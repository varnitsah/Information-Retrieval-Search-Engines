modern bard has painted the desolate state of scotland during a period highly unfavourable to poetical composition yet the civil and religious wars of the seventeenth century have afforded some subjects for traditionary poetry and the reader is here presented with the ballads of that disastrous aera some prefatory history may not be unacceptable  that the reformation was a good and a glorious work few will be such slavish bigots as to deny but the enemy came by night and sowed tares among the wheat or rather the foul and rank soil upon which the seed was thrown pushed forth together with the rising crop a plentiful proportion of pestilential weeds the morals of the reformed clergy were severe their learning was usually respectable sometimes profound and their eloquence though often coarse was vehement animated and popular but they never could forget that their rise had been achieved by the degradation if not the fall of the crown and hence a body of men who in most countries have been attached to monarchy were in scotland for nearly two centuries sometimes the avowed enemies always the ambitious rivals of their prince the disciples of calvin could scarcely avoid a tendency to democracy and the republican form of church government was sometimes hinted at as no unfit model for the state at least the kirkmen laboured to impress upon their followers and hearers the fundamental principle that the church should be solely governed by those unto whom god had given the spiritual sceptre the elder melvine in a conference with james vi seized the monarch by the sleeve and addressing him as gods sillie vassal told him there are two kings and two kingdomes there is christ and his kingdome the kirke whose subject king james the sixth is and of whose kingdome he is not a king nor a head nor a lord but a member and they whom christ hath called and commanded to watch ower his kirke and govern his spiritual kingdome have sufficient authorise and power from him so to do which no christian king no prince should controul or discharge but fortifie and assist otherwise they are not faithful subjects to christcalderwood p 329 the delegated theocracy thus sternly claimed was exercised with equal rigour the offences in the kings household fell under their unceremonious jurisdiction and he was formally reminded of his occasional neglect to say grace before and after meathis repairing to hear the word more rarely than was fittinghis profane banning and swearing and keeping of evil companyand finally of his queens carding dancing nightwalking and such like profane pastimescalderwood p 313 a curse direct or implied was formally denounced against every man horse and spear who should assist the king in his quarrel with the earl of gowrie and from the pulpit the favourites of the listening sovereign were likened to haman his wife to herodias and he himself to ahab to herod and to jeroboam these effusions of zeal could not be very agreeable to the temper of james and accordingly by a course of slow and often crooked and cunning policy he laboured to arrange the churchgovernment upon a less turbulent and menacing footing his eyes were naturally turned towards the english hierarchy which had been modelled by the despotic henry viii into such a form as to connect indissolubly the interest of the church with that of the regal powera the reformation in england had originated in the arbitrary will of the prince in scotland and in all other countries of europe it had commenced among insurgents of the lower ranks hence the deep and essential difference which separated the huguenots the lutherans the scottish presbyterians and in fine all the other reformed churches from that of england but james with a timidity which sometimes supplies the place of prudence contented himself with gradually imposing upon the scottish nation a limited and moderate system of episcopacy which while it gave to a proportion of the churchmen a seat in the council of the nation induced them to look up to the sovereign as the power to whose influence they owed their elevation but in other respects james spared the prejudices of his subjects no ceremonial ritual was imposed upon their consciences the pastors were reconciled by the prospect of prefermentb the dress and train of the bishops were plain and decent the system of tythes was placed upon a moderate and unoppressive footingc and perhaps on the whole the scottish hierarchy contained as few objectionable points as any system of churchgovernment in europe had it subsisted to the present day although its doctrines could not have been more pure nor its morals more exemplary than those of the present kirk of scotland yet its degrees of promotion might have afforded greater encouragement to learning and objects of laudable ambition to those who might dedicate themselves to its service but the precipitate bigotry of the unfortunate charles i was a blow to episcopacy in scotland from which it never perfectly recovered  footnote a of this the covenanters were so sensible as to trace what they called the antichristian hierarchy with its idolatry superstition and human inventions to the prelacy of england the fountain whence all these babylonish streams issue unto ussee their manifesto on entering england in 1640  footnote b many of the preachers who had been loudest in the cause of presbytery were induced to accept of bishoprics such was for example william cooper who was created bishop of galloway this recreant mass john was a hypochondriac and conceived his lower extremities to be composed of glass hence on his court advancement the following epigram was composed      aureus heu frugilem confregit malleus urnam  footnote c this part of the system was perfected in the reign of charles i  it has frequently happened that the virtues of the individual at least their excess if indeed there can be an excess in virtue have been fatal to the prince never was this more fully exemplified than in the history of charles i his zeal for religion his family affection the spirit with which he defended his supposed rights while they do honour to the man were the fatal shelves upon which the monarchy was wrecked impatient to accomplish the total revolution which his fathers cautious timidity had left incomplete charles endeavoured at once to introduce into scotland the churchgovernment and to renew in england the temporal domination of his predecessor henry viii the furious temper of the scottish nation first took fire and the brandished footstool of a prostitutea gave the signal for civil dissension which ceased not till the church was buried under the ruins of the constitution till the nation had stooped to a military despotism and the monarch to the block of the executioner  footnote a out false loon wilt thou say the mass at my lug ear was the well known exclamation of margaret geddes as she discharged her missile tripod against the bishop of edinburgh who in obedience to the orders of the privycouncil was endeavouring to rehearse the common prayer upon a seat more elevated the said margaret had shortly before done penance before the congregation for the sin of fornication such at least is the tory tradition  the consequence of charles hasty and arbitrary measures were soon evident the united nobility gentry and clergy of scotland entered into the solemn league and covenant by which memorable deed they subscribed and swore a national renunciation of the hierarchy the walls of the prelatic jericho to use the language of the times were thus levelled with the ground and the curse of hiel the bethelite denounced against those who should rebuild them while the clergy thundered from the pulpits against the prelatists and malignants by which names were distinguished the scattered and heartless adherents of charles the nobility and gentry in arms hurried to oppose the march of the english army which now advanced towards their borders at the head of their defensive forces they placed alexander lesley who with many of his best officers had been trained to war under the great gustavus adolphus they soon assembled an army of 26000 men whose camp upon dunselaw is thus described by an eyewitness  mr baillie acknowledges that it was an agreeable feast to his eyes to survey the place it is a round hill about a scots mile in circle rising with very little declivity to the height of a bowshot and the head somewhat plain and near a quarter of a mile in length and breadth on the top it was garnished with near forty field pieces pointed towards the east and south the colonels who were mostly noblemen as rothes cassilis eglinton dalhousie lindsay lowdon boyd sinclair balcarras flemyng kirkcudbright erskine montgomery yester c lay in large tents at the head of their respective regiments their captains who generally were barons or chief gentlemen lay around them next to these were the lieutenants who were generally old veterans and had served in that or a higher station over sea and the common soldiers lay outmost all in huts of timber covered with divot or straw every company which according to the first plan did consist of two hundred men had their colours flying at the captains tent door with the scots arms upon them and this motto in golden letters for christs crown and covenant against this army so well arrayed and disciplined and whose natural hardihood was edged and exalted by a high opinion of their sacred cause charles marched at the head of a large force but divided by the emulation of the commanders and enervated by disuse of arms a faintness of spirit pervaded the royal army and the king stooped to a treaty with his scottish subjects the treaty was soon broken and in the following year dunselaw again presented the same edifying spectacle of a presbyterian army but the scots were not contented with remaining there they passed the tweed and the english troops in a skirmish at newburn shewed either more disaffection or cowardice than had at any former period disgraced their national character this war was concluded by the treaty of rippon in consequence of which and of charless concessions made during his subsequent visit to his native country the scottish parliament congratulated him on departing a contented king from a contented people if such content ever existed it was of short duration  the storm which had been soothed to temporary rest in scotland burst forth in england with treble violence the popular clamour accused charles or his ministers of fetching into britain the religion of rome and the policy of constantinople the scots felt most keenly the first and the english the second of these aggressions accordingly when the civil war of england broke forth the scots nation for a time regarded it in neutrality though not with indifference but when the successes of a prelatic monarch against a presbyterian parliament were paving the way for rebuilding the system of hierarchy they could no longer remain inactive bribed by the delusive promise of sir henry vane and marshall the parliamentary commissioners that the church of england should be reformed according to the word of god which they fondly believed amounted to an adoption of presbytery they agreed to send succours to their brethren of england alexander lesly who ought to have ranked among the contented subjects having been raised by the king to the honours of earl of leven was nevertheless readily induced to accept the command of this second army doubtless where insurrection is not only pardoned but rewarded a monarch has little right to expect gratitude for benefits which all the world as well as the receiver must attribute to fear yet something is due to decency and the best apology for lesly is his zeal for propagating presbyterianism in england the bait which had caught the whole parliament of scotland but although the earl of leven was commander in chief david lesly a yet more renowned and active soldier than himself was majorgeneral of the cavalry and in truth bore away the laurels of the expedition  the words of the following march which was played in the van of this presbyterian crusade were first published by allan ramsay in his evergreen and they breathe the very spirit we might expect mr ritson in his collection of scottish songs has favoured the public with the music which seems to have been adapted to the bagpipes  the hatred of the old presbyterians to the organ was apparently invincible it is here vilified with the name of a chestfull of whistles as the episcopal chapel at glasgow was by the vulgar opprobriously termed the whistling kirk yet such is the revolution of sentiment upon this as upon more important points that reports have lately been current of a plan to introduce this noble instrument into presbyterian congregations  the share which leslys army bore in the action of marston moor has been exalted or depressed as writers were attached to the english or scottish nations to the presbyterian or independent factions mr laing concludes with laudable impartiality that the victory was equally due to cromwells iron brigade of disciplined independents and to three regiments of leslys horsevol i p 244    lesleys march     march march   why the devil do ye na march   stand to your arms my lads

cock up your bonnets           da capo    the battle of philiphaugh   this ballad is so immediately connected with the former that the editor is enabled to continue his sketch of historical transactions from the march of lesly  in the insurrection of 1680 all scotland south from the grampians was actively and zealously engaged but after the treaty of rippon the first fury of the revolutionary torrent may be said to have foamed off its force and many of the nobility began to look round with horror upon the rocks and shelves amongst which it had hurried them numbers regarded the defence of scotland as a just and necessary warfare who did not see the same reason for interfering in the affairs of england the visit of king charles to the metropolis of his fathers in all probability produced its effect on his nobles some were allied to the house of stuart by blood all regarded it as the source of their honours and venerated the ancient in obtaining the private objects of ambition or selfish policy which had induced them to rise up against the crown amongst these late penitents the well known marquis of montrose was distinguished as the first who endeavoured to recede from the paths of rude rebellion moved by the enthusiasm of patriotism or perhaps of religion but yet more by ambition the sin of noble minds montrose had engaged eagerly and deeply upon the side of the covenanters he had been active in pressing the town of aberdeen to take the covenant and his success against the gordons at the bridge of dee left that royal burgh no other means of safety from pillage at the head of his own battalion he waded through the tweed in 1640 and totally routed the vanguard of the kings cavalry but in 1643 moved with resentment against the covenanters who preferred to his prompt and ardent character the caution of the wily and politic earl of argyle or seeing perhaps that the final views of that party were inconsistent with the interests of monarchy and of the constitution montrose espoused the falling cause of royalty and raised the highland clans whom he united to a small body of irish commanded by alexander macdonald still renowned in the north under the title of colkitto with these tumultuary and uncertain forces he rushed forth like a torrent from the mountains and commenced a rapid and brilliant career of victory at tippermoor where he first met the covenanters their defeat was so effectual as to appal the presbyterian courage even after the lapse of eighty yearsa a second army was defeated under the walls of aberdeen and the pillage of the illfated town was doomed to expiate the principles which montrose himself had formerly imposed upon them argyleshire next experienced his arms the domains of his rival were treated with more than military severity and argyle himself advancing to inverlochy for the defence of his country was totally and disgracefully routed by montrose pressed betwixt two armies well appointed and commanded by the most experienced generals of the covenant mozitrose displayed more military skill in the astonishingly rapid marches by which he avoided fighting to disadvantage than even in the field of victory by one of those hurried marches from the banks of loch katrine to the heart of invernessshire he was enabled to attack and totally to defeat the covenanters at aulderne though he brought into the field hardly one half of their forces baillie a veteran officer was next routed by him at the village of alford in strathbogie encouraged by these repeated and splendid successes montrose now descended into the heart of scotland and fought a bloody and decisive battle near kilsyth where four thousand covenanters fell under the highland claymore  footnote a upon the breaking out of the insurrection in the year 1715 the earl of rothes sheriff and lordlieutenant of the county of fife issued out an order for all the fencible men of the countie to meet him at a place called cashmoor the gentlemen took no notice of his orders nor did the commons except those whom the ministers forced to goe to the place of rendezvouse to the number of fifteen hundred men being all that their utmost diligence could perform but those of that countie having been taught by their experience that it is not good meddling with edge tools especiallie in the hands of highlandmen were very averse from taking armes no sooner they reflected on the name of the place of rendezvouse cashmoor than tippermoor was called to mind a place not far from thence where montrose had routed them when under the command of my greatgranduncle the earl of wemyss then generall of gods armie in a word the unlucky choice of a place called moo appeared ominous and that with the flying report of the highlandmen having made themselves masters of perth made them throw down their armes and run notwithstanding the trouble that rothes and the ministers gave themselves to stop themms memoirs of lord st clair  this victory opened the whole of scotland to montrose he occupied the capital and marched forward to the border not merely to complete the subjection of the southern provinces but with the flattering hope of pouring his victorious army into england and bringing to the support of charles the sword of his paternal tribes  half a century before montroses career the state of the borders was such as might have enabled him easily to have accomplished his daring plan the marquis of douglas the earls of hume roxburgh traquair and annandale were all descended of mighty border chiefs whose ancestors could each of them have led into the field a body of their own vassals equal in numbers and superior in discipline to the army of montrose but the military spirit of the borderers and their attachment to their chiefs had been much broken since the union of the crowns the disarming acts of james had been carried rigorously into execution and the smaller proprietors no longer feeling the necessity of protection from their chiefs in war had aspired to independence and embraced the tenets of the covenant without imputing with wishart absolute treachery to the border nobles it may be allowed that they looked with envy upon montrose and with dread and aversion upon his rapacious and disorderly forces hence had it been in their power it might not have altogether suited their inclinations to have brought the strength of the border lances to the support of the northern clans the once formidable name of douglas still sufficed to raise some bands by whom montrose was joined in his march down the gala with these reinforcements and with the remnant of his highlanders for a great number had returned home with colkitto to deposit their plunder and provide for their families montrose after traversing the border finally encamped upon the field of philiphaugh  the river ettrick immediately after its junction with the yarrow and previous to its falling into the tweed makes a large sweep to the southward and winds almost beneath the lofty bank on which the town of selkirk stands leaving upon the northern side a large and level plain extending in an easterly direction from a hill covered with natural copsewood called the hareheadwood to the high ground which forms the banks of the tweed near sunderlandhall this plain is called philliphaugha it is about a mile and a half in length and a quarter of a mile broad and being defended to the northward by the high hills which separate tweed from yarrow by the river in front and by the high grounds already mentioned on each flank it forms at once a convenient and a secure field of encampment on each flank montrose threw up some trenches which are still visible and here he posted his infantry amounting to about twelve or fifteen hundred men he himself took up his quarters in the burgh of selkirk and with him the cavalry in number hardly one thousand but respectable as being chiefly composed of gentlemen and their immediate retainers in this manner by a fatal and unaccountable error the river ettrick was thrown betwixt the cavalry and infantry which were to depend upon each other for intelligence and mutual support but this might be overlooked by montrose in the conviction that there was no armed enemy of charles in the realm of scotland for he is said to have employed the night in writing and dispatching this agreeable intelligence to the king such an enemy was already within four miles of his camp  footnote a the scottish language is rich in words expressive of local situation the single word haugh conveys to a scotsman almost all that i have endeavoured to explain in the text by circumlocutory description  recalled by the danger of the cause of the covenant general david lesly came down from england at the head of those iron squadrons whose force had been proved in the fatal battle of long marston moor his array consisted of from five to six thousand men chiefly cavalry leslys first plan seems to have been to occupy the midland counties so as to intercept the return of montroses highlanders and to force him to an unequal combat accordingly he marched along the eastern coast from berwick to tranent but there he suddenly altered his direction and crossing through midlothian turned again to the southward and following the course of gala water arrived at melrose the evening before the engagement how it is possible that montrose should have received no notice whatever of the march of so considerable an army seems almost inconceivable and proves that the country was strongly disaffected to his cause or person still more extraordinary does it appear that even with the advantage of a thick mist lesly should have the next morning advanced towards montroses encampment without being descried by a single scout such however was the case and it was attended with all the consequences of the most complete surprisal the first intimation that montrose received of the march of lesly was the noise of the conflict or rather that which attended the unresisted slaughter of his infantry who never formed a line of battle the right wing alone supported by the thickets of hareheadwood and by the entrenchments which are there still visible stood firm for some time but lesly had detached two thousand men who crossing the ettrick still higher up than his main body assaulted the rear of montroses right wing at this moment the marquis himself arrived and beheld his army dispersed for the first time in irretrievable route he had thrown himself upon a horse the instant he heard the firing and followed by such of his disorderly cavalry as had gathered upon the alarm he galloped from selkirk crossed the ettrick and made a bold and desperate attempt to retrieve the fortune of the day but all was in vain and after cutting his way almost singly through a body of leslys troopers the gallant montrose graced by his example the retreat of the fugitives that retreat he continued up yarrow and over minchmoor nor did he stop till he arrived at traquair sixteen miles from the field of battle upon philiphaugh he lost in one defeat the fruit of six splendid victories nor was he again able effectually to make head in scotland against the covenanted cause the number slain in the field did not exceed three or four hundred for the fugitives found refuge in the mountains which had often been the retreat of vanquished armies and were impervious to the pursuers cavalry lesly abused his victory and dishonoured his arms by slaughtering in cold blood many of the prisoners whom he had taken and the courtyard of newark castle is said to have been the spot upon which they were shot by his command many others are said by wishart to have been precipitated from a high bridge over the tweed this as mr laing remarks is impossible because there was not a bridge over the tweed betwixt peebles and berwick but there is an old bridge over the ettrick only four miles from philiphaugh and another over the yarrow both of which lay in the very line of flight and pursuit and either might have been the scene of the massacre but if this is doubtful it is too certain that several of the royalists were executed by the covenanters as traitors to the king and parliamenta  footnote a a covenanted minister present at the execution of these gentlemen observed this wark gaes bonnilie on an amiable exclamation equivalent to the modern ça ira so often used on similar occasionswisharts memoirs of montrose  i have reviewed at some length the details of this memorable engagement which at the same time terminated the career of a hero likened by no mean judge of mankinda to those of antiquity and decided the fate of his country it is further remarkable as the last field which was fought in ettrick forest the scene of so many bloody actions the unaccountable neglect of patroles and the imprudent separation betwixt the horse and foot seem to have been the immediate causes of montroses defeat but the ardent and impetuous character of this great warrior corresponding with that of the troops which he commanded was better calculated for attack than defence for surprising others rather than for providing against surprise himself thus he suffered loss by a sudden attack upon part of his forces stationed at aberdeenb and had he not extricated himself with the most singular ability he must have lost his whole army when surprised by baillie during the plunder of dundee nor has it escaped an ingenious modern historian that his final defeat at dunbeath so nearly resembles in its circumstances the surprise at philiphaugh as to throw some shade on his military talentslaings history  footnote a cardinal du retz  footnote b colonel hurry with a party of horse surprised the town while montroses highlanders and cavaliers were dispersed through the town drinking carelessly in their lodgings and hearing the horses feet and great noise were astonished never dreaming of their enemy however donald farquharson happened to come to the causey where he was cruelly slain anent the court de guard a brave gentleman and one of the noblest captains amongst all the highlanders of scotland two or three others were killed and some taken prisoners had to edinburgh and cast into irons in the tolbooth great lamentation was made for this gallant being still the kings man for life and deathspalding vol ii p 281 the journalist to whom all matters were of equal importance proceeds to inform us that hurry took the marquis of huntlys best horse and in his retreat through montrose seized upon the marquiss second son he also expresses his regret that the said donald farquharsons body was found in the street stripped naked for they tirrd from off his body a rich stand of apparel but put on the same dayibid  the following ballad which is preserved by tradition in selkirkshire coincides accurately with historical fact this indeed constitutes its sole merit the covenanters were not i dare say addicted more than their successors to the profane and unprofitable art of poemmakinga still however they could not refrain from some strains of exultation over the defeat of the truculent tyrant james grahame for gentle reader montrose who with resources which seemed as none gained six victories and reconquered a kingdom who a poet a scholar a cavalier and a general could have graced alike a court and governed a camp this montrose was numbered by his covenanted countrymen among the troublers of israel the firebrands of hell the corahs the balaams the doegs the rabshakahs the hamans the tobiahs and sanballats of the time  footnote a so little was the spirit of illiberal fanaticism decayed in some parts of scotland that only thirty years ago when wilson the ingenious author of a poem called clyde now republished was inducted into the office of schoolmaster at greenock he was obliged formally and in writing to abjure the profane and unprofitable art of poemmaking it is proper to add that such an incident is now as unlikely to happen in greenock as in london    the battle of philiphaugh     on philiphaugh a fray began

came to the lingly burnp 27 v 2 a brook which falls into the ettrick from the north a little above the shaw burn  they spyd an aged fatherp 27 v 2 the traditional commentary upon the ballad states this mans name to have been brydone ancestor to several families in the parish of ettrick particularly those occupying the farms of midgehope and redford green it is a strange anachronism to make this aged father state himself at the battle of solway flow which was fought a hundred years before philiphaugh and a still stranger to mention that of dunbar which did not take place till five years after montroses defeat  a tradition annexed to a copy of this ballad transmitted to me by mr james hogg bears that the earl of traquair on the day of the battle was advancing with a large sum of money for the payment of montroses forces attended by a blacksmith one of his retainers as they crossed minchmoor they were alarmed by firing which the earl conceived to be montrose exercising his forces but which his attendant from the constancy and irregularity of the noise affirmed to be the tumult of an engagement as they came below broadmeadows upon yarrow they met their fugitive friends hotly pursued by the parliamentary troopers the earl of course turned and fled also but his horse jaded with the weight of dollars which he carried refused to take the hill so that the earl was fain to exchange with his attendant leaving him with the breathless horse and bag of silver to shift for himself which he is supposed to have done very effectually some of the dragoons attracted by the appearance of the horse and trappings gave chase to the smith who fled up the yarrow but finding himself as he said encumbered with the treasure and unwilling that it should be taken he flung it into a well or pond near the tinnies above hangingshaw many wells were afterwards searched in vain but it is the general belief that the smith if he ever hid the money knew too well how to anticipate the scrutiny there is however a pond which some peasants began to drain not long ago in hopes of finding the golden prize but were prevented as they pretended by supernatural interference    the gallant grahams   the preceding ballad was a song of triumph over the defeat of montrose at philiphaugh the verses which follow are a lamentation for his final discomfiture and cruel death the present edition of the gallant grahams is given from tradition enlarged and corrected by an ancient printed edition entitled the gallant grahams of scotland to the tune of i will away and i will not tarry of which mr ritson favoured the editor with an accurate copy  the conclusion of montroses melancholy history is too well known the scottish army which sold king charles i to his parliament had we may charitably hope no idea that they were bartering his blood although they must have been aware that they were consigning him to perpetual bondagea at least the sentiments of the kingdom at large differed widely from those of the military merchants and the danger of king charles drew into england a well appointed scottish army under the command of the duke of hamilton but he met with cromwell and to meet with cromwell was inevitable defeat the death of charles and the triumph of the independents excited still more highly the hatred and the fears of the scottish nation the outwitted presbyterians who saw too late that their own hands had been employed in the hateful task of erecting the power of a sect yet more fierce and fanatical than themselves deputed a commission to the hague to treat with charles ii whom upon certain conditions they now wished to restore to the throne of his fathers at the court of the exiled monarch montrose also offered to his acceptance a splendid plan of victory and conquest and pressed for his permission to enter scotland and there collecting the remains of the royalists to claim the crown for his master with the sword in his hand an able statesman might perhaps have reconciled these jarring projects a good man would certainly have made a decided choice betwixt them charles was neither the one not the other and while he treated with the presbyterians with a view of accepting the crown from their hands he scrupled not to authorise montrose the mortal enemy of the sect to pursue his separate and inconsistent plan of conquest  footnote a as salmasius

was joined by several royalists as he traversed the wilds of caithness and sutherland but advancing into rossshire he was surprised and totally defeated by colonel strachan an officer of the scottish parliament who had distinguished himself in the civil wars and who afterwards became a decided cromwellian montrose after a fruitless resistance at length fled from the field of defeat and concealed himself in the grounds of macleod of assint to whose fidelity he entrusted his life and by whom he was delivered up to lesly his most bitter enemy  he was tried for what was termed treason against the estates of the kingdom and despite the commission of charles for his proceedings he was condemned to die by a parliament who acknowledged charles to be their king and whom on that account only montrose acknowledged to be a parliament  the clergy says a late animated historian whose vocation it was to persecute the repose of his last moments sought by the terrors of his sentence to extort repentance but his behaviour firm and dignified to the end repelled their insulting advances with scorn and disdain he was prouder he replied to have his head affixed to the prisonwalls than to have his picture placed in the kings bedchamber and far from being troubled that my limbs are to be sent to your principal cities i wish i had flesh enough to be dispersed through christendom to attest my dying attachment to my king it was the calm employment of his mind that night to reduce this extravagant sentiment to verse he appeared next day on the scaffold in a rich habit with the same serene and undaunted countenance and addressed the people to vindicate his dying unabsolved by the church rather than to justify an invasion of the kingdom during a treaty with the estates the insults of his enemies were not yet exhausted the history of his exploits was attached to his neck by the public executioner but he smiled at their inventive malice declared that he wore it with more pride than he

reproach for a nobler poet might have failed in the attempt indifferent as the ballad is we may regret its being still more degraded by many apparent corruptions there seems an attempt to trace montroses career from his first raising the royal standard to his second expedition and death but it is interrupted and imperfect from the concluding stanza i presume the song was composed upon the

concerning cromwell is preserved by an uncommonly direct line of traditional evidence being narrated as i am informed by the grandson of an eyewitness when cromwell in 1650 entered glasgow he attended divine service in the high church but the presbyterian divine who officiated poured forth with more zeal than prudence the vial of his indignation upon the person principles and cause of the independent general one of cromwells officers rose and whispered his commander who seemed to give him a short and stern answer and the sermon was concluded without interruption among the crowd who were assembled to gaze at the general as he came out of the church was a shoemaker the son of one of james the sixths scottish footmen this man had been born and bred in england but after his fathers death had settled in glasgow cromwell eyed him among the crowd and immediately called him by his namethe man fled but at cromwells command one of his retinue followed him and brought him to the generals lodgings a number of the inhabitants remained at the door waiting the end of this extraordinary scene the shoemaker soon came out in high spirits and shewing some gold declared he was going to drink cromwells health many attended him to hear the particulars of his interview among others the grandfather of the narrator the shoemaker said that he had been a playfellow of cromwell when they were both boys their parents residing in the same street that he had fled when the general first called to him thinking he might owe him some illwill on account of his father being in the service of the royal family he added that cromwell had been so very kind and familiar with him that he ventured to ask him what the officer had said to him in the church he proposed said cromwell to pull forth the minister by the ears and i answered that the preacher was one fool and he another in the course of the day cromwell held an interview with the minister and contrived to satisfy his scruples so effectually that the evening discourse by the same man was tuned to the praise and glory of the victor of naseby    nathaniel gordon stout and bold     did for king charles wear the bluep 40 v 5  this gentleman was of the ancient family of gordon of gight he had served as a soldier upon the continent and acquired great military skill when his chief the marquis of huntly took up arms in 1640 nathaniel gordon then called major gordon joined him and was of essential service during that short insurrection but being checked for making prize of a danish fishing buss he left the service of the marquis in some disgust in 1644 he assisted at a sharp and dexterous camisade as it was then called when the barons of haddo of gight of drum and other gentlemen with only sixty men under their standard galloped through the old town of aberdeen and entering the burgh itself about seven in the morning made prisoners and carried off four of the covenanting magistrates and effected a safe retreat though the town was then under the domination of the opposite party after the death of the baron of haddo and the severe treatment of sir george gordon of gight his cousingerman major nathaniel gordon seems to have taken arms in despair of finding mercy at the covenanters hands on the 24th of july 1645 he came down with a band of horsemen upon the town of elgin while st james fair was held and pillaged the merchants of 14000 merks of money and merchandizea he seems to have joined montrose as soon as he raised the royal standard and as a bold and active partizan rendered him great service but in november 1644 gordon now a colonel suddenly deserted montrose aided the escape of forbes of craigievar one of his prisoners and reconciled himself to the kirk by doing penance for adultery and for the almost equally heinous crime of having scared mr andrew cantb the famous apostle of the covenant this however seems to have been an artifice to arrange a correspondence betwixt montrose and lord gordon a gallant young nobleman representative of the huntley family and inheriting their loyal spirit though hitherto engaged in the service of the covenant colonel gordon was successful and returned to the royal camp with his converted chief both followed zealously the fortunes of montrose until lord gordon fell in the battle of alford and nathaniel gordon was taken at philiphaugh he was one of ten loyalists devoted upon that occasion by the parliament to expiate with their blood the crime of fidelity to their king nevertheless the covenanted nobles would have probably been satisfied with the death of the gallant rollock sharer of montroses dangers and glory of ogilvy a youth of eighteen whose crime was the hereditary feud betwixt his family and argyle and

thrust out by the officers and using some threatening language to the provost was imprisoned like a felon for many months till he became furious and nearly mad having got free of the shackles with which he was loaded he used his liberty by coming to the tolbooth window where he uttered the most violent and horrible threats against provost lesly and the other covenanting magistrates by whom he had been so severely treated under pretence of this new offence he was sent to edinburgh and lay long in prison there for so fierce was his temper that no one would give surety for his keeping the

arms against the english in the north and west highlands some noblemen and loyal gentlemen with others were forward to repair to them with such forces as they could make which the english with marvelouse diligence night and day did bestir themselves to impede making their troops of horse and dragoons to pursue the loyal party in all places that they might not come to such a considerable number as was designed it happened one night that one captain masoun commander of a troop of dragoons that came from carlisle in england marching through the town of sanquhar in the night was encountered by one captain palmer commanding a troop of horse that came from ayr marching eastward and meeting at the tollhouse or tolbooth one david veitch brother to the laird of dawick in tweeddale and one of the loyal party being prisoner in irons by the english did arise and came to the window at their meeting and cryed out that they should fight valiantly for king charles wherethrough they taking each other for the loyal party did begin a brisk fight which continued for a while til the dragoons having spent their shot and finding the horsemen to be too strong for them did give ground but yet retired in some order towards the castle of sanquhar being hotly pursued by the troop through the whole town above a quarter of a mile till they came to the castle where both parties did to their mutual grief become sensible of their mistake in this skirmish there were several killed on both sides and captain palmer himself dangerously wounded with many mo wounded in each troop who did

was beheaded by the sentence of the parliament of scotland so calling themselves upon the 22d march 1649 one month and twentytwo days after the martyrdom of his master he has been much blamed for not cordially cooperating with montrose and bishop wishart in the zeal of partiality for his hero accuses huntley of direct treachery but he is a true believer who seals with his blood his creed religious or political and there are many reasons short of this foul charge which may have dictated the backward conduct of huntley towards montrose he could not forget that when he first stood out for the king montrose then the soldier of the covenant had actually made him prisoner and we cannot suppose huntley to have been so sensible of montroses superior military talents as not to think himself as equal in rank superior in power and more uniform in loyalty entitled to equally high marks of royal trust and favour this much is certain that the gallant clan of gordon contributed greatly to montroses success for the gentlemen of that name with the brave and loyal ogilvies composed the principal part of his cavalry    the battle of pentland hills   we have observed the early antipathy mutually entertained by the scottish presbyterians and the house of stuart it seems to have glowed in the breast even of the goodnatured charles ii he might have remembered that in 1551 the presbyterians had fought bled and ruined themselves in his cause but he rather recollected their early faults than their late repentance and even their services were combined with the recollection of the absurd and humiliating circumstances of personal degradationa to which their pride and folly had subjected him while they professed to espouse his cause as a man of pleasure he hated their stern and inflexible rigour which stigmatised follies even more deeply than crimes and he whispered to his confidents that presbytery was no religion for a gentleman it is not therefore wonderful that in the first year of his restoration he formally reestablished prelacy in scotland but it is surprising that with his fathers example before his eyes he should not have been satisfied to leave at freedom the consciences of those who could not reconcile themselves to the new system the religious opinions of sectaries have a tendency like the water of some springs to become soft and mild when freely exposed to the open day who can recognise in the decent and industrious quakers and anabaptists the wild and ferocious tenets which distinguished their sects while they were yet honoured with the distinction of the scourge and the pillory had the system of coercion against the presbyterians been continued until our day blair and robertson would have preached in the wilderness and only discovered their powers of eloquence and composition by rolling along a deeper torrent of gloomy fanaticism  footnote a among other ridiculous occurrences it is said that some of charless gallantries were discovered by a prying neighbour a wily old minister was deputed by his brethren to rebuke the king for this heinous scandal being introduced into the royal presence he limited his commission to a serious admonition that upon such occasions his majesty should always shut the windowsthe king is said to have recompensed this unexpected lenity after the restoration he probably remembered the joke though he might have forgotten the service  the western counties distinguished themselves by their opposition to the prelatic system three hundred and fifty ministers ejected from their churches and livings wandered through the mountains sowing the seeds of covenanted doctrine while multitudes of fanatical followers pursued them to reap the forbidden crop these conventicles as they were called were denounced by the law and their frequenters dispersed by military force the genius of the persecuted became stubborn obstinate and ferocious and although indulgencies were tardily granted to some presbyterian ministers few of the true covenanters or whigs as they were called would condescend to compound with a prelatic government or to listen even to their own favourite doctrine under the auspices of the king from richard cameron their apostle this rigid sect acquired the name of cameronians they preached and prayed against the indulgence and against the presbyterians who availed themselves of it because their accepting this royal boon was a tacit acknowledgment of the kings supremacy in ecclesiastical matters upon these bigotted and persecuted fanatics and by no means upon the presbyterians at large are to be charged the wild anarchical principles of antimonarchy and assassination which polluted the period when they flourished  the insurrection commemorated and magnified in the following ballad as indeed it has been in some histories was in itself no very important affair it began in dumfriesshire where sir james turner a soldier of fortune was employed to levy the arbitrary fines imposed for not attending the episcopal churches the people rose seized his person disarmed his soldiers and having continued together resolved to march towards edinburgh expecting to be joined by their friends in that quarter in this they were disappointed and being now diminished to half their numbers they drew up on the pentland hills at a place called rullien green they were commanded by one wallace and here they awaited the approach of general dalziel of binns who having marched to calder to meet them on the lanark road and finding that by passing through collington they had got to the other side of the hills cut through the mountains and approached them wallace shewed both spirit and judgment he drew his men up in a very strong situation and withstood two charges of dalziels cavalry but upon the third shock the insurgents were broken and utterly dispersed there was very little slaughter as the cavalry of dalziel were chiefly gentlemen who pitied their oppressed and misguided countrymen there were about fifty killed and as many made prisoners the battle was fought on the 28th november 1666 a day still observed by the scattered remnant of the cameronian sect who

the battle of loudonhill   the whigs now become desperate adopted the most desperate principles and retaliating as far as they could the intolerating persecution which they endured they openly disclaimed allegiance to any monarch who should not profess presbytery and subscribe the covenantthese principles were not likely to conciliate the favour of government and as we wade onward in the history of the times the scenes become yet darker at length one would imagine the parties had agreed to divide the kingdom of vice betwixt them the hunters assuming to themselves open profligacy and legalized oppression and the hunted the opposite attributes of hypocrisy fanaticism disloyalty and midnight assassination the troopers and cavaliers became enthusiasts in the pursuit of the

nonconformists undauntedly brave and steadily faithful to his prince he sacrificed himself in the cause of james when he was deserted by all the world if we add to these attributes a goodly person

against leaden bullets but against those only during the battle of pentlandhills paton of meadowhead conceived he saw the balls hop harmlessly down from general dalziels boots and to counteract the spell loaded his pistol with a piece of silver coin but dalziel having his eye on him drew back behind his servant who was shot deadpatons life at a skirmish in ayrshire some of the wanderers defended themselves in a sequestered house by the side of a lake they aimed repeatedly but in vain at the commander of the assailants an english officer until their ammunition running short one of them loaded his piece with the ball at the head of the tongs and succeeded in shooting the hitherto impenetrable captain to accommodate dundees fate to their own hypothesis the cameronian tradition runs that in the battle of killicrankie he fell not by the enemys fire but by the pistol of one of his own servants who to avoid the spell had loaded it with a silver button from his coat one of their writers argues thus perhaps some may think this anent proofshot a paradox and be ready to object here as formerly concerning bishop sharpe and dalzielhow can the devil have or give power to save life without entering upon the thing in its reality i shall only observe 1 that it is neither in his power or of his nature to be a saviour of mens lives he is called apollyon the destroyer 2 that even in this case he is said only to give enchantment against one kind of metal and this does not save life for though lead could not take sharpe and claverhouses lives yet steel and silver could do it and for dalziel though he died not on the field yet he did not escape the arrows of the almightygods judgement against persecutors if the reader be not now convinced of the thing in its reality i have nothing to add to such exquisite reasoning  john balfour of kinloch commonly called burly was one of the fiercest of the proscribed sect a gentleman by birth he was says his biographer zealous and honesthearted courageous in every enterprise and a brave soldier seldom any escaping that came in his hands life of john balfour creichton says that he was once chamberlain to archbishop sharpe and by negligence or dishonesty had incurred a large arrear which occasioned his being active in his masters assassination but of this i know no other evidence than creichtons assertion and a hint in wodrow burly for that is his most common designation was brotherinlaw to hackston of rathillet a wild enthusiastic character who joined daring courage and skill in the sword to the fiery zeal of his sect burly himself was less eminent for religious fervour than for the active and violent share which he had in the most desperate enterprises of his party his name does not appear among the covenanters who were denounced for the affair of pentland but in 1677 robert hamilton afterwards commander of the insurgents at loudon hill and bothwell bridge with several other nonconformists were assembled at this burlys house in fife there they were attacked by a party of soldiers commanded by captain carstairs whom they beat off wounding desperately one of his party for this resistance to authority they were declared rebels the next exploit in which burly was engaged was of a bloodier complexion and more dreadful celebrity it is well known that james sharpe archbishop of st andrews was regarded by the rigid presbyterians not only as a renegade who had turned back from the spiritual plough but as the principal author of the rigours exercised against their sect he employed as an agent of his oppression one carmichael a decayed gentleman the industry of this man in procuring information and in enforcing the severe penalties against conventiclers having excited the resentment of the cameronians nine of their number of whom burly and his brotherinlaw hackston were the leaders assembled with the purpose of waylaying and murdering carmichael but while they searched for him in vain they received tidings that the archbishop himself was at hand the party resorted to prayer after which they agreed unanimously that the lord had delivered the wicked haman into their hand in the execution of the supposed will of heaven they agreed to put themselves under the command of a leader and they requested hackston of rathillet to accept the office which he declined alleging that should he comply with their request the slaughter might be imputed to a private quarrel which existed betwixt him and the archbishop the command was then offered to burly who accepted it without scruple and they galloped off in pursuit of the archbishops carriage which contained himself and his daughter being well mounted they easily overtook and disarmed the prelates attendants burly crying out judas be taken rode up to the carriage wounded the postillion and hamstrung one of the horses he then fired into the coach a piece charged with several bullets so near that the archbishops gown was set on fire the rest coming up dismounted and dragged him out of the carriage when frightened and wounded he crawled towards hackston who still remained on horseback and begged for mercy the stern enthusiast contented himself with answering that he would not himself lay a hand on him burly and his men again fired a volley upon the kneeling old man and were in the act of riding off when one who remained to girth his horse unfortunately heard the daughter of their victim call to the servant for help exclaiming that his master was still alive burly then again dismounted struck off the prelates hat with his foot and split his skull with his shable broad sword although one of the party probably rathillet exclaimed spare these grey hairsa the rest pierced him with repeated wounds they plundered the carriage and rode off leaving beside the mangled corpse the daughter who was herself wounded in her pious endeavour to interpose betwixt her father and his murderers the murder is accurately represented in basrelief upon a beautiful monument erected to the memory of archbishop sharpe in the metropolitan church of st andrews this memorable example of fanatic revenge was acted upon magus muir near st andrews 3d may 1679b  footnote a they believed sharpe to be proof against shot for one of the murderers told wodrow that at the sight of cold iron his courage fell they no longer doubted this when they found in his pocket a small clue of silk rolled round a bit of parchment marked with two long words in hebrew or chaldaic characters accordingly it is still averred that the balls only left blue marks on the prelates neck and breast although the discharge was so near as to burn his clothes  footnote b the question whether the bishop of st andrews death was murder was a shibboleth or experimentum crucis frequently put to the apprehended conventiclers isabel alison executed at edinburgh 26th january 1681 was interrogated before the privy council if she conversed with david hackston i answered i did converse with him and i bless the lord that ever i saw him for i never saw ought in him but a godly pious youth they asked if the killing of the bishop of st andrews was a pious act i answered i never heard him say he killed him but if god moved any and put it upon them to execute his righteous judgment upon him i have nothing to say to that they asked me when saw ye john balfour burly that pious youth i answered i have seen him they asked when i answered these are frivolous questions i am not bound to answer them cloud of witnesses p 85  burly was of course obliged to leave fife and upon the 25th of the same month he arrived in evandale in lanarkshire along with hackston and a fellow called dingwall or daniel one of the same bloody band here he joined his old friend hamilton already mentioned and as they resolved to take up arms they were soon at the head of such a body of the chased and tossed western men as they thought equal to keep the field they resolved to commence their exploits upon the 29th of may 1679 being the anniversary of the restoration appointed to be kept as a holiday by act of parliament an institution which they esteemed a presumptuous and unholy solemnity accordingly at the head of eighty horse tolerably appointed hamilton burly and hackston entered the royal burgh of rutherglen extinguished the bonfires made in honour of the day burned at the cross the acts of parliament in favour of prelacy and for suppression of conventicles as well as those acts of council which regulated the indulgence granted to presbyterians against all these acts they entered their solemn protest or testimony as they called it and having affixed it to the cross concluded with prayer and psalms being now joined by a large body of foot so that their strength seems to have amounted to five or six hundred men though very indifferently armed they encamped upon loudoun hill claverhouse who was in garrison at glasgow instantly marched against the insurgents at the head of his own troop of cavalry and others amounting to about one hundred and fifty men he arrived at hamilton on the 1st of june so unexpectedly as to make prisoner john king a famous preacher among the wanderers and rapidly continued his march carrying his captive along with him till he came to the village of drumclog about a mile east of loudoun hill and twelve miles southwest of hamilton at some distance from this place the insurgents were skilfully posted in a boggy strait almost inaccessible to cavalry having a broad ditch in their front claverhouses dragoons discharged their carabines and made an attempt to charge but the nature of the ground threw them into total disorder burly who commanded the handful of horse belonging to the whigs instantly led them down on the disordered squadrons of claverhouse who were at the same time vigorously assaulted by the foot headed by the gallant clelanda and the enthusiastic hackston claverhouse himself was forced to fly and was in the utmost danger of being taken his horses belly being cut open by the stroke of a scythe so that the poor animal trailed his bowels for more than a mile in his flight he passed king the minister lately his prisoner but now deserted by his guard in the general confusion the preacher hollowed to the flying commander to halt and take his prisoner with him or as others say to stay and take the afternoons preaching claverhouse at length remounted continued his retreat to glasgow he lost in the skirmish about twenty of his troopers and his own cornet and kinsman robert graham whose fate is alluded to in the ballad only four of the other side were killed among whom was dingwall or daniel an associate of burly in sharpes murder the rebels says creichton finding the cornets body and supposing it to be that of clavers because the name of graham was wrought in the shirtneck treated it with the utmost inhumanity cutting off the nose picking out the eyes and stabbing it through in a hundred places the same charge is brought by guild in his bellum bothuellianum in which occurs the following account of the skirmish at drumclog

man of considerable genius was author of several poems published in 1697 his hudibrastic verses are poor scurrilous trash as the reader may judge from the description of the highlanders already quoted but in a wild rhapsody entitled hollo my fancy he displays some imagination his antimonarchical principles seem to break out in the following lines    fain would i know if beasts have any reason   if falcons killing eagles do commit a treason  he was a strict nonconformist and after the revolution became lieutenant colonel of the earl of anguss regiment called the cameronian regiment he was killed 21st august 1689 in the churchyard of dunkeld which his corps manfully and successfully defended against a superior body of highlanders his son was the author of the letter prefixed to the dunciad and is said to have been the notorious cleland who in circumstances of pecuniary embarrassment prostituted his talents to the composition of indecent and infamous works but this seems inconsistent with dates and the latter personage was probably the grandson of colonel cleland  although burly was among the most active leaders in the action he was not the commander in chief as one would conceive from the ballad that honour belonged to robert hamilton brother to sir william hamilton of preston a gentleman who like most of those at drumclog had imbibed the very wildest principles of fanaticism the cameronian account of the insurrection states that mr hamilton discovered a great deal of bravery and valour both in the conflict with and pursuit of the enemy but when he and some others were pursuing the enemy others flew too greedily upon the spoil small as it was instead of pursuing the victory and some without mr hamiltons knowledge and against his strict command gave five of these bloody enemies quarters and then let them go this greatly grieved mr hamilton when he saw some of babels brats spared after the lord had delivered them to their hands that they might dash them against the stones psalm cxxxvii 9 in his own account of this he reckons the sparing of these enemies and letting them go to be among their first stepping aside for which he feared that the lord would not honour them to do much more for him and says that he was neither for taking favours from nor giving favours to the lords enemies burly was not a likely man to fall into this sort of backsliding he disarmed one of the duke of hamiltons servants who had been in the action and desired him to tell his master he would keep till meeting the pistols he had taken from him the man described burly to the duke as a little stout man squinteyed and of a most ferocious aspect from which it appears that burlys figure corresponded to his manners and perhaps gave rise to his nickname burly signifying strong he was with the insurgents till the battle of bothwell bridge and afterwards fled to holland he joined the prince of orange but died at sea during the expedition the cameronians still believe he had obtained liberty from the prince to be avenged of those who had persecuted the lords people but through his death the laudable design of purging the land with their blood is supposed to have fallen to the groundlife of balfour of kinloch  the consequences of the battle of loudon hill will be detailed in the introduction to the next ballad    the battle of loudonhill     youl marvel when i tell ye o

of bothwellbridge   it has been often remarked that the scottish notwithstanding their national courage were always unsuccessful when fighting for their religion the cause lay not in the principle but in the mode of its application a leader like mahomet who is at the same time the prophet of his tribe may avail himself of religious enthusiasm because it comes to the aid of discipline and is a powerful means of attaining the despotic command essential to the success of a general but among the insurgents in the reigns of the last stuarts were mingled preachers who taught different shades of the presbyterian doctrine and minute as these shades sometimes were neither the several shepherds nor their flocks could cheerfully unite in a common cause this will appear from the transactions leading to the battle of bothwell bridge  we have seen that the party which defeated claverhouse at loudoun hill were cameronians whose principles consisted in disowning all temporal authority which did not flow from and through the solemn league and covenant this doctrine which is still retained by a scattered remnant of the sect in scotland is in theory and would be in practice inconsistent with the safety of any well regulated government because the covenanters deny to their governors that toleration which was iniquitously refused to themselves in many respects therefore we cannot be surprised at the anxiety and rigour with which the cameronians were persecuted although we may be of opinion that milder means would have induced a melioration of their principles these men as already noticed excepted against such presbyterians as were contented to exercise their worship under the indulgence granted by government or in other words who would have been satisfied with toleration for themselves without insisting upon a revolution in the state or even in the church government  when however the success at loudoun hill was spread abroad a number of preachers gentlemen and common people who had embraced the more moderate doctrine joined the army of hamilton thinking that the difference in their opinions ought not to prevent their acting in the common cause the insurgents were repulsed in an attack upon the town of glasgow which however claverhouse shortly afterwards thought it necessary to evacuate they were now nearly in full possession of the west of scotland and pitched their camp at hamilton where instead of modelling and disciplining their army the cameronians and erastians for so the violent insurgents chose to call the more moderate presbyterians only debated in council of war the real cause of their being in arms hamilton their general was the leader of the first party mr john walsh a minister headed the erastians the latter so far prevailed as to get a declaration drawn up in which they owned the kings government but the publication of it gave rise to new quarrels each faction had its own set of leaders all of whom aspired to be officers and there were actually two councils of war issuing contrary orders and declarations at the same time the one owning the king and the other designing him a malignant bloody and perjured tyrant  meanwhile their numbers and zeal were magnified at edinburgh and great alarm excited lest they should march eastward not only was the foot militia instantly called out but proclamations were issued directing all the heritors in the eastern southern and northern shires to repair to the kings host with their best horses arms and retainers in fife and other countries where the presbyterian doctrines prevailed many gentlemen disobeyed this order and were afterwards severely fined most of them alleged in excuse the apprehension of disquiet from their wivesa a respectable force was soon assembled and james duke of buccleuch and monmouth was sent down by charles to take the command furnished with instructions not unfavourable to presbyterians the royal army now moved slowly forwards towards hamilton and reached bothwellmoor on the 22d of june 1679 the insurgents were encamped chiefly in the duke of hamiltons park along the clyde which separated the two armies bothwellbridge which is long and narrow had then a portal in the middle with gates which the covenanters shut and barricadoed with stones and logs of timber this important post was defended by three hundred of their best men under hackston of rathillet and hall of haughhead early in the morning this party crossed the bridge and skirmished with the royal vanguard now advanced as far as the village of bothwell but hackston speedily retired to his post at the western end of bothwellbridge  footnote a balcanquhall of that ilk alledged that his horses were robbed but shunned to take the declaration for fear of disquiet from his wife young of kirktonhis ladyes dangerous sickness and bitter curses if he should leave her and the appearance of abortion on his offering to go from her and many others pled in general terms that their wives opposed or contradicted their going but the justiciary court found this defence totally irrelevantfountainhalls decisions vol i p 88  while the dispositions made by the duke of monmouth announced his purpose of assailing the pass the more moderate of the insurgents resolved to offer terms ferguson of kaithloch a gentleman of landed fortune and david hume a clergyman carried to the duke of monmouth a supplication demanding free exercise of their religion a free parliament and a free general assembly of the church the duke heard their demands with his natural mildness and assured them he would interpose with his majesty in their behalf on condition of their immediately dispersing themselves and yielding up their arms had the insurgents been all of the moderate opinion this proposal would have been accepted much bloodshed saved and perhaps some permanent advantage derived to their party or had they been all cameronians their defence would have been fierce and desperate but while their motley and misassorted officers were debating upon the dukes proposal his fieldpieces were already planted on the eastern side of the river to cover the attack of the foot guards who were led on by lord livingstone to force the bridge here hackston maintained his post with zeal and courage nor was it until all his ammunition was expended and every support denied him by the general that he reluctantly abandoned the important passa when his party were drawn back the dukes army slowly and with their cannon in front defiled along the bridge and formed in line of battle as they came over the river the duke commanded the foot and claverhouse the cavalry it would seem that these movements could not have been performed without at least some loss had the enemy been serious in opposing them but the insurgents were otherwise employed with the strangest delusion that ever fell upon devoted beings they chose these precious moments to cashier their officers and elect others in their room in this important operation they were at length disturbed by the dukes cannon at the very first discharge of which the horse of the covenanters wheeled and rode off breaking and trampling down the ranks of their infantry in their flight the cameronian account blames weir of greenridge a commander of the horse who is termed a sad achan in the camp the more moderate party lay the whole blame on hamilton whose conduct they say left the world to debate whether he was most traitor coward or fool the generous monmouth was anxious to spare the blood of his infatuated countrymen by which he incurred much blame among the highflying royalists lucky it was for the insurgents that the battle did not happen a day later when old general dalziel who divided with claverhouse the terror and hatred of the whigs arrived in the camp with a commission to supersede monmouth as commander in chief he is said to have upbraided the duke publicly with his lenity and heartily to have wished his own commission had come a day sooner when as he expresses himself these rogues should never more have troubled the king or countryb but notwithstanding the merciful orders of the duke of monmouth the cavalry made great slaughter among the fugitives of whom four hundred were slain guild thus expresses himself    ei ni dux validus tenuisset forte catervas   vix quisquam profugus vitam servasset

revenge of the cameronians if successful would have been little less sanguinary than that of the royalists creichton mentions that they had erected in their camp a high pair of gallows and prepared a quantity of halters to hang such prisoners as might fall into their hands and he admires the forbearance of the kings soldiers who when they returned with their prisoners brought them to the very spot where the gallows stood and guarded them there without offering to hang a single individual guild in the bellum bothuellianum alludes to the same story which is rendered probable by the character of hamilton the insurgent general guilds msscreichtons memoirs p 61  there were two gordons of earlstoun father and son they were descended of an ancient family in the west of scotland and their progenitors were believed to have been favourers of the reformed doctrine and possessed of a translation of the bible as early as the days of wickliffe william gordon the father was in 1663 summoned before the privy council for keeping conventicles in his house and woods by another act of council he was banished out of scotland but the sentence was never put into execution in 1667 earlstoun was

oppressive laws against nonconformists he joined the insurgents shortly after the skirmish at loudounhill he appears to have been active in forwarding the supplication sent to the duke of monmouth after the battle he escaped discovery by flying into a house at hamilton belonging to one of his tenants and disguising himself in female attire his person was proscribed and his estate of earlstoun

which the unfortunate earl of argyle was then meditating he was apprehended upon his return to scotland tried convicted of treason and condemned to die but his fate was postponed by a letter from the king appointing him to be reprieved for a month that he might in the interim be tortured for the discovery of his accomplices the council had the unusual spirit to remonstrate against this illegal course of severity on november 3 1653 he received a farther respite in hopes he would make some discovery when brought to the bar to be tortured for the king had reiterated his commands he through fear or distraction roared like a bull and laid so stoutly about him that the hangman and his assistant could hardly master him at last he fell into a swoon and on his recovery charged general dalziel and drummond violent tories together with the duke of hamilton with being the leaders of the fanatics it was generally thought that he affected this extravagant behaviour to invalidate all that agony

appointing his immediate death on 22d august 1684 earlstoun was sent for from the bass and ordered for execution 4th november 1684 he endeavoured to prevent his doom by escape but was discovered and taken after he had gained the roof of the prison the council deliberated whether in consideration of this attempt he was not liable to instant execution finally however they were satisfied to imprison

vulgar phrase of a true blue whig spalding informs us that when the first army of covenanters entered aberdeen few or none wanted a blue ribband the lord gordon and some others of the marquis of huntleys family had a ribband when they were dwelling in the town of a red fresh colour which they wore in their hats and called it the royal ribband as a sign of their love and loyalty to the king in despite and derision thereof this blue ribband was worn and called the covenanters ribband by the hail soldiers of the army who would not hear of the royal ribband such was their pride and malicevol i p 123 after the departure of this first army the town was occupied by the barons of the royal party till they were once more expelled by the covenanters who plundered the burgh and country adjacent no

too favourable to the fanatics the pretence was his having married into the presbyterian family of lord dundonald an act of council was also past regulating the payment of quarters which is stated by fountainhall to have been done in odium of claverhouse and in order to excite complaints against him this charge so inconsistent with the nature and conduct of claverhouse seems to have been the fruit of a quarrel betwixt him and the lord high treasurer fountainhall vol i p 360  that claverhouse was most unworthily accused of mitigating the persecution of the covenanters will appear from the following simple but very affecting narrative extracted from one of the little publications which appeared soon after the revolution while the facts were fresh in the memory of the sufferers the imitation of the scriptural stile produces in some passages of these works an effect not unlike what we feel in reading the beautiful book of ruth it is taken from the life of mr alexander pedena printed about 1720  in the beginning of may 1685 he came to the house of john brown and marion weir whom he married before he went to ireland where he stayed all night and in the morning when he took farewell he came out of the door saying to himself poor woman a fearful morning twice over a dark misty morning the next morning between five and six hours the said john brown having performed the worship of god in his family was going with a spade in his hand to make ready some peat ground the mist being very dark he knew not until cruel and bloody claverhouse compassed him with three troops of horse brought him to his house and there examined him who though he was a man of a stammering speech yet answered him distinctly and solidly which made claverhouse to examine those whom he had taken to be his guides through the muirs if ever they heard him preach they answered no no he was never a preacher he said if he has never preached meikle he has prayed in his time he said to john go to your prayers for you shall immediately die when he was praying claverhouse interrupted him three times one time that he stopt him he was pleading that the lord would spare a remnant and not make a full end in the day of his anger claverhouse said i gave you time to pray and ye are begun to preach he turned about upon his knees and said sir you know neither the nature of preaching or praying that calls this preaching then continued without confusion when ended claverhouse said take goodnight of your wife and children his wife standing by with her child in her arms that she had brought forth to him and another child of his first wifes he came to her and said now marion the day is come that i told you would come when i spake first to you of marrying me she said indeed john i can willingly part with youthen he said this is all i desire i have no more to do but die he kissed his wife and bairns and wished purchased and promised blessings to be multiplied upon them and his blessing clavers ordered six soldiers to shoot him the most part of the bullets came upon his head which scattered his brains upon the ground claverhouse said to his wife what thinkest thou of thy husband now woman she said i thought ever much of him and now as much as ever he said it were justice to lay thee beside him she said if ye were permitted i doubt not but your cruelty would go that length but how will ye make answer for this mornings work he said to man i can be answerable and for god i will take him in my own hand claverhouse mounted his horse and marched and left her with the corpse of her dead husband lying there she set the bairn on the ground and gathered his brains and tied up his head and straighted his body and covered him in her plaid and sat down and wept over him it being a very desart place where never victual grew and far from neighbours it was some time before any friends came to her the first that came was a very fit hand that old singular christian woman in the cummerhead named elizabeth menzies three miles distant who had been tried with the violent death of her husband at pentland afterwards of two worthy sons thomas weir who was killed at drumclog and david steel who was suddenly shot afterwards when taken the said marion weir sitting upon her husbands grave told me that before that she could see no blood but she was in danger to faint and yet she was helped to be a witness to all this without either fainting or confusion except when the shots were let off her eyes dazzled his corpse were buried at the end of his house where he was slain with this inscription on his gravestone    in earths cold bed the dusty part here lies   of one who did the earth as dust despise   here in this place from earth he took departure   now he has got the garland of the martyrs  footnote a the enthusiasm of this personage and of his followers invested him as has been already noticed with prophetic powers but hardly any of the stories told of him exceeds that sort of gloomy conjecture of misfortune which the precarious situation of his sect so greatly fostered the following passage relates to the battle of bothwellbridgethat dismal day 22d of june 1679 at bothwellbridge when the lords people fell and fled before the enemy he was forty miles distant near the border and kept himself retired until the middle of the day when some friends said to him sir the people are waiting for sermon he answered let them go to their prayers for me i neither can nor will preach any this day for our friends are fallen and fled before the enemy at hamilton and they are hacking and hewing them down and their blood is running like water the feats of peden are thus commemorated by fountainhall 27th of march 1650 news came to the privy council that about one hundred men well armed and appointed had left ireland because of a search there for such malcontents and landed in the west of scotland and joined with the wild fanatics the council finding that they disappointed the forces by skulking from hole to hole were of opinion it were better to let them gather into a body and draw to a head and so they would get them altogether in a snare they had one mr peden a minister with them and one isaac who commanded them they had frighted most part of all the country ministers so that they durst not stay at their churches but retired to edinburgh or to garrison towns and it was sad to see whole shires destitute of preaching except in burghs wherever they came they plundered arms and particularly at my lord dumfriess housefountainhall vol i p 359  this murder was committed betwixt six and seven in the morning mr peden was about ten or eleven miles distant having been in the fields all night he came to the house betwixt seven and eight and desired to call in the family that he might pray amongst them when praying he said lord when wilt thou avenge browns blood oh let browns blood be precious in thy sight and hasten the day when thou wilt avenge it with camerons cargils and many others of our martyrs names and oh for that day when the lord would avenge all their bloods when ended john muirhead enquired what he meant by browns blood he said twice over what do i mean claverhouse has been at the preshil this morning and has cruelly murdered john brown his corpse are lying at the end of his house and his poor wife sitting weeping by his corpse and not a soul to speak a word comfortably to her  while we read this dismal story we must remember browns situation was that of an avowed and determined rebel liable as such to military execution so that the atrocity was more that of the times than of claverhouse that generals gallant adherence to his master the misguided james vii and his glorious death on the field of victory at killicrankie have tended to preserve and gild his memory he is still remembered in the highlands as the most successful leader of their clans an ancient gentleman who had borne arms for the cause of stuart in 1715 told the editor that when the armies met on the field of battle at sheriffmuir a veteran chief i think he named gordon of glenbucket covered with scars came up to the earl of mar and earnestly pressed him to order the highlanders to charge before the regular army of argyle had completely formed their line and at a moment when the rapid and furious onset of the clans might have thrown them into total disorder mar repeatedly answered it was not yet time till the chieftain turned from him in disdain and despair and stamping with rage exclaimed aloud o for one hour of

airy elves by moonlight shadows seen   the silver token and the circled greenpope  in a work avowedly dedicated to the preservation of the poetry and tradition of the olden time it would be unpardonable to omit this opportunity of making some observations upon so interesting an article of the popular creed as that concerning the elves or fairies the general idea of spirits of a limited power and subordinate nature dwelling among the woods and mountains is perhaps common to all nations but the intermixture of tribes of languages and religion which has occurred in europe renders it difficult to trace the origin of the names which have been bestowed upon such spirits and the primary ideas which were entertained concerning their manners and habits  the word elf which seems to have been the original name of the beings afterwards denominated fairies is of gothic origin and probably signified simply a spirit of a lower order thus the saxons had not only dunelfen bergelfen and muntelfen spirits of the downs hills and mountains but also feldelfen wuduelfen saeelfen and waterelfen spirits of the fields of the woods of the sea and of the waters in low german the same latitude of expression occurs for night hags are termed aluinnen and aluen which is sometimes latinized eluoe but the prototype of the english elf is to be sought chiefly in the bergelfen or duergar of the scandinavians from the most early of the icelandic sagas as well as from the edda itself we learn the belief of the northern nations in a race of dwarfish spirits inhabiting the rocky mountains and approaching in some respects to the human nature their attributes amongst which we recognize the features of the modern fairy were supernatural wisdom and prescience and skill in the mechanical arts especially in the fabrication of arms they are farther described as capricious vindictive and easily irritated the story of the elfin sword tyrfing may be the most pleasing illustration of this position suafurlami a scandinavian monarch returning from hunting bewildered himself among the mountains about sunset he beheld a large rock and two dwarfs sitting before the mouth of a cavern the king drew his sword and intercepted their retreat by springing betwixt them and their recess and imposed upon them the following condition of safetythat they should make for him a faulchion with a baldric and scabbard of pure gold and a blade which should divide stones and iron as a garment and which should render the wielder ever victorious in battle the elves complied with the requisition and suafurlami pursued his way home returning at the time appointed the dwarfs delivered to him the famous sword tyrfing then standing in the entrance of their cavern spoke thus this sword o king shall destroy a man every time it is brandished but it shall perform three atrocious deeds and it shall be thy bane the king rushed forward with the charmed sword and buried both its edges in the rock but the dwarfs escaped into their recessesa this enchanted sword emitted rays like the sun dazzling all against whom it was brandished it divided steel like water and was never unsheathed without slaying a manhervarar saga p 9 similar to this was the enchanted sword skoffhung which was taken by a pirate out of the tomb of a norwegian monarch many such tales are narrated in the sagas but the most distinct account of the duergar or elves and their attributes is to be found in a preface of torfaeus to the history of hrolf kraka who cites a dissertation by einar gudmund a learned native of iceland i am firmly of opinion says the icelander that these beings are creatures of god consisting like human beings of a body and rational soul that they are of different sexes and capable of producing children and subject to all human affections as sleeping and waking laughing and crying poverty and wealth and that they possess cattle and other effects and are obnoxious to death like other mortals he proceeds to state that the females of this race are capable of procreating with mankind and gives an account of one who bore a child to an inhabitant of iceland for whom she claimed the privilege of baptism depositing the infant for that purpose at the gate of the churchyard together with a goblet of gold as an offeringhistoria hrolfi krakae a torfaeo  footnote a perhaps in this and similar tales we may recognize something of real history that the fins or ancient natives of scandinavia were driven into the mountains by the invasion of odin and his asiatics is sufficiently probable and there is reason to believe that the aboriginal inhabitants understood better than the intruders how to manufacture the produce of their own mines it is therefore possible that in process of time the oppressed fins may have been transformed into the supernatural duergar a similar transformation has taken place among the vulgar in scotland regarding the picts or pechs to whom they ascribe various supernatural attributes  similar to the traditions of the icelanders are those current among the laplanders of finland concerning a subterranean people gifted with supernatural qualities and inhabiting the recesses of the earth resembling men in their general appearance the manner of their existence and their habits of life they far excel the miserable laplanders in perfection of nature felicity of situation and skill in mechanical arts from all these advantages however after the partial conversion of the laplanders the subterranean people have derived no farther credit than to be confounded with the devils and magicians of the dark ages of christianity a degradation which as will shortly be demonstrated has been also suffered by the harmless fairies of albion and indeed by the whole host of deities of learned greece and mighty rome the ancient opinions are yet so firmly rooted that the laps of finland at this day boast of an intercourse with these beings in banquets dances and magical ceremonies and even in the more intimate commerce of gallantry they talk with triumph of the feasts which they have shared in the elfin caverns where wine and tobacco the productions of the fairy region went round in abundance and whence the mortal guest after receiving the kindest treatment and the most salutary counsel has been conducted to his tent by an escort of his supernatural entertainersjessens de lapponibus  the superstitions of the islands of feroe concerning their froddenskemen or underground people are derived from the duergar of scandinavia these beings are supposed to inhabit the interior recesses of mountains which they enter by invisible passages like the fairies they are supposed to steal human beings it happened says debes p 354 a good while since when the burghers of bergen had the commerce of feroe that there was a man in servaade called jonas soideman who was kept by spirits in a mountain during the space of seven years and at length came out but lived afterwards in great distress and fear lest they should again take him away wherefore people were obliged to watch him in the night the same author mentions another young man who had been carried away and after his return was removed a second time upon the eve of his marriage he returned in a short time and narrated that the spirit that had carried him away was in the shape of a most beautiful woman who pressed him to forsake his bride and remain with her urging her own superior beauty and splendid appearance he added that he saw the men who were employed to search for him and heard them call but that they could not see him nor could he answer them till upon his determined refusal to listen to the spirits persuasions the spell ceased to operate the kidneyshaped west indian bean which is sometimes driven upon the shore of the feroes is termed by the natives the fairies kidney  in these traditions of the gothic and finnish tribes we may recognize with certainty the rudiments of elfin superstition but we must look to various other causes for the modifications which it has undergone these are to be sought 1st in the traditions of the east 2d in the wreck and confusion of the gothic mythology 3d in the tales of chivalry 4th in the fables of classical antiquity 5th in the influence of the christian religion 6th and finally in the creative imagination of the sixteenth century it may be proper to notice the effect of these various causes before stating the popular belief of our own time regarding the fairies  i to the traditions of the east the fairies of britain owe i think little more than the appellation by which they have been distinguished since the days of the crusade the term fairy occurs not only in chaucer and in yet older english authors but also and more frequently in the romance language from which they seem to have adopted it ducange cites the following passage from gul guiart in historia francica ms    plusiers parlent de guenart   du lou de lasne de renart   de faëries et de songes   de phantosmes et de mensonges  the lay le frain enumerating the subjects of the breton lays informs us expressly    many ther beth faëry  by some etymologists of that learned class who not only know whence words come but also whither they are going the term fairy or faërie is derived from faë which is again derived from nympha it is more probable the term is of oriental origin and is derived from the persic through the medium of the arabic in persic the term peri expresses a species of imaginary being which resembles the fairy in some of its qualities and is one of the fairest creatures of romantic fancy this superstition must have been known to the arabs among whom the persian tales or romances even as early as the time of mahomet were so popular that it required the most terrible denunciations of that legislator to proscribe them now in the enunciation of the arabs the term peri would sound fairy the letter p not occurring in the alphabet of that nation and as the chief intercourse of the early crusaders was with the arabs or saracens it is probable they would adopt the term according to their pronounciation neither will it be considered as an objection to this opinion that in hesychius the ionian term phereas or pheres denotes the satyrs of classical antiquity if the number of words of oriental origin in that lexicographer be recollected of the persian peris ouseley in his persian miscellanies has described some characteristic traits with all the luxuriance of a fancy impregnated with the oriental association of ideas however vaguely their nature and appearance is described they are uniformly represented as gentle amiable females to whose character beneficence and beauty are essential none of them are mischievous or malignant none of them are deformed or diminutive like the gothic fairy though they correspond in beauty with our ideas of angels their employments are dissimilar and as they have no place in heaven their abode is different neither do they resemble those intelligences whom on account of their wisdom the platonists denominated daemons nor do they correspond either to the guardian genii of the romans or the celestial virgins of paradise whom the arabs denominate houri but the peris hover in the balmy clouds live in the colours of the rainbow and as the exquisite purity of their nature rejects all nourishment grosser than the odours of flowers they subsist by inhaling the fragrance of the jessamine and rose though their existence is not commensurate with the bounds of human life they are not exempted from the common fate of mortalswith the peris in persian mythology are contrasted the dives a race of beings who differ from them in sex appearance and disposition these are represented as of the male sex cruel wicked and of the most hideous aspect or as they are described by mr finch with ugly shapes long horns staring eyes shaggy hair great fangs ugly paws long tails with such horrible difformity and deformity that i wonder the poor women are not frightened therewith though they live very long their lives are limited and they are obnoxious to the blows of a human foe from the malignancy of their nature they not only wage war with mankind but persecute the peris with unremitting ferocity such are the brilliant and fanciful colours in which the imaginations of the persian poets have depicted the charming race of the peris and if we consider the romantic gallantry of the knights of chivalry and of the crusaders it will not appear improbable that their charms might occasionally fascinate the fervid imagination of an amorous troubadour but further the intercourse of france and italy with the moors of spain and the prevalence of the arabic as the language of science in the dark ages facilitated the introduction of their mythology amongst the nations of the west hence the romances of france of spain and of italy unite in describing the fairy as an inferior spirit in a beautiful female form possessing many of the amiable qualities of the eastern peri nay it seems sufficiently clear that the romancers borrowed from the arabs not merely the general idea concerning those spirits but even the names of individuals amongst them the peri mergian banou see herbelot ap peri celebrated in the ancient persian poetry figures in the european romances under the various names of mourgue la faye sister to king arthur urgande la deconnue protectress of amadis de gaul and the fata morgana of boiardo and ariosto the description of these nymphs by the troubadours and minstrels is in no respect inferior to those of the peris in the tale of sir launfal in ways fabliaux as well as in that of sir gruelan in the same interesting collection the reader will find the fairy of normandy or bretagne adorned with all the splendour of eastern description the fairy melusina also who married guy de lusignan count of poictou

indiscreet intruder than transforming herself into a dragon she departed with a loud yell of lamentation and was never again visible to mortal eyes although even in the days of brantome she was

as an object of desire and of affection those of britain and more especially those of scotland were far from being so fortunate but retaining the unamiable qualities and diminutive size of the gothic elves they only exchanged that term for the more popular appellation of fairies  footnote a upon this or some similar tradition was founded the notion which the inveteracy of national prejudice so easily diffused in scotland that the ancestor of the english monarchs geoffrey plantagenet had actually married a daemon bowmaker in order to explain the cruelty and ambition of edward i dedicates a chapter to shew how the kings of england are descended from the devil by the mothers sidefordun chron lib 9 cap 6 the lord of a certain castle called espervel was unfortunate enough to have a wife of the same class having observed for several years that she always left the chapel before the mass was concluded the baron in a fit of obstinacy or curiosity ordered his guard to detain her by force of which the consequence was that unable to support the elevation of the host she retreated through the air carrying with her one side of the chapel and several of the congregation  ii indeed so singularly unlucky were the british fairies that as has already been hinted amid the wreck of the gothic mythology consequent upon the introduction of christianity they seem to have preserved with difficulty their own distinct characteristics while at the same time they engrossed the mischievous attributes of several other classes of subordinate spirits acknowledged by the nations of the north the abstraction of children for example the well known practice of the modern fairy seems by the ancient gothic nations to have rather been ascribed to a species of nightmare or hag than to the bergelfen or duergar in the ancient legend of st margaret of which there is a saxonorman copy in hickes thesaurus linguar septen and one more modern in the auchinleck mss that lady encounters a fiend whose profession it was among other malicious tricks to injure newborn children and their mothers a practice afterwards imputed to the fairies gervase of tilbury in the otia imperialia mentions certain hags or lamiae who entered into houses in the nighttime to oppress the inhabitants while asleep injure their persons and property and carry off their children he likewise mentions the dracae a sort of water spirits who inveigle women and children into the recesses which they inhabit beneath lakes and rivers by floating past them on the surface of the water in the shape of gold rings or cups the women thus seized are employed as nurses and after seven years are permitted to revisit earth gervase mentions one woman in particular who had been allured by observing a wooden dish or cup float by her while washing clothes in a river being seized as soon as she reached the depths she was conducted into one of these subterranean recesses which she described as very magnificent and employed as nurse to one of the brood of the hag who had allured her during her residence in this capacity having accidentally touched one of her eyes with an ointment of serpents grease she perceived at her return to the world that she had acquired the faculty of seeing the dracae when they intermingle themselves with men of this power she was however deprived by the touch of her ghostly mistress whom

shoulder of mutton no doubt a case so much in point as that we have now quoted would have removed his incredulity  the following frisian superstition related by schott in his physica curiosa p 362 on the authority of cornelius a kempen coincides more accurately with the popular opinions concerning the fairies than even the dracae of gervase or the waterspirits of thomas heywoodin the time of the emperor lotharius in 830 says he many spectres infested frieseland particularly the white nymphs of the ancients which the moderns denominate witte wiven who inhabited a subterraneous cavern formed in a wonderful manner without human art on the top of a lofty mountain these were accustomed to surprise benighted travellers shepherds watching their herds and flocks and women newly delivered with their children and convey them into their caverns from which subterranean murmurs the cries of children the groans and lamentations of men and sometimes imperfect words and all kinds of musical sounds were heard to proceed the same superstition is detailed by bekker in his world bewitchd p 196 of the english translation as the different classes of spirits were gradually confounded the abstraction of children seems to have been chiefly ascribed to the elves or fairies yet not so entirely as to exclude hags and witches from the occasional exertion of their ancient privilegein germany the same confusion of classes has not taken place in the beautiful ballads of the erl king the water king and the mermaid we still recognize the ancient traditions of the goths concerning the waldelven and the dracae  a similar superstition concerning abstraction by daemons seems in the time of gervase of tilbury to have pervaded the greatest part of europe in catalonia says that author there is a lofty mountain named cavagum at the foot of which runs a river with golden sands in the vicinity of which there are likewise mines of silver this mountain is steep and almost inaccessible on its top which is always covered with ice and snow is a black and bottomless lake into which if a stone be thrown a tempest suddenly rises and near this lake though invisible to men is the porch of the palace of daemons in a town adjacent to this mountain named junchera lived one peter de cabinam being one day teazed with the fretfulness of his young daughter he in his impatience suddenly wished that the devil might take her when she was immediately borne away by the spirits about seven years afterwards an inhabitant of the same city passing by the mountain met a man who complained bitterly of the burthen he was constantly forced to bear upon enquiring the cause of his complaining as he did not seem to carry any load the man related that he had been unwarily devoted to the spirits by an execration and that they now employed him constantly as a vehicle of burthen as a proof of his assertion he added that the daughter of his fellowcitizen was detained by the spirits but that they were willing to restore her if her father would come and demand her on the mountain peter de cabinam on being informed of this ascended the mountain to the lake and in the name of god demanded his daughter when a tall thin withered figure with wandering eyes and almost bereft of understanding was wafted to him in a blast of wind after some time the person who had been employed as the vehicle of the spirits also returned when he related where the palace of the spirits was situated but added that none were permitted to enter but those who devoted themselves entirely to the spirits those who had been rashly committed to the devil by others being only permitted during their probation to enter the porch it may be proper to observe that the superstitious idea concerning the lake on the top of the mountain is common to almost every high hill in scotland wells or pits on the top of high hills were likewise supposed to lead to the subterranean habitations of the fairies thus gervase relates p 975 that he was informed the swineherd of william peverell an english baron having lost a broodsow descended through a deep abyss in the middle of an ancient ruinous castle situated on the top of a hill called bech in search of it though a violent wind commonly issued from this pit he found it calm and pursued his way till he arrived at a subterraneous region pleasant and cultivated with reapers cutting down corn though the snow remained on the surface of the ground above among the ears of corn he discovered his sow and was permitted to ascend with her and the pigs which she had farrowed though the author seems to think that the inhabitants of this cave might be antipodes yet as many such stories are related of the fairies it is probable that this narration is of the same kind of a similar nature seems to be another superstition mentioned by the same author concerning the ringing of invisible bells at the hour of one in a field in the vicinity of carleol which as he relates was denominated laikibraine or lai ki brait from all these tales we may perhaps be justified in supposing that the faculties and habits ascribed to the fairies by the superstition of latter days comprehended several originally attributed to other classes of inferior spirits  iii the notions arising from the spirit of chivalry combined to add to the fairies certain qualities less atrocious indeed but equally formidable with those which they derived from the last mentioned source and alike inconsistent with the powers of the duergar whom we may term their primitive prototype from an early period the daring temper of the northern tribes urged them to defy even the supernatural powers in the days of caesar the suevi were described by their countrymen as a people with whom the immortal gods dared not venture to contend at a later period the historians of scandinavia paint their heroes and champions not as bending at the altar of their deities but wandering into remote forests and caverns descending into the recesses of the tomb and extorting boons alike from gods and daemons by dint of the sword and battleaxe i will not detain the reader by quoting instances in which heaven is thus described as having been literally attempted by storm he may consult saxo olaus wormius olaus magnus torfaeus bartholin and other northern antiquaries with such ideas of superior beings the normans saxons and other gothic tribes brought their ardent courage to ferment yet more highly in the genial climes of the south and under the blaze of romantic chivalry hence during the dark ages the invisible world was modelled after the material and the saints to the protection of whom the knightserrant were accustomed to recommend themselves were accoutered like preux chevaliers by the ardent imaginations of their votaries with such ideas concerning the inhabitants of the celestial regions we ought not to be surprised to find the inferior spirits of a more dubious nature and origin equipped in the same disguise gervase of tilbury otia imperial ap script rer brunsvic vol i p 797 relates the following popular story concerning a fairy knight osbert a bold and powerful baron visited a noble family in the vicinity of wandlebury in the bishopric of ely among other stories related in the social circle of his friends who according to custom amused each other by repeating ancient tales and traditions he was informed that if any knight unattended entered an adjacent plain by moonlight and challenged an adversary to appear he would be immediately encountered by a spirit in the form of a knight osbert resolved to make the experiment and set out attended by a single squire whom he ordered to remain without the limits of the plain which was surrounded by an ancient entrenchment on repeating the challenge he was instantly assailed by an adversary whom he quickly unhorsed and seized the reins of his steed during this operation his ghostly opponent sprung up and darting his spear like a javelin at osbert wounded him in the thigh osbert returned in triumph with the horse which he committed to the care of his servants the horse was of a sable colour as well as his whole accoutrements and apparently of great beauty and vigour he remained with his keeper till cockcrowing when with eyes flashing fire he reared spurned the ground and vanished on disarming himself osbert perceived that he was wounded and that one of his steel boots was full of blood gervase adds that as long as he lived the scar of his wound opened afresh on the anniversary of the eve on which he encountered the spirita less fortunate was the gallant bohemian knight who travelling by night with a single companion came in sight of a fairy host arrayed under displayed banners despising the remonstrances of his friend the knight pricked forward to break a lance with a champion who advanced from the ranks apparently in defiance his companion beheld the bohemian overthrown

attribute the long train of military processions which the fairies are supposed occasionally to exhibit the elves indeed seem in this point to be identified with the aërial host termed during the middle ages the milites herlikini or herleurini celebrated by pet blesensis and termed in the life of st thomas of canterbury the familia helliquinii the chief of this band was originally a gallant knight and warrior but having spent his whole possessions in the service of the emperor and being rewarded with scorn and abandoned to subordinate oppression he became desperate and with his sons and followers formed a band of robbers after committing many ravages and defeating all the forces sent against him hellequin with his whole troop fell in a bloody engagement with the imperial host his former good life was supposed to save him from utter reprobation but he and his followers were condemned after death to a state of wandering which should endure till the last day retaining their military habits they were usually seen in the act of justing together or in similar warlike employments see the ancient french romance of richard sans peur similar to this was the nacht lager or

similar delusions see delrius pp 294 295  the martial spirit of our ancestors led them to defy these aërial warriors and it is still currently believed that he who has courage to rush upon a fairy

as the seed was supposed to have the quality of rendering the possessor invisible at pleasureb and to be also of sovereign use in charms and incantations persons of courage addicted to these mysterious arts were wont to watch in solitude to gather it at the moment when it should become visible the particular charms by which they fenced themselves during this vigil are now unknown but it was reckoned a feat of no small danger as the person undertaking it was exposed to the most dreadful assaults from spirits who dreaded the effect of this powerful herb in the hands of a cabalist such

mountains the memory of the pagan creed was not speedily eradicated in the extensive provinces through which it was once universally received and in many particulars it continued long to mingle with

or fatae of romance in the year 1058 a young man of noble birth had been married at rome and during the period of his nuptial feast having gone with his companions to play at ball he put his marriage ring on the finger of a broken statue of venus in the area to remain while he was engaged in the recreation desisting from the exercise he found the finger on which he had put his ring contracted firmly against the palm and attempted in vain either to break it or to disengage his ring he concealed the circumstance from his companions and returned at night with a servant when he found the finger extended and his ring gone he dissembled the loss and returned to his wife but whenever he attempted to embrace her he found himself prevented by something dark and dense which was tangible though not visible interposing between them and he heard a voice saying embrace me for i am venus whom this day you wedded and i will not restore your ring as this was constantly repeated he consulted his relations who had recourse to palumbus a priest skilled in necromancy he directed the young man to go at a certain hour of night to a spot among the ruins of ancient rome where four roads met and wait silently till he saw a company pass by and then without uttering a word to deliver a letter which he gave him to a majestic being who rode in a chariot after the rest of the company the young man did as he was directed and saw a company of all ages sexes and ranks on horse and on foot some joyful and others sad pass along among whom he distinguished a woman in a meretricious dress who from the tenuity of her garments seemed almost naked she rode on a mule her long hair which flowed over her shoulders was bound with a golden fillet and in her hand was a golden rod with which she directed her mule in the close of the procession a tall majestic figure appeared in a chariot adorned with emeralds and pearls who fiercely asked the young man what he did there he presented the letter in silence which the daemon dared not refuse as soon as he had read lifting up his hands to heaven he exclaimed almighty god how long wilt thou endure the iniquities of the sorcerer palumbus and immediately dispatched some of his attendants who with much difficulty extorted the ring from venus and restored it to its owner whose infernal banns were thus dissolvedforduni scotichronicon vol i p 407 cura

only of two classes of spirits exclusive of the souls of menangels namely and devils this doctrine had a necessary tendency to abolish the distinction among subordinate spirits which had been introduced by the superstitions of the scandinavians the existence of the fairies was readily admitted but as they had no pretensions to the angelic character they were deemed to be of infernal origin the union also which had been formed betwixt the elves and the pagan deities was probably of disservice to the former since every one knows that the whole synod of olympus were accounted daemons  the fulminations of the church were therefore early directed against those who consulted or consorted with the fairies and according to the inquisitorial logic the innocuous choristers of oberon and titania were without remorse confounded with the sable inhabitants of the orthodox gehennim while the rings which marked their revels were assimilated to the blasted sward on which the witches held

reformation swept away many of the corruptions of the church of rome but the purifying torrent remained itself somewhat tinctured by the superstitious impurities of the soil over which it had passed the trials of sorcerers and witches which disgrace our criminal records become even more frequent after the reformation of the church as if human credulity no longer amused by the miracles of rome had sought for food in the traditionary records of popular superstition a judaical observation of the precepts of the old testament also characterized the presbyterian reformers thou shalt not suffer a witch to live was a text which at once as they conceived authorized their belief in sorcery and sanctioned the penalty which they denounced against it the fairies were therefore in no better credit after the reformation than before being still regarded as actual daemons or something very little better a famous divine doctor jasper brokeman teaches us in his system of divinity that they inhabit in those places that are polluted with any crying sin as effusion of blood or where unbelief or superstitione have gotten the upper handdescription of feroe the fairies being on such bad terms with the divines those who pretended to intercourse with them were without scruple punished as sorcerers and such absurd charges are frequently stated as exaggerations of crimes in themselves sufficiently heinous  such is the case in the trial of the noted major weir and his sister where the following mummery interlards a criminal indictment too infamously flagitious to be farther detailed 9th april 1670 jean weir indicted of sorceries committed by her when she lived and kept a school at dalkeith that she took employment from a woman to speak in her behalf to the queen of fairii meaning the devil and that another woman gave her a piece of a tree or root the next day and did tell her that as long as she kept the same she should be able to do what she pleased and that same woman from whom she got the tree caused her spread a cloth before her door and set her foot upon it and to repeat thrice in the posture foresaid these words all her losses and crosses go alongst to the doors which was truly a consulting with the devil and an act of sorcery c that after the spirit in the shape of a woman who gave her the piece of tree had removed she addressing herself to spinning and having spun

character was at the same time ambitious of appearing eminently godly and used to frequent the beds of sick persons to assist them with his prayers on such occasions he put to his mouth a long staff which he usually carried and expressed himself with uncommon energy and fluency of which he was utterly incapable when the inspiring rod was withdrawn this circumstance the result probably of a trick or habit appearing suspicious to the judges the staff of the sorcerer was burned along with his person one hundred and thirty years have elapsed since his execution yet no one has during that space ventured to inhabit the house of this celebrated criminal  neither was the judgment of the criminal court of scotland less severe against another familiar of the fairies whose supposed correspondence

adamson bishop of st andrews he is accused of consulting with sorcerers particularly with this very woman and an account is given of her travelling through breadalbane in the company of the queen of faëry and of her descrying in the court of elfland many persons who had been supposed at rest in the peaceful gravea among these we find two remarkable personages the secretary young maitland of lethington and one of the old lairds of buccleuch the cause of their being stationed in elfland probably arose from the manner of their decease which being uncommon and violent caused the vulgar to suppose that they had been abstracted by the fairies lethington as is generally supposed died a roman death during his imprisonment in leith and the buccleuch whom i believe to be here meant was slain in a nocturnal scuffle by the kerrs his hereditary enemies besides they were both attached to the cause of queen mary and to the ancient religion and were thence probably considered as more

anomalous facts concerning the history of fairies in a sort of cocklane narrative contained in a letter from moses pitt to dr edward fowler lord bishop of gloucester printed at london in 1696 and preserved in morgans phoenix britannicus 4to london 1732  anne jefferies was born in the parish of st teath in the county of cornwall in 1626 being the daughter of a poor man she resided as servant in the house of the narrators father and waited upon the narrator himself in his childhood as she was knitting stockings in an arbour of the garden six small people all in green clothes came suddenly over the garden wall at the sight of whom being much frightened she was seized with convulsions and continued so long sick that she became as a changeling and was unable to walk during her sickness she frequently exclaimed they are just gone out of the window they are just gone out of the window do you not see them these expressions as she afterwards declared related to their disappearing during the harvest when every one was employed her mistress walked out and dreading that anne who was extremely weak and silly might injure herself or the house by the fire with some difficulty persuaded her to walk in the orchard till her return she accidentally hurt her leg and at her return anne cured it by stroking it with her hand she appeared to be informed of every particular and asserted that she had this information from the fairies who had caused the misfortune after this she performed numerous cures but would never receive money for them from harvest time to christmas she was fed by the fairies and eat no other victuals but theirs the narrator affirms that looking one day through the keyhole of the door of her chamber he saw her eating and that she gave him a piece of bread which was the most delicious he ever tasted the fairies always appeared to her in even numbers never less than two nor more than eight at a time she had always a sufficient stock of salves and medicines and yet neither made nor purchased any nor did she ever appear to be in want of money she one day gave a silver cup containing about a quart to the daughter of her mistress a girl about four years old to carry to her mother who refused to receive it the narrator adds that he had seen her dancing in the orchard among the trees and that she informed him she was then dancing with the fairies the report of the strange cures which she performed soon attracted the attention of both ministers and magistrates the ministers endeavoured to persuade her that the fairies by which she was haunted were evil spirits and that she was under the delusion of the devil after they had left her she was visited by the fairies while in great perplexity who desired her to cause those who termed them evil spirits to read that place of scripture first epistle of john chap iv v 1dearly beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god c though anne jefferies could not read she produced a bible folded down at this passage by the magistrates she was confined three months without food in bodmin jail and afterwards for some time in the house of justice tregeagle before the constable appeared to apprehend her she was visited by the fairies who informed her what was intended and advised her to go with him when this account was given on may 1 1696 she was still alive but refused to relate any particulars of her connection with the fairies or the occasion on which they deserted her lest she should again fall under the cognizance of the magistrates  anne jefferies fairies were not altogether singular in maintaining their good character in opposition to the received opinion of the church aubrey and lily unquestionably judges in such matters had a high opinion of these beings if we may judge from the following succinct and businesslike memorandum of a ghostseer anno 1670 not far from cirencester was an apparition being demanded whether a good spirit or a bad returned no

the highland seers even in our day have boasted of their intimacy with the elves as an innocent and advantageous connection one maccoan in appin the last person eminently gifted with the second sight professed to my learned and excellent friend mr ramsay of ochtertyre that he owed his prophetic visions to their intervention  vi there remains yet another cause to be noticed which seems to have induced a considerable alteration into the popular creed of england respecting fairies many poets of the sixteenth century and above all our immortal shakespeare deserting the hackneyed fictions of greece and rome sought for machinery in the superstitions of their native country the fays which nightly dance upon the wold were an interesting subject and the creative imagination of the bard improving upon the vulgar belief assigned to them many of those fanciful attributes and occupations which posterity have since associated with the name of fairy in such employments as rearing the drooping flower and arranging the disordered chamber the fairies of south britain gradually lost the harsher character of the dwarfs or elves their choral dances were enlivened by the introduction of the merry goblin pucka for whose freakish pranks they exchanged their original mischievous propensities the fairies of shakespeare drayton and mennis therefore at first exquisite fancy portraits may be considered as having finally operated a change in the original which gave them birthb  footnote a robin goodfellow or hobgoblin possesses the frolicksome qualities of the french lutin for his full

fairies of spenser have no connection with popular superstition being only words used to denote an utopian scene of action and imaginary or allegorical characters and the title of the fairy queen being probably suggested by the elfin mistress of chaucers sir thopas the stealing of the red cross knight while a child is the only incident in the poem which approaches to the popular character of the fairy    a fairy thee unweeting reft   there as thou sleptst in tender swadling band   and her base elfin brood there for thee left   such men do changelings call so changd by fairies theft       book i canto 10  while the fays of south britain received such attractive and poetical embellishments those of scotland who possessed no such advantage retained more of their ancient and appropriate character perhaps also the persecution which these sylvan deities underwent at the instance of the stricter presbyterian clergy had its usual effect in hardening their dispositions or at least in rendering them more dreaded by those among whom they dwelt the face of the country too might have some effect as we should naturally attribute a less malicious disposition and a less frightful appearance to the fays who glide by moonlight through the oaks of windsor than to those who haunt the solitary heaths and lofty mountains of the north the fact at least is certain and it has not escaped a late ingenious traveller that the character of the scottish fairy is more harsh and terrific than that which is ascribed to the elves of our sister kingdomsee stoddarts view of scenery and manners in scotland  the fairies of scotland are represented as a diminutive race of beings of a mixed or rather dubious nature capricious in their dispositions and mischievous in their resentment they inhabit the interior of green hills chiefly those of a conical form in gaelic termed sighan on which they lead their dances by moonlight impressing upon the surface the mark of circles which sometimes appear yellow and blasted sometimes of a deep green hue and within which it is dangerous to sleep or to be found after sunset the removal of those large portions of turf which thunderbolts sometimes scoop out of the ground with singular regularity is also ascribed to their agency cattle which are suddenly seized with the cramp or some similar disorder are said to be elfshot and the approved cure is to chafe the parts affected with a blue bonnet which it may be readily believed often restores the circulation the triangular flints frequently found in scotland with which the ancient inhabitants probably barbed their shafts are supposed to be the weapons of fairy resentment and are termed elfarrow heads the rude brazen battleaxes of the ancients commonly called celts are also ascribed to their manufacture but like the gothic duergar their skill is not confined to the fabrication of arms for they are heard sedulously hammering in linns precipices and rocky or cavernous situations where like the dwarfs of the mines mentioned by georg agricola they busy themselves in imitating the actions and the various employments of men the brook of beaumont for example which passes in its course by numerous linns and caverns is notorious for being haunted by the fairies and the perforated and rounded stones which are formed by trituration in its channel are termed by the vulgar fairy cups and dishes a beautiful reason is assigned by fletcher for the fays frequenting streams and fountains he tells us of    a virtuous well about whose flowery banks   the nimblefooted fairies dance their rounds   by the pale moonshine dipping oftentimes   their stolen children so to make them free   from dying flesh and dull mortality       faithful shepherdess  it is sometimes accounted unlucky to pass such places without performing some ceremony to avert the displeasure of the elves there is upon the top of minchmuir a mountain in peeblesshire a spring called the cheese well because anciently those who passed that way were wont to throw into it a piece of cheese as an offering to the fairies to whom it was consecrated  like the feld elfen of the saxons the usual dress of the fairies is green though on the moors they have been sometimes observed in heathbrown or in weeds dyed with the stoneraw or lichena they often ride in invisible procession when their presence is discovered by the shrill ringing of their bridles on these occasions they sometimes borrow mortal steeds and when such are found at morning panting and fatigued in their stalls with their manes and tails dishevelled and entangled the grooms i presume often find this a convenient excuse for their situation as the common belief of the elves quaffing the choicest liquors in the cellars of the rich see the story of lord duffus below might occasionally cloak the delinquencies of an unfaithful butler  footnote a hence the hero of the ballad is termed an elfin grey  the fairies beside their equestrian processions are addicted it would seem to the pleasures of the chace a young sailor travelling by night from douglas in the isle of man to visit his sister residing in kirk merlugh heard the noise of horses the holla of a huntsman and the sound of a horn immediately afterwards thirteen horsemen dressed in green and gallantly mounted swept past him jack was so much delighted with the sport that he followed them and enjoyed the sound of the horn for some miles and it was not till he arrived at his sisters house that he learned the danger which he had incurred i must not omit to mention that these little personages are expert jockeys and scorn to ride the little manks ponies though apparently well suited to their size the exercise therefore falls heavily upon the english and irish horses brought into the isle of man mr waldron was assured by a gentleman of ballafletcher that he had lost three or four capital hunters by these nocturnal excursionswaldrons works p 132 from the same author we learn that the fairies sometimes take more legitimate modes of procuring horses a person of the utmost integrity informed him that having occasion to sell a horse he was accosted among the mountains by a little gentleman plainly dressed who priced his horse cheapened him and after some chaffering finally purchased him no sooner had the buyer mounted and paid the price than he sunk through the earth horse and man to the astonishment and terror of the seller who experienced however no inconvenience from dealing with so extraordinary a purchaseribid p 135  it is hoped the reader will receive with due respect these and similar stories told by mr waldron for he himself a scholar and a gentleman informs us as to circles in grass and the impression of small feet among the snow i cannot deny but i have seen them frequently and once thought i heard a whistle as though in my ear when nobody that could make it was near me in this passage there is a curious picture of the contagious effects of a superstitious atmosphere waldron had lived so long among the manks that he was almost persuaded to believe their legends  from the history of the irish bards by mr walker and from the glossary subjoined to the lively and ingenious tale of castle rackrent we learn that the same ideas concerning fairies are current among the vulgar in that country the latter authority mentions their inhabiting the ancient tumuli called barrows and their abstracting mortals they are termed the good people and when an eddy of wind raises loose dust and sand the vulgar believe that it announces a fairy procession and bid god speed their journey  the scottish fairies in like manner sometimes reside in subterranean abodes in the vicinity of human habitations or according to the popular phrase under the doorstane or threshold in which situation they sometimes establish an intercourse with men by borrowing and lending and other kindly offices in this capacity they are termed the good neighboursa from supplying privately the wants of their friends and assisting them in all their transactions while their favours are concealed of this the traditionary story of sir godfrey macculloch forms a curious example  footnote a perhaps this epithet is only one example among many of the extreme civility which the vulgar in scotland use towards spirits of a dubious or even a determinedly mischievous nature the archfiend himself is often distinguished by the softened title of the goodman this epithet so applied must sound strange to a southern ear but as the phrase bears various interpretations according to the places where it is used so in the scottish dialect the goodman of such a place signifies the tenant or liferenter in opposition to the laird or proprietor hence the devil is termed the goodman or tenant of the infernal regions in the book of the universal kirk 13th may 1594 mention is made of the horrible superstitioune usit in garioch and dyvers parts of the countrie in not labouring a parcel of ground dedicated to the devil under the title of the guidmans croft lord hailes conjectured this to have been the tenenos adjoining to some ancient pagan temple the unavowed but obvious purpose of this practice was to avert the destructive rage of satan from the neighbouring possessions it required various fulminations of the general assembly of the kirk to abolish a practice bordering so nearly upon the doctrine of the magi  as this gallovidian gentleman was taking the air on horseback near his own house he was suddenly accosted by a little old man arrayed in green and mounted upon a white palfrey after mutual salutation the old man gave sir godfrey to understand that he resided under his habitation and that he had great reason to complain of the direction of a drain or common sewer which emptied itself directly into his chamber of dais a sir godfrey macculloch was a good deal startled at this extraordinary complaint but guessing the nature of the being he had to deal with he assured the old man with great courtesy that the direction of the drain should be altered and caused it be done accordingly many years afterwards sir godfrey had the misfortune to kill in a fray a gentleman of the neighbourhood he was apprehended tried and condemnedb the scaffold upon which his head was to be struck off was erected on the castlehill of edinburgh but hardly had he reached the fatal spot when the old man upon his white palfrey pressed through the crowd with the rapidity of lightning sir godfrey at his command sprung on behind him the good neighbour spurred his horse down the steep bank and neither he nor the criminal were ever again seen  footnote a the best chamber was thus currently denominated in scotland from the french dais signifying that part of the ancient halls which was elevated above the rest and covered with a canopy the turfseats which occupy the sunny side of a cottage wall is also termed the dais  footnote b in this particular tradition coincides with the real fact the trial took place in 1697  the most formidable attribute of the elves was their practice of carrying away and exchanging children and that of stealing human souls from their bodies a persuasion prevails among the ignorant says the author of a ms history of moray that in a consumptive disease the fairies steal away the soul and put the soul of a fairy in the room of it this belief prevails chiefly along the eastern coast of scotland where a practice apparently of druidical origin is used to avert the danger in the increase of the march moon withies of oak and ivy are cut and twisted into wreaths or circles which they preserve till next march after that period when persons are consumptive or children hectic they cause them to pass thrice through these circles in other cases the cure was more rough and at least as dangerous as the disease as will appear from the following extract  there is one thing remarkable in this parish of suddie in invernessshire which i think proper to mention there is a small hill nw from the church commonly called therdy hill or hill of therdie as some term it on the top of which there is a well which i had the curiosity to view because of the several reports concerning it when children happen to be sick and languish long in their malady so that they almost turned skeletons the common people imagine they are taken away at least the substance by spirits called fairies and the shadow left with them so at a particular season in summer they leave them all night themselves watching at a distance near this well and this they imagine will either end or mend them they say many more do recover than do not yea an honest tenant who lives hard by it and whom i had the curiosity to discourse about it told me it has recovered some who were about eight or nine years of age and to his certain knowledge they bring adult persons to it for as he was passing one dark night he heard groanings and coming to the well he found a man who had been long sick wrapped in a plaid so that he could scarcely move a stake being fixed in the earth with a rope or tedder that was about the plaid he had no sooner enquired what he was but he conjured him to loose him and out of sympathy he was pleased to slacken that wherein he was as i may so speak swaddled but if i right remember he signified he did not recoveraccount of the parish of suddie apud macfarlanes mss  according to the earlier doctrine concerning the original corruption of human nature the power of daemons over infants had been long reckoned considerable in the period intervening between birth and baptism during this period therefore children were believed to be particularly liable to abstraction by the fairies and mothers chiefly dreaded the substitution of changelings in the place of their own offspring various monstrous charms existed in scotland for procuring the restoration of a child which had been thus stolen but the most efficacious of them was supposed to be the roasting of the suppositious child upon the live embers when it was believed it would vanish and the true child appear in the place whence it had been originally abstracteda  footnote a less perilous recipes were sometimes used the editor is possessed of a small relique termed by tradition a toadstone the influence of which was supposed to preserve pregnant women from the power of daemons and other dangers incidental to their situation it has been carefully preserved for several generations was often pledged for considerable sums of money and uniformly redeemed from a belief in its efficacy  the most minute and authenticated account of an exchanged child is to be found in waldrons isle of man a book from which i have derived much legendary information i was prevailed upon myself says that author to go and see a child who they told me was one of these changelings and indeed must own was not a little surprised as well as shocked at the sight nothing under heaven could have a more beautiful face but though between five and six years old and seemingly healthy he was so far from being able to walk or stand that he could not so much as move any one joint his limbs were vastly long for his age but smaller than any infants of six months his complexion was perfectly delicate and he had the finest hair in the world he never spoke nor cried ate scarce any thing and was very seldom seen to smile but if any one called him a fairyelf he would frown and fix his eyes so earnestly on those who said it as if he would look them through his mother or at least his supposed mother being very poor frequently went out a chareing and left him a whole day together the neighbours out of curiosity have often looked in at the window to see how he behaved while alone which whenever they did they were sure to find him laughing and in the utmost delight this made them judge that he was not without company more pleasing to him than any mortals could be and what made this conjecture seem the more reasonable was that if he were left ever so dirty the woman at her return saw him with a clean face and his hair combed with the utmost exactness and nicety p 128  waldron gives another account of a poor woman to whose offspring it would seem the fairies had taken a special fancy a few nights after she was delivered of her first child the family were alarmed by a dreadful cry of fire all flew to the door while the mother lay trembling in bed unable to protect her infant which was snatched from the bed by an invisible hand fortunately the return of the gossips after the causeless alarm disturbed the fairies who dropped the child which was found sprawling and shrieking upon the threshold at the good womans second accouchement a tumult was heard in the cowhouse which drew thither the whole assistants they returned when they found that all was quiet among the cattle and lo the second child had been carried from the bed and dropped in the middle of the lane but upon the third occurrence of the same kind the company were again decoyed out of the sick womans chamber by a false alarm leaving only a nurse who was detained by the bonds of sleep on this last occasion the mother plainly saw her child removed though the means were invisible she screamed for assistance to the nurse but the old lady had partaken too deeply of the cordials which circulate on such joyful occasions to be easily awakened in short the child was this time fairly carried off and a withered deformed creature left in its stead quite naked with the clothes of the abstracted infant rolled in a bundle by its side this creature lived nine years ate nothing but a few herbs and neither spoke stood walked nor performed any other functions of mortality resembling in all respects the changeling already mentionedwaldrons works ibid  but the power of the fairies was not confined to unchristened children alone it was supposed frequently to extend to full grown persons especially such as in an unlucky hour were devoted to the devil by the execration of parents and of mastersa or those who were found asleep under a rock or on a green hill belonging to the fairies after sunset or finally to those who unwarily joined their orgies a tradition existed during the seventeenth century concerning an ancestor of the noble family of duffus who walking abroad in the fields near to his own house was suddenly carried away and found the next day at paris in the french kings cellar with a silver cup in his hand being brought into the kings presence and questioned by him who he was and how he came thither he told his name his country and the place of his residence and that on such a day of the month which proved to be the day immediately preceding being in the fields he heard the noise of a whirlwind and of voices crying horse and hattock this is the word which the fairies are said to use when they remove from any place whereupon he cried horse and hattock also and was immediately caught up and transported through the air by the fairies to that place where after he had drunk heartily he fell asleep and before he woke the rest of the company were gone and had left him in the posture wherein he was found it is said the king gave him the cup which was found in his hand and dismissed him the narrator affirms that the cup was still preserved and known by the name of the fairy cup he adds that mr steward tutor to the then lord duffus had informed him that when a boy at the school of forres he and his schoolfellows were upon a time whipping their tops in the churchyard before the door of the church when though the day was calm they heard a noise of a wind and at some distance saw the small dust begin to rise and turn round which motion continued advancing till it came to the place where they were whereupon they began to bless themselves but one of their number being it seems a little more bold and confident than his companions said horse and hattock with my top and immediately they all saw the top lifted up from the ground but could not see which way it was carried by reason of a cloud of dust which was raised at the same time they sought for the top all about the place where it was taken up but in vain and it was found afterwards in the churchyard on the other side of the churchthis puerile legend is contained in a letter from a learned gentleman in scotland to mr aubrey dated 15th march 1695 published in aubreys miscellanies p 158  footnote a this idea is not peculiar to the gothic tribes but extends to those of sclavic origin tooke history of russia vol i p 100 relates that the russian peasants believe the nocturnal daemon kikimora to have been a child whom the devil stole out of the womb of its mother because she had cursed it they also assert that if an execration against a child be spoken in an evil hour the child is carried off by the devil the beings so stolen are neither fiends nor men they are invisible and afraid of the cross and holy water but on the other hand in their nature and dispositions they resemble mankind whom they love and rarely injure  notwithstanding the special example of lord duffus and of the top it is the common opinion that persons falling under the power of the fairies were only allowed to revisit the haunts of men after seven years had expired at the end of seven years more they again disappeared after which they were seldom seen among mortals the accounts they gave of their situation differ in some particulars sometimes they were represented as leading a life of constant restlessness and wandering by moonlight according to others they inhabited a pleasant region where however their situation was rendered horrible by the sacrifice of one or more individuals to the devil every seventh year this circumstance is mentioned in alison pearsons indictment and in the tale of the young tamlane where it is termed the paying the kane to hell or according to some recitations the teind or tenth this is the popular reason assigned for the desire of the fairies to abstract young children as substitutes for themselves in this dreadful tribute concerning the mode of winning or recovering persons abstracted by the fairies tradition differs but the popular opinion contrary to what may be inferred from the following tale supposes that the recovery must be effected within a year and a day to be held legal in the fairy court this feat which was reckoned an enterprize of equal difficulty and danger could only be accomplished on halloween at the great annual procession of the fairy courta of this procession the following description is found in montgomerys flyting against polwart apud watsons collection of

footnote a see the inimitable poem of halloween    upon that night when fairies light     on cassilis downan dance   or oer the leas in splendid blaze     on stately coursers prance c    burns  the catastrophe of tamlane terminated more successfully than that of other attempts which tradition still records the wife of a farmer in lothian had been carried off by the fairies and during the year of probation repeatedly appeared on sunday in the midst of her children combing their hair on one of these occasions she was accosted by her husband when she related to him the unfortunate event which had separated them instructed him by what means he might win her and exhorted him to exert all his courage since her temporal and eternal happiness depended on the success of his attempt the farmer who ardently loved his wife set out on halloween and in the midst of a plot of furze waited impatiently for the procession of the fairies at the ringing of the fairy bridles and the wild unearthly sound which accompanied the cavalcade his heart failed him and he suffered the ghostly train to pass by without interruption when the last had rode past the whole troop vanished with loud shouts of laughter and exultation among which he plainly discovered the voice of his wife lamenting that he had lost her for ever  a similar but real incident took place at the town of north berwick within the memory of man the wife of a man above the lowest class of society being left alone in the house a few days after delivery was attacked and carried off by one of those convulsion fits incident to her situation upon the return of the family who had been engaged in haymaking or harvest they found the corpse much disfigured this circumstance the natural consequence of her disease led some of the spectators to think that she had been carried off by the fairies and that the body before them was some elfin deception the husband probably paid little attention to this opinion at the time the body was interred and after a decent time had elapsed finding his domestic affairs absolutely required female superintendence the widower paid his addresses to a young woman in the neighbourhood the recollection however of his former wife whom he had tenderly loved haunted his slumbers and one morning he came to the clergyman of the parish in the utmost dismay declaring that she had appeared to him the preceding night informed him that she was a captive in fairy land and conjured him to attempt her deliverance she directed him to bring the minister and certain other persons whom she named to her grave at midnight her body was then to be dug up and certain prayers recited after which the corpse was to become animated and fly from them one of the assistants the swiftest runner in the parish was to pursue the body and if he was able to seize it before it had thrice encircled the church the rest were to come to his assistance and detain it in spite of the struggles it should use and the various shapes into which it might be transformed the redemption of the abstracted person was then to become complete the minister a sensible man argued with his parishioner upon the indecency and absurdity of what was proposed and dismissed him next sunday the banns being for the first time proclaimed betwixt the widower and his new bride his former wife very naturally took the opportunity of the following night to make him another visit yet more terrific than the former she upbraided him with his incredulity his fickleness and his want of affection and to convince him that her appearance was no aërial illusion she gave suck in his presence to her youngest child the man under the greatest horror of mind had again recourse to the pastor and his ghostly counsellor fell upon an admirable expedient to console him this was nothing less than dispensing with the further solemnity of banns and marrying him without an hours delay to the young woman to whom he was affianced after which no spectre again disturbed his repose                                       having concluded these general observations upon the fairy superstition which although minute may not i hope be deemed altogether uninteresting i proceed to the more particular illustrations relating to the tale of the young tamlane  the following ballad still popular in ettrick forest where the scene is laid is certainly of much greater antiquity than its phraseology gradually modernized as transmitted by tradition would seem to denote the tale of the young tamlane is mentioned in the complaynt of scotland and the air to which it was chaunted seems to have been accommodated to a particular dance for the dance of thorn of lynn another variation of thomalin likewise occurs in the same performance like every popular subject it seems to have been frequently parodied and a burlesque ballad beginning    tom o the linn was a scotsman born  is still well known  in a medley contained in a curious and ancient ms cantus penes jg dalyell esq there is an allusion to our ballad    sing young thomlin be merry be merry and twice so merry  in scottish songs 1774 a part of the original tale was published under the title of kerton ha a corruption of carterhaugh and in the same collection there is a fragment containing two or three additional verses beginning    ill wager ill wager ill wager with you c  in johnsons musical museum a more complete copy occurs under the title of thom linn which with some alterations was reprinted in the tales of wonder  the present edition is the most perfect which has yet appeared being prepared from a collation of the printed copies with a very accurate one in glenriddells mss and with several recitals from tradition some verses are omitted in this edition being ascertained to belong to a separate ballad which will be found in a subsequent part of the work in one recital only the well known fragment of the wee wee man was introduced in the same measure with the rest of the poem it was retained in the first edition but is now omitted as the editor has been favoured by the learned mr ritson with a copy of the original poem of which it is a detached fragment the editor has been enabled to add several verses of beauty and interest to this edition of tamlane in consequence of a copy obtained from a gentleman residing near langholm which is said to be very ancient though the diction is somewhat of a modern cast the manners of the fairies are detailed at considerable length and in poetry of no common merit  carterhaugh is a plain at the conflux of the ettrick and yarrow in selkirkshire about a mile above selkirk and two miles below newark castle a romantic ruin which overhangs the yarrow and which is said to have been the habitation of our heroines father though others place his residence in the tower of oakwood the peasants point out upon the plain those electrical rings which vulgar credulity supposes to be traces of the fairy revels here they say were placed the stands of milk and of water in which tamlane was dipped in order to effect the disenchantment and upon these spots according to their mode of expressing themselves the grass will never grow miles cross perhaps a corruption of marys cross where fair janet waited the arrival of the fairy train is said to have stood near the duke of buccleuchs seat of bowhill about half a mile from carterhaugh in no part of scotland indeed has the belief in fairies maintained its ground with more pertinacity than in selkirkshire the most sceptical among the lower ranks only venture to assert that their appearances and mischievous exploits have ceased or at least become infrequent since the light of the gospel was diffused in its purity one of their frolics is said to have happened late in the last century the victim of elfin sport was a poor man who being employed in pulling heather upon peatlaw a hill not far from carterhaugh had tired of his labour and laid him down to sleep upon a fairy ringwhen he awakened he was amazed to find himself in the midst of a populous city to which as well as to the means of his transportation he was an utter stranger his coat was left upon the peatlaw and his bonnet which had fallen off in the course of his aërial journey was afterwards found hanging upon the steeple of the church of lanark the distress of the poor man was in some degree relieved by meeting a carrier whom he had formerly known and who conducted him back to selkirk by a slower conveyance than had whirled him to glasgowthat he had been carried off by the fairies was implicitly believed by all who did not reflect that a man may have private reasons for leaving his own country and for disguising his having intentionally done so    the young tamlane     o i forbid ye maidens a     that wear gowd on your hair   to come or gae by carterhaugh     for young tamlane is there    theres nane that gaes by carterhaugh     but maun leave him a wad   either

after other discourse enquired into his circumstances mine host confessed that although he practised all the unconscionable tricks of his trade he was still miserably poor the monk shook his head and asked to see his buttery or larder as they looked into it he rendered visible to the astonished host an immense goblin whose paunch and whole appearance bespoke his being gorged with food and who nevertheless was gormandizing at the innkeepers expence emptying whole shelves of food and washing it down with entire hogsheads of liquor to the depredation of this visitor will thy viands be exposed

man when they again inspected the larder they saw the same spirit but woefully reduced in size and in vain attempting to reach at the full plates and bottles which stood around him starving in short

and that at the same time there should exist such a difference as to make the one appear rather a counterpart than copy of the other in order to enable the curious reader to contrast these two singular poems and to form a judgment which may be the original i take the liberty of copying the english ballad from mr ritsons collection omitting only the burden and repetition of the first line

the ballad of the douglas tragedy is one of the few to which popular tradition has ascribed complete locality the farm of blackhouse in selkirkshire is said to have been the scene of this melancholy event there are the remains of a very ancient tower adjacent to the farmhouse in a wild and solitary glen upon a torrent named douglasburn which joins the yarrow after passing a craggy rock called the douglascraig this wild scene now a part of the traquair estate formed one of the most ancient possessions of the renowned family of douglas for sir john douglas eldest son of william the first lord douglas is said to have sat as baronial lord of douglasburn during his fathers lifetime in a parliament of malcolm canmore held at forfargodscroft vol i p 20 the tower appears to have been square with a circular turret at one angle for carrying up the staircase and for flanking the entrance it is said to have derived its name of blackhouse from the complexion of the lords of douglas whose swarthy hue was a family attribute but when the high mountains by which it is inclosed were covered with heather which was the case till of late years blackhouse must have also merited its appellation from the appearance of the scenery  from this ancient tower lady margaret is said to have been carried by her lover seven large stones erected upon the neighbouring heights of blackhouse are shown as marking the spot where the seven brethren were slain and the douglasburn is averred to have been the stream at which the lovers stopped to drink so minute is tradition in ascertaining the scene of a tragical tale which considering the rude state of former times had probably foundation in some real event  many copies of this ballad are current among the vulgar but chiefly in a state of great corruption especially such as have been committed to the press in the shape of penny pamphlets one of these is now before me which among many others has the ridiculous error of blue gilded horn for bugelet horn the copy principally used in this edition of the ballad was supplied by mr sharpe the three last verses are given from the printed copy and from tradition the hackneyed verse of the rose and the briar springing from the grave of the lovers is common to most tragic ballads but it is introduced into this with singular propriety as the chapel of st mary whose vestiges may be still traced upon the lake to which it has given name is said to have been the burial place of lord william and fair margaret the wrath of the black douglas which vented itself upon the brier far surpasses the usual stanza    at length came the clerk of the parish     as you the truth shall hear   and by mischance he cut them down     or else they had still been there    the douglas tragedy     rise up rise

st marys loch    young benjie never before published   in this ballad the reader will find traces of a singular superstition not yet altogether discredited in the wilder parts of scotland the lykewake or watching a dead body in itself a melancholy office is rendered in the idea of the assistants more dismally awful by the mysterious horrors of superstition in the interval betwixt death and interment the disembodied spirit is supposed to hover around its mortal habitation and if invoked by certain rites retains the power of communicating through its organs the cause of its dissolution such enquiries however are always dangerous and never to be resorted to unless the deceased is suspected to have suffered foul play as it is called it is the more unsafe to tamper with this charm in an unauthorized manner because the inhabitants of the infernal regions are at such periods peculiarly active one of the most potent ceremonies in the charm for causing the dead body to speak is setting the door ajar or half open on this account the peasants of scotland sedulously avoid leaving the door ajar while a corpse lies in the house the door must either be left wide open or quite shut but the first is always preferred on account of the exercise of hospitality usual on such occasions the attendants must be likewise careful never to leave the corpse for a moment alone or if it is left alone to avoid with a degree of superstitious horror the first sight of it the following story which is frequently related by the peasants of scotland will illustrate the imaginary danger of leaving the door ajar in former times a man and his wife lived in a solitary cottage on one of the extensive border fells one day the husband died suddenly and his wife who was equally afraid of staying alone by the corpse or leaving the dead body by itself repeatedly went to the door and looked anxiously over the lonely moor for the sight of some person approaching in her confusion and alarm she accidentally left the door ajar when the corpse suddenly started up and sat in the bed frowning and grinning at her frightfully she sat alone crying bitterly unable to avoid the fascination of the dead mans eye and too much terrified to break the sullen silence till a catholic priest passing over the wild entered the cottage he first set the door quite open then put his little finger in his mouth and said the paternoster backwards when the horrid look of the corpse relaxed it fell back on the bed and behaved itself as a dead man ought to do  the ballad is given from tradition    young benjie     of a the maids o fair scotland     the fairest was marjorie   and young benjie was her ae true love     and a dear true love was he    and wow but they were lovers dear     and loved fu constantlie   but ay the mair when they fell out     the sairer was their pleaa    and they hae quarrelled on a day     till marjories heart grew wae   and she said shed chuse another luve     and let young benjie gae    and he was stoutb and proudhearted     and thought ot bitterlie   and hes gaen by the wan moonlight     to meet his marjorie    o open open my true love     o open and let me in

of hoddom who mentions having copied it from an old magazine although it has probably received some modern corrections the general turn seems to be ancient and corresponds with that of a fragment

is for example currently believed in ettrick forest that a libertine who had destroyed fiftysix inhabited houses in order to throw the possessions of the cottagers into his estate and who added to this injury that of seducing their daughters was wont to commit to a carrier in the neighbourhood the care of his illegitimate children shortly after they were born his emissary regularly carried them away but they were never again heard of the unjust and cruel gains of the profligate laird were dissipated by his extravagance and the ruins of his house seem to bear witness to the truth of the rhythmical prophecies denounced against it and still current among the peasantry he himself died an untimely death but the agent of his amours and crimes survived to extreme old age when on his deathbed he seemed much oppressed in mind and sent for a clergyman to speak peace to his departing spirit but before the messenger returned the man was in his last agony and the terrified assistants had fled from his cottage unanimously averring that the wailing of murdered infants had ascended from behind his couch and mingled with the groans of the departing sinner    lady anne     fair lady

has been derived from the other yet its intrinsic merit seems to warrant its insertion mr hogg has added the following note which in the course of my enquiries i have found most fully corroborated  i am fully convinced of the antiquity of this song for although much of the language seems somewhat modernized this must be attributed to its currency being much liked and very much sung in this

b todfox    lord randal   there is a beautiful air to this old ballad the hero is more generally termed lord ronald but i willingly follow the authority of an ettrick forest copy for calling him randal because though the circumstances are so very different i think it not impossible that the ballad may have originally regarded the death of thomas randolph or randal earl of murray nephew to robert bruce and governor of scotland this great warrior died at musselburgh 1332 at the moment when his services were most necessary to his country already threatened by an english army for this sole reason perhaps our historians obstinately impute his death to poison see the bruce book xx fordun repeats and boece echoes this story both of whom charge the murder on edward iii but it is combated successfully by lord hailes in his remarks on the history of scotland  the substitution of some venomous reptile for food or putting it into liquor was anciently supposed to be a common mode of administering poison as appears from the following curious account of the death of king john extracted from a ms chronicle of england penes john clerk esq advocate and in the same tyme the pope sente into englond a legate that men cald swals and he was prest cardinal of rome for to mayntene king johnes cause agens the barons of englond but the barons had so much pte poustie ie power through lewys

im sick at the heart and i fain wald lie down    sir hugh le blond   this ballad is a northern composition and seems to have been the original of the legend called sir aldingar which is printed in the reliques of antient poetry the incidents are nearly the same in both ballads excepting that in aldingar an angel combats for the queen instead of a mortal champion the names of aldingar and rodingham approach near to each other in sound though not in orthography and the one might by reciters be easily substituted for the other  the tradition upon which the ballad is founded is universally current in the mearns and the editor is informed that till very lately the sword with which sir hugh le blond was believed to have defended the life and honour of the queen was carefully preserved by his descendants the viscounts of arbuthnot that sir hugh of arbuthnot lived in the thirteenth century is proved by his having in 1282 bestowed the patronage of the church of garvoch upon the monks of aberbrothwick for the safety of his soulregister of aberbrothwick quoted by crawford in peerage but i find no instance in history in which the honour of a queen of scotland was committed to the chance of a duel it is true that mary wife of alexander ii was about 1242 somewhat implicated in a dark story concerning the murder of patrick earl of athole burned in his lodging at haddington where he had gone to attend a great tournament the relations of the deceased baron accused of the murder sir william bisat a powerful nobleman who appears to have been in such high favour with the young queen that she offered her oath as a compurgator to prove his innocence bisat himself stood upon his defence and proffered the combat to his accusers but he was obliged to give way to the tide and was banished from scotland this affair interested all the northern barons and it is not impossible that some share taken in it by this sir hugh de arbuthnot may have given a slight foundation for the tradition of the countrywinton b vii ch 9 or if we suppose sir hugh le blond to be a predecessor of the sir hugh who flourished in the thirteenth century he may have been the victor in a duel shortly noticed as having occurred in 1154 when one arthur accused of treason was unsuccessful in his appeal to the judgment of god arthurus regem malcolm proditurus duello periit chron sanctae crucis ap anglia sacra vol i p 161  but true or false the incident narrated in the ballad is in the genuine style of chivalry romances abound with similar instances nor are they wanting in real history the most solemn part of a knights oath was to defend all widows orphelines and maidens of gude famealindsays heraldry ms the love of arms was a real passion of itself which blazed yet more fiercely when united with the enthusiastic admiration of the fair sex the knight of chaucer exclaims with chivalrous energy    to fight for a lady a benedicite   it were a lusty sight for to see  it was an argument seriously urged by sir john of heinault for making war upon edward ii in behalf of his banished wife isabella that knights were bound to aid to their uttermost power all distressed damsels living without council or comfort  footnote a such an oath is still taken by the knights of the bath but i believe few of that honourable brotherhood will now consider it quite so obligatory as the conscientious lord herbert of cherbury who gravely alleges it as a sufficient reason for having challenged divers cavaliers that they had either snatched from a lady her bouquet or ribband or by some discourtesy of similar importance placed her as his lordship conceived in the predicament of a distressed damozell  an apt illustration of the ballad would have been the combat undertaken by three spanish champions against three moors of granada in defence of the honour of the queen of granada wife to mohammed chiquito the last monarch of that kingdom but i have not at hand las guerras civiles de granada in which that

warriors were retainers of the earl of alencon and originally sworn brothers john de carogne went over the sea for the advancement of his fame leaving in his castle a beautiful wife where she lived soberly and sagely but the devil entered into the heart of jaques le grys and he rode one morning from the earls house to the castle of his friend where he was hospitably received by the unsuspicious lady he requested her to show him the donjon or keep of the castle and in that remote and inaccessible tower forcibly violated her chastity he then mounted his horse and returned to the earl of alencon within so short a space that his absence had not been perceived the lady abode within the donjon weeping bitterly and exclaiming ah jaques it was not well done thus to shame me but on you shall the shame rest if god send my husband safe home the lady kept secret this sorrowful deed until her husbands return from his voyage the day passed and night came and the knight went to bed but the lady would not for ever she blessed herself and walked up and down the chamber studying and musing until her attendants had retired and then throwing herself on her knees before the knight she shewed him all the adventure hardly would carogne believe the treachery of his companion but when convinced he replied since it is so lady i pardon you but the knight shall die for this villainous deed accordingly jaques le grys was accused of the crime in the court of the earl of alencon but as he was greatly loved of his lord and as the evidence was very slender the earl gave judgment against the accusers hereupon john carogne appealed to the parliament of paris which court after full consideration appointed the case to be tried by mortal combat betwixt the parties john carogne appearing as the champion of his lady if he failed in his combat then was he to be hanged and his lady burned as false and unjust calumniators this combat under circumstances so very peculiar attracted universal attention in so much that the king of france and his peers who were then in flanders collecting troops for an invasion of england returned to paris that so notable a duel might be fought in the royal presence thus the kynge and his uncles and the constable came to parys then the lystes were made in a place called saynt katheryne behinde the temple there was soo moche people that it was mervayle to beholde and on the one side of the lystes there was made gret scaffoldes that the lordes might the better se the batayle of the ii champion and so they bothe came to the felde armed at all peaces and there eche of them was set in theyr chayre the erle of saynt poule gouverned john of carongne and the erle of alansons company with jacques le grys and when the knyght entred in to the felde he came to his wyfe who was there syttynge in a chayre covered in blacke and he sayd to her thusdame by your enformacyon and in your quarrell i do put my lyfe in adventure as to fyght with jacques le grys ye knowe if the cause be just and truesyr sayd the lady it is as i have sayd wherefore ye maye fyght surely the cause is good and true with those wordes the knyghte kissed the lady and toke her by the hande and then blessyd hym and soo entred into the felde the lady sate styll in the blacke chayre in her prayers to god and to the vyrgyne mary humbly prayenge them by theyr specyall grace to send her husbande the victory accordynge to the ryght she was in gret hevynes for she was not sure of her lyfe for if her husbande sholde have ben dyscomfyted she was judged without remedy to be brente and her husbande hanged i cannot say whether she repented her or not as the matter was so forwarde that both she and her husbande were in grete peryll howbeit fynally she must as then abyde the adventure then these two champyons were set one agaynst another and so mounted on theyr horses and behauved them nobly for they knewe what perteyned to deades of armes there were many lordes and knyghtes of fraunce that were come thyder to se that batayle the two champyons justed at theyr fyrst metyng but none of them dyd hurte other and after the justes they lyghted on foote to periournie theyr batayle and soo fought valyauntlyand fyrst john of carongne was hurt in the thyghe whereby al his frendes were in grete fere but after that he fought so valyauntly that he bette down his adversary to the erthe and threst his swerde in his body and soo slewe hyrn in the felde and then he demaunded if he had done his devoyse or not and they answered that he had valyauntly atchieved his batayle then jacques le grys was delyuered to the hangman of parys and he drewe hym to the gybbet of mountfawcon and there hanged him up then john of carongne came before the kynge and kneled downe and the kynge made him to stand up before hym and the same daye the kynge caused to be delyvred to him a thousande franks and reteyned him to be of his chambre with a pencyon of ii hundred pounde by yere durynge the terme of his lyfe then he thanked the kynge and the lordes and went to his wyfe and kissed her and then they wente togyder to the chyrche of our ladye in parys and made theyr offerynge and then retourned to their lodgynges then this sir john of carongne taryed not longe in fraunce but went with syr john boucequant syr john of bordes and syr loys grat all these went to se

those times heroes put their lives in jeopardy for honour and ladys sake but i doubt whether the fair dames of the present day will think that the risk of being burned upon every suspicion of frailty could be altogether compensated by the probability that a husband of good faith like john de carogne or a disinterested champion like hugh le blond would take up the gauntlet in their behalf i fear they will rather accord to the sentiment of the hero of an old romance who expostulates thus with a certain duke    certes sir duke thou doest unright   to make a roast of your daughter bright    i

indifferently told is in itself interesting it is believed that there have been many more verses    sir hugh le blond     the birds sang sweet as ony bell    the world had not their make   the queen

fight with him for me    she breathed unto her messengers    sent them south east and west   they could find none to fight with him    nor enter the contest    she breathed on her messengers    she sent them to the north   and there they found sir hugh le blond    to fight him he came forth    when unto him they did unfold    the circumstance all right   he bade them go and tell the queen

arbattle is the ancient name of the barony of arbuthnot fordun has long been the patrimony of the same family    graeme and bewick   the date of this ballad and its subject are uncertain from internal evidence i am inclined to place it late in the sixteenth century of the graemes enough is elsewhere said it is not impossible that such a clan as they are described may have retained the rude ignorance of ancient border manners to a later period than their more inland neighbours and hence the taunt of old bewick to graeme bewick is an ancient name in cumberland and northumberland the ballad itself was given in the first edition from the recitation of a gentleman who professed to have forgotten some verses these have in the present edition been partly restored from a copy obtained by the recitation of an ostler in carlisle which has also furnished some slight alterations  the ballad is remarkable as containing probably the very latest allusion to the institution of brotherhood in arms which was held so sacred in the days of chivalry and whose origin may be traced up to the scythian ancestors of odin many of the old romances turn entirely upon the sanctity of the engagement contracted by the freres darmes in that of amis and amelion the hero slays his two infant children that he may compound a potent salve with their blood to cure the leprosy of his brother in arms the romance of gyron le courtois has a similar subject i think the hero like graeme in the ballad kills himself out of some high point of honour towards his friend  the quarrel of the two old chieftains over their wine is highly in character two generations have not elapsed since the custom of drinking deep and taking deadly revenge for slight offences produced very tragical events on the border to which the custom of going armed to festive meetings contributed not a little a minstrel who flourished about 1720 and is often talked of by the old people happened to be performing before one of these parties when they betook themselves to their swords the cautious musician accustomed to such scenes dived beneath the table a moment after a mans hand struck off with a backsword fell beside him the minstrel secured it carefully in his pocket as he would have done any other loose moveable sagely observing the owner would miss it sorely next morning i chuse rather to give this ludicrous example than some graver instances of bloodshed at border orgies i observe it is said in a ms account of tweeddale in praise of the inhabitants that when they fall in the humour of good fellowship they use it as a cement and bond of society and not to foment revenge quarrels and murders which is usual in other countries by which we ought probably to understand selkirkshire and teviotdalemacfarlanes mss

of wharton and stuart in two parts   duels as may be seen from the two preceding ballads are derived from the times of chivalry they succeeded to the combat at outrance about the end of the sixteenth century and though they were no longer countenanced by the laws nor considered a solemn appeal to the deity nor honoured by the presence of applauding monarchs and multitudes yet they were authorised by the manners of the age and by the applause of the faira they long continued they even yet continue to be appealed to as the test of truth since by the code of honour every gentleman is still bound to repel a charge of falsehood with the point of his sword and at the peril of his life this peculiarity of manners which would have surprised an ancient roman is obviously deduced from the gothic ordeal of trial by combat nevertheless the custom of duelling was considered at its first introduction as an innovation upon the law of arms and a book in two huge volumes entituled le vrai theatre d honneur et de la chivalerie was written by a french nobleman to support the venerable institutions of chivalry against this unceremonious mode of combat he has chosen for his frontispiece two figures the first represents a conquering knight trampling his enemy under foot in the lists crowned by justice with laurel and preceded by fame sounding his praises the other figure presents a duellist in his shirt as was then the fashion see the following ballad with his bloody rapier in his hand the slaughtered combatant is seen in the distance and the victor is pursued by the furies nevertheless the wise will make some scruple whether if the warriors were to change equipments they might not also exchange their emblematic attendants the modern mode of duel without defensive armour began about the reign of henry iii of france when the gentlemen of that nation as we learn from davila began to lay aside the cumbrous lance and cuirass even in war the increase of danger being supposed to contribute to the increase of honour the national ardour of the french gallants led them early to distinguish themselves by neglect of every thing that could contribute to their personal safety hence duels began to be fought by the combatants in their shirts and with the rapier only to this custom contributed also the art of fencing then cultivated as a new study in italy and spain by which the sword became at once an offensive and defensive weapon the reader will see the new science of defence as it was called ridiculed by shakespeare in romeo and juliet and by don quevedo in some of his novels but the more ancient customs continued for some time to maintain their ground the sieur colombiere mentions two gentlemen who fought with equal advantage for a whole day in all the panoply of chivalry and the next day had recourse to the modern mode of combat by a still more extraordinary mixture of ancient and modern fashions two combatants on horseback ran a tilt at each other with lances without any covering but their shirts  footnote a all things being ready for the ball and every one being in their place and i myself being next to the queen of france expecting when the dancers would come in one

knighterrant appears from a transaction which took place at the siege of juliers betwixt this balagny and lord herbert as these two noted duellists stood together in the trenches the frenchman addressed lord herbert monsieur on dit que vous etes un des plus braves de votre nation et je suis balagny allons voir qui fera le mieux with these words balagny jumped over the trench and herbert as speedily following both ran sword in hand towards the defences of the besieged town which welcomed their approach with a storm of musquetry and artillery balagny then observed this was hot service but herbert swore he would not turn back first so the frenchman was finally fain to set him the example or retreat notwithstanding the advantage which he had gained over balagny in this jeopardy of war lord herbert seems still to have grudged that gentlemans astonishing reputation for he endeavoured to pick a quarrel with him on the romantic score of the worth of their mistresses and receiving a ludicrous answer told him with disdain that he spoke more like a palliard than a cavalier from such instances the reader may judge whether the age of chivalry did not endure somewhat longer than is generally supposed  when armour was laid aside the consequence was that the first duels were very sanguinary terminating frequently in the death of one and sometimes as in the ballad of both persons engaged nor was this all the seconds who had nothing to do with the quarrel fought stoutly pour se desennuyer and often sealed with their blood their friendship for their principal a desperate combat fought between messrs entraguet and caylus is said to have been the first in which this fashion of promiscuous fight was introduced it proved fatal to two of henry the thirds minions and extracted from that sorrowing monarch an edict against duelling which was as frequently as fruitlessly renewed by his successors the use of rapier and poniard togethera was another cause of the mortal slaughter in these duels which were supposed in the reign of henry iv to have cost france at least as many of her nobles as had fallen in the civil wars with these double weapons frequent instances occurred in which a duellist mortally wounded threw himself within his antagonists guard and plunged his poniard into his heart nay sometimes the sword was altogether abandoned for the more sure and murderous dagger a quarrel having arisen betwixt the vicompte d allemagne and the sieur de la roque the former alleging the youth and dexterity of his antagonist insisted upon fighting the duel in their shirts and with their poniards only a desperate mode of conflict which proved fatal to both others refined even upon this horrible struggle by chusing for the scene a small room a large hogshead or finally a hole dug in the earth into which the duellists descended as into a certain gravemust i add that even women caught the phrenzy and that duels were fought not only by those whose rank and character rendered it little surprising but by modest and wellborn maidens audiguier traité de duel theatre d honneur vol ib  footnote a it appears from a line in the blackletter copy of the following ballad

three men then marry and get two or three children otherwise the world will neither have gained or lost by you herberts life p 64  we learn from every authority that duels became nearly as common in england after the accession of james vi as they had ever been in france the point of honour so fatal to the gallants of the age was no where carried more highly than at the court of the pacific solomon of britain instead of the feudal combats upon the hiegate of edinburgh which had often disturbed his repose at holyrood his levees at theobalds were occupied with listening to the detail of more polished but not less sanguinary contests i rather suppose that james never was himself disposed to pay particular attention to the laws of the duello but they were defined with a quaintness and pedantry which bating his dislike to the subject must have deeply interested him the point of honour was a science which a grown gentleman might study under suitable professors as well as dancing or any other modish accomplishment nay it would appear that the ingenuity of the swordmen so these military casuists were termed might often accommodate a bashful combatant with an honourable excuse for declining the combat     understandst them well nice points of duel   art born of gentle blood and pure descent   were none of all thy lineage hangd or cuckold   bastard or bastinadoed is thy pedigree

the professors of the point of honour  but though such shifts might occasionally be resorted to by the fainthearted yet the fiery cavaliers of the english court were but little apt to profit by them though their vengeance for insulted honour sometimes vented itself through fouler channels than that of fair combat it happened for example that lord sanquhar a scottish nobleman in fencing with a master of the noble science of defence lost his eye by an unlucky thrust the accident was provoking but without remedy nor did lord sanquhar think of it unless with regret until some years after when he chanced to be in the french court henry the great casually asked him how he lost his eye by the thrust of a sword answered lord sanquhar not caring to enter into particulars the king supposing the accident the consequence of a duel immediately enquired does the man yet live these few words set the blood of the scottish nobleman on fire nor did he rest till he had taken the base vengeance of assassinating by hired ruffians the unfortunate fencingmaster the mutual animosity betwixt the english and scottish nations had already occasioned much bloodshed among the gentry by single combat and james now found himself under the necessity of making a striking example of one of his scottish nobles to avoid the imputation of the grossest partiality lord sanquhar was condemned to be hanged and suffered that ignominious punishment accordingly  by a circuitous route we are now arrived at the subject of our ballad for to the tragical duel of stuart and wharton and to other instances of bloody combats and brawls betwixt the two nations is imputed jamess firmness in the case of lord sanquhar  for ramsay one of the kings servants not long before sanquhars trial had switched the earl of montgomery who was the kings first favourite happily because he tooke it so maxwell another of them had bitten hawley a gentleman of the temple by the ear which enraged the templars in those times

which there exists a blackletter copy in the pearson collection now in the library of the late john duke of roxburghe entitled a lamentable ballad of a combate lately fought near london between sir james stewarde and sir george wharton knights who were both slain at that timeto the tune of down plumpton park c a copy of this ballad has been published in mr ritsons ancient songs and upon comparison appears very little different from that which has been preserved by tradition in ettrick forest two verses have been added and one considerably improved from mr ritsons edition these three stanzas are the fifth and ninth of part first and the penult verse of part second i am thus particular that the reader may be able if he pleases to compare the traditional ballad with the original edition it furnishes striking evidence that without characters fame lives long the difference chiefly to be remarked betwixt the copies lies in the dialect and in some modifications applicable to scotland as using the words our scottish knight the blackletter ballad in like manner terms wharton our english knight my correspondent james hogg adds the following note to this ballad i have heard this song sung by several old people but all of them with this tradition that wharton bribed stuarts second and actually fought in armour i acknowledge that from some dark hints in the song this appears not impossible but that you may not judge too rashly i must remind you that the old people inhabiting the headlands high grounds hereabouts although possessed of many original songs traditions and anecdotes are most unreasonably partial when the valour or honour of a scotsman is called in question i retain this note because it is characteristic but i agree with my correspondent there can be no foundation for the tradition except in national partiality    the duel of wharton and stuart  part first     it grieveth me to tell you o    near london late what did befal   twixt two young

 could hold from striking in that place   for in the height and heat of blood    james struck george wharton on the face    what doth this mean george wharton said    to strike in such unmanly sort

that memorable expedition in 1529 which was fatal to johnie armstrang adam scott of tushielaw and many other marauders the vestiges of the castle of henderland are still to be traced upon the farm of that name belonging to mr murray of henderland they are situated near the mouth of the river meggat which falls into the lake of st mary in selkirkshire the adjacent country which now hardly bears a single tree is celebrated by lesly as in his time affording shelter to the largest stags in scotland a mountain torrent called henderland burn rushes impetuously from the hills through a rocky chasm named the dowglen and passes near the site of the tower to the recesses of this glen the wife of cokburne is said to have retreated during the execution of her husband and a place called the ladys seat is still shewn where she is said to have striven to drown amid the roar of a foaming cataract the tumultuous noise which announced the close of his existence in a deserted burialplace which once surrounded the chapel of the castle the monument of cokburne and his lady is still shewn it is a large stone broken into three parts but some armorial bearings may be yet traced and the following inscription is still legible though defaced  here lyes perys of cokburne and his wyfe marjory  tradition says that cokburne was surprised by the king while sitting at dinner after the execution james marched rapidly forward to surprise adam scott of tushielaw called the king of the border and sometimes the king of thieves a path through the mountains which separate the vale of ettrick from the head of yarrow is still called the kings road and seems to have been the rout which he followed the remains of the tower of tushielaw are yet visible overhanging the wild banks of the ettrick and are an object of terror to the benighted peasant from an idea of their being haunted by spectres from these heights and through the adjacent county of peebles passes a wild path called still the thiefs

ballad has been handed down by tradition in its present imperfect state the affecting incident on which it is founded is well known a lady of the name of helen irving or bella for this is disputed by the two clans daughter of the laird of kirconnell in dumfriesshire and celebrated for her beauty was beloved by two gentlemen in the neighbourhood the name of the favoured suitor was adam fleming of kirkpatrick that of the other has escaped tradition though it has been alleged that he was a bell of blacket house the addresses of the latter were however favoured by the friends of the lady and the lovers were therefore obliged to meet in secret and by night in the churchyard of kirconnell a romantic spot surrounded by the river kirtle during one of those private interviews the jealous and despised lover suddenly appeared on the opposite bank of the stream and levelled his carabine at the breast of his rival helen threw herself before her lover received in her bosom the bullet and died in his arms a desperate and mortal combat ensued between fleming and the murderer in which the latter was cut to pieces other accounts say that fleming pursued his enemy to spain and slew him in the streets of madrid  footnote a this dispute is owing to the uncertain date of the ballad for although the last proprietors if kirconnell were irvings when deprived of their possession by robert maxwell in 1600 yet kirconnell is termed in old chronicles the bells tower and a stone with the arms of that family has been found among its ruins fair helens sirname therefore depends upon the period at which she lived which it is now impossible to ascertain  the ballad as now published consists of two parts the first seems to be an address either by fleming or his rival to the lady if indeed it constituted any portion of the original poem for the editor cannot help suspecting that these verses have been the production of a different and inferior bard and only adapted to the original measure and tune but this suspicion being unwarranted by any copy he has been able to procure he does not venture to do more than intimate his own opinion the second part by far the most beautiful and which is unquestionably original forms the lament of fleming over the grave of fair helen  the ballad is here given without alteration or improvement from the most accurate copy which could be recovered the fate of helen has not however remained unsung by modern bards a lament of great poetical merit by the learned historian mr pinkerton with several other poems on this subject have been printed in various forms  the grave of the lovers is yet shewn in the churchyard of kirconnell near springkell upon the tombstone can still be readhie jacet adamus fleming a cross and sword are sculptured on the

contentment and then while the marquis and richard being both on foot were chasing the kid about the stack the prince from horseback killed him in the head with a scottish pistolwhich circumstance

ballad appears to have been an outlaw and deerstealerprobably one of the broken men residing upon the border there are several different copies in one of which the principal personage is called johnie of cockielaw the stanzas of greatest merit have been selected from each copy it is sometimes said that this outlaw possessed the old castle of morton in dumfriesshire now ruinousnear to this castle there was a park built by sir thomas randolph on the face of a very great and high hill so artificially that by the advantage of the hill all wild beasts such as deers harts and roes and hares did easily leap in but could not get out again and if any other cattle such as cows sheep or goats did voluntarily leap in or were forced to do it it is doubted if their owners were permitted to get them out againaccount of presbytery of penpont apud macfarlanes mss such a park would form a convenient domain to an outlaws castle and the mention of durrisdeer a neighbouring parish adds weight to the

this ballad which is a very great favourite among the inhabitants of ettrick forest is universally believed to be founded in fact the editor found it easy to collect a variety of copies but very difficult indeed to select from them such a collated edition as may in any degree suit the taste of these more light and giddypaced times  tradition places the event recorded in the song very early and it is probable that the ballad was composed soon afterwards although the language has been gradually modernized in the course of its transmission to us through the inaccurate channel of oral traditionthe bard does not relate particulars but barely the striking outlines of a fact apparently so well known when he wrote as to render minute detail as unnecessary as it is always tedious and unpoetical  the hero of the ballad was a knight of great bravery called scott who is said to have resided at kirkhope or oakwood castle and is in tradition termed the baron of oakwood the estate of kirkhope belonged anciently to the scotts of harden oakwood is still their property and has been so from time immemorial the editor was therefore led to suppose that the hero of the ballad might have been identified with john scott sixth son of the laird of harden murdered in ettrick forest by his kinsmen the scotts of gilmanscleugh see notes to jamie telfer vol i p 152 this appeared the more probable as the common people always affirm that this young man was treacherously slain and that in evidence thereof his body remained uncorrupted for many years so that even the roses on his shoes seemed as fresh as when he was first laid in the family vault at hassendean but from a passage in nisbets heraldry he now believes the ballad refers to a duel fought at deucharswyre of which annans treat is a part betwixt john scott of tushielaw and his brotherinlaw walter scott third son of robert of thirlestane in which the latter was slain  in ploughing annans treat a huge monumental stone with an inscription was discovered but being rather scratched than engraved and the lines being run through each other it is only possible to read one or two latin words it probably records the event of the combatthe person slain was the male ancestor of the present lord napier  tradition affirms that the hero of the song be he who he may was murdered by the brother either of his wife or betrothed bride the alleged cause of malice was the ladys father having proposed to endow her with half of his property upon her marriage with a warrior of such renown the name of the murderer is said to have been annan and the place of combat is still called annans treat it is a low muir on the banks of the yarrow lying to the west of yarrow kirk two tall unhewn masses of stone are erected about eighty yards distant from each other and the least child that can herd a cow will tell the passenger that there lie the two lords who were slain in single combat  it will be with many readers the greatest

cheeks like the sanguine traces thereon whilst the raven recals to my memory the colour of his beautiful locks  there is also some resemblance in the conduct of the story betwixt the ballad and the tale just quoted the princess faravla being desperately in love with carral odaly dispatches in search of him a faithful confidant who by her magical art transforms herself into a hawk and perching upon the windows of the bard conveys to him information of the distress of the princess of scotland  in the ancient romance of sir tristrem the simile of the blood drops upon snow likewise occurs    a

scotland pronounced jill for gille or julianna as a female name we have fair gillian of croyden and a thousand authorities such being the case the editor must enter his protest against the conversion of gil morrice into child maurice an epithet of chivalry all the circumstances in that ballad argue that the unfortunate hero was an obscure and very young man who had never received the honour of knighthood at any rate there can be no reason even were internal evidence totally wanting for altering a well known proper name which till of late years has been the uniform title of the ballad

now jellon grame    my father ye need na dread   ill keep my babe in gude greenwood    or wi it ill beg my bread    he took no pity on lillie flower    tho she for life did pray   but pierced her thro the fair body    as at his feet she lay    he felt nae pity for lillie flower    where she was lying dead   but he felt some for the bonny bairn    that lay weltering in her bluid    up has he taen that bonny boy    given him to nurses nine   three to sleep and three to wake    and three to go between    and he bred up that bonny boy    called him his sisters son   and he thought no eye could ever see    the deed that he had done    o so it fell upon a day    when hunting they might be   they rested them in silverwood    beneath that green aik tree    and mony were the greenwood flowers

seen to illuminate the spot where a dead body is concealed the editor is informed that some years ago the corpse of a man drowned in the ettrick below selkirk was discovered by means of these candles such lights are common in churchyards and are probably of a phosphoric nature but rustic superstition derives them from supernatural agency and supposes that as soon as life has departed a pale flame appears at the window of the house in which the person had died and glides towards the churchyard tracing through every winding the route of the future funeral and pausing where the bier is to rest this and other opinions relating to the tombfires livid gleam seem to be of runic extraction    the deepest pot in a the linnp 403 v 5  the deep holes scooped in the rock by the eddies of a river are called pots the motion of the water having there some resemblance to a boiling cauldron    linn means the pool beneath a cataract    the maiden touched the claycauld corpse   a drop it never bledp 405 v i  this verse which is restored from tradition refers to a superstition formerly received in most parts of europe and even resorted to by judicial authority for the discovery of murder in germany this experiment was called bahrrecht or the law of the bier because the murdered body being stretched upon a bier the suspected person was obliged to put one hand upon the wound and the other upon the mouth of the deceased and in that posture call upon heaven to attest his innocence if during this ceremony the blood gushed from the mouth nose or wound a circumstance not unlikely to happen in the course of shifting or stirring the body it was held sufficient evidence of the guilt of the party  the same singular kind of evidence although reprobated by mathaeus and carpzovius was admitted in the scottish criminal courts at the short distance of one century my readers may be amused by the following instances  the laird of auchindrane muir of auchindrane in ayrshire was accused of a horrid and private murder where there were no witnesses and which the lord had witnessed from heaven singularly by his own hand and proved the deed against him the corpse of the man being buried in girvan churchyard as a man cast away at sea and cast out there the laird of colzean whose servant he had been dreaming of him in his sleep and that he had a particular mark upon his body came and took up the body and found it to be the same person and caused all that lived near by come and touch the corpse as is usual in such cases all round the place came but auchindrane and his son whom nobody suspected till a young child of his mary muir seeing the people examined came in among them and when she came near the dead body it sprang out in bleeding upon which they were apprehended and put to the torturewodrows history vol i p 513 the trial of auchindrane happened in 1611 he was convicted and executedhumes criminal law vol i p 428  a yet more dreadful case was that of philip standfield tried upon the 30th november 1687 for cursing his father which by the scottish law is a capital crime act 1661 chap 20 and for being accessory to his murder sir james standfield the deceased was a person of melancholy temperament so that when his body was found in a pond near his own house of newmilns he was at first generally supposed to have drowned himself but the body having been hastily buried a report arose that he had been strangled by ruffians instigated by his son philip a profligate youth whom be had disinherited on account of his gross debauchery upon this rumour the privy council granted warrant to two surgeons of character named crawford and muirhead to dig up the body and to report the state in which they should find it philip was present on this occasion and the evidence of both surgeons bears distinctly that he stood for some time at a distance from the body of his parent but being called upon to assist in stretching out the corpse he put his hand to the head when the mouth and nostrils instantly gushed with blood this circumstance with the evident symptoms of terror and remorse exhibited by young standfield seem to have had considerable weight with the jury and are thus stated in the indictment that his the deceaseds nearest relations being required to lift the corpse into the coffin after it had been inspected upon the said philip standfield touching of it according to gods usual mode of discovering murder it bled afresh upon the said philip and that thereupon he let the body fall and fled from it in the greatest consternation crying lord have mercy upon me the prisoner was found guilty of being accessory to the murder of his father although there was little more than strong presumptions against him it is true he was at the same time separately convicted of the distinct crimes of having cursed his father and drank damnation to the monarchy and hierarchy his sentence which was to have his tongue cut out and hand struck off previous to his being hanged was executed with the utmost rigour he denied the murder with his last breath it is says a contemporary judge a dark case of divination to be remitted to the great day whether he was guilty or innocent only it is certain he was a bad youth and may serve as a beacon to all profligate personsfountainhalls decisions vol i p 483  while all ranks believed alike the existence of these prodigies the vulgar were contented to refer them to the immediate interference of the deity or as they termed it gods revenge against murder but those who while they had overleaped the bounds of superstition were still entangled in the mazes of mystic philosophy amongst whom we must reckon many of the medical practitioners endeavoured to explain the phenomenon by referring to the secret power of sympathy which even bacon did not venture to dispute to this occult agency was imputed the cure of wounds effected by applying salves and powders not to the wound itself but to the sword or dagger by which it had been inflicted a course of treatment which wonderful as it may at first seem was certainly frequently attended with signal successa this however was attributed to magic and those who submitted to such a mode of cure were refused spiritual assistance  footnote a the first part of the process was to wash the wound clean and bind it up so as to promote adhesion and exclude the air now though the remedies afterwards applied to the sword could hardly promote so desirable an issue yet it is evident the wound stood a good chance of healing by the operation of nature which i believe medical gentlemen call a cure by the first intention  the vulgar continue to believe firmly in the phenomenon of the murdered corpse bleeding at the approach of the murderer many i adopt the words of an ingenious correspondent are the proofs advanced in confirmation of the opinion against those who are so hardy as to doubt it but one in particular as it is said to have happened in this place i cannot help repeating  two young men going a fishing in the river yarrow fell out and so high ran the quarrel that the one in a passion stabbed the other to the heart with a fish spear astonished at the rash act he hesitated whether to fly give himself up to justice or conceal the crime and in the end fixed on the latter expedient burying the body of his friend very deep in the sands as the meeting had been accidental he was never from gaiety to a settled melancholy time passed on for the space of fifty years when a smith fishing near the same place discovered an uncommon and curious bone which he put in his pocket and afterwards showed to some people in his smithy the murderer being present now an old whiteheaded man leaning on his staff desired a sight of the little bone but how horrible was the issue no sooner had he touched it than it streamed with purple blood being told where it was found he confessed the crime was condemned but was prevented by death from suffering the punishment due to his crime  such opinions though reason forbids us to believe them a few moments reflection on the cause of their origin will teach us to revere under the feudal system which prevailed the rights of humanity were too often violated and redress very hard to be procured thus an awful deference to one of the leading attributes of omnipotence begat on the mind untutored by philosophy the first germ of these supernatural effects which was by superstitious zeal assisted perhaps by a few instances of sudden remorse magnified into evidence of indisputable guilt    the lass of lochroyan  now first published in a perfect state   lochroyan whence this ballad probably derives its name lies in galloway the lover who if the story be real may be supposed to have been detained
