51663140	martin eden   chapter i   the one opened the door with a latchkey and went in followed by a young fellow who awkwardly removed his cap  he wore rough clothes that smacked of the sea and he was manifestly out of place in the spacious hall in which he found himself  he did not know what to do with his cap and was stuffing it into his coat pocket when the other took it from him  the act was done quietly and naturally and the awkward young fellow appreciated it  he understands was his thought  hell see me through all right  he walked at the others heels with a swing to his shoulders and his legs spread unwittingly as if the level floors were tilting up and sinking down to the heave and lunge of the sea  the wide rooms seemed too narrow for his rolling gait and to himself he was in terror lest his broad shoulders should collide with the doorways or sweep the bricabrac from the low mantel  he recoiled from side to side between the various objects and multiplied the hazards that in reality lodged only in his mind  between a grand piano and a centretable piled high with books was space for a half a dozen to walk abreast yet he essayed it with trepidation  his heavy arms hung loosely at his sides  he did not know what to do with those arms and hands and when to his excited vision one arm seemed liable to brush against the books on the table he lurched away like a frightened horse barely missing the piano stool  he watched the easy walk of the other in front of him and for the first time realized that his walk was different from that of other men  he experienced a momentary pang of shame that he should walk so uncouthly the sweat burst through the skin of his forehead in tiny beads and he paused and mopped his bronzed face with his handkerchief  hold on arthur my boy he said attempting to mask his anxiety with facetious utterance  this is too much all at once for yours truly  give me a chance to get my nerve  you know i didnt want to come an i guess your famly aint hankerin to see me neither  thats all right was the reassuring answer  you mustnt be frightened at us  were just homely peoplehello theres a letter for me  he stepped back to the table tore open the envelope and began to read giving the stranger an opportunity to recover himself  and the stranger understood and appreciated  his was the gift of sympathy understanding and beneath his alarmed exterior that sympathetic process went on  he mopped his forehead dry and glanced about him with a controlled face though in the eyes there was an expression such as wild animals betray when they fear the trap  he was surrounded by the unknown apprehensive of what might happen ignorant of what he should do aware that he walked and bore himself awkwardly fearful that every attribute and power of him was similarly afflicted  he was keenly sensitive hopelessly selfconscious and the amused glance that the other stole privily at him over the top of the letter burned into him like a daggerthrust  he saw the glance but he gave no sign for among the things he had learned was discipline  also that daggerthrust went to his pride  he cursed himself for having come and at the same time resolved that happen what would having come he would carry it through  the lines of his face hardened and into his eyes came a fighting light  he looked about more unconcernedly sharply observant every detail of the pretty interior registering itself on his brain  his eyes were wide apart nothing in their field of vision escaped and as they drank in the beauty before them the fighting light died out and a warm glow took its place  he was responsive to beauty and here was cause to respond  an oil painting caught and held him  a heavy surf thundered and burst over an outjutting rock lowering stormclouds covered the sky and outside the line of surf a pilotschooner closehauled heeled over till every detail of her deck was visible was surging along against a stormy sunset sky  there was beauty and it drew him irresistibly  he forgot his awkward walk and came closer to the painting very close  the beauty faded out of the canvas  his face expressed his bepuzzlement  he stared at what seemed a careless daub of paint then stepped away immediately all the beauty flashed back into the canvas  a trick picture was his thought as he dismissed it though in the midst of the multitudinous impressions he was receiving he found time to feel a prod of indignation that so much beauty should be sacrificed to make a trick he did not know painting  he had been brought up on chromos and lithographs that were always definite and sharp near or far  he had seen oil paintings it was true in the show windows of shops but the glass of the windows had prevented his eager eyes from approaching too near  he glanced around at his friend reading the letter and saw the books on the table  into his eyes leaped a wistfulness and a yearning as promptly as the yearning leaps into the eyes of a starving man at sight of food an impulsive stride with one lurch to right and left of the shoulders brought him to the table where he began affectionately handling the books  he glanced at the titles and the authors names read fragments of text caressing the volumes with his eyes and hands and once recognized a book he had read  for the rest they were strange books and strange authors  he chanced upon a volume of swinburne and began reading steadily forgetful of where he was his face glowing  twice he closed the book on his forefinger to look at the name of the author  swinburne he would remember that name  that fellow had eyes and he had certainly seen color and flashing light  but who was swinburne  was he dead a hundred years or so like most of the poets  or was he alive still and writing  he turned to the titlepage    yes he had written other books well he would go to the free library the first thing in the morning and try to get hold of some of swinburnes stuff  he went back to the text and lost himself  he did not notice that a young woman had entered the room  the first he knew was when he heard arthurs voice saying  ruth this is mr eden  the book was closed on his forefinger and before he turned he was thrilling to the first new impression which was not of the girl but of her brothers words  under that muscled body of his he was a mass of quivering sensibilities  at the slightest impact of the outside world upon his consciousness his thoughts sympathies and emotions leapt and played like lambent flame  he was extraordinarily receptive and responsive while his imagination pitched high was ever at work establishing relations of likeness and difference  mr eden was what he had thrilled tohe who had been called eden or martin eden or just martin all his life  and mister  it was certainly going some was his internal comment  his mind seemed to turn on the instant into a vast camera obscura and he saw arrayed around his consciousness endless pictures from his life of stokeholes and forecastles camps and beaches jails and boozingkens feverhospitals and slum streets wherein the thread of association was the fashion in which he had been addressed in those various situations  and then he turned and saw the girl  the phantasmagoria of his brain vanished at sight of her  she was a pale ethereal creature with wide spiritual blue eyes and a wealth of golden hair  he did not know how she was dressed except that the dress was as wonderful as she  he likened her to a pale gold flower upon a slender stem  no she was a spirit a divinity a goddess such sublimated beauty was not of the earth  or perhaps the books were right and there were many such as she in the upper walks of life  she might well be sung by that chap swinburne perhaps he had had somebody like her in mind when he painted that girl iseult in the book there on the table  all this plethora of sight and feeling and thought occurred on the instant  there was no pause of the realities wherein he moved  he saw her hand coming out to his and she looked him straight in the eyes as she shook hands frankly like a man the women he had known did not shake hands that way  for that matter most of them did not shake hands at all  a flood of associations visions of various ways he had made the acquaintance of women rushed into his mind and threatened to swamp it  but he shook them aside and looked at her  never had he seen such a woman  the women he had known immediately beside her on either hand ranged the women he had known for an eternal second he stood in the midst of a portrait gallery wherein she occupied the central place while about her were limned many women all to be weighed and measured by a fleeting glance herself the unit of weight and measure  he saw the weak and sickly faces of the girls of the factories and the simpering boisterous girls from the south of market  there were women of the cattle camps and swarthy cigarettesmoking women of old mexico  these in turn were crowded out by japanese women dolllike stepping mincingly on wooden clogs by eurasians delicate featured stamped with degeneracy by fullbodied southseaisland women flowercrowned and brownskinned  all these were blotted out by a grotesque and terrible nightmare broodfrowsy shuffling creatures from the pavements of whitechapel ginbloated hags of the stews and all the vast hells following of harpies vilemouthed and filthy that under the guise of monstrous female form prey upon sailors the scrapings of the ports the scum and slime of the human pit  wont you sit down mr eden the girl was saying  i have been looking forward to meeting you ever since arthur told us  it was brave of you  he waved his hand deprecatingly and muttered that it was nothing at all what he had done and that any fellow would have done it  she noticed that the hand he waved was covered with fresh abrasions in the process of healing and a glance at the other loosehanging hand showed it to be in the same condition  also with quick critical eye she noted a scar on his cheek another that peeped out from under the hair of the forehead and a third that ran down and disappeared under the starched collar  she repressed a smile at sight of the red line that marked the chafe of the collar against the bronzed neck  he was evidently unused to stiff collars  likewise her feminine eye took in the clothes he wore the cheap and unaesthetic cut the wrinkling of the coat across the shoulders and the series of wrinkles in the sleeves that advertised bulging biceps muscles  while he waved his hand and muttered that he had done nothing at all he was obeying her behest by trying to get into a chair  he found time to admire the ease with which she sat down then lurched toward a chair facing her overwhelmed with consciousness of the awkward figure he was cutting  this was a new experience for him  all his life up to then he had been unaware of being either graceful or awkward  such thoughts of self had never entered his mind  he sat down gingerly on the edge of the chair greatly worried by his hands  they were in the way wherever he put them  arthur was leaving the room and martin eden followed his exit with longing eyes  he felt lost alone there in the room with that pale spirit of a woman  there was no barkeeper upon whom to call for drinks no small boy to send around the corner for a can of beer and by means of that social fluid start the amenities of friendship flowing  you have such a scar on your neck mr eden the girl was saying  how did it happen  i am sure it must have been some adventure  a mexican with a knife miss he answered moistening his parched lips and clearing hip throat  it was just a fight  after i got the knife away he tried to bite off my nose  baldly as he had stated it in his eyes was a rich vision of that hot starry night at salina cruz the white strip of beach the lights of the sugar steamers in the harbor the voices of the drunken sailors in the distance the jostling stevedores the flaming passion in the mexicans face the glint of the beasteyes in the starlight the sting of the steel in his neck and the rush of blood the crowd and the cries the two bodies his and the mexicans locked together rolling over and over and tearing up the sand and from away off somewhere the mellow tinkling of a guitar  such was the picture and he thrilled to the memory of it wondering if the man could paint it who had painted the pilotschooner on the wall  the white beach the stars and the lights of the sugar steamers would look great he thought and midway on the sand the dark group of figures that surrounded the fighters  the knife occupied a place in the picture he decided and would show well with a sort of gleam in the light of the stars  but of all this no hint had crept into his speech  he tried to bite off my nose he concluded  oh the girl said in a faint far voice and he noticed the shock in her sensitive face  he felt a shock himself and a blush of embarrassment shone faintly on his sunburned cheeks though to him it burned as hotly as when his cheeks had been exposed to the open furnacedoor in the fireroom  such sordid things as stabbing affrays were evidently not fit subjects for conversation with a lady  people in the books in her walk of life did not talk about such thingsperhaps they did not know about them either  there was a brief pause in the conversation they were trying to get started  then she asked tentatively about the scar on his cheek  even as she asked he realized that she was making an effort to talk his talk and he resolved to get away from it and talk hers  it was just an accident he said putting his hand to his cheek  one night in a calm with a heavy sea running the mainboomlift carried away an next the tackle  the lift was wire an it was threshin around like a snake  the whole watch was tryin to grab it an i rushed in an got swatted  oh she said this time with an accent of comprehension though secretly his speech had been so much greek to her and she was wondering what a lift was and what swatted meant  this man swineburne he began attempting to put his plan into execution and pronouncing the i long  who  swineburne he repeated with the same mispronunciation  the poet  swinburne she corrected  yes thats the chap he stammered his cheeks hot again  how long since he died  why i havent heard that he was dead  she looked at him curiously where did you make his acquaintance  i never clapped eyes on him was the reply  but i read some of his poetry out of that book there on the table just before you come in  how do you like his poetry  and thereat she began to talk quickly and easily upon the subject he had suggested  he felt better and settled back slightly from the edge of the chair holding tightly to its arms with his hands as if it might get away from him and buck him to the floor  he had succeeded in making her talk her talk and while she rattled on he strove to follow her marvelling at all the knowledge that was stowed away in that pretty head of hers and drinking in the pale beauty of her face  follow her he did though bothered by unfamiliar words that fell glibly from her lips and by critical phrases and thoughtprocesses that were foreign to his mind but that nevertheless stimulated his mind and set it tingling  here was intellectual life he thought and here was beauty warm and wonderful as he had never dreamed it could be  he forgot himself and stared at her with hungry eyes  here was something to live for to win to to fight foray and die for  the books were true  there were such women in the world  she was one of them  she lent wings to his imagination and great luminous canvases spread themselves before him whereon loomed vague gigantic figures of love and romance and of heroic deeds for womans sakefor a pale woman a flower of gold  and through the swaying palpitant vision as through a fairy mirage he stared at the real woman sitting there and talking of literature and art  he listened as well but he stared unconscious of the fixity of his gaze or of the fact that all that was essentially masculine in his nature was shining in his eyes  but she who knew little of the world of men being a woman was keenly aware of his burning eyes  she had never had men look at her in such fashion and it embarrassed her  she stumbled and halted in her utterance  the thread of argument slipped from her  he frightened her and at the same time it was strangely pleasant to be so looked upon  her training warned her of peril and of wrong subtle mysterious luring while her instincts rang clarionvoiced through her being impelling her to hurdle caste and place and gain to this traveller from another world to this uncouth young fellow with lacerated hands and a line of raw red caused by the unaccustomed linen at his throat who all too evidently was soiled and tainted by ungracious existence  she was clean and her cleanness revolted but she was woman and she was just beginning to learn the paradox of woman  as i was sayingwhat was i saying  she broke off abruptly and laughed merrily at her predicament  you was saying that this man swinburne failed bein a great poet becausean that was as far as you got miss he prompted while to himself he seemed suddenly hungry and delicious little thrills crawled up and down his spine at the sound of her laughter  like silver he thought to himself like tinkling silver bells and on the instant and for an instant he was transported to a far land where under pink cherry blossoms he smoked a cigarette and listened to the bells of the peaked pagoda calling strawsandalled devotees to worship  yes thank you she said  swinburne fails when all is said because he is well indelicate  there are many of his poems that should never be read  every line of the really great poets is filled with beautiful truth and calls to all that is high and noble in the human  not a line of the great poets can be spared without impoverishing the world by that much  i thought it was great he said hesitatingly the little i read  i had no idea he was such aa scoundrel  i guess that crops out in his other books  there are many lines that could be spared from the book you were reading she said her voice primly firm and dogmatic  i must a missed em he announced  what i read was the real goods it was all lighted up an shining an it shun right into me an lighted me up inside like the sun or a searchlight  thats the way it landed on me but i guess i aint up much on poetry miss  he broke off lamely  he was confused painfully conscious of his inarticulateness  he had felt the bigness and glow of life in what he had read but his speech was inadequate  he could not express what he felt and to himself he likened himself to a sailor in a strange ship on a dark night groping about in the unfamiliar running rigging  well he decided it was up to him to get acquainted in this new world  he had never seen anything that he couldnt get the hang of when he wanted to and it was about time for him to want to learn to talk the things that were inside of him so that she could understand  she was bulking large on his horizon  now longfellow she was saying  yes ive read m he broke in impulsively spurred on to exhibit and make the most of his little store of book knowledge desirous of showing her that he was not wholly a stupid clod  the psalm of life excelsior an    i guess thats all  she nodded her head and smiled and he felt somehow that her smile was tolerant pitifully tolerant  he was a fool to attempt to make a pretence that way  that longfellow chap most likely had written countless books of poetry  excuse me miss for buttin in that way  i guess the real facts is that i dont know nothin much about such things  it aint in my class but im goin to make it in my class  it sounded like a threat  his voice was determined his eyes were flashing the lines of his face had grown harsh  and to her it seemed that the angle of his jaw had changed its pitch had become unpleasantly aggressive  at the same time a wave of intense virility seemed to surge out from him and impinge upon her  i think you could make it inin your class she finished with a laugh you are very strong  her gaze rested for a moment on the muscular neck heavy corded almost bulllike bronzed by the sun spilling over with rugged health and strength  and though he sat there blushing and humble again she felt drawn to him  she was surprised by a wanton thought that rushed into her mind  it seemed to her that if she could lay her two hands upon that neck that all its strength and vigor would flow out to her  she was shocked by this thought  it seemed to reveal to her an undreamed depravity in her nature  besides strength to her was a gross and brutish thing  her ideal of masculine beauty had always been slender gracefulness  yet the thought still persisted  it bewildered her that she should desire to place her hands on that sunburned neck  in truth she was far from robust and the need of her body and mind was for strength  but she did not know it  she knew only that no man had ever affected her before as this one had who shocked her from moment to moment with his awful grammar  yes i aint no invalid he said  when it comes down to hardpan i can digest scrapiron  but just now ive got dyspepsia  most of what you was sayin i cant digest  never trained that way you see  i like books and poetry and what time ive had ive read em but ive never thought about em the way you have  thats why i cant talk about em im like a navigator adrift on a strange sea without chart or compass now i want to get my bearins  mebbe you can put me right  how did you learn all this youve ben talkin  by going to school i fancy and by studying she answered  i went to school when i was a kid he began to object  yes but i mean high school and lectures and the university  youve gone to the university he demanded in frank amazement  he felt that she had become remoter from him by at least a million miles  im going there now  im taking special courses in english  he did not know what english meant but he made a mental note of that item of ignorance and passed on  how long would i have to study before i could go to the university he asked  she beamed encouragement upon his desire for knowledge and said that depends upon how much studying you have already done  you have never attended high school  of course not  but did you finish grammar school  i had two years to run when i left he answered  but i was always honorably promoted at school  the next moment angry with himself for the boast he had gripped the arms of the chair so savagely that every fingerend was stinging  at the same moment he became aware that a woman was entering the room  he saw the girl leave her chair and trip swiftly across the floor to the newcomer  they kissed each other and with arms around each others waists they advanced toward him  that must be her mother he thought she was a tall blond woman slender and stately and beautiful  her gown was what he might expect in such a house  his eyes delighted in the graceful lines of it  she and her dress together reminded him of women on the stage  then he remembered seeing similar grand ladies and gowns entering the london theatres while he stood and watched and the policemen shoved him back into the drizzle beyond the awning  next his mind leaped to the grand hotel at yokohama where too from the sidewalk he had seen grand ladies  then the city and the harbor of yokohama in a thousand pictures began flashing before his eyes  but he swiftly dismissed the kaleidoscope of memory oppressed by the urgent need of the present  he knew that he must stand up to be introduced and he struggled painfully to his feet where he stood with trousers bagging at the knees his arms loosehanging and ludicrous his face set hard for the impending ordeal     chapter ii   the process of getting into the dining room was a nightmare to him between halts and stumbles jerks and lurches locomotion had at times seemed impossible  but at last he had made it and was seated alongside of her  the array of knives and forks frightened him  they bristled with unknown perils and he gazed at them fascinated till their dazzle became a background across which moved a succession of forecastle pictures wherein he and his mates sat eating salt beef with sheathknives and fingers or scooping thick peasoup out of pannikins by means of battered iron spoons  the stench of bad beef was in his nostrils while in his ears to the accompaniment of creaking timbers and groaning bulkheads echoed the loud mouthnoises of the eaters  he watched them eating and decided that they ate like pigs  well he would be careful here  he would make no noise  he would keep his mind upon it all the time  he glanced around the table  opposite him was arthur and arthurs brother norman  they were her brothers he reminded himself and his heart warmed toward them  how they loved each other the members of this family  there flashed into his mind the picture of her mother of the kiss of greeting and of the pair of them walking toward him with arms entwined  not in his world were such displays of affection between parents and children made  it was a revelation of the heights of existence that were attained in the world above  it was the finest thing yet that he had seen in this small glimpse of that world  he was moved deeply by appreciation of it and his heart was melting with sympathetic tenderness  he had starved for love all his life  his nature craved love  it was an organic demand of his being  yet he had gone without and hardened himself in the process  he had not known that he needed love  nor did he know it now  he merely saw it in operation and thrilled to it and thought it fine and high and splendid  he was glad that mr morse was not there  it was difficult enough getting acquainted with her and her mother and her brother norman arthur he already knew somewhat  the father would have been too much for him he felt sure  it seemed to him that he had never worked so hard in his life  the severest toil was childs play compared with this  tiny nodules of moisture stood out on his forehead and his shirt was wet with sweat from the exertion of doing so many unaccustomed things at once  he had to eat as he had never eaten before to handle strange tools to glance surreptitiously about and learn how to accomplish each new thing to receive the flood of impressions that was pouring in upon him and being mentally annotated and classified to be conscious of a yearning for her that perturbed him in the form of a dull aching restlessness to feel the prod of desire to win to the walk in life whereon she trod and to have his mind ever and again straying off in speculation and vague plans of how to reach to her  also when his secret glance went across to norman opposite him or to any one else to ascertain just what knife or fork was to be used in any particular occasion that persons features were seized upon by his mind which automatically strove to appraise them and to divine what they wereall in relation to her  then he had to talk to hear what was said to him and what was said back and forth and to answer when it was necessary with a tongue prone to looseness of speech that required a constant curb  and to add confusion to confusion there was the servant an unceasing menace that appeared noiselessly at his shoulder a dire sphinx that propounded puzzles and conundrums demanding instantaneous solution  he was oppressed throughout the meal by the thought of fingerbowls  irrelevantly insistently scores of times he wondered when they would come on and what they looked like  he had heard of such things and now sooner or later somewhere in the next few minutes he would see them sit at table with exalted beings who used themay and he would use them himself  and most important of all far down and yet always at the surface of his thought was the problem of how he should comport himself toward these persons  what should his attitude be  he wrestled continually and anxiously with the problem  there were cowardly suggestions that he should make believe assume a part and there were still more cowardly suggestions that warned him he would fail in such course that his nature was not fitted to live up to it and that he would make a fool of himself  it was during the first part of the dinner struggling to decide upon his attitude that he was very quiet  he did not know that his quietness was giving the lie to arthurs words of the day before when that brother of hers had announced that he was going to bring a wild man home to dinner and for them not to be alarmed because they would find him an interesting wild man  martin eden could not have found it in him just then to believe that her brother could be guilty of such treacheryespecially when he had been the means of getting this particular brother out of an unpleasant row  so he sat at table perturbed by his own unfitness and at the same time charmed by all that went on about him  for the first time he realized that eating was something more than a utilitarian function  he was unaware of what he ate  it was merely food  he was feasting his love of beauty at this table where eating was an aesthetic function  it was an intellectual function too  his mind was stirred  he heard words spoken that were meaningless to him and other words that he had seen only in books and that no man or woman he had known was of large enough mental caliber to pronounce  when he heard such words dropping carelessly from the lips of the members of this marvellous family her family he thrilled with delight  the romance and beauty and high vigor of the books were coming true  he was in that rare and blissful state wherein a man sees his dreams stalk out from the crannies of fantasy and become fact  never had he been at such an altitude of living and he kept himself in the background listening observing and pleasuring replying in reticent monosyllables saying yes miss and no miss to her and yes maam and no maam to her mother  he curbed the impulse arising out of his seatraining to say yes sir and no sir to her brothers  he felt that it would be inappropriate and a confession of inferiority on his partwhich would never do if he was to win to her also it was a dictate of his pride  by god he cried to himself once im just as good as them and if they do know lots that i dont i could learn m a few myself all the same  and the next moment when she or her mother addressed him as mr eden his aggressive pride was forgotten and he was glowing and warm with delight  he was a civilized man that was what he was shoulder to shoulder at dinner with people he had read about in books  he was in the books himself adventuring through the printed pages of bound volumes  but while he belied arthurs description and appeared a gentle lamb rather than a wild man he was racking his brains for a course of action he was no gentle lamb and the part of second fiddle would never do for the highpitched dominance of his nature  he talked only when he had to and then his speech was like his walk to the table filled with jerks and halts as he groped in his polyglot vocabulary for words debating over words he knew were fit but which he feared he could not pronounce rejecting other words he knew would not be understood or would be raw and harsh  but all the time he was oppressed by the consciousness that this carefulness of diction was making a booby of him preventing him from expressing what he had in him  also his love of freedom chafed against the restriction in much the same way his neck chafed against the starched fetter of a collar  besides he was confident that he could not keep it up  he was by nature powerful of thought and sensibility and the creative spirit was restive and urgent  he was swiftly mastered by the concept or sensation in him that struggled in birththroes to receive expression and form and then he forgot himself and where he was and the old wordsthe tools of speech he knewslipped out  once he declined something from the servant who interrupted and pestered at his shoulder and he said shortly and emphatically pew  on the instant those at the table were keyed up and expectant the servant was smugly pleased and he was wallowing in mortification  but he recovered himself quickly  its the kanaka for finish he explained and it just come out naturally  its spelt pau  he caught her curious and speculative eyes fixed on his hands and being in explanatory mood he said  i just come down the coast on one of the pacific mail steamers  she was behind time an around the puget sound ports we worked like niggers storing cargomixed freight if you know what that means  thats how the skin got knocked off  oh it wasnt that she hastened to explain in turn  your hands seemed too small for your body  his cheeks were hot  he took it as an exposure of another of his deficiencies  yes he said depreciatingly  they aint big enough to stand the strain  i can hit like a mule with my arms and shoulders  they are too strong an when i smash a man on the jaw the hands get smashed too  he was not happy at what he had said  he was filled with disgust at himself  he had loosed the guard upon his tongue and talked about things that were not nice  it was brave of you to help arthur the way you didand you a stranger she said tactfully aware of his discomfiture though not of the reason for it  he in turn realized what she had done and in the consequent warm surge of gratefulness that overwhelmed him forgot his looseworded tongue  it wasnt nothin at all he said  any guy ud do it for another that bunch of hoodlums was lookin for trouble an arthur wasnt botherin em none  they butted in on m an then i butted in on them an poked a few  thats where some of the skin off my hands went along with some of the teeth of the gang  i wouldnt a missed it for anything  when i seen  he paused openmouthed on the verge of the pit of his own depravity and utter worthlessness to breathe the same air she did  and while arthur took up the tale for the twentieth time of his adventure with the drunken hoodlums on the ferryboat and of how martin eden had rushed in and rescued him that individual with frowning brows meditated upon the fool he had made of himself and wrestled more determinedly with the problem of how he should conduct himself toward these people  he certainly had not succeeded so far  he wasnt of their tribe and he couldnt talk their lingo was the way he put it to himself  he couldnt fake being their kind  the masquerade would fail and besides masquerade was foreign to his nature  there was no room in him for sham or artifice  whatever happened he must be real  he couldnt talk their talk just yet though in time he would  upon that he was resolved  but in the meantime talk he must and it must be his own talk toned down of course so as to be comprehensible to them and so as not to shook them too much  and furthermore he wouldnt claim not even by tacit acceptance to be familiar with anything that was unfamiliar  in pursuance of this decision when the two brothers talking university shop had used trig several times martin eden demanded  what is trig  trignometry norman said a higher form of math  and what is math was the next question which somehow brought the laugh on norman  mathematics arithmetic was the answer  martin eden nodded  he had caught a glimpse of the apparently illimitable vistas of knowledge  what he saw took on tangibility  his abnormal power of vision made abstractions take on concrete form  in the alchemy of his brain trigonometry and mathematics and the whole field of knowledge which they betokened were transmuted into so much landscape the vistas he saw were vistas of green foliage and forest glades all softly luminous or shot through with flashing lights  in the distance detail was veiled and blurred by a purple haze but behind this purple haze he knew was the glamour of the unknown the lure of romance  it was like wine to him  here was adventure something to do with head and hand a world to conquerand straightway from the back of his consciousness rushed the thought conquering to win to her that lily pale spirit sitting beside him  the glimmering vision was rent asunder and dissipated by arthur who all evening had been trying to draw his wild man out  martin eden remembered his decision  for the first time he became himself consciously and deliberately at first but soon lost in the joy of creating in making life as he knew it appear before his listeners eyes he had been a member of the crew of the smuggling schooner halcyon when she was captured by a revenue cutter  he saw with wide eyes and he could tell what he saw  he brought the pulsing sea before them and the men and the ships upon the sea  he communicated his power of vision till they saw with his eyes what he had seen  he selected from the vast mass of detail with an artists touch drawing pictures of life that glowed and burned with light and color injecting movement so that his listeners surged along with him on the flood of rough eloquence enthusiasm and power  at times he shocked them with the vividness of the narrative and his terms of speech but beauty always followed fast upon the heels of violence and tragedy was relieved by humor by interpretations of the strange twists and quirks of sailors minds  and while he talked the girl looked at him with startled eyes  his fire warmed her  she wondered if she had been cold all her days  she wanted to lean toward this burning blazing man that was like a volcano spouting forth strength robustness and health  she felt that she must lean toward him and resisted by an effort  then too there was the counter impulse to shrink away from him  she was repelled by those lacerated hands grimed by toil so that the very dirt of life was ingrained in the flesh itself by that red chafe of the collar and those bulging muscles his roughness frightened her each roughness of speech was an insult to her ear each rough phase of his life an insult to her soul  and ever and again would come the draw of him till she thought he must be evil to have such power over her  all that was most firmly established in her mind was rocking  his romance and adventure were battering at the conventions  before his facile perils and ready laugh life was no longer an affair of serious effort and restraint but a toy to be played with and turned topsyturvy carelessly to be lived and pleasured in and carelessly to be flung aside  therefore play was the cry that rang through her  lean toward him if so you will and place your two hands upon his neck  she wanted to cry out at the recklessness of the thought and in vain she appraised her own cleanness and culture and balanced all that she was against what he was not  she glanced about her and saw the others gazing at him with rapt attention and she would have despaired had not she seen horror in her mothers eyesfascinated horror it was true but none the less horror  this man from outer darkness was evil  her mother saw it and her mother was right  she would trust her mothers judgment in this as she had always trusted it in all things  the fire of him was no longer warm and the fear of him was no longer poignant  later at the piano she played for him and at him aggressively with the vague intent of emphasizing the impassableness of the gulf that separated them  her music was a club that she swung brutally upon his head and though it stunned him and crushed him down it incited him  he gazed upon her in awe  in his mind as in her own the gulf widened but faster than it widened towered his ambition to win across it  but he was too complicated a plexus of sensibilities to sit staring at a gulf a whole evening especially when there was music  he was remarkably susceptible to music  it was like strong drink firing him to audacities of feelinga drug that laid hold of his imagination and went cloudsoaring through the sky  it banished sordid fact flooded his mind with beauty loosed romance and to its heels added wings  he did not understand the music she played  it was different from the dancehall pianobanging and blatant brass bands he had heard  but he had caught hints of such music from the books and he accepted her playing largely on faith patiently waiting at first for the lifting measures of pronounced and simple rhythm puzzled because those measures were not long continued  just as he caught the swing of them and started his imagination attuned in flight always they vanished away in a chaotic scramble of sounds that was meaningless to him and that dropped his imagination an inert weight back to earth  once it entered his mind that there was a deliberate rebuff in all this he caught her spirit of antagonism and strove to divine the message that her hands pronounced upon the keys  then he dismissed the thought as unworthy and impossible and yielded himself more freely to the music the old delightful condition began to be induced  his feet were no longer clay and his flesh became spirit before his eyes and behind his eyes shone a great glory and then the scene before him vanished and he was away rocking over the world that was to him a very dear world  the known and the unknown were commingled in the dreampageant that thronged his vision  he entered strange ports of sunwashed lands and trod marketplaces among barbaric peoples that no man had ever seen  the scent of the spice islands was in his nostrils as he had known it on warm breathless nights at sea or he beat up against the southeast trades through long tropic days sinking palmtufted coral islets in the turquoise sea behind and lifting palmtufted coral islets in the turquoise sea ahead  swift as thought the pictures came and went  one instant he was astride a broncho and flying through the fairycolored painted desert country the next instant he was gazing down through shimmering heat into the whited sepulchre of death valley or pulling an oar on a freezing ocean where great ice islands towered and glistened in the sun  he lay on a coral beach where the cocoanuts grew down to the mellowsounding surf  the hulk of an ancient wreck burned with blue fires in the light of which danced the hula dancers to the barbaric love calls of the singers who chanted to tinkling ukuleles and rumbling tom toms  it was a sensuous tropic night  in the background a volcano crater was silhouetted against the stars  overhead drifted a pale crescent moon and the southern cross burned low in the sky  he was a harp all life that he had known and that was his consciousness was the strings and the flood of music was a wind that poured against those strings and set them vibrating with memories and dreams  he did not merely feel  sensation invested itself in form and color and radiance and what his imagination dared it objectified in some sublimated and magic way  past present and future mingled and he went on oscillating across the broad warm world through high adventure and noble deeds to heray and with her winning her his arm about her and carrying her on in flight through the empery of his mind  and she glancing at him across her shoulder saw something of all this in his face  it was a transfigured face with great shining eyes that gazed beyond the veil of sound and saw behind it the leap and pulse of life and the gigantic phantoms of the spirit  she was startled  the raw stumbling lout was gone  the illfitting clothes battered hands and sunburned face remained but these seemed the prisonbars through which she saw a great soul looking forth inarticulate and dumb because of those feeble lips that would not give it speech  only for a flashing moment did she see this then she saw the lout returned and she laughed at the whim of her fancy  but the impression of that fleeting glimpse lingered and when the time came for him to beat a stumbling retreat and go she lent him the volume of swinburne and another of browningshe was studying browning in one of her english courses  he seemed such a boy as he stood blushing and stammering his thanks that a wave of pity maternal in its prompting welled up in her  she did not remember the lout nor the imprisoned soul nor the man who had stared at her in all masculineness and delighted and frightened her  she saw before her only a boy who was shaking her hand with a hand so calloused that it felt like a nutmeggrater and rasped her skin and who was saying jerkily  the greatest time of my life  you see i aint used to things     he looked about him helplessly  to people and houses like this  its all new to me and i like it  i hope youll call again she said as he was saying good night to her brothers  he pulled on his cap lurched desperately through the doorway and was gone  well what do you think of him arthur demanded  he is most interesting a whiff of ozone she answered  how old is he  twentyalmost twentyone  i asked him this afternoon  i didnt think he was that young  and i am three years older was the thought in her mind as she kissed her brothers goodnight     chapter iii   as martin eden went down the steps his hand dropped into his coat pocket  it came out with a brown rice paper and a pinch of mexican tobacco which were deftly rolled together into a cigarette  he drew the first whiff of smoke deep into his lungs and expelled it in a long and lingering exhalation  by god he said aloud in a voice of awe and wonder  by god he repeated  and yet again he murmured by god then his hand went to his collar which he ripped out of the shirt and stuffed into his pocket  a cold drizzle was falling but he bared his head to it and unbuttoned his vest swinging along in splendid unconcern he was only dimly aware that it was raining  he was in an ecstasy dreaming dreams and reconstructing the scenes just past  he had met the woman at lastthe woman that he had thought little about not being given to thinking about women but whom he had expected in a remote way he would sometime meet  he had sat next to her at table  he had felt her hand in his he had looked into her eyes and caught a vision of a beautiful spiritbut no more beautiful than the eyes through which it shone nor than the flesh that gave it expression and form  he did not think of her flesh as fleshwhich was new to him for of the women he had known that was the only way he thought  her flesh was somehow different  he did not conceive of her body as a body subject to the ills and frailties of bodies  her body was more than the garb of her spirit  it was an emanation of her spirit a pure and gracious crystallization of her divine essence  this feeling of the divine startled him  it shocked him from his dreams to sober thought  no word no clew no hint of the divine had ever reached him before  he had never believed in the divine  he had always been irreligious scoffing goodnaturedly at the skypilots and their immortality of the soul  there was no life beyond he had contended it was here and now then darkness everlasting  but what he had seen in her eyes was soulimmortal soul that could never die  no man he had known nor any woman had given him the message of immortality  but she had  she had whispered it to him the first moment she looked at him  her face shimmered before his eyes as he walked alongpale and serious sweet and sensitive smiling with pity and tenderness as only a spirit could smile and pure as he had never dreamed purity could be  her purity smote him like a blow  it startled him  he had known good and bad but purity as an attribute of existence had never entered his mind  and now in her he conceived purity to be the superlative of goodness and of cleanness the sum of which constituted eternal life  and promptly urged his ambition to grasp at eternal life  he was not fit to carry water for herhe knew that it was a miracle of luck and a fantastic stroke that had enabled him to see her and be with her and talk with her that night  it was accidental  there was no merit in it  he did not deserve such fortune  his mood was essentially religious  he was humble and meek filled with selfdisparagement and abasement  in such frame of mind sinners come to the penitent form  he was convicted of sin  but as the meek and lowly at the penitent form catch splendid glimpses of their future lordly existence so did he catch similar glimpses of the state he would gain to by possessing her  but this possession of her was dim and nebulous and totally different from possession as he had known it  ambition soared on mad wings and he saw himself climbing the heights with her sharing thoughts with her pleasuring in beautiful and noble things with her  it was a soulpossession he dreamed refined beyond any grossness a free comradeship of spirit that he could not put into definite thought  he did not think it  for that matter he did not think at all  sensation usurped reason and he was quivering and palpitant with emotions he had never known drifting deliciously on a sea of sensibility where feeling itself was exalted and spiritualized and carried beyond the summits of life  he staggered along like a drunken man murmuring fervently aloud by god  by god  a policeman on a street corner eyed him suspiciously then noted his sailor roll  where did you get it the policeman demanded  martin eden came back to earth  his was a fluid organism swiftly adjustable capable of flowing into and filling all sorts of nooks and crannies  with the policemans hail he was immediately his ordinary self grasping the situation clearly  its a beaut aint it he laughed back  i didnt know i was talkin out loud  youll be singing next was the policemans diagnosis  no i wont  gimme a match an ill catch the next car home  he lighted his cigarette said good night and went on  now wouldnt that rattle you he ejaculated under his breath  that copper thought i was drunk  he smiled to himself and meditated  i guess i was he added but i didnt think a womans faced do it  he caught a telegraph avenue car that was going to berkeley  it was crowded with youths and young men who were singing songs and ever and again barking out college yells  he studied them curiously  they were university boys  they went to the same university that she did were in her class socially could know her could see her every day if they wanted to  he wondered that they did not want to that they had been out having a good time instead of being with her that evening talking with her sitting around her in a worshipful and adoring circle  his thoughts wandered on  he noticed one with narrowslitted eyes and a looselipped mouth  that fellow was vicious he decided  on shipboard he would be a sneak a whiner a tattler  he martin eden was a better man than that fellow  the thought cheered him  it seemed to draw him nearer to her he began comparing himself with the students  he grew conscious of the muscled mechanism of his body and felt confident that he was physically their master  but their heads were filled with knowledge that enabled them to talk her talkthe thought depressed him  but what was a brain for he demanded passionately  what they had done he could do  they had been studying about life from the books while he had been busy living life  his brain was just as full of knowledge as theirs though it was a different kind of knowledge  how many of them could tie a lanyard knot or take a wheel or a lookout  his life spread out before him in a series of pictures of danger and daring hardship and toil  he remembered his failures and scrapes in the process of learning  he was that much to the good anyway  later on they would have to begin living life and going through the mill as he had gone  very well  while they were busy with that he could be learning the other side of life from the books  as the car crossed the zone of scattered dwellings that separated oakland from berkeley he kept a lookout for a familiar twostory building along the front of which ran the proud sign higginbothams cash store  martin eden got off at this corner  he stared up for a moment at the sign  it carried a message to him beyond its mere wording  a personality of smallness and egotism and petty underhandedness seemed to emanate from the letters themselves  bernard higginbotham had married his sister and he knew him well  he let himself in with a latchkey and climbed the stairs to the second floor  here lived his brotherinlaw  the grocery was below  there was a smell of stale vegetables in the air  as he groped his way across the hall he stumbled over a toycart left there by one of his numerous nephews and nieces and brought up against a door with a resounding bang  the pincher was his thought too miserly to burn two cents worth of gas and save his boarders necks  he fumbled for the knob and entered a lighted room where sat his sister and bernard higginbotham  she was patching a pair of his trousers while his lean body was distributed over two chairs his feet dangling in dilapidated carpetslippers over the edge of the second chair  he glanced across the top of the paper he was reading showing a pair of dark insincere sharpstaring eyes  martin eden never looked at him without experiencing a sense of repulsion  what his sister had seen in the man was beyond him  the other affected him as so much vermin and always aroused in him an impulse to crush him under his foot  some day ill beat the face off of him was the way he often consoled himself for enduring the mans existence  the eyes weasellike and cruel were looking at him complainingly  well martin demanded  out with it  i had that door painted only last week mr higginbotham half whined half bullied and you know what union wages are  you should be more careful  martin had intended to reply but he was struck by the hopelessness of it  he gazed across the monstrous sordidness of soul to a chromo on the wall  it surprised him  he had always liked it but it seemed that now he was seeing it for the first time  it was cheap that was what it was like everything else in this house  his mind went back to the house he had just left and he saw first the paintings and next her looking at him with melting sweetness as she shook his hand at leaving  he forgot where he was and bernard higginbothams existence till that gentleman demanded  seen a ghost  martin came back and looked at the beady eyes sneering truculent cowardly and there leaped into his vision as on a screen the same eyes when their owner was making a sale in the store belowsubservient eyes smug and oily and flattering  yes martin answered  i seen a ghost  good night  good night gertrude  he started to leave the room tripping over a loose seam in the slatternly carpet  dont bang the door mr higginbotham cautioned him  he felt the blood crawl in his veins but controlled himself and closed the door softly behind him  mr higginbotham looked at his wife exultantly  hes ben drinkin he proclaimed in a hoarse whisper  i told you he would  she nodded her head resignedly  his eyes was pretty shiny she confessed and he didnt have no collar though he went away with one  but mebbe he didnt have moren a couple of glasses  he couldnt stand up straight asserted her husband  i watched him he couldnt walk across the floor without stumblin  you heard m yourself almost fall down in the hall  i think it was over alices cart she said  he couldnt see it in the dark  mr higginbothams voice and wrath began to rise  all day he effaced himself in the store reserving for the evening with his family the privilege of being himself  i tell you that precious brother of yours was drunk  his voice was cold sharp and final his lips stamping the enunciation of each word like the die of a machine  his wife sighed and remained silent  she was a large stout woman always dressed slatternly and always tired from the burdens of her flesh her work and her husband  hes got it in him i tell you from his father mr higginbotham went on accusingly  an hell croak in the gutter the same way  you know that  she nodded sighed and went on stitching  they were agreed that martin had come home drunk  they did not have it in their souls to know beauty or they would have known that those shining eyes and that glowing face betokened youths first vision of love  settin a fine example to the children mr higginbotham snorted suddenly in the silence for which his wife was responsible and which he resented  sometimes he almost wished she would oppose him more  if he does it again hes got to get out  understand  i wont put up with his shinanigandebotchin innocent children with his boozing  mr higginbotham liked the word which was a new one in his vocabulary recently gleaned from a newspaper column  thats what it is debotchinthere aint no other name for it  still his wife sighed shook her head sorrowfully and stitched on  mr higginbotham resumed the newspaper  has he paid last weeks board he shot across the top of the newspaper  she nodded then added he still has some money  when is he goin to sea again  when his paydays spent i guess she answered  he was over to san francisco yesterday looking for a ship  but hes got money yet an hes particular about the kind of ship he signs for  its not for a deckswab like him to put on airs mr higginbotham snorted  particular  him  he said something about a schooner thats gettin ready to go off to some outlandish place to look for buried treasure that hed sail on her if his money held out  if he only wanted to steady down id give him a job drivin the wagon her husband said but with no trace of benevolence in his voice  toms quit  his wife looked alarm and interrogation  quit tonight  is goin to work for carruthers  they paid m moren i could afford  i told you youd lose m she cried out  he was worth moren you was giving him  now look here old woman higginbotham bullied for the thousandth time ive told you to keep your nose out of the business  i wont tell you again  i dont care she sniffled  tom was a good boy  her husband glared at her  this was unqualified defiance  if that brother of yours was worth his salt he could take the wagon he snorted  he pays his board just the same was the retort  an hes my brother an so long as he dont owe you money youve got no right to be jumping on him all the time  ive got some feelings if i have been married to you for seven years  did you tell m youd charge him for gas if he goes on readin in bed he demanded  mrs higginbotham made no reply  her revolt faded away her spirit wilting down into her tired flesh  her husband was triumphant  he had her  his eyes snapped vindictively while his ears joyed in the sniffles she emitted  he extracted great happiness from squelching her and she squelched easily these days though it had been different in the first years of their married life before the brood of children and his incessant nagging had sapped her energy  well you tell m tomorrow thats all he said  an i just want to tell you before i forget it that youd better send for marian tomorrow to take care of the children  with tom quit ill have to be out on the wagon an you can make up your mind to it to be down below waitin on the counter  but tomorrows wash day she objected weakly  get up early then an do it first  i wont start out till ten oclock  he crinkled the paper viciously and resumed his reading     chapter iv   martin eden with blood still crawling from contact with his brotherin law felt his way along the unlighted back hall and entered his room a tiny cubbyhole with space for a bed a washstand and one chair  mr higginbotham was too thrifty to keep a servant when his wife could do the work  besides the servants room enabled them to take in two boarders instead of one  martin placed the swinburne and browning on the chair took off his coat and sat down on the bed  a screeching of asthmatic springs greeted the weight of his body but he did not notice them  he started to take off his shoes but fell to staring at the white plaster wall opposite him broken by long streaks of dirty brown where rain had leaked through the roof  on this befouled background visions began to flow and burn  he forgot his shoes and stared long till his lips began to move and he murmured ruth  ruth  he had not thought a simple sound could be so beautiful  it delighted his ear and he grew intoxicated with the repetition of it ruth  it was a talisman a magic word to conjure with  each time he murmured it her face shimmered before him suffusing the foul wall with a golden radiance  this radiance did not stop at the wall  it extended on into infinity and through its golden depths his soul went questing after hers  the best that was in him was out in splendid flood  the very thought of her ennobled and purified him made him better and made him want to be better  this was new to him  he had never known women who had made him better  they had always had the counter effect of making him beastly  he did not know that many of them had done their best bad as it was  never having been conscious of himself he did not know that he had that in his being that drew love from women and which had been the cause of their reaching out for his youth  though they had often bothered him he had never bothered about them and he would never have dreamed that there were women who had been better because of him always in sublime carelessness had he lived till now and now it seemed to him that they had always reached out and dragged at him with vile hands  this was not just to them nor to himself  but he who for the first time was becoming conscious of himself was in no condition to judge and he burned with shame as he stared at the vision of his infamy  he got up abruptly and tried to see himself in the dirty lookingglass over the washstand  he passed a towel over it and looked again long and carefully  it was the first time he had ever really seen himself his eyes were made for seeing but up to that moment they had been filled with the ever changing panorama of the world at which he had been too busy gazing ever to gaze at himself  he saw the head and face of a young fellow of twenty but being unused to such appraisement he did not know how to value it  above a squaredomed forehead he saw a mop of brown hair nutbrown with a wave to it and hints of curls that were a delight to any woman making hands tingle to stroke it and fingers tingle to pass caresses through it  but he passed it by as without merit in her eyes and dwelt long and thoughtfully on the high square foreheadstriving to penetrate it and learn the quality of its content what kind of a brain lay behind there was his insistent interrogation what was it capable of  how far would it take him  would it take him to her  he wondered if there was soul in those steelgray eyes that were often quite blue of color and that were strong with the briny airs of the sun washed deep  he wondered also how his eyes looked to her  he tried to imagine himself she gazing into those eyes of his but failed in the jugglery  he could successfully put himself inside other mens minds but they had to be men whose ways of life he knew  he did not know her way of life  she was wonder and mystery and how could he guess one thought of hers  well they were honest eyes he concluded and in them was neither smallness nor meanness  the brown sunburn of his face surprised him  he had not dreamed he was so black  he rolled up his shirtsleeve and compared the white underside if the arm with his face yes he was a white man after all  but the arms were sunburned too  he twisted his arm rolled the biceps over with his other hand and gazed underneath where he was least touched by the sun  it was very white  he laughed at his bronzed face in the glass at the thought that it was once as white as the underside of his arm nor did he dream that in the world there were few pale spirits of women who could boast fairer or smoother skins than hefairer than where he had escaped the ravages of the sun  his might have been a cherubs mouth had not the full sensuous lips a trick under stress of drawing firmly across the teeth  at times so tightly did they draw the mouth became stern and harsh even ascetic they were the lips of a fighter and of a lover  they could taste the sweetness of life with relish and they could put the sweetness aside and command life  the chin and jaw strong and just hinting of square aggressiveness helped the lips to command life  strength balanced sensuousness and had upon it a tonic effect compelling him to love beauty that was healthy and making him vibrate to sensations that were wholesome  and between the lips were teeth that had never known nor needed the dentists care  they were white and strong and regular he decided as he looked at them  but as he looked he began to be troubled  somewhere stored away in the recesses of his mind and vaguely remembered was the impression that there were people who washed their teeth every day  they were the people from up abovepeople in her class  she must wash her teeth every day too  what would she think if she learned that he had never washed his teeth in all the days of his life  he resolved to get a toothbrush and form the habit  he would begin at once tomorrow  it was not by mere achievement that he could hope to win to her  he must make a personal reform in all things even to toothwashing and neckgear though a starched collar affected him as a renunciation of freedom  he held up his hand rubbing the ball of the thumb over the calloused palm and gazing at the dirt that was ingrained in the flesh itself and which no brush could scrub away  how different was her palm  he thrilled deliciously at the remembrance  like a rosepetal he thought cool and soft as a snowflake  he had never thought that a mere womans hand could be so sweetly soft  he caught himself imagining the wonder of a caress from such a hand and flushed guiltily  it was too gross a thought for her  in ways it seemed to impugn her high spirituality  she was a pale slender spirit exalted far beyond the flesh but nevertheless the softness of her palm persisted in his thoughts  he was used to the harsh callousness of factory girls and working women  well he knew why their hands were rough but this hand of hers    it was soft because she had never used it to work with  the gulf yawned between her and him at the awesome thought of a person who did not have to work for a living  he suddenly saw the aristocracy of the people who did not labor  it towered before him on the wall a figure in brass arrogant and powerful  he had worked himself his first memories seemed connected with work and all his family had worked  there was gertrude  when her hands were not hard from the endless housework they were swollen and red like boiled beef what of the washing  and there was his sister marian she had worked in the cannery the preceding summer and her slim pretty hands were all scarred with the tomatoknives  besides the tips of two of her fingers had been left in the cutting machine at the paperbox factory the preceding winter  he remembered the hard palms of his mother as she lay in her coffin  and his father had worked to the last fading gasp the horned growth on his hands must have been half an inch thick when he died  but her hands were soft and her mothers hands and her brothers  this last came to him as a surprise it was tremendously indicative of the highness of their caste of the enormous distance that stretched between her and him  he sat back on the bed with a bitter laugh and finished taking off his shoes  he was a fool he had been made drunken by a womans face and by a womans soft white hands  and then suddenly before his eyes on the foul plasterwall appeared a vision  he stood in front of a gloomy tenement house  it was nighttime in the east end of london and before him stood margey a little factory girl of fifteen  he had seen her home after the beanfeast  she lived in that gloomy tenement a place not fit for swine  his hand was going out to hers as he said good night  she had put her lips up to be kissed but he wasnt going to kiss her somehow he was afraid of her  and then her hand closed on his and pressed feverishly  he felt her callouses grind and grate on his and a great wave of pity welled over him  he saw her yearning hungry eyes and her illfed female form which had been rushed from childhood into a frightened and ferocious maturity then he put his arms about her in large tolerance and stooped and kissed her on the lips  her glad little cry rang in his ears and he felt her clinging to him like a cat  poor little starveling  he continued to stare at the vision of what had happened in the long ago  his flesh was crawling as it had crawled that night when she clung to him and his heart was warm with pity  it was a gray scene greasy gray and the rain drizzled greasily on the pavement stones  and then a radiant glory shone on the wall and up through the other vision displacing it glimmered her pale face under its crown of golden hair remote and inaccessible as a star  he took the browning and the swinburne from the chair and kissed them just the same she told me to call again he thought  he took another look at himself in the glass and said aloud with great solemnity  martin eden the first thing tomorrow you go to the free library an read up on etiquette  understand  he turned off the gas and the springs shrieked under his body  but youve got to quit cussin martin old boy youve got to quit cussin he said aloud  then he dozed off to sleep and to dream dreams that for madness and audacity rivalled those of poppyeaters     chapter v   he awoke next morning from rosy scenes of dream to a steamy atmosphere that smelled of soapsuds and dirty clothes and that was vibrant with the jar and jangle of tormented life  as he came out of his room he heard the slosh of water a sharp exclamation and a resounding smack as his sister visited her irritation upon one of her numerous progeny  the squall of the child went through him like a knife  he was aware that the whole thing the very air he breathed was repulsive and mean  how different he thought from the atmosphere of beauty and repose of the house wherein ruth dwelt  there it was all spiritual  here it was all material and meanly material  come here alfred he called to the crying child at the same time thrusting his hand into his trousers pocket where he carried his money loose in the same large way that he lived life in general  he put a quarter in the youngsters hand and held him in his arms a moment soothing his sobs  now run along and get some candy and dont forget to give some to your brothers and sisters  be sure and get the kind that lasts longest  his sister lifted a flushed face from the washtub and looked at him  a nickeld ha ben enough she said  its just like you no idea of the value of money  the childll eat himself sick  thats all right sis he answered jovially  my moneyll take care of itself  if you werent so busy id kiss you good morning  he wanted to be affectionate to this sister who was good and who in her way he knew loved him  but somehow she grew less herself as the years went by and more and more baffling  it was the hard work the many children and the nagging of her husband he decided that had changed her  it came to him in a flash of fancy that her nature seemed taking on the attributes of stale vegetables smelly soapsuds and of the greasy dimes nickels and quarters she took in over the counter of the store  go along an get your breakfast she said roughly though secretly pleased  of all her wandering brood of brothers he had always been her favorite  i declare i will kiss you she said with a sudden stir at her heart  with thumb and forefinger she swept the dripping suds first from one arm and then from the other  he put his arms round her massive waist and kissed her wet steamy lips the tears welled into her eyesnot so much from strength of feeling as from the weakness of chronic overwork  she shoved him away from her but not before he caught a glimpse of her moist eyes  youll find breakfast in the oven she said hurriedly  jim ought to be up now  i had to get up early for the washing  now get along with you and get out of the house early  it wont be nice today what of tom quittin an nobody but bernard to drive the wagon  martin went into the kitchen with a sinking heart the image of her red face and slatternly form eating its way like acid into his brain  she might love him if she only had some time he concluded  but she was worked to death  bernard higginbotham was a brute to work her so hard but he could not help but feel on the other hand that there had not been anything beautiful in that kiss  it was true it was an unusual kiss  for years she had kissed him only when he returned from voyages or departed on voyages but this kiss had tasted soapsuds and the lips he had noticed were flabby  there had been no quick vigorous lippressure such as should accompany any kiss  hers was the kiss of a tired woman who had been tired so long that she had forgotten how to kiss  he remembered her as a girl before her marriage when she would dance with the best all night after a hard days work at the laundry and think nothing of leaving the dance to go to another days hard work  and then he thought of ruth and the cool sweetness that must reside in her lips as it resided in all about her  her kiss would be like her handshake or the way she looked at one firm and frank  in imagination he dared to think of her lips on his and so vividly did he imagine that he went dizzy at the thought and seemed to rift through clouds of rosepetals filling his brain with their perfume  in the kitchen he found jim the other boarder eating mush very languidly with a sick faraway look in his eyes  jim was a plumbers apprentice whose weak chin and hedonistic temperament coupled with a certain nervous stupidity promised to take him nowhere in the race for bread and butter  why dont you eat he demanded as martin dipped dolefully into the cold halfcooked oatmeal mush  was you drunk again last night  martin shook his head  he was oppressed by the utter squalidness of it all  ruth morse seemed farther removed than ever  i was jim went on with a boastful nervous giggle  i was loaded right to the neck  oh she was a daisy  billy brought me home  martin nodded that he heardit was a habit of nature with him to pay heed to whoever talked to himand poured a cup of lukewarm coffee  goin to the lotus club dance tonight jim demanded  theyre goin to have beer an if that temescal bunch comes therell be a roughhouse  i dont care though  im takin my lady friend just the same  cripes but ive got a taste in my mouth  he made a wry face and attempted to wash the taste away with coffee  dye know julia  martin shook his head  shes my lady friend jim explained and shes a peach  id introduce you to her only youd win her  i dont see what the girls see in you honest i dont but the way you win them away from the fellers is sickenin  i never got any away from you martin answered uninterestedly  the breakfast had to be got

answer  you mean makin blieve you dont care about them jim queried eagerly  martin considered for a moment then answered perhaps that will do but with me i guess its different  i never have caredmuch  if you can put it on its all right most likely  you should a ben up at rileys barn last night jim announced inconsequently  a lot of the fellers put on the gloves  there was a peach from west oakland  they called m the rat  slick as silk  no one could touch m  we was all wishin you was there  where was you anyway  down in oakland martin replied  to the show  martin shoved his plate away and got up  comin to the dance tonight the other called after him  no i think not he answered  he went downstairs and out into the street breathing great breaths of air  he had been suffocating in that atmosphere while the apprentices chatter had driven him frantic  there had been times when it was all he could do to refrain from reaching over and mopping jims face in the mush plate  the more he had chattered the more remote had ruth seemed to him  how could he herding with such cattle ever become worthy of her he was appalled at the problem confronting him weighted down by the incubus of his workingclass station  everything reached out to hold him downhis sister his sisters house and family jim the apprentice everybody he knew every tie of life  existence did not taste good in his mouth  up to then he had accepted existence as he had lived it with all about him as a good thing  he had never questioned it except when he read books but then they were only books fairy stories of a fairer and impossible world  but now he had seen that world possible and real with a flower of a woman called ruth in the midmost centre of it and thenceforth he must know bitter tastes and longings sharp as pain and hopelessness that tantalized because it fed on hope  he had debated between the berkeley free library and the oakland free library and decided upon the latter because ruth lived in oakland  who could tella library was a most likely place for her and he might see her there  he did not know the way of libraries and he wandered through endless rows of fiction till the delicatefeatured frenchlooking girl who seemed in charge told him that the reference department was upstairs  he did not know enough to ask the man at the desk and began his adventures in the philosophy alcove  he had heard of book philosophy but had not imagined there had been so much written about it the high bulging shelves of heavy tomes humbled him and at the same time stimulated him  here was work for the vigor of his brain  he found books on trigonometry in the mathematics section and ran the pages and stared at the meaningless formulas and figures  he could read english but he saw there an alien speech  norman and arthur knew that speech  he had heard them talking it  and they were her brothers  he left the alcove in despair  from every side the books seemed to press upon him and crush him  he had never dreamed that the fund of human knowledge bulked so big  he was frightened  how could his brain ever master it all  later he remembered that there were other men many men who had mastered it and he breathed a great oath passionately under his breath swearing that his brain could do what theirs had done  and so he wandered on alternating between depression and elation as he stared at the shelves packed with wisdom  in one miscellaneous section he came upon a norries epitome  he turned the pages reverently  in a way it spoke a kindred speech  both he and it were of the sea  then he found a bowditch and books by lecky and marshall  there it was he would teach himself navigation  he would quit drinking work up and become a captain  ruth seemed very near to him in that moment  as a captain he could marry her if she would have him  and if she wouldnt wellhe would live a good life among men because of her and he would quit drinking anyway  then he remembered the underwriters and the owners the two masters a captain must serve either of which could and would break him and whose interests were diametrically opposed  he cast his eyes about the room and closed the lids down on a vision of ten thousand books  no no more of the sea for him  there was power in all that wealth of books and if he would do great things he must do them on the land  besides captains were not allowed to take their wives to sea with them  noon came and afternoon  he forgot to eat and sought on for the books on etiquette for in addition to career his mind was vexed by a simple and very concrete problem when you meet a young lady and she asks you to call how soon can you call was the way he worded it to himself  but when he found the right shelf he sought vainly for the answer  he was appalled at the vast edifice of etiquette and lost himself in the mazes of visitingcard conduct between persons in polite society  he abandoned his search  he had not found what he wanted though he had found that it would take all of a mans time to be polite and that he would have to live a preliminary life in which to learn how to be polite  did you find what you wanted the man at the desk asked him as he was leaving  yes sir he answered  you have a fine library here  the man nodded  we should be glad to see you here often  are you a sailor  yes sir he answered  and ill come again  now how did he know that he asked himself as he went down the stairs  and for the first block along the street he walked very stiff and straight and awkwardly until he forgot himself in his thoughts whereupon his rolling gait gracefully returned to him     chapter vi   a terrible restlessness that was akin to hunger afflicted martin eden  he was famished for a sight of the girl whose slender hands had gripped his life with a giants grasp  he could not steel himself to call upon her he was afraid that he might call too soon and so be guilty of an awful breach of that awful thing called etiquette  he spent long hours in the oakland and berkeley libraries and made out application blanks for membership for himself his sisters gertrude and marian and jim the latters consent being obtained at the expense of several glasses of beer  with four cards permitting him to draw books he burned the gas late in the servants room and was charged fifty cents a week for it by mr higginbotham  the many books he read but served to whet his unrest  every page of every book was a peephole into the realm of knowledge  his hunger fed upon what he read and increased  also he did not know where to begin and continually suffered from lack of preparation  the commonest references that he could see plainly every reader was expected to know he did not know  and the same was true of the poetry he read which maddened him with delight  he read more of swinburne than was contained in the volume ruth had lent him and dolores he understood thoroughly but surely ruth did not understand it he concluded  how could she living the refined life she did  then he chanced upon kiplings poems and was swept away by the lilt and swing and glamour with which familiar things had been invested  he was amazed at the mans sympathy with life and at his incisive psychology  psychology was a new word in martins vocabulary  he had bought a dictionary which deed had decreased his supply of money and brought nearer the day on which he must sail in search of more  also it incensed mr higginbotham who would have preferred the money taking the form of board  he dared not go near ruths neighborhood in the daytime but night found him lurking like a thief around the morse home stealing glimpses at the windows and loving the very walls that sheltered her  several times he barely escaped being caught by her brothers and once he trailed mr morse down town and studied his face in the lighted streets longing all the while for some quick danger of death to threaten so that he might spring in and save her father  on another night his vigil was rewarded by a glimpse of ruth through a secondstory window  he saw only her head and shoulders and her arms raised as she fixed her hair before a mirror it was only for a moment but it was a long moment to him during which his blood turned to wine and sang through his veins  then she pulled down the shade  but it was her roomhe had learned that and thereafter he strayed there often hiding under a dark tree on the opposite side of the street and smoking countless cigarettes  one afternoon he saw her mother coming out of a bank and received another proof of the enormous distance that separated ruth from him  she was of the class that dealt with banks  he had never been inside a bank in his life and he had an idea that such institutions were frequented only by the very rich and the very powerful  in one way he had undergone a moral revolution  her cleanness and purity had reacted upon him and he felt in his being a crying need to be clean  he must be that if he were ever to be worthy of breathing the same air with her  he washed his teeth and scrubbed his hands with a kitchen scrubbrush till he saw a nailbrush in a drugstore window and divined its use  while purchasing it the clerk glanced at his nails suggested a nailfile and so he became possessed of an additional toilet tool  he ran across a book in the library on the care of the body and promptly developed a penchant for a coldwater bath every morning much to the amazement of jim and to the bewilderment of mr higginbotham who was not in sympathy with such highfangled notions and who seriously debated whether or not he should charge martin extra for the water another stride was in the direction of creased trousers  now that martin was aroused in such matters he swiftly noted the difference between the baggy knees of the trousers worn by the working class and the straight line from knee to foot of those worn by the men above the working class also he learned the reason why and invaded his sisters kitchen in search of irons and ironingboard  he had misadventures at first hopelessly burning one pair and buying another which expenditure again brought nearer the day on which he must put to sea  but the reform went deeper than mere outward appearance  he still smoked but he drank no more  up to that time drinking had seemed to him the proper thing for men to do and he had prided himself on his strong head which enabled him to drink most men under the table  whenever he encountered a chance shipmate and there were many in san francisco he treated them and was treated in turn as of old but he ordered for himself root beer or ginger ale and goodnaturedly endured their chaffing  and as they waxed maudlin he studied them watching the beast rise and master them and thanking god that he was no longer as they  they had their limitations to forget and when they were drunk their dim stupid spirits were even as gods and each ruled in his heaven of intoxicated desire  with martin the need for strong drink had vanished he was drunken in new and more profound wayswith ruth who had fired him with love and with a glimpse of higher and eternal life with books that had set a myriad maggots of desire gnawing in his brain and with the sense of personal cleanliness he was achieving that gave him even more superb health than what he had enjoyed and that made his whole body sing with physical wellbeing  one night he went to the theatre on the blind chance that he might see her there and from the second balcony he did see her  he saw her come down the aisle with arthur and a strange young man with a football mop of hair and eyeglasses the sight of whom spurred him to instant apprehension and jealousy  he saw her take her seat in the orchestra circle and little else than her did he see that nighta pair of slender white shoulders and a mass of pale gold hair dim with distance  but there were others who saw and now and again glancing at those about him he noted two young girls who looked back from the row in front a dozen seats along and who smiled at him with bold eyes  he had always been easygoing  it was not in his nature to give rebuff  in the old days he would have smiled back and gone further and encouraged smiling but now it was different  he did smile back then looked away and looked no more deliberately  but several times forgetting the existence of the two girls his eyes caught their smiles  he could not rethumb himself in a day nor could he violate the intrinsic kindliness of his nature so at such moments he smiled at the girls in warm human friendliness  it was nothing new to him  he knew they were reaching out their womans hands to him  but it was different now  far down there in the orchestra circle was the one woman in all the world so different so terrifically different from these two girls of his class that he could feel for them only pity and sorrow  he had it in his heart to wish that they could possess in some small measure her goodness and glory  and not for the world could he hurt them because of their outreaching  he was not flattered by it he even felt a slight shame at his lowliness that permitted it  he knew did he belong in ruths class that there would be no overtures from these girls and with each glance of theirs he felt the fingers of his own class clutching at him to hold him down  he left his seat before the curtain went down on the last act intent on seeing her as she passed out  there were always numbers of men who stood on the sidewalk outside and he could pull his cap down over his eyes and screen himself behind some ones shoulder so that she should not see him he emerged from the theatre with the first of the crowd but scarcely had he taken his position on the edge of the sidewalk when the two girls appeared  they were looking for him he knew and for the moment he could have cursed that in him which drew women  their casual edging across the sidewalk to the curb as they drew near apprised him of discovery  they slowed down and were in the thick of the crown as they came up with him  one of them brushed against him and apparently for the first time noticed him  she was a slender dark girl with black defiant eyes  but they smiled at him and he smiled back  hello he said  it was automatic he had said it so often before under similar circumstances of first meetings  besides he could do no less  there was that large tolerance and sympathy in his nature that would permit him to do no less  the blackeyed girl smiled gratification and greeting and showed signs of stopping while her companion arm linked in arm giggled and likewise showed signs of halting  he thought quickly  it would never do for her to come out and see him talking there with them quite naturally as a matter of course he swung in alongside the dark eyed one and walked with her  there was no awkwardness on his part no numb tongue  he was at home here and he held his own royally in the badinage bristling with slang and sharpness that was always the preliminary to getting acquainted in these swiftmoving affairs  at the corner where the main stream of people flowed onward he started to edge out into the cross street  but the girl with the black eyes caught his arm following him and dragging her companion after her as she cried  hold on bill  whats yer rush  youre not goin to shake us so sudden as all that  he halted with a laugh and turned facing them  across their shoulders he could see the moving throng passing under the street lamps  where he stood it was not so light and unseen he would be able to see her as she passed by  she would certainly pass by for that way led home  whats her name he asked of the giggling girl nodding at the dark eyed one  you ask her was the convulsed response  well what is it he demanded turning squarely on the girl in question  you aint told me yours yet she retorted  you never asked it he smiled  besides you guessed the first rattle its bill all right all right  aw go long with you  she looked him in the eyes her own sharply passionate and inviting  what is it honest  again she looked  all the centuries of woman since sex began were eloquent in her eyes  and he measured her in a careless way and knew bold now that she would begin to retreat coyly and delicately as he pursued ever ready to reverse the game should he turn fainthearted  and too he was human and could feel the draw of her while his ego could not but appreciate the flattery of her kindness  oh he knew it all and knew them well from a to z  good as goodness might be measured in their particular class hardworking for meagre wages and scorning the sale of self for easier ways nervously desirous for some small pinch of happiness in the desert of existence and facing a future that was a gamble between the ugliness of unending toil and the black pit of more terrible wretchedness the way whereto being briefer though better paid  bill he answered nodding his head  sure pete bill an no other  no joshin she queried  it aint bill at all the other broke in  how do you know he demanded  you never laid eyes on me before  no need to to know youre lyin was the retort  straight bill what is it the first girl asked  billll do he confessed  she reached out to his arm and shook him playfully  i knew you was lyin but you look good to me just the same  he captured the hand that invited and felt on the palm familiar markings and distortions  whend you chuck the cannery he asked  howd yeh know and my aint cheh a mindreader the girls chorussed  and while he exchanged the stupidities of stupid minds with them before his inner sight towered the bookshelves of the library filled with the wisdom of the ages  he smiled bitterly at the incongruity of it and was assailed by doubts  but between inner vision and outward pleasantry he found time to watch the theatre crowd streaming by  and then he saw her under the lights between her brother and the strange young man with glasses and his heart seemed to stand still  he had waited long for this moment  he had time to note the light fluffy something that hid her queenly head the tasteful lines of her wrapped figure the gracefulness of her carriage and of the hand that caught up her skirts and then she was gone and he was left staring at the two girls of the cannery at their tawdry attempts at prettiness of dress their tragic efforts to be clean and trim the cheap cloth the cheap ribbons and the cheap rings on the fingers  he felt a tug at his arm and heard a voice saying  wake up bill  whats the matter with you  what was you sayin he asked  oh nothin the dark girl answered with a toss of her head  i was only remarkin  what  well i was whisperin itd be a good idea if you could dig up a gentleman friendfor her indicating her companion and then we could go off an have icecream soda somewhere or coffee or anything  he was afflicted by a sudden spiritual nausea  the transition from ruth to this had been too abrupt  ranged side by side with the bold defiant eyes of the girl before him he saw ruths clear luminous eyes like a saints gazing at him out of unplumbed depths of purity  and somehow he felt within him a stir of power  he was better than this  life meant more to him than it meant to these two girls whose thoughts did not go beyond icecream and a gentleman friend  he remembered that he had led always a secret life in his thoughts  these thoughts he had tried to share but never had he found a woman capable of understandingnor a man  he had tried at times but had only puzzled his listeners  and as his thoughts had been beyond them so he argued now he must be beyond them  he felt power move in him and clenched his fists  if life meant more to him then it was for him to demand more from life but he could not demand it from such companionship as this  those bold black eyes had nothing to offer  he knew the thoughts behind themof icecream and of something else  but those saints eyes alongsidethey offered all he knew and more than he could guess  they offered books and painting beauty and repose and all the fine elegance of higher existence  behind those black eyes he knew every thought process  it was like clockwork he could watch every wheel go around  their bid was low pleasure narrow as the grave that palled and the grave was at the end of it  but the bid of the saints eyes was mystery and wonder unthinkable and eternal life  he had caught glimpses of the soul in them and glimpses of his own soul too  theres only one thing wrong with the programme he said aloud  ive got a date already  the girls eyes blazed her disappointment  to sit up with a sick friend i suppose she sneered  no a real honest date with he faltered with a girl  youre not stringin me she asked earnestly  he looked her in the eyes and answered its straight all right  but why cant we meet some other time  you aint told me your name yet  an where dye live  lizzie she replied softening toward him her hand pressing his arm while her body leaned against his  lizzie connolly  and i live at fifth an market  he talked on a few minutes before saying good night  he did not go home immediately and under the tree where he kept his vigils he looked up at a window and murmured that date was with you ruth  i kept it for you     chapter vii   a week of heavy reading had passed since the evening he first met ruth morse and still he dared not call  time and again he nerved himself up to call but under the doubts that assailed him his determination died away  he did not know the proper time to call nor was there any one to tell him and he was afraid of committing himself to an irretrievable blunder  having shaken himself free from his old companions and old ways of life and having no new companions nothing remained for him but to read and the long hours he devoted to it would have ruined a dozen pairs of ordinary eyes  but his eyes were strong and they were backed by a body superbly strong  furthermore his mind was fallow  it had lain fallow all his life so far as the abstract thought of the books was concerned and it was ripe for the sowing  it had never been jaded by study and it bit hold of the knowledge in the books with sharp teeth that would not let go  it seemed to him by the end of the week that he had lived centuries so far behind were the old life and outlook  but he was baffled by lack of preparation  he attempted to read books that required years of preliminary specialization  one day he would read a book of antiquated philosophy and the next day one that was ultramodern so that his head would be whirling with the conflict and contradiction of ideas  it was the same with the economists  on the one shelf at the library he found karl marx ricardo adam smith and mill and the abstruse formulas of the one gave no clew that the ideas of another were obsolete  he was bewildered and yet he wanted to know  he had become interested in a day in economics industry and politics  passing through the city hall park he had noticed a group of men in the centre of which were half a dozen with flushed faces and raised voices earnestly carrying on a discussion  he joined the listeners and heard a new alien tongue in the mouths of the philosophers of the people  one was a tramp another was a labor agitator a third was a lawschool student and the remainder was composed of wordy workingmen  for the first time he heard of socialism anarchism and single tax and learned that there were warring social philosophies  he heard hundreds of technical words that were new to him belonging to fields of thought that his meagre reading had never touched upon  because of this he could not follow the arguments closely and he could only guess at and surmise the ideas wrapped up in such strange expressions  then there was a blackeyed restaurant waiter who was a theosophist a union baker who was an agnostic an old man who baffled all of them with the strange philosophy that what is is right and another old man who discoursed interminably about the cosmos and the fatheratom and the motheratom  martin edens head was in a state of addlement when he went away after several hours and he hurried to the library to look up the definitions of a dozen unusual words  and when he left the library he carried under his arm four volumes madam blavatskys secret doctrine progress and poverty the quintessence of socialism and warfare of religion and science  unfortunately he began on the secret doctrine  every line bristled with manysyllabled words he did not understand  he sat up in bed and the dictionary was in front of him more often than the book  he looked up so many new words that when they recurred he had forgotten their meaning and had to look them up again  he devised the plan of writing the definitions in a notebook and filled page after page with them  and still he could not understand  he read until three in the morning and his brain was in a turmoil but not one essential thought in the text had he grasped  he looked up and it seemed that the room was lifting heeling and plunging like a ship upon the sea  then he hurled the secret doctrine and many curses across the room turned off the gas and composed himself to sleep  nor did he have much better luck with the other three books  it was not that his brain was weak or incapable it could think these thoughts were it not for lack of training in thinking and lack of the thoughttools with which to think  he guessed this and for a while entertained the idea of reading nothing but the dictionary until he had mastered every word in it  poetry however was his solace and he read much of it finding his greatest joy in the simpler poets who were more understandable  he loved beauty and there he found beauty  poetry like music stirred him profoundly and though he did not know it he was preparing his mind for the heavier work that was to come  the pages of his mind were blank and without effort much he read and liked stanza by stanza was impressed upon those pages so that he was soon able to extract great joy from chanting aloud or under his breath the music and the beauty of the printed words he had read  then he stumbled upon gayleys classic myths and bulfinchs age of fable side by side on a library shelf  it was illumination a great light in the darkness of his ignorance and he read poetry more avidly than ever  the man at the desk in the library had seen martin there so often that he had become quite cordial always greeting him with a smile and a nod when he entered  it was because of this that martin did a daring thing drawing out some books at the desk and while the man was stamping the cards martin blurted out  say theres something id like to ask you  the man smiled and paid attention  when you meet a young lady an she asks you to call how soon can you call  martin felt his shirt press and cling to his shoulders what of the sweat of the effort  why id say any time the man answered  yes but this is different martin objected  sheiwell you see its this way maybe she wont be there  she goes to the university  then call again  what i said aint what i meant martin confessed falteringly while he made up his mind to throw himself wholly upon the others mercy  im just a rough sort of a fellow an i aint never seen anything of society  this girl is all that i aint an i aint anything that she is  you dont think im playin the fool do you he demanded abruptly  no no not at all i assure you the other protested  your request is not exactly in the scope of the reference department but i shall be only too pleased to assist you  martin looked at him admiringly  if i could tear it off that way id be all right he said  i beg pardon  i mean if i could talk easy that way an polite an all the rest  oh said the other with comprehension  what is the best time to call  the afternoonnot too close to meal time  or the evening  or sunday  ill tell you the librarian said with a brightening face  you call her up on the telephone and find out  ill do it he said picking up his books and starting away  he turned back and asked  when youre speakin to a young ladysay for instance miss lizzie smithdo you say miss lizzie or miss smith  say miss smith the librarian stated authoritatively  say miss smith alwaysuntil you come to know her better  so it was that martin eden solved the problem  come down any time ill be at home all afternoon was ruths reply over the telephone to his stammered request as to when he could return the borrowed books  she met him at the door herself and her womans eyes took in immediately the creased trousers and the certain slight but indefinable change in him for the better  also she was struck by his face  it was almost violent this health of his and it seemed to rush out of him and at her in waves of force  she felt the urge again of the desire to lean toward him for warmth and marvelled again at the effect his presence produced upon her  and he in turn knew again the swimming sensation of bliss when he felt the contact of her hand in greeting  the difference between them lay in that she was cool and selfpossessed while his face flushed to the roots of the hair  he stumbled with his old awkwardness after her and his shoulders swung and lurched perilously  once they were seated in the livingroom he began to get on easilymore easily by far than he had expected  she made it easy for him and the gracious spirit with which she did it made him love her more madly than ever  they talked first of the borrowed books of the swinburne he was devoted to and of the browning he did not understand and she led the conversation on from subject to subject while she pondered the problem of how she could be of help to him  she had thought of this often since their first meeting  she wanted to help him  he made a call upon her pity and tenderness that no one had ever made before and the pity was not so much derogatory of him as maternal in her  her pity could not be of the common sort when the man who drew it was so much man as to shock her with maidenly fears and set her mind and pulse thrilling with strange thoughts and feelings  the old fascination of his neck was there and there was sweetness in the thought of laying her hands upon it  it seemed still a wanton impulse but she had grown more used to it  she did not dream that in such guise newborn love would epitomize itself nor did she dream that the feeling he excited in her was love  she thought she was merely interested in him as an unusual type possessing various potential excellencies and she even felt philanthropic about it  she did not know she desired him but with him it was different  he knew that he loved her and he desired her as he had never before desired anything in his life  he had loved poetry for beautys sake but since he met her the gates to the vast field of lovepoetry had been opened wide  she had given him understanding even more than bulfinch and gayley  there was a line that a week before he would not have favored with a second thoughtgods own mad lover dying on a kiss but now it was ever insistent in his mind  he marvelled at the wonder of it and the truth and as he gazed upon her he knew that he could die gladly upon a kiss  he felt himself gods own mad lover and no accolade of knighthood could have given him greater pride  and at last he knew the meaning of life and why he had been born  as he gazed at her and listened his thoughts grew daring  he reviewed all the wild delight of the pressure of her hand in his at the door and longed for it again  his gaze wandered often toward her lips and he yearned for them hungrily  but there was nothing gross or earthly about this yearning  it gave him exquisite delight to watch every movement and play of those lips as they enunciated the words she spoke yet they were not ordinary lips such as all men and women had  their substance was not mere human clay  they were lips of pure spirit and his desire for them seemed absolutely different from the desire that had led him to other womens lips  he could kiss her lips rest his own physical lips upon them but it would be with the lofty and awful fervor with which one would kiss the robe of god  he was not conscious of this transvaluation of values that had taken place in him and was unaware that the light that shone in his eyes when he looked at her was quite the same light that shines in all mens eyes when the desire of love is upon them  he did not dream how ardent and masculine his gaze was nor that the warm flame of it was affecting the alchemy of her spirit  her penetrative virginity exalted and disguised his own emotions elevating his thoughts to a starcool chastity and he would have been startled to learn that there was that shining out of his eyes like warm waves that flowed through her and kindled a kindred warmth  she was subtly perturbed by it and more than once though she knew not why it disrupted her train of thought with its delicious intrusion and compelled her to grope for the remainder of ideas partly uttered  speech was always easy with her and these interruptions would have puzzled her had she not decided that it was because he was a remarkable type  she was very sensitive to impressions and it was not strange after all that this aura of a traveller from another world should so affect her  the problem in the background of her consciousness was how to help him and she turned the conversation in that direction but it was martin who came to the point first  i wonder if i can get some advice from you he began and received an acquiescence of willingness that made his heart bound  you remember the other time i was here i said i couldnt talk about books an things because i didnt know how  well ive ben doin a lot of thinkin ever since  ive ben to the library a whole lot but most of the books ive tackled have ben over my head  mebbe id better begin at the beginnin i aint never had no advantages  ive worked pretty hard ever since i was a kid an since ive ben to the library lookin with new eyes at booksan lookin at new books tooive just about concluded that i aint ben reading the right kind  you know the books you find in cattle camps an focsls aint the same youve got in this house for instance  well thats the sort of readin matter ive ben accustomed to  and yetan i aint just makin a brag of itive ben different from the people ive herded with  not that im any better than the sailors an cowpunchers i travelled withi was cowpunchin for a short time you knowbut i always liked books read everything i could lay hands on anwell i guess i think differently from most of em  now to come to what im drivin at  i was never inside a house like this  when i come a week ago an saw all this an you an your mother an brothers an everythingwell i liked it  id heard about such things an read about such things in some of the books an when i looked around at your house why the books come true  but the thing im after is i liked it  i wanted it  i want it now  i want to breathe air like you get in this houseair that is filled with books and pictures and beautiful things where people talk in low voices an are clean an their thoughts are clean  the air i always breathed was mixed up with grub an houserent an scrappin an booze an thats all they talked about too  why when you was crossin the room to kiss your mother i thought it was the most beautiful thing i ever seen  ive seen a whole lot of life an somehow ive seen a whole lot more of it than most of them that was with me  i like to see an i want to see more an i want to see it different  but i aint got to the point yet  here it is  i want to make my way to the kind of life you have in this house  theres more in life than booze an hard work an knockin about  now how am i goin to get it where do i take hold an begin  im willin to work my passage you know an i can make most men sick when it comes to hard work  once i get started ill work night an day  mebbe you think its funny me askin you about all this  i know youre the last person in the world i ought to ask but i dont know anybody else i could askunless its arthur  mebbe i ought to ask him  if i was  his voice died away  his firmly planned intention had come to a halt on the verge of the horrible probability that he should have asked arthur and that he had made a fool of himself  ruth did not speak immediately she was too absorbed in striving to reconcile the stumbling uncouth speech and its simplicity of thought with what she saw in his face  she had never looked in eyes that expressed greater power  here was a man who could do anything was the message she read there and it accorded ill with the weakness of his spoken thought  and for that matter so complex and quick was her own mind that she did not have a just appreciation of simplicity  and yet she had caught an impression of power in the very groping of this mind  it had seemed to her like a giant writhing and straining at the bonds that held him down  her face was all sympathy when she did speak  what you need you realize yourself and it is education  you should go back and finish grammar school and then go through to high school and university  but that takes money he interrupted  oh she cried  i had not thought of that  but then you have relatives somebody who could assist you  he shook his head  my father and mother are dead  ive two sisters one married an the otherll get married soon i suppose  then ive a string of brothersim the youngestbut they never helped nobody  theyve just knocked around over the world lookin out for number one  the oldest died in india  two are in south africa now an anothers on a whaling voyage an ones travellin with a circushe does trapeze work  an i guess im just like them  ive taken care of myself since i was eleventhats when my mother died  ive got to study by myself i guess an what i want to know is where to begin  i should say the first thing of all would be to get a grammar  your grammar is  she had intended saying awful but she amended it to is not particularly good  he flushed and sweated  i know i must talk a lot of slang an words you dont understand  but then theyre the only words i knowhow to speak  ive got other words in my mind picked em up from books but i cant pronounce em so i dont use em  it isnt what you say so much as how you say it  you dont mind my being frank do you  i dont want to hurt you  no no he cried while he secretly blessed her for her kindness  fire away  ive got to know an id sooner know from you than anybody else  well then you say you was it should be you were  you say i seen for i saw  you use the double negative  whats the double negative he demanded then added humbly you see i dont even understand your explanations  im afraid i didnt explain that she smiled  a double negative islet me seewell you say never helped nobody  never is a negative  nobody is another negative  it is a rule that two negatives make a positive  never helped nobody means that not helping nobody they must have helped somebody  thats pretty clear he said  i never thought of it before  but it dont mean they must have helped somebody does it  seems to me that never helped nobody just naturally fails to say whether or not they helped somebody  i never thought of it before and ill never say it again  she was pleased and surprised with the quickness and surety of his mind as soon as he had got the clew he not only understood but corrected her error  youll find it all in the grammar she went on  theres something else i noticed in your speech  you say dont when you shouldnt dont is a contraction and stands for two words  do you know them  he thought a moment then answered do not  she nodded her head and said and you use dont when you mean does not  he was puzzled over this and did not get it so quickly  give me an illustration he asked  well  she puckered her brows and pursed up her mouth as she thought while he looked on and decided that her expression was most adorable it dont do to be hasty  change dont to do not and it reads it do not do to be hasty which is perfectly absurd  he turned it over in his mind and considered  doesnt it jar on your ear she suggested  cant say that it does he replied judicially  why didnt you say cant say that it do she queried  that sounds wrong he said slowly  as for the other i cant make up my mind  i guess my ear aint had the trainin yours has  there is no such word as aint she said prettily emphatic  martin flushed again  and you say ben for been she continued come for came and the way you chop your endings is something dreadful  how do you mean  he leaned forward feeling that he ought to get down on his knees before so marvellous a mind  how do i chop  you dont complete the endings  and spells and  you pronounce it an  ing spells ing  sometimes you pronounce it ing and sometimes you leave off the g  and then you slur by dropping initial letters and diphthongs  them spells them  you pronounce itoh well it is not necessary to go over all of them  what you need is the grammar  ill get one and show you how to begin  as she arose there shot through his mind something that he had read in the etiquette books and he stood up awkwardly worrying as to whether he was doing the right thing and fearing that she might take it as a sign that he was about to go  by the way mr eden she called back as she was leaving the room what is booze  you used it several times you know  oh booze he laughed  its slang  it means whiskey an beeranything that will make you drunk  and another thing she laughed back  dont use you when you are impersonal  you is very personal and your use of it just now was not precisely what you meant  i dont just see that  why you said just now to me whiskey and beeranything that will make you drunkmake me drunk dont you see  well it would wouldnt it  yes of course she smiled  but it would be nicer not to bring me into it  substitute one for you and see how much better it sounds  when she returned with the grammar she drew a chair near hishe wondered if he should have helped her with the chairand sat down beside him  she turned the pages of the grammar and their heads were inclined toward each other  he could hardly follow her outlining of the work he must do so amazed was he by her delightful propinquity  but when she began to lay down the importance of conjugation he forgot all about her he had never heard of conjugation and was fascinated by the glimpse he was catching into the tieribs of language  he leaned closer to the page and her hair touched his cheek  he had fainted but once in his life and he thought he was going to faint again  he could scarcely breathe and his heart was pounding the blood up into his throat and suffocating him  never had she seemed so accessible as now  for the moment the great gulf that separated them was bridged  but there was no diminution in the loftiness of his feeling for her  she had not descended to him  it was he who had been caught up into the clouds and carried to her  his reverence for her in that moment was of the same order as religious awe and fervor  it seemed to him that he had intruded upon the holy of holies and slowly and carefully he moved his head aside from the contact which thrilled him like an electric shock and of which she had not been aware     chapter viii   several weeks went by during which martin eden studied his grammar reviewed the books on etiquette and read voraciously the books that caught his fancy  of his own class he saw nothing  the girls of the lotus club wondered what had become of him and worried jim with questions and some of the fellows who put on the glove at rileys were glad that martin came no more  he made another discovery of treasure trove in the library  as the grammar had shown him the tieribs of language so that book showed him the tieribs of poetry and he began to learn metre and construction and form beneath the beauty he loved finding the why and wherefore of that beauty  another modern book he found treated poetry as a representative art treated it exhaustively with copious illustrations from the best in literature  never had he read fiction with so keen zest as he studied these books  and his fresh mind untaxed for twenty years and impelled by maturity of desire gripped hold of what he read with a virility unusual to the student mind  when he looked back now from his vantageground the old world he had known the world of land and sea and ships of sailormen and harpywomen seemed a very small world and yet it blended in with this new world and expanded  his mind made for unity and he was surprised when at first he began to see points of contact between the two worlds and he was ennobled as well by the loftiness of thought and beauty he found in the books  this led him to believe more firmly than ever that up above him in society like ruth and her family all men and women thought these thoughts and lived them  down below where he lived was the ignoble and he wanted to purge himself of the ignoble that had soiled all his days and to rise to that sublimated realm where dwelt the upper classes  all his childhood and youth had been troubled by a vague unrest he had never known what he wanted but he had wanted something that he had hunted vainly for until he met ruth  and now his unrest had become sharp and painful and he knew at last clearly and definitely that it was beauty and intellect and love that he must have  during those several weeks he saw ruth half a dozen times and each time was an added inspiration  she helped him with his english corrected his pronunciation and started him on arithmetic  but their intercourse was not all devoted to elementary study  he had seen too much of life and his mind was too matured to be wholly content with fractions cube root parsing and analysis and there were times when their conversation turned on other themesthe last poetry he had read the latest poet she had studied  and when she read aloud to him her favorite passages he ascended to the topmost heaven of delight  never in all the women he had heard speak had he heard a voice like hers  the least sound of it was a stimulus to his love and he thrilled and throbbed with every word she uttered  it was the quality of it the repose and the musical modulationthe soft rich indefinable product of culture and a gentle soul  as he listened to her there rang in the ears of his memory the harsh cries of barbarian women and of hags and in lesser degrees of harshness the strident voices of working women and of the girls of his own class  then the chemistry of vision would begin to work and they would troop in review across his mind each by contrast multiplying ruths glories  then too his bliss was heightened by the knowledge that her mind was comprehending what she read and was quivering with appreciation of the beauty of the written thought  she read to him much from the princess and often he saw her eyes swimming with tears so finely was her aesthetic nature strung  at such moments her own emotions elevated him till he was as a god and as he gazed at her and listened he seemed gazing on the face of life and reading its deepest secrets  and then becoming aware of the heights of exquisite sensibility he attained he decided that this was love and that love was the greatest thing in the world  and in review would pass along the corridors of memory all previous thrills and burnings he had knownthe drunkenness of wine the caresses of women the rough play and give and take of physical contestsand they seemed trivial and mean compared with this sublime ardor he now enjoyed  the situation was obscured to ruth  she had never had any experiences of the heart  her only experiences in such matters were of the books where the facts of ordinary day were translated by fancy into a fairy realm of unreality and she little knew that this rough sailor was creeping into her heart and storing there pent forces that would some day burst forth and surge through her in waves of fire  she did not know the actual fire of love  her knowledge of love was purely theoretical and she conceived of it as lambent flame gentle as the fall of dew or the ripple of quiet water and cool as the velvetdark of summer nights  her idea of love was more that of placid affection serving the loved one softly in an atmosphere flowerscented and dimlighted of ethereal calm  she did not dream of the volcanic convulsions of love its scorching heat and sterile wastes of parched ashes  she knew neither her own potencies nor the potencies of the world and the deeps of life were to her seas of illusion  the conjugal affection of her father and mother constituted her ideal of loveaffinity and she looked forward some day to emerging without shock or friction into that same quiet sweetness of existence with a loved one  so it was that she looked upon martin eden as a novelty a strange individual and she identified with novelty and strangeness the effects he produced upon her  it was only natural  in similar ways she had experienced unusual feelings when she looked at wild animals in the menagerie or when she witnessed a storm of wind or shuddered at the brightribbed lightning  there was something cosmic in such things and there was something cosmic in him  he came to her breathing of large airs and great spaces  the blaze of tropic suns was in his face and in his swelling resilient muscles was the primordial vigor of life  he was marred and scarred by that mysterious world of rough men and rougher deeds the outposts of which began beyond her horizon  he was untamed wild and in secret ways her vanity was touched by the fact that he came so mildly to her hand  likewise she was stirred by the common impulse to tame the wild thing  it was an unconscious impulse and farthest from her thoughts that her desire was to rethumb the clay of him into a likeness of her fathers image which image she believed to be the finest in the world  nor was there any way out of her inexperience for her to know that the cosmic feel she caught of him was that most cosmic of things love which with equal power drew men and women together across the world compelled stags to kill each other in the rutting season and drove even the elements irresistibly to unite  his swift development was a source of surprise and interest  she detected unguessed finenesses in him that seemed to bud day by day like flowers in congenial soil  she read browning aloud to him and was often puzzled by the strange interpretations he gave to mooted passages  it was beyond her to realize that out of his experience of men and women and life his interpretations were far more frequently correct than hers his conceptions seemed naive to her though she was often fired by his daring flights of comprehension whose orbitpath was so wide among the stars that she could not follow and could only sit and thrill to the impact of unguessed power  then she played to himno longer at himand probed him with music that sank to depths beyond her plumbline  his nature opened to music as a flower to the sun and the transition was quick from his workingclass ragtime and jingles to her classical display pieces that she knew nearly by heart  yet he betrayed a democratic fondness for wagner and the tannhauser overture when she had given him the clew to it claimed him as nothing else she played  in an immediate way it personified his life  all his past was the venusburg motif while her he identified somehow with the pilgrims chorus motif and from the exalted state this elevated him to he swept onward and upward into that vast shadowrealm of spiritgroping where good and evil war eternally  sometimes he questioned and induced in her mind temporary doubts as to the correctness of her own definitions and conceptions of music  but her singing he did not question  it was too wholly her and he sat always amazed at the divine melody of her pure soprano voice  and he could not help but contrast it with the weak pipings and shrill quaverings of factory girls illnourished and untrained and with the raucous shriekings from gincracked throats of the women of the seaport towns she enjoyed singing and playing to him  in truth it was the first time she had ever had a human soul to play with and the plastic clay of him was a delight to mould for she thought she was moulding it and her intentions were good  besides it was pleasant to be with him  he did not repel her  that first repulsion had been really a fear of her undiscovered self and the fear had gone to sleep  though she did not know it she had a feeling in him of proprietary right  also he had a tonic effect upon her  she was studying hard at the university and it seemed to strengthen her to emerge from the dusty books and have the fresh seabreeze of his personality blow upon her  strength  strength was what she needed and he gave it to her in generous measure  to come into the same room with him or to meet him at the door was to take heart of life  and when he had gone she would return to her books with a keener zest and fresh store of energy  she knew her browning but it had never sunk into her that it was an awkward thing to play with souls  as her interest in martin increased the remodelling of his life became a passion with her  there is mr butler she said one afternoon when grammar and arithmetic and poetry had been put aside  he had comparatively no advantages at first  his father had been a bank cashier but he lingered for years dying of consumption in arizona so that when he was dead mr butler charles butler he was called found himself alone in the world  his father had come from australia you know and so he had no relatives in california  he went to work in a printingofficei have heard him tell of it many timesand he got three dollars a week at first  his income today is at least thirty thousand a year  how did he do it  he was honest and faithful and industrious and economical  he denied himself the enjoyments that most boys indulge in  he made it a point to save so much every week no matter what he had to do without in order to save it  of course he was soon earning more than three dollars a week and as his wages increased he saved more and more  he worked in the daytime and at night he went to night school  he had his eyes fixed always on the future  later on he went to night high school  when he was only seventeen he was earning excellent wages at setting type but he was ambitious  he wanted a career not a livelihood and he was content to make immediate sacrifices for his ultimate again  he decided upon the law and he entered fathers office as an office boythink of thatand got only four dollars a week  but he had learned how to be economical and out of that four dollars he went on saving money  she paused for breath and to note how martin was receiving it  his face was lighted up with interest in the youthful struggles of mr butler but there was a frown upon his face as well  id say they was pretty hard lines for a young fellow he remarked four dollars a week  how could he live on it  you can bet he didnt have any frills  why i pay five dollars a week for board now an theres nothin excitin about it you can lay to that  he must have lived like a dog  the food he ate  he cooked for himself she interrupted on a little kerosene stove  the food he ate must have been worse than what a sailor gets on the worstfeedin deepwater ships than which there aint much that can be possibly worse  but think of him now she cried enthusiastically  think of what his income affords him  his early denials are paid for a thousandfold  martin looked at her sharply  theres one thing ill bet you he said and it is that mr butler is nothin gayhearted now in his fat days  he fed himself like that for years an years on a boys stomach an i bet his stomachs none too good now for it  her eyes dropped before his searching gaze  ill bet hes got dyspepsia right now martin challenged  yes he has she confessed but  an i bet martin dashed on that hes solemn an serious as an old owl an doesnt care a rap for a good time for all his thirty thousand a year  an ill bet hes not particularly joyful at seein others have a good time  aint i right  she nodded her head in agreement and hastened to explain  but he is not that type of man  by nature he is sober and serious  he always was that  you can bet he was martin proclaimed  three dollars a week an four dollars a week an a young boy cookin for himself on an oilburner an layin up money workin all day an studyin all night just workin an never playin never havin a good time an never learnin how to have a good timeof course his thirty thousand came along too late  his sympathetic imagination was flashing upon his inner sight all the thousands of details of the boys existence and of his narrow spiritual development into a thirtythousanddollarayear man  with the swiftness and widereaching of multitudinous thought charles butlers whole life was telescoped upon his vision  do you know he added i feel sorry for mr butler  he was too young to know better but he robbed himself of life for the sake of thirty thousand a year thats clean wasted upon him  why thirty thousand lump sum wouldnt buy for him right now what ten cents he was layin up would have bought him when he was a kid in the way of candy an peanuts or a seat in nigger heaven  it was just such uniqueness of points of view that startled ruth  not only were they new to her and contrary to her own beliefs but she always felt in them germs of truth that threatened to unseat or modify her own convictions  had she been fourteen instead of twentyfour she might have been changed by them but she was twentyfour conservative by nature and upbringing and already crystallized into the cranny of life where she had been born and formed  it was true his bizarre judgments troubled her in the moments they were uttered but she ascribed them to his novelty of type and strangeness of living and they were soon forgotten  nevertheless while she disapproved of them the strength of their utterance and the flashing of eyes and earnestness of face that accompanied them always thrilled her and drew her toward him  she would never have guessed that this man who had come from beyond her horizon was in such moments flashing on beyond her horizon with wider and deeper concepts  her own limits were the limits of her horizon but limited minds can recognize limitations only in others  and so she felt that her outlook was very wide indeed and that where his conflicted with hers marked his limitations and she dreamed of helping him to see as she saw of widening his horizon until it was identified with hers  but i have not finished my story she said  he worked so father says as no other office boy he ever had  mr butler was always eager to work  he never was late and he was usually at the office a few minutes before his regular time  and yet he saved his time  every spare moment was devoted to study  he studied bookkeeping and typewriting and he paid for lessons in shorthand by dictating at night to a court reporter who needed practice  he quickly became a clerk and he made himself invaluable  father appreciated him and saw that he was bound to rise  it was on fathers suggestion that he went to law college  he became a lawyer and hardly was he back in the office when father took him in as junior partner  he is a great man  he refused the united states senate several times and father says he could become a justice of the supreme court any time a vacancy occurs if he wants to  such a life is an inspiration to all of us  it shows us that a man with will may rise superior to his environment  he is a great man martin said sincerely  but it seemed to him there was something in the recital that jarred upon his sense of beauty and life  he could not find an adequate motive in mr butlers life of pinching and privation  had he done it for love of a woman or for attainment of beauty martin would have understood  gods own mad lover should do anything for the kiss but not for thirty thousand dollars a year  he was dissatisfied with mr butlers career there was something paltry about it after all  thirty thousand a year was all right but dyspepsia and inability to be humanly happy robbed such princely income of all its value  much of this he strove to express to ruth and shocked her and made it clear that more remodelling was necessary  hers was that common insularity of mind that makes human creatures believe that their color creed and politics are best and right and that other human creatures scattered over the world are less fortunately placed than they  it was the same insularity of mind that made the ancient jew thank god he was not born a woman and sent the modern missionary godsubstituting to the ends of the earth and it made ruth desire to shape this man from other crannies of life into the likeness of the men who lived in her particular cranny of life     chapter ix   back from sea martin eden came homing for california with a lovers desire  his store of money exhausted he had shipped before the mast on the treasurehunting schooner and the solomon islands after eight months of failure to find treasure had witnessed the breaking up of the expedition  the men had been paid off in australia and martin had immediately shipped on a deepwater vessel for san francisco  not alone had those eight months earned him enough money to stay on land for many weeks but they had enabled him to do a great deal of studying and reading  his was the students mind and behind his ability to learn was the indomitability of his nature and his love for ruth  the grammar he had taken along he went through again and again until his unjaded brain had mastered it  he noticed the bad grammar used by his shipmates and made a point of mentally correcting and reconstructing their crudities of speech  to his great joy he discovered that his ear was becoming sensitive and that he was developing grammatical nerves  a double negative jarred him like a discord and often from lack of practice it was from his own lips that the jar came  his tongue refused to learn new tricks in a day  after he had been through the grammar repeatedly he took up the dictionary and added twenty words a day to his vocabulary  he found that this was no light task and at wheel or lookout he steadily went over and over his lengthening list of pronunciations and definitions while he invariably memorized himself to sleep  never did anything if i were and those things were phrases with many variations that he repeated under his breath in order to accustom his tongue to the language spoken by ruth  and and ing with the d and g pronounced emphatically he went over thousands of times and to his surprise he noticed that he was beginning to speak cleaner and more correct english than the officers themselves and the gentlemanadventurers in the cabin who had financed the expedition  the captain was a fishyeyed norwegian who somehow had fallen into possession of a complete shakespeare which he never read and martin had washed his clothes for him and in return been permitted access to the precious volumes  for a time so steeped was he in the plays and in the many favorite passages that impressed themselves almost without effort on his brain that all the world seemed to shape itself into forms of elizabethan tragedy or comedy and his very thoughts were in blank verse it trained his ear and gave him a fine appreciation for noble english withal it introduced into his mind much that was archaic and obsolete  the eight months had been well spent and in addition to what he had learned of right speaking and high thinking he had learned much of himself  along with his humbleness because he knew so little there arose a conviction of power  he felt a sharp gradation between himself and his shipmates and was wise enough to realize that the difference lay in potentiality rather than achievement  what he could dothey could do but within him he felt a confused ferment working that told him there was more in him than he had done  he was tortured by the exquisite beauty of the world and wished that ruth were there to share it with him  he decided that he would describe to her many of the bits of south sea beauty  the creative spirit in him flamed up at the thought and urged that he recreate this beauty for a wider audience than ruth  and then in splendor and glory came the great idea  he would write  he would be one of the eyes through which the world saw one of the ears through which it heard one of the hearts through which it felt  he would writeeverythingpoetry and prose fiction and description and plays like shakespeare  there was career and the way to win to ruth  the men of literature were the worlds giants and he conceived them to be far finer than the mr butlers who earned thirty thousand a year and could be supreme court justices if they wanted to  once the idea had germinated it mastered him and the return voyage to san francisco was like a dream  he was drunken with unguessed power and felt that he could do anything  in the midst of the great and lonely sea he gained perspective  clearly and for the first lime he saw ruth and her world  it was all visualized in his mind as a concrete thing which he could take up in his two hands and turn around and about and examine there was much that was dim and nebulous in that world but he saw it as a whole and not in detail and he saw also the way to master it  to write  the thought was fire in him  he would begin as soon as he got back  the first thing he would do would be to describe the voyage of the treasurehunters  he would sell it to some san francisco newspaper  he would not tell ruth anything about it and she would be surprised and pleased when she saw his name in print  while he wrote he could go on studying  there were twentyfour hours in each day  he was invincible he knew how to work and the citadels would go down before him  he would not have to go to sea againas a sailor and for the instant he caught a vision of a steam yacht  there were other writers who possessed steam yachts  of course he cautioned himself it would be slow succeeding at first and for a time he would be content to earn enough money by his writing to enable him to go on studying  and then after some timea very indeterminate timewhen he had learned and prepared himself he would write the great things and his name would be on all mens lips  but greater than that infinitely greater and greatest of all he would have proved himself worthy of ruth  fame was all very well but it was for ruth that his splendid dream arose  he was not a famemonger but merely one of gods mad lovers  arrived in oakland with his snug payday in his pocket he took up his old room at bernard higginbothams and set to work  he did not even let ruth know he was back  he would go and see her when he finished the article on the treasurehunters  it was not so difficult to abstain from seeing her because of the violent heat of creative fever that burned in him  besides the very article he was writing would bring her nearer to him  he did not know how long an article he should write but he counted the words in a doublepage article in the sunday supplement of the san francisco examiner and guided himself by that  three days at white heat completed his narrative but when he had copied it carefully in a large scrawl that was easy to read he learned from a rhetoric he picked up in the library that there were such things as paragraphs and quotation marks  he had never thought of such things before and he promptly set to work writing the article over referring continually to the pages of the rhetoric and learning more in a day about composition than the average schoolboy in a year  when he had copied the article a second time and rolled it up carefully he read in a newspaper an item on hints to beginners and discovered the iron law that manuscripts should never be rolled and that they should be written on one side of the paper  he had violated the law on both counts  also he learned from the item that firstclass papers paid a minimum of ten dollars a column  so while he copied the manuscript a third time he consoled himself by multiplying ten columns by ten dollars  the product was always the same one hundred dollars and he decided that that was better than seafaring  if it hadnt been for his blunders he would have finished the article in three days  one hundred dollars in three days  it would have taken him three months and longer on the sea to earn a similar amount  a man was a fool to go to sea when he could write he concluded though the money in itself meant nothing to him  its value was in the liberty it would get him the presentable garments it would buy him all of which would bring him nearer swiftly nearer to the slender pale girl who had turned his life back upon itself and given him inspiration  he mailed the manuscript in a flat envelope and addressed it to the editor of the san francisco examiner  he had an idea that anything accepted by a paper was published immediately and as he had sent the manuscript in on friday he expected it to come out on the following sunday  he conceived that it would be fine to let that event apprise ruth of his return  then sunday afternoon he would call and see her in the meantime he was occupied by another idea which he prided himself upon as being a particularly sane careful and modest idea  he would write an adventure story for boys and sell it to the youths companion he went to the free readingroom and looked through the files of the youths companion  serial stories he found were usually published in that weekly in five instalments of about three thousand words each  he discovered several serials that ran to seven instalments and decided to write one of that length  he had been on a whaling voyage in the arctic oncea voyage that was to have been for three years and which had terminated in shipwreck at the end of six months  while his imagination was fanciful even fantastic at times he had a basic love of reality that compelled him to write about the things he knew  he knew whaling and out of the real materials of his knowledge he proceeded to manufacture the fictitious adventures of the two boys he intended to use as joint heroes  it was easy work he decided on saturday evening  he had completed on that day the first instalment of three thousand wordsmuch to the amusement of jim and to the open derision of mr higginbotham who sneered throughout mealtime at the litery person they had discovered in the family  martin contented himself by picturing his brotherinlaws surprise on sunday morning when he opened his examiner and saw the article on the treasurehunters  early that morning he was out himself to the front door nervously racing through the manysheeted newspaper  he went through it a second time very carefully then folded it up and left it where he had found it  he was glad he had not told any one about his article  on second thought he concluded that he had been wrong about the speed with which things found their way into newspaper columns  besides there had not been any news value in his article and most likely the editor would write to him about it first  after breakfast he went on with his serial  the words flowed from his pen though he broke off from the writing frequently to look up definitions in the dictionary or to refer to the rhetoric  he often read or reread a chapter at a time during such pauses and he consoled himself that while he was not writing the great things he felt to be in him he was learning composition at any rate and training himself to shape up and express his thoughts  he toiled on till dark when he went out to the readingroom and explored magazines and weeklies until the place closed at ten oclock  this was his programme for a week  each day he did three thousand words and each evening he puzzled his way through the magazines taking note of the stories articles and poems that editors saw fit to publish  one thing was certain what these multitudinous writers did he could do and only give him time and he would do what they could not do  he was cheered to read in book news in a paragraph on the payment of magazine writers not that rudyard kipling received a dollar per word but that the minimum rate paid by firstclass magazines was two cents a word  the youths companion was certainly first class and at that rate the three thousand words he had written that day would bring him sixty dollarstwo months wages on the sea  on friday night he finished the serial twentyone thousand words long at two cents a word he calculated that would bring him four hundred and twenty dollars  not a bad weeks work  it was more money than he had ever possessed at one time  he did not know how he could spend it all he had tapped a gold mine  where this came from he could always get more  he planned to buy some more clothes to subscribe to many magazines and to buy dozens of reference books that at present he was compelled to go to the library to consult  and still there was a large portion of the four hundred and twenty dollars unspent  this worried him until the thought came to him of hiring a servant for gertrude and of buying a bicycle for marion  he mailed the bulky manuscript to the youths companion and on saturday afternoon after having planned an article on pearldiving he went to see ruth  he had telephoned and she went herself to greet him at the door  the old familiar blaze of health rushed out from him and struck her like a blow  it seemed to enter into her body and course through her veins in a liquid glow and to set her quivering with its imparted strength  he flushed warmly as he took her hand and looked into her blue eyes but the fresh bronze of eight months of sun hid the flush though it did not protect the neck from the gnawing chafe of the stiff collar she noted the red line of it with amusement which quickly vanished as she glanced at his clothes  they really fitted himit was his first made toorder suitand he seemed slimmer and better modelled  in addition his cloth cap had been replaced by a soft hat which she commanded him to put on and then complimented him on his appearance  she did not remember when she had felt so happy  this change in him was her handiwork and she was proud of it and fired with ambition further to help him  but the most radical change of all and the one that pleased her most was the change in his speech  not only did he speak more correctly but he spoke more easily and there were many new words in his vocabulary when he grew excited or enthusiastic however he dropped back into the old slurring and the dropping of final consonants  also there was an awkward hesitancy at times as he essayed the new words he had learned on the other hand along with his ease of expression he displayed a lightness and facetiousness of thought that delighted her  it was his old spirit of humor and badinage that had made him a favorite in his own class but which he had hitherto been unable to use in her presence through lack of words and training  he was just beginning to orientate himself and to feel that he was not wholly an intruder  but he was very tentative fastidiously so letting ruth set the pace of sprightliness and fancy keeping up with her but never daring to go beyond her  he told her of what he had been doing and of his plan to write for a livelihood and of going on with his studies  but he was disappointed at her lack of approval  she did not think much of his plan  you see she said frankly writing must be a trade like anything else  not that i know anything about it of course  i only bring common judgment to bear  you couldnt hope to be a blacksmith without spending three years at learning the tradeor is it five years  now writers are so much better paid than blacksmiths that there must be ever so many more men who would like to write whotry to write  but then may not i be peculiarly constituted to write he queried secretly exulting at the language he had used his swift imagination throwing the whole scene and atmosphere upon a vast screen along with a thousand other scenes from his lifescenes that were rough and raw gross and bestial  the whole composite vision was achieved with the speed of light producing no pause in the conversation nor interrupting his calm train of thought  on the screen of his imagination he saw himself and this sweet and beautiful girl facing each other and conversing in good english in a room of books and paintings and tone and culture and all illuminated by a bright light of steadfast brilliance while ranged about and fading away to the remote edges of the screen were antithetical scenes each scene a picture and he the onlooker free to look at will upon what he wished  he saw these other scenes through drifting vapors and swirls of sullen fog dissolving before shafts of red and garish light  he saw cowboys at the bar drinking fierce whiskey the air filled with obscenity and ribald language and he saw himself with them drinking and cursing with the wildest or sitting at table with them under smoking kerosene lamps while the chips clicked and clattered and the cards were dealt around  he saw himself stripped to the waist with naked fists fighting his great fight with liverpool red in the forecastle of the susquehanna and he saw the bloody deck of the john rogers that gray morning of attempted mutiny the mate kicking in death throes on the mainhatch the revolver in the old mans hand spitting fire and smoke the men with passionwrenched faces of brutes screaming vile blasphemies and falling about himand then he returned to the central scene calm and clean in the steadfast light where ruth sat and talked with him amid books and paintings and he saw the grand piano upon which she would later play to him and he heard the echoes of his own selected and correct words but then may i not be peculiarly constituted to write  but no matter how peculiarly constituted a man may be for blacksmithing she was laughing i never heard of one becoming a blacksmith without first serving his apprenticeship  what would you advise he asked  and dont forget that i feel in me this capacity to writei cant explain it i just know that it is in me  you must get a thorough education was the answer whether or not you ultimately become a writer  this education is indispensable for whatever career you select and it must not be slipshod or sketchy  you should go to high school  yes he began but she interrupted with an afterthought  of course you could go on with your writing too  i would have to he said grimly  why  she looked at him prettily puzzled for she did not quite like the persistence with which he clung to his notion  because without writing there wouldnt be any high school  i must live and buy books and clothes you know  id forgotten that she laughed  why werent you born with an income  id rather have good health and imagination he answered  i can make good on the income but the other things have to be made good for  he almost said you then amended his sentence to have to be made good for one  dont say make good she cried sweetly petulant  its slang and its horrid  he flushed and stammered thats right and i only wish youd correct me every time  iid like to she said haltingly  you have so much in you that is good that i want to see you perfect  he was clay in her hands immediately as passionately desirous of being moulded by her as she was desirous of shaping him into the image of her ideal of man  and when she pointed out the opportuneness of the time that the entrance examinations to high school began on the following monday he promptly volunteered that he would take them  then she played and sang to him while he gazed with hungry yearning at her drinking in her loveliness and marvelling that there should not be a hundred suitors listening there and longing for her as he listened and longed     chapter x   he stopped to dinner that evening and much to ruths satisfaction made a favorable impression on her father  they talked about the sea as a career a subject which martin had at his fingerends and mr morse remarked afterward that he seemed a very clearheaded young man  in his avoidance of slang and his search after right words martin was compelled to talk slowly which enabled him to find the best thoughts that were in him  he was more at ease than that first night at dinner nearly a year before and his shyness and modesty even commended him to mrs morse who was pleased at his manifest improvement  he is the first man that ever drew passing notice from ruth she told her husband  she has been so singularly backward where men are concerned that i have been worried greatly  mr morse looked at his wife curiously  you mean to use this young sailor to wake her up he questioned  i mean that she is not to die an old maid if i can help it was the answer  if this young eden can arouse her interest in mankind in general it will be a good thing  a very good thing he commented  but supposeand we must suppose sometimes my dearsuppose he arouses her interest too particularly in him  impossible mrs morse laughed  she is three years older than he and besides it is impossible  nothing will ever come of it  trust that to me  and so martins role was arranged for him while he led on by arthur and norman was meditating an extravagance  they were going out for a ride into the hills sunday morning on their wheels which did not interest martin until he learned that ruth too rode a wheel and was going along he did not ride nor own a wheel but if ruth rode it was up to him to begin was his decision and when he said good night he stopped in at a cyclery on his way home and spent forty dollars for a wheel  it was more than a months hardearned wages and it reduced his stock of money amazingly but when he added the hundred dollars he was to receive from the examiner to the four hundred and twenty dollars that was the least the youths companion could pay him he felt that he had reduced the perplexity the unwonted amount of money had caused him  nor did he mind in the course of learning to ride the wheel home the fact that he ruined his suit of clothes  he caught the tailor by telephone that night from mr higginbothams store and ordered another suit  then he carried the wheel up the narrow stairway that clung like a fireescape to the rear wall of the building and when he had moved his bed out from the wall found there was just space enough in the small room for himself and the wheel  sunday he had intended to devote to studying for the high school examination but the pearldiving article lured him away and he spent the day in the whitehot fever of recreating the beauty and romance that burned in him  the fact that the examiner of that morning had failed to publish his treasurehunting article did not dash his spirits  he was at too great a height for that and having been deaf to a twicerepeated summons he went without the heavy sunday dinner with which mr higginbotham invariably graced his table  to mr higginbotham such a dinner was advertisement of his worldly achievement and prosperity and he honored it by delivering platitudinous sermonettes upon american institutions and the opportunity said institutions gave to any hardworking man to risethe rise in his case which he pointed out unfailingly being from a grocers clerk to the ownership of higginbothams cash store  martin eden looked with a sigh at his unfinished pearldiving on monday morning and took the car down to oakland to the high school  and when days later he applied for the results of his examinations he learned that he had failed in everything save grammar  your grammar is excellent professor hilton informed him staring at him through heavy spectacles but you know nothing positively nothing in the other branches and your united states history is abominablethere is no other word for it abominable  i should advise you  professor hilton paused and glared at him unsympathetic and unimaginative as one of his own testtubes  he was professor of physics in the high school possessor of a large family a meagre salary and a select fund of parrotlearned knowledge  yes sir martin said humbly wishing somehow that the man at the desk in the library was in professor hiltons place just then  and i should advise you to go back to the grammar school for at least two years  good day  martin was not deeply affected by his failure though he was surprised at ruths shocked expression when he told her professor hiltons advice  her disappointment was so evident that he was sorry he had failed but chiefly so for her sake  you see i was right she said  you know far more than any of the students entering high school and yet you cant pass the examinations it is because what education you have is fragmentary sketchy  you need the discipline of study such as only skilled teachers can give you  you must be thoroughly grounded  professor hilton is right and if i were you id go to night school  a year and a half of it might enable you to catch up that additional six months  besides that would leave you your days in which to write or if you could not make your living by your pen you would have your days in which to work in some position  but if my days are taken up with work and my nights with school when am i going to see youwas martins first thought though he refrained from uttering it  instead he said  it seems so babyish for me to be going to night school  but i wouldnt mind that if i thought it would pay  but i dont think it will pay  i can do the work quicker than they can teach me  it would be a loss of time he thought of her and his desire to have herand i cant afford the time  i havent the time to spare in fact  there is so much that is necessary  she looked at him gently and he was a brute to oppose her  physics and chemistryyou cant do them without laboratory study and youll find algebra and geometry almost hopeless with instruction  you need the skilled teachers the specialists in the art of imparting knowledge  he was silent for a minute casting about for the least vainglorious way in which to express himself  please dont think im bragging he began  i dont intend it that way at all  but i have a feeling that i am what i may call a natural student  i can study by myself  i take to it kindly like a duck to water  you see yourself what i did with grammar  and ive learned much of other thingsyou would never dream how much  and im only getting started  wait till i get  he hesitated and assured himself of the pronunciation before he said momentum  im getting my first real feel of things now  im beginning to size up the situation  please dont say size up she interrupted  to get a line on things he hastily amended  that doesnt mean anything in correct english she objected  he floundered for a fresh start  what im driving at is that im beginning to get the lay of the land  out of pity she forebore and he went on  knowledge seems to me like a chartroom  whenever i go into the library i am impressed that way  the part played by teachers is to teach the student the contents of the chartroom in a systematic way  the teachers are guides to the chartroom thats all  its not something that they have in their own heads  they dont make it up dont create it  its all in the chartroom and they know their way about in it and its their business to show the place to strangers who might else get lost  now i dont get lost easily  i have the bump of location  i usually know where im atwhats wrong now  dont say where im at  thats right he said gratefully where i am  but where am i ati mean where am i  oh yes in the chartroom  well some people  persons she corrected  some persons need guides most persons do but i think i can get along without them  ive spent a lot of time in the chartroom now and im on the edge of knowing my way about what charts i want to refer to what coasts i want to explore  and from the way i line it up ill explore a whole lot more quickly by myself  the speed of a fleet you know is the speed of the slowest ship and the speed of the teachers is affected the same way  they cant go any faster than the ruck of their scholars and i can set a faster pace for myself than they set for a whole schoolroom  he travels the fastest who travels alone she quoted at him  but id travel faster with you just the same was what he wanted to blurt out as he caught a vision of a world without end of sunlit spaces and starry voids through which he drifted with her his arm around her her pale gold hair blowing about his face  in the same instant he was aware of the pitiful inadequacy of speech  god  if he could so frame words that she could see what he then saw  and he felt the stir in him like a throe of yearning pain of the desire to paint these visions that flashed unsummoned on the mirror of his mind  ah that was it  he caught at the hem of the secret  it was the very thing that the great writers and masterpoets did  that was why they were giants  they knew how to express what they thought and felt and saw  dogs asleep in the sun often whined and barked but they were unable to tell what they saw that made them whine and bark  he had often wondered what it was  and that was all he was a dog asleep in the sun  he saw noble and beautiful visions but he could only whine and bark at ruth  but he would cease sleeping in the sun  he would stand up with open eyes and he would struggle and toil and learn until with eyes unblinded and tongue untied he could share with her his visioned wealth  other men had discovered the trick of expression of making words obedient servitors and of making combinations of words mean more than the sum of their separate meanings  he was stirred profoundly by the passing glimpse at the secret and he was again caught up in the vision of sunlit spaces and starry voidsuntil it came to him that it was very quiet and he saw ruth regarding him with an amused expression and a smile in her eyes  i have had a great visioning he said and at the sound of his words in his own ears his heart gave a leap  where had those words come from they had adequately expressed the pause his vision had put in the conversation  it was a miracle  never had he so loftily framed a lofty thought  but never had he attempted to frame lofty thoughts in words that was it  that explained it  he had never tried  but swinburne had and tennyson and kipling and all the other poets  his mind flashed on to his pearldiving  he had never dared the big things the spirit of the beauty that was a fire in him  that article would be a different thing when he was done with it  he was appalled by the vastness of the beauty that rightfully belonged in it and again his mind flashed and dared and he demanded of himself why he could not chant that beauty in noble verse as the great poets did  and there was all the mysterious delight and spiritual wonder of his love for ruth  why could he not chant that too as the poets did  they had sung of love  so would he by god  and in his frightened ears he heard his exclamation echoing  carried away he had breathed it aloud  the blood surged into his face wave upon wave mastering the bronze of it till the blush of shame flaunted itself from collarrim to the roots of his hair  iibeg your pardon he stammered  i was thinking  it sounded as if you were praying she said bravely but she felt herself inside to be withering and shrinking  it was the first time she had heard an oath from the lips of a man she knew and she was shocked not merely as a matter of principle and training but shocked in spirit by this rough blast of life in the garden of her sheltered maidenhood  but she forgave and with surprise at the ease of her forgiveness somehow it was not so difficult to forgive him anything  he had not had a chance to be as other men and he was trying so hard and succeeding too  it never entered her head that there could be any other reason for her being kindly disposed toward him  she was tenderly disposed toward him but she did not know it  she had no way of knowing it  the placid poise of twentyfour years without a single love affair did not fit her with a keen perception of her own feelings and she who had never warmed to actual love was unaware that she was warming now     chapter xi   martin went back to his pearldiving article which would have been finished sooner if it had not been broken in upon so frequently by his attempts to write poetry  his poems were love poems inspired by ruth but they were never completed  not in a day could he learn to chant in noble verse  rhyme and metre and structure were serious enough in themselves but there was over and beyond them an intangible and evasive something that he caught in all great poetry but which he could not catch and imprison in his own  it was the elusive spirit of poetry itself that he sensed and sought after but could not capture  it seemed a glow to him a warm and trailing vapor ever beyond his reaching though sometimes he was rewarded by catching at shreds of it and weaving them into phrases that echoed in his brain with haunting notes or drifted across his vision in misty wafture of unseen beauty  it was baffling  he ached with desire to express and could but gibber prosaically as everybody gibbered  he read his fragments aloud  the metre marched along on perfect feet and the rhyme pounded a longer and equally faultless rhythm but the glow and high exaltation that he felt within were lacking  he could not understand and time and again in despair defeated and depressed he returned to his article  prose was certainly an easier medium  following the pearldiving he wrote an article on the sea as a career another on turtlecatching and a third on the northeast trades  then he tried as an experiment a short story and before he broke his stride he had finished six short stories and despatched them to various magazines he wrote prolifically intensely from morning till night and late at night except when he broke off to go to the readingroom draw books from the library or to call on ruth  he was profoundly happy  life was pitched high  he was in a fever that never broke  the joy of creation that is supposed to belong to the gods was his  all the life about himthe odors of stale vegetables and soapsuds the slatternly form of his sister and the jeering face of mr higginbothamwas a dream  the real world was in his mind and the stories he wrote were so many pieces of reality out of his mind  the days were too short  there was so much he wanted to study  he cut his sleep down to five hours and found that he could get along upon it he tried four hours and a half and regretfully came back to five  he could joyfully have spent all his waking hours upon any one of his pursuits  it was with regret that he ceased from writing to study that he ceased from study to go to the library that he tore himself away from that chartroom of knowledge or from the magazines in the readingroom that were filled with the secrets of writers who succeeded in selling their wares  it was like severing heart strings when he was with ruth to stand up and go and he scorched through the dark streets so as to get home to his books at the least possible expense of time  and hardest of all was it to shut up the algebra or physics put notebook and pencil aside and close his tired eyes in sleep  he hated the thought of ceasing to live even for so short a time and his sole consolation was that the alarm clock was set five hours ahead  he would lose only five hours anyway and then the jangling bell would jerk him out of unconsciousness and he would have before him another glorious day of nineteen hours  in the meantime the weeks were passing his money was ebbing low and there was no money coming in  a month after he had mailed it the adventure serial for boys was returned to him by the youths companion the rejection slip was so tactfully worded that he felt kindly toward the editor  but he did not feel so kindly toward the editor of the san francisco examiner  after waiting two whole weeks martin had written to him  a week later he wrote again  at the end of the month he went over to san francisco and personally called upon the editor  but he did not meet that exalted personage thanks to a cerberus of an office boy of tender years and red hair who guarded the portals  at the end of the fifth week the manuscript came back to him by mail without comment there was no rejection slip no explanation nothing  in the same way his other articles were tied up with the other leading san francisco papers  when he recovered them he sent them to the magazines in the east from which they were returned more promptly accompanied always by the printed rejection slips  the short stories were returned in similar fashion  he read them over and over and liked them so much that he could not puzzle out the cause of their rejection until one day he read in a newspaper that manuscripts should always be typewritten  that explained it  of course editors were so busy that they could not afford the time and strain of reading handwriting  martin rented a typewriter and spent a day mastering the machine  each day he typed what he composed and he typed his earlier manuscripts as fast as they were returned him  he was surprised when the typed ones began to come back  his jaw seemed to become squarer his chin more aggressive and he bundled the manuscripts off to new editors  the thought came to him that he was not a good judge of his own work  he tried it out on gertrude  he read his stories aloud to her  her eyes glistened and she looked at him proudly as she said  aint it grand you writin those sort of things  yes yes he demanded impatiently  but the storyhow did you like it  just grand was the reply  just grand an thrilling too  i was all worked up  he could see that her mind was not clear  the perplexity was strong in her goodnatured face  so he waited  but say mart after a long pause how did it end  did that young man who spoke so highfalutin get her  and after he had explained the end which he thought he had made artistically obvious she would say  thats what i wanted to know  why didnt you write that way in the story  one thing he learned after he had read her a number of stories namely that she liked happy endings  that story was perfectly grand she announced straightening up from the washtub with a tired sigh and wiping the sweat from her forehead with a red steamy hand but it makes me sad  i want to cry  there is too many sad things in the world anyway  it makes me happy to think about happy things  now if hed married her andyou dont mind mart she queried apprehensively  i just happen to feel that way because im tired i guess  but the story was grand just the same perfectly grand where are you goin to sell it  thats a horse of another color he laughed  but if you did sell it what do you think youd get for it  oh a hundred dollars  that would be the least the way prices go  my  i do hope youll sell it  easy money eh  then he added proudly i wrote it in two days  thats fifty dollars a day  he longed to read his stories to ruth but did not dare  he would wait till some were published he decided then she would understand what he had been working for  in the meantime he toiled on  never had the spirit of adventure lured him more strongly than on this amazing exploration of the realm of mind  he bought the textbooks on physics and chemistry and along with his algebra worked out problems and demonstrations  he took the laboratory proofs on faith and his intense power of vision enabled him to see the reactions of chemicals more understandingly than the average student saw them in the laboratory martin wandered on through the heavy pages overwhelmed by the clews he was getting to the nature of things  he had accepted the world as the world but now he was comprehending the organization of it the play and interplay of force and matter  spontaneous explanations of old matters were continually arising in his mind  levers and purchases fascinated him and his mind roved backward to handspikes and blocks and tackles at sea  the theory of navigation which enabled the ships to travel unerringly their courses over the pathless ocean was made clear to him the mysteries of storm and rain and tide were revealed and the reason for the existence of tradewinds made him wonder whether he had written his article on the northeast trade too soon  at any rate he knew he could write it better now  one afternoon he went out with arthur to the university of california and with bated breath and a feeling of religious awe went through the laboratories saw demonstrations and listened to a physics professor lecturing to his classes  but he did not neglect his writing  a stream of short stories flowed from his pen and he branched out into the easier forms of versethe kind he saw printed in the magazinesthough he lost his head and wasted two weeks on a tragedy in blank verse the swift rejection of which by half a dozen magazines dumfounded him  then he discovered henley and wrote a series of seapoems on the model of hospital sketches  they were simple poems of light and color and romance and adventure  sea lyrics he called them and he judged them to be the best work he had yet done  there were thirty and he completed them in a month doing one a day after having done his regular days work on fiction which days work was the equivalent to a weeks work of the average successful writer  the toil meant nothing to him  it was not toil  he was finding speech and all the beauty and wonder that had been pent for years behind his inarticulate lips was now pouring forth in a wild and virile flood  he showed the sea lyrics to no one not even to the editors  he had become distrustful of editors  but it was not distrust that prevented him from submitting the lyrics  they were so beautiful to him that he was impelled to save them to share with ruth in some glorious faroff time when he would dare to read to her what he had written  against that time he kept them with him reading them aloud going over them until he knew them by heart  he lived every moment of his waking hours and he lived in his sleep his subjective mind rioting through his five hours of surcease and combining the thoughts and events of the day into grotesque and impossible marvels in reality he never rested and a weaker body or a less firmly poised brain would have been prostrated in a general breakdown  his late afternoon calls on ruth were rarer now for june was approaching when she would take her degree and finish with the university  bachelor of artswhen he thought of her degree it seemed she fled beyond him faster than he could pursue  one afternoon a week she gave to him and arriving late he usually stayed for dinner and for music afterward  those were his redletter days  the atmosphere of the house in such contrast with that in which he lived and the mere nearness to her sent him forth each time with a firmer grip on his resolve to climb the heights  in spite of the beauty in him and the aching desire to create it was for her that he struggled  he was a lover first and always  all other things he subordinated to love  greater than his adventure in the world of thought was his loveadventure  the world itself was not so amazing because of the atoms and molecules that composed it according to the propulsions of irresistible force what made it amazing was the fact that ruth lived in it  she was the most amazing thing he had ever known or dreamed or guessed  but he was oppressed always by her remoteness  she was so far from him and he did not know how to approach her  he had been a success with girls and women in his own class but he had never loved any of them while he did love her and besides she was not merely of another class his very love elevated her above all classes  she was a being apart so far apart that he did not know how to draw near to her as a lover should draw near  it was true as he acquired knowledge and language that he was drawing nearer talking her speech discovering ideas and delights in common but this did not satisfy his lovers yearning  his lovers imagination had made her holy too holy too spiritualized to have any kinship with him in the flesh  it was his own love that thrust her from him and made her seem impossible for him  love itself denied him the one thing that it desired  and then one day without warning the gulf between them was bridged for a moment and thereafter though the gulf remained it was ever narrower they had been eating cherriesgreat luscious black cherries with a juice of the color of dark wine  and later as she read aloud to him from the princess he chanced to notice the stain of the cherries on her lips  for the moment her divinity was shattered  she was clay after all mere clay subject to the common law of clay as his clay was subject or anybodys clay  her lips were flesh like his and cherries dyed them as cherries dyed his  and if so with her lips then was it so with all of her  she was woman all woman just like any woman  it came upon him abruptly  it was a revelation that stunned him  it was as if he had seen the sun fall out of the sky or had seen worshipped purity polluted  then he realized the significance of it and his heart began pounding and challenging him to play the lover with this woman who was not a spirit from other worlds but a mere woman with lips a cherry could stain  he trembled at the audacity of his thought but all his soul was singing and reason in a triumphant paean assured him he was right  something of this change in him must have reached her for she paused from her reading looked up at him and smiled  his eyes dropped from her blue eyes to her lips and the sight of the stain maddened him  his arms all but flashed out to her and around her in the way of his old careless life  she seemed to lean toward him to wait and all his will fought to hold him back  you were not following a word she pouted  then she laughed at him delighting in his confusion and as he looked into her frank eyes and knew that she had divined nothing of what he felt he became abashed  he had indeed in thought dared too far  of all the women he had known there was no woman who would not have guessedsave her  and she had not guessed  there was the difference  she was different  he was appalled by his own grossness awed by her clear innocence and he gazed again at her across the gulf  the bridge had broken down  but still the incident had brought him nearer  the memory of it persisted and in the moments when he was most cast down he dwelt upon it eagerly  the gulf was never again so wide  he had accomplished a distance vastly greater than a bachelorship of arts or a dozen bachelorships  she was pure it was true as he had never dreamed of purity but cherries stained her lips  she was subject to the laws of the universe just as inexorably as he was  she had to eat to live and when she got her feet wet she caught cold  but that was not the point if she could feel hunger and thirst and heat and cold then could she feel loveand love for a man  well he was a man  and why could he not be the man  its up to me to make good he would murmur fervently  i will be the man  i will make myself the man  i will make good     chapter xii   early one evening struggling with a sonnet that twisted all awry the beauty and thought that trailed in glow and vapor through his brain martin was called to the telephone  its a ladys voice a fine ladys mr higginbotham who had called him jeered  martin went to the telephone in the corner of the room and felt a wave of warmth rush through him as he heard ruths voice  in his battle with the sonnet he had forgotten her existence and at the sound of her voice his love for her smote him like a sudden blow  and such a voicedelicate and sweet like a strain of music heard far off and faint or better like a bell of silver a perfect tone crystalpure no mere woman had a voice like that  there was something celestial about it and it came from other worlds  he could scarcely hear what it said so ravished was he though he controlled his face for he knew that mr higginbothams ferret eyes were fixed upon him  it was not much that ruth wanted to saymerely that norman had been going to take her to a lecture that night but that he had a headache and she was so disappointed and she had the tickets and that if he had no other engagement would he be good enough to take her  would he  he fought to suppress the eagerness in his voice  it was amazing  he had always seen her in her own house  and he had never dared to ask her to go anywhere with him  quite irrelevantly still at the telephone and talking with her he felt an overpowering desire to die for her and visions of heroic sacrifice shaped and dissolved in his whirling brain  he loved her so much so terribly so hopelessly  in that moment of mad happiness that she should go out with him go to a lecture with himwith him martin edenshe soared so far above him that there seemed nothing else for him to do than die for her  it was the only fit way in which he could express the tremendous and lofty emotion he felt for her  it was the sublime abnegation of true love that comes to all lovers and it came to him there at the telephone in a whirlwind of fire and glory and to die for her he felt was to have lived and loved well  and he was only twentyone and he had never been in love before  his hand trembled as he hung up the receiver and he was weak from the organ which had stirred him  his eyes were shining like an angels and his face was transfigured purged of all earthly dross and pure and holy  makin dates outside eh his brotherinlaw sneered  you know what that means  youll be in the police court yet  but martin could not come down from the height  not even the bestiality of the allusion could bring him back to earth  anger and hurt were beneath him  he had seen a great vision and was as a god and he could feel only profound and awful pity for this maggot of a man  he did not look at him and though his eyes passed over him he did not see him and as in a dream he passed out of the room to dress  it was not until he had reached his own room and was tying his necktie that he became aware of a sound that lingered unpleasantly in his ears  on investigating this sound he identified it as the final snort of bernard higginbotham which somehow had not penetrated to his brain before  as ruths front door closed behind them and he came down the steps with her he found himself greatly perturbed  it was not unalloyed bliss taking her to the lecture  he did not know what he ought to do  he had seen on the streets with persons of her class that the women took the mens arms  but then again he had seen them when they didnt and he wondered if it was only in the evening that arms were taken or only between husbands and wives and relatives  just before he reached the sidewalk he remembered minnie  minnie had always been a stickler  she had called him down the second time she walked out with him because he had gone along on the inside and she had laid the law down to him that a gentleman always walked on the outsidewhen he was with a lady  and minnie had made a practice of kicking his heels whenever they crossed from one side of the street to the other to remind him to get over on the outside  he wondered where she had got that item of etiquette and whether it had filtered down from above and was all right  it wouldnt do any harm to try it he decided by the time they had reached the sidewalk and he swung behind ruth and took up his station on the outside  then the other problem presented itself  should he offer her his arm  he had never offered anybody his arm in his life  the girls he had known never took the fellows arms  for the first several times they walked freely side by side and after that it was arms around the waists and heads against the fellows shoulders where the streets were unlighted  but this was different  she wasnt that kind of a girl he must do something  he crooked the arm next to hercrooked it very slightly and with secret tentativeness not invitingly but just casually as though he was accustomed to walk that way  and then the wonderful thing happened  he felt her hand upon his arm  delicious thrills ran through him at the contact and for a few sweet moments it seemed that he had left the solid earth and was flying with her through the air  but he was soon back again perturbed by a new complication  they were crossing the street this would put him on the inside  he should be on the outside  should he therefore drop her arm and change over  and if he did so would he have to repeat the manoeuvre the next time  and the next  there was something wrong about it and he resolved not to caper about and play the fool  yet he was not satisfied with his conclusion and when he found himself on the inside he talked quickly and earnestly making a show of being carried away by what he was saying so that in case he was wrong in not changing sides his enthusiasm would seem the cause for his carelessness  as they crossed broadway he came face to face with a new problem  in the blaze of the electric lights he saw lizzie connolly and her giggly friend  only for an instant he hesitated then his hand went up and his hat came off  he could not be disloyal to his kind and it was to more than lizzie connolly that his hat was lifted  she nodded and looked at him boldly not with soft and gentle eyes like ruths but with eyes that were handsome and hard and that swept on past him to ruth and itemized her face and dress and station  and he was aware that ruth looked too with quick eyes that were timid and mild as a doves but which saw in a look that was a flutter on and past the workingclass girl in her cheap finery and under the strange hat that all workingclass girls were wearing just then  what a pretty girl ruth said a moment later  martin could have blessed her though he said  i dont know  i guess its all a matter of personal taste but she doesnt strike me as being particularly pretty  why there isnt one woman in ten thousand with features as regular as hers  they are splendid  her face is as clearcut as a cameo  and her eyes are beautiful  do you think so martin queried absently for to him there was only one beautiful woman in the world and she was beside him her hand upon his arm  do i think so  if that girl had proper opportunity to dress mr eden and if she were taught how to carry herself you would be fairly dazzled by her and so would all men  she would have to be taught how to speak he commented or else most of the men wouldnt understand her  im sure you couldnt understand a quarter of what she said if she just spoke naturally  nonsense  you are as bad as arthur when you try to make your point  you forget how i talked when you first met me  i have learned a new language since then  before that time i talked as that girl talks  now i can manage to make myself understood sufficiently in your language to explain that you do not know that other girls language  and do you know why she carries herself the way she does  i think about such things now though i never used to think about them and i am beginning to understandmuch  but why does she  she has worked long hours for years at machines  when ones body is young it is very pliable and hard work will mould it like putty according to the nature of the work  i can tell at a glance the trades of many workingmen i meet on the street  look at me  why am i rolling all about the shop  because of the years i put in on the sea  if id put in the same years cowpunching with my body young and pliable i wouldnt be rolling now but id be bowlegged  and so with that girl you noticed that her eyes were what i might call hard  she has never been sheltered  she has had to take care of herself and a young girl cant take care of herself and keep her eyes soft and gentle likelike yours for example  i think you are right ruth said in a low voice  and it is too bad she is such a pretty girl  he looked at her and saw her eyes luminous with pity  and then he remembered that he loved her and was lost in amazement at his fortune that permitted him to love her and to take her on his arm to a lecture  who are you martin eden he demanded of himself in the lookingglass that night when he got back to his room  he gazed at himself long and curiously  who are you  what are you  where do you belong  you belong by rights to girls like lizzie connolly  you belong with the legions of toil with all that is low and vulgar and unbeautiful  you belong with the oxen and the drudges in dirty surroundings among smells and stenches  there are the stale vegetables now  those potatoes are rotting  smell them damn you smell them  and yet you dare to open the books to listen to beautiful music to learn to love beautiful paintings to speak good english to think thoughts that none of your own kind thinks to tear yourself away from the oxen and the lizzie connollys and to love a pale spirit of a woman who is a million miles beyond you and who lives in the stars  who are you and what are you damn you  and are you going to make good  he shook his fist at himself in the glass and sat down on the edge of the bed to dream for a space with wide eyes  then he got out notebook and algebra and lost himself in quadratic equations while the hours slipped by and the stars dimmed and the gray of dawn flooded against his window     chapter xiii   it was the knot of wordy socialists and workingclass philosophers that held forth in the city hall park on warm afternoons that was responsible for the great discovery  once or twice in the month while riding through the park on his way to the library martin dismounted from his wheel and listened to the arguments and each time he tore himself away reluctantly  the tone of discussion was much lower than at mr morses table  the men were not grave and dignified  they lost their tempers easily and called one another names while oaths and obscene allusions were frequent on their lips  once or twice he had seen them come to blows  and yet he knew not why there seemed something vital about the stuff of these mens thoughts  their logomachy was far more stimulating to his intellect than the reserved and quiet dogmatism of mr morse these men who slaughtered english gesticulated like lunatics and fought one anothers ideas with primitive anger seemed somehow to be more alive than mr morse and his crony mr butler  martin had heard herbert spencer quoted several times in the park but one afternoon a disciple of spencers appeared a seedy tramp with a dirty coat buttoned tightly at the throat to conceal the absence of a shirt  battle royal was waged amid the smoking of many cigarettes and the expectoration of much tobaccojuice wherein the tramp successfully held his own even when a socialist workman sneered there is no god but the unknowable and herbert spencer is his prophet  martin was puzzled as to what the discussion was about but when he rode on to the library he carried with him a newborn interest in herbert spencer and because of the frequency with which the tramp had mentioned first principles martin drew out that volume  so the great discovery began  once before he had tried spencer and choosing the principles of psychology to begin with he had failed as abjectly as he had failed with madam blavatsky  there had been no understanding the book and he had returned it unread  but this night after algebra and physics and an attempt at a sonnet he got into bed and opened first principles  morning found him still reading  it was impossible for him to sleep  nor did he write that day  he lay on the bed till his body grew tired when he tried the hard floor reading on his back the book held in the air above him or changing from side to side  he slept that night and did his writing next morning and then the book tempted him and he fell reading all afternoon oblivious to everything and oblivious to the fact that that was the afternoon ruth gave to him  his first consciousness of the immediate world about him was when bernard higginbotham jerked open the door and demanded to know if he thought they were running a restaurant  martin eden had been mastered by curiosity all his days  he wanted to know and it was this desire that had sent him adventuring over the world  but he was now learning from spencer that he never had known and that he never could have known had he continued his sailing and wandering forever  he had merely skimmed over the surface of things observing detached phenomena accumulating fragments of facts making superficial little generalizationsand all and everything quite unrelated in a capricious and disorderly world of whim and chance  the mechanism of the flight of birds he had watched and reasoned about with understanding but it had never entered his head to try to explain the process whereby birds as organic flying mechanisms had been developed  he had never dreamed there was such a process  that birds should have come to be was unguessed  they always had been  they just happened  and as it was with birds so had it been with everything  his ignorant and unprepared attempts at philosophy had been fruitless  the medieval metaphysics of kant had given him the key to nothing and had served the sole purpose of making him doubt his own intellectual powers  in similar manner his attempt to study evolution had been confined to a hopelessly technical volume by romanes  he had understood nothing and the only idea he had gathered was that evolution was a dryasdust theory of a lot of little men possessed of huge and unintelligible vocabularies  and now he learned that evolution was no mere theory but an accepted process of development that scientists no longer disagreed about it their only differences being over the method of evolution  and here was the man spencer organizing all knowledge for him reducing everything to unity elaborating ultimate realities and presenting to his startled gaze a universe so concrete of realization that it was like the model of a ship such as sailors make and put into glass bottles there was no caprice no chance  all was law  it was in obedience to law that the bird flew and it was in obedience to the same law that fermenting slime had writhed and squirmed and put out legs and wings and become a bird  martin had ascended from pitch to pitch of intellectual living and here he was at a higher pitch than ever  all the hidden things were laying their secrets bare  he was drunken with comprehension  at night asleep he lived with the gods in colossal nightmare and awake in the day he went around like a somnambulist with absent stare gazing upon the world he had just discovered  at table he failed to hear the conversation about petty and ignoble things his eager mind seeking out and following cause and effect in everything before him  in the meat on the platter he saw the shining sun and traced its energy back through all its transformations to its source a hundred million miles away or traced its energy ahead to the moving muscles in his arms that enabled him to cut the meat and to the brain wherewith he willed the muscles to move to cut the meat until with inward gaze he saw the same sun shining in his brain  he was entranced by illumination and did not hear the bughouse whispered by jim nor see the anxiety on his sisters face nor notice the rotary motion of bernard higginbothams finger whereby he imparted the suggestion of wheels revolving in his brotherinlaws head  what in a way most profoundly impressed martin was the correlation of knowledgeof all knowledge  he had been curious to know things and whatever he acquired he had filed away in separate memory compartments in his brain  thus on the subject of sailing he had an immense store  on the subject of woman he had a fairly large store  but these two subjects had been unrelated  between the two memory compartments there had been no connection  that in the fabric of knowledge there should be any connection whatever between a woman with hysterics and a schooner carrying a weatherhelm or heaving to in a gale would have struck him as ridiculous and impossible  but herbert spencer had shown him not only that it was not ridiculous but that it was impossible for there to be no connection  all things were related to all other things from the farthermost star in the wastes of space to the myriads of atoms in the grain of sand under ones foot  this new concept was a perpetual amazement to martin and he found himself engaged continually in tracing the relationship between all things under the sun and on the other side of the sun  he drew up lists of the most incongruous things and was unhappy until he succeeded in establishing kinship between them allkinship between love poetry earthquake fire rattlesnakes rainbows precious gems monstrosities sunsets the roaring of lions illuminating gas cannibalism beauty murder lovers fulcrums and tobacco  thus he unified the universe and held it up and looked at it or wandered through its byways and alleys and jungles not as a terrified traveller in the thick of mysteries seeking an unknown goal but observing and charting and becoming familiar with all there was to know and the more he knew the more passionately he admired the universe and life and his own life in the midst of it all  you fool he cried at his image in the lookingglass  you wanted to write and you tried to write and you had nothing in you to write about what did you have in yousome childish notions a few halfbaked sentiments a lot of undigested beauty a great black mass of ignorance a heart filled to bursting with love and an ambition as big as your love and as futile as your ignorance  and you wanted to write  why youre just on the edge of beginning to get something in you to write about  you wanted to create beauty but how could you when you knew nothing about the nature of beauty  you wanted to write about life when you knew nothing of the essential characteristics of life  you wanted to write about the world and the scheme of existence when the world was a chinese puzzle to you and all that you could have written would have been about what you did not know of the scheme of existence  but cheer up martin my boy  youll write yet  you know a little a very little and youre on the right road now to know more  some day if youre lucky you may come pretty close to knowing all that may be known  then you will write  he brought his great discovery to ruth sharing with her all his joy and wonder in it  but she did not seem to be so enthusiastic over it  she tacitly accepted it and in a way seemed aware of it from her own studies  it did not stir her deeply as it did him and he would have been surprised had he not reasoned it out that it was not new and fresh to her as it was to him  arthur and norman he found believed in evolution and had read spencer though it did not seem to have made any vital impression upon them while the young fellow with the glasses and the mop of hair will olney sneered disagreeably at spencer and repeated the epigram there is no god but the unknowable and herbert spencer is his prophet  but martin forgave him the sneer for he had begun to discover that olney was not in love with ruth  later he was dumfounded to learn from various little happenings not only that olney did not care for ruth but that he had a positive dislike for her  martin could not understand this  it was a bit of phenomena that he could not correlate with all the rest of the phenomena in the universe  but nevertheless he felt sorry for the young fellow because of the great lack in his nature that prevented him from a proper appreciation of ruths fineness and beauty they rode out into the hills several sundays on their wheels and martin had ample opportunity to observe the armed truce that existed between ruth and olney  the latter chummed with norman throwing arthur and martin into company with ruth for which martin was duly grateful  those sundays were great days for martin greatest because he was with ruth and great also because they were putting him more on a par with the young men of her class  in spite of their long years of disciplined education he was finding himself their intellectual equal and the hours spent with them in conversation was so much practice for him in the use of the grammar he had studied so hard  he had abandoned the etiquette books falling back upon observation to show him the right things to do except when carried away by his enthusiasm he was always on guard keenly watchful of their actions and learning their little courtesies and refinements of conduct  the fact that spencer was very little read was for some time a source of surprise to martin  herbert spencer said the man at the desk in the library oh yes a great mind  but the man did not seem to know anything of the content of that great mind  one evening at dinner when mr butler was there martin turned the conversation upon spencer  mr morse bitterly arraigned the english philosophers agnosticism but confessed that he had not read first principles while mr butler stated that he had no patience with spencer had never read a line of him and had managed to get along quite well without him  doubts arose in martins mind and had he been less strongly individual he would have accepted the general opinion and given herbert spencer up  as it was he found spencers explanation of things convincing and as he phrased it to himself to give up spencer would be equivalent to a navigator throwing the compass and chronometer overboard  so martin went on into a thorough study of evolution mastering more and more the subject himself and being convinced by the corroborative testimony of a thousand independent writers  the more he studied the more vistas he caught of fields of knowledge yet unexplored and the regret that days were only twentyfour hours long became a chronic complaint with him  one day because the days were so short he decided to give up algebra and geometry  trigonometry he had not even attempted  then he cut chemistry from his studylist retaining only physics  i am not a specialist he said in defence to ruth  nor am i going to try to be a specialist  there are too many special fields for any one man in a whole lifetime to master a tithe of them  i must pursue general knowledge  when i need the work of specialists i shall refer to their books  but that is not like having the knowledge yourself she protested  but it is unnecessary to have it  we profit from the work of the specialists  thats what they are for  when i came in i noticed the chimneysweeps at work  theyre specialists and when they get done you will enjoy clean chimneys without knowing anything about the construction of chimneys  thats farfetched i am afraid  she looked at him curiously and he felt a reproach in her gaze and manner  but he was convinced of the rightness of his position  all thinkers on general subjects the greatest minds in the world in fact rely on the specialists  herbert spencer did that  he generalized upon the findings of thousands of investigators  he would have had to live a thousand lives in order to do it all himself  and so with darwin he took advantage of all that had been learned by the florists and cattle breeders  youre right martin olney said  you know what youre after and ruth doesnt  she doesnt know what she is after for herself even  oh yes olney rushed on heading off her objection i know you call it general culture  but it doesnt matter what you study if you want general culture  you can study french or you can study german or cut them both out and study esperanto youll get the culture tone just the same  you can study greek or latin too for the same purpose though it will never be any use to you  it will be culture though  why ruth studied saxon became clever in itthat was two years agoand all that she remembers of it now is whan that sweet aprile with his schowers sooteisnt that the way it goes  but its given you the culture tone just the same he laughed again heading her off  i know  we were in the same classes  but you speak of culture as if it should be a means to something ruth cried out  her eyes were flashing and in her cheeks were two spots of color  culture is the end in itself  but that is not what martin wants  how do you know  what do you want martin olney demanded turning squarely upon him  martin felt very uncomfortable and looked entreaty at ruth  yes what do you want ruth asked  that will settle it  yes of course i want culture martin faltered  i love beauty and culture will give me a finer and keener appreciation of beauty  she nodded her head and looked triumph  rot and you know it was olneys comment  martins after career not culture  it just happens that culture in his case is incidental to career  if he wanted to be a chemist culture would be unnecessary martin wants to write but hes afraid to say so because it will put you in the wrong  and why does martin want to write he went on  because he isnt rolling in wealth  why do you fill your head with saxon and general culture  because you dont have to make your way in the world  your father sees to that  he buys your clothes for you and all the rest what rotten good is our education yours and mine and arthurs and normans  were soaked in general culture and if our daddies went broke today wed be falling down tomorrow on teachers examinations  the best job you could get ruth would be a country school or music teacher in a girls boardingschool  and pray what would you do she asked  not a blessed thing  i could earn a dollar and a half a day common labor and i might get in as instructor in hanleys cramming jointi say might mind you and i might be chucked out at the end of the week for sheer inability  martin followed the discussion closely and while he was convinced that olney was right he resented the rather cavalier treatment he accorded ruth  a new conception of love formed in his mind as he listened  reason had nothing to do with love  it mattered not whether the woman he loved reasoned correctly or incorrectly  love was above reason  if it just happened that she did not fully appreciate his necessity for a career that did not make her a bit less lovable  she was all lovable and what she thought had nothing to do with her lovableness  whats that he replied to a question from olney that broke in upon his train of thought  i was saying that i hoped you wouldnt be fool enough to tackle latin  but latin is more than culture ruth broke in  it is equipment  well are you going to tackle it olney persisted  martin was sore beset  he could see that ruth was hanging eagerly upon his answer  i am afraid i wont have time he said finally  id like to but i wont have time  you see martins not seeking culture olney exulted  hes trying to get somewhere to do something  oh but its mental training  its mind discipline  its what makes disciplined minds  ruth looked expectantly at martin as if waiting for him to change his judgment  you know the football players have to train before the big game  and that is what latin does for the thinker it trains  rot and bosh  thats what they told us when we were kids  but there is one thing they didnt tell us then  they let us find it out for ourselves afterwards  olney paused for effect then added and what they didnt tell us was that every gentleman should have studied latin but that no gentleman should know latin  now thats unfair ruth cried  i knew you were turning the conversation just in order to get off something  its clever all right was the retort but its fair too  the only men who know their latin are the apothecaries the lawyers and the latin professors  and if martin wants to be one of them i miss my guess  but whats all that got to do with herbert spencer anyway  martins just discovered spencer and hes wild over him  why  because spencer is taking him somewhere  spencer couldnt take me anywhere nor you  we havent got anywhere to go  youll get married some day and ill have nothing to do but keep track of the lawyers and business agents who will take care of the money my fathers going to leave me  onley got up to go but turned at the door and delivered a parting shot  you leave martin alone ruth  he knows whats best for himself  look at what hes done already  he makes me sick sometimes sick and ashamed of myself  he knows more now about the world and life and mans place and all the rest than arthur or norman or i or you too for that matter and in spite of all our latin and french and saxon and culture  but ruth is my teacher martin answered chivalrously  she is responsible for what little i have learned  rats  olney looked at ruth and his expression was malicious  i suppose youll be telling me next that you read spencer on her recommendationonly you didnt  and she doesnt know anything more about darwin and evolution than i do about king solomons mines  whats that jawbreaker definition about something or other of spencers that you sprang on us the other daythat indefinite incoherent homogeneity thing  spring it on her and see if she understands a word of it  that isnt culture you see  well tra la and if you tackle latin martin i wont have any respect for you  and all the while interested in the discussion martin had been aware of an irk in it as well  it was about studies and lessons dealing with the rudiments of knowledge and the schoolboyish tone of it conflicted with the big things that were stirring in himwith the grip upon life that was even then crooking his fingers like eagles talons with the cosmic thrills that made him ache and with the inchoate consciousness of mastery of it all  he likened himself to a poet wrecked on the shores of a strange land filled with power of beauty stumbling and stammering and vainly trying to sing in the rough barbaric tongue of his brethren in the new land  and so with him  he was alive painfully alive to the great universal things and yet he was compelled to potter and grope among schoolboy topics and debate whether or not he should study latin  what in hell has latin to do with it he demanded before his mirror that night  i wish dead people would stay dead  why should i and the beauty in me be ruled by the dead  beauty is alive and everlasting languages come and go  they are the dust of the dead  and his next thought was that he had been phrasing his ideas very well and he went to bed wondering why he could not talk in similar fashion when he was with ruth  he was only a schoolboy with a schoolboys tongue when he was in her presence  give me time he said aloud  only give me time  time  time  time was his unending plaint     chapter xiv   it was not because of olney but in spite of ruth and his love for ruth that he finally decided not to take up latin  his money meant time there was so much that was more important than latin so many studies that clamored with imperious voices  and he must write  he must earn money  he had had no acceptances  twoscore of manuscripts were travelling the endless round of the magazines  how did the others do it he spent long hours in the free readingroom going over what others had written studying their work eagerly and critically comparing it with his own and wondering wondering about the secret trick they had discovered which enabled them to sell their work  he was amazed at the immense amount of printed stuff that was dead  no light no life no color was shot through it  there was no breath of life in it and yet it sold at two cents a word twenty dollars a thousandthe newspaper clipping had said so  he was puzzled by countless short stories written lightly and cleverly he confessed but without vitality or reality  life was so strange and wonderful filled with an immensity of problems of dreams and of heroic toils and yet these stories dealt only with the commonplaces of life  he felt the stress and strain of life its fevers and sweats and wild insurgencessurely this was the stuff to write about  he wanted to glorify the leaders of forlorn hopes the mad lovers the giants that fought under stress and strain amid terror and tragedy making life crackle with the strength of their endeavor  and yet the magazine short stories seemed intent on glorifying the mr butlers the sordid dollar chasers and the commonplace little love affairs of commonplace little men and women  was it because the editors of the magazines were commonplace he demanded  or were they afraid of life these writers and editors and readers  but his chief trouble was that he did not know any editors or writers and not merely did he not know any writers but he did not know anybody who had ever attempted to write  there was nobody to tell him to hint to him to give him the least word of advice  he began to doubt that editors were real men  they seemed cogs in a machine  that was what it was a machine  he poured his soul into stories articles and poems and intrusted them to the machine  he folded them just so put the proper stamps inside the long envelope along with the manuscript sealed the envelope put more stamps outside and dropped it into the mailbox it travelled across the continent and after a certain lapse of time the postman returned him the manuscript in another long envelope on the outside of which were the stamps he had enclosed  there was no human editor at the other end but a mere cunning arrangement of cogs that changed the manuscript from one envelope to another and stuck on the stamps  it was like the slot machines wherein one dropped pennies and with a metallic whirl of machinery had delivered to him a stick of chewinggum or a tablet of chocolate  it depended upon which slot one dropped the penny in whether he got chocolate or gum  and so with the editorial machine  one slot brought checks and the other brought rejection slips  so far he had found only the latter slot  it was the rejection slips that completed the horrible machinelikeness of the process  these slips were printed in stereotyped forms and he had received hundreds of themas many as a dozen or more on each of his earlier manuscripts  if he had received one line one personal line along with one rejection of all his rejections he would have been cheered  but not one editor had given that proof of existence  and he could conclude only that there were no warm human men at the other end only mere cogs well oiled and running beautifully in the machine  he was a good fighter wholesouled and stubborn and he would have been content to continue feeding the machine for years but he was bleeding to death and not years but weeks would determine the fight  each week his board bill brought him nearer destruction while the postage on forty manuscripts bled him almost as severely  he no longer bought books and he economized in petty ways and sought to delay the inevitable end though he did not know how to economize and brought the end nearer by a week when he gave his sister marian five dollars for a dress  he struggled in the dark without advice without encouragement and in the teeth of discouragement  even gertrude was beginning to look askance  at first she had tolerated with sisterly fondness what she conceived to be his foolishness but now out of sisterly solicitude she grew anxious  to her it seemed that his foolishness was becoming a madness  martin knew this and suffered more keenly from it than from the open and nagging contempt of bernard higginbotham  martin had faith in himself but he was alone in this faith  not even ruth had faith  she had wanted him to devote himself to study and though she had not openly disapproved of his writing she had never approved  he had never offered to show her his work  a fastidious delicacy had prevented him  besides she had been studying heavily at the university and he felt averse to robbing her of her time  but when she had taken her degree she asked him herself to let her see something of what he had been doing  martin was elated and diffident  here was a judge  she was a bachelor of arts  she had studied literature under skilled instructors  perhaps the editors were capable judges too  but she would be different from them  she would not hand him a stereotyped rejection slip nor would she inform him that lack of preference for his work did not necessarily imply lack of merit in his work  she would talk a warm human being in her quick bright way and most important of all she would catch glimpses of the real martin eden  in his work she would discern what his heart and soul were like and she would come to understand something a little something of the stuff of his dreams and the strength of his power  martin gathered together a number of carbon copies of his short stories hesitated a moment then added his sea lyrics  they mounted their wheels on a late june afternoon and rode for the hills  it was the second time he had been out with her alone and as they rode along through the balmy warmth just chilled by she seabreeze to refreshing coolness he was profoundly impressed by the fact that it was a very beautiful and wellordered world and that it was good to be alive and to love  they left their wheels by the roadside and climbed to the brown top of an open knoll where the sunburnt grass breathed a harvest breath of dry sweetness and content  its work is done martin said as they seated themselves she upon his coat and he sprawling close to the warm earth  he sniffed the sweetness of the tawny grass which entered his brain and set his thoughts whirling on from the particular to the universal  it has achieved its reason for existence he went on patting the dry grass affectionately  it quickened with ambition under the dreary downpour of last winter fought the violent early spring flowered and lured the insects and the bees scattered its seeds squared itself with its duty and the world and  why do you always look at things with such dreadfully practical eyes she interrupted  because ive been studying evolution i guess  its only recently that i got my eyesight if the truth were told  but it seems to me you lose sight of beauty by being so practical that you destroy beauty like the boys who catch butterflies and rub the down off their beautiful wings  he shook his head  beauty has significance but i never knew its significance before  i just accepted beauty as something meaningless as something that was just beautiful without rhyme or reason  i did not know anything about beauty but now i know or rather am just beginning to know  this grass is more beautiful to me now that i know why it is grass and all the hidden chemistry of sun and rain and earth that makes it become grass  why there is romance in the lifehistory of any grass yes and adventure too  the very thought of it stirs me  when i think of the play of force and matter and all the tremendous struggle of it i feel as if i could write an epic on the grass  how well you talk she said absently and he noted that she was looking at him in a searching way  he was all confusion and embarrassment on the instant the blood flushing red on his neck and brow  i hope i am learning to talk he stammered  there seems to be so much in me i want to say  but it is all so big  i cant find ways to say what is really in me  sometimes it seems to me that all the world all life everything had taken up residence inside of me and was clamoring for me to be the spokesman  i feeloh i cant describe iti feel the bigness of it but when i speak i babble like a little child  it is a great task to transmute feeling and sensation into speech written or spoken that will in turn in him who reads or listens transmute itself back into the selfsame feeling and sensation  it is a lordly task  see i bury my face in the grass and the breath i draw in through my nostrils sets me quivering with a thousand thoughts and fancies  it is a breath of the universe i have breathed  i know song and laughter and success and pain and struggle and death and i see visions that arise in my brain somehow out of the scent of the grass and i would like to tell them to you to the world  but how can i  my tongue is tied  i have tried by the spoken word just now to describe to you the effect on me of the scent of the grass  but i have not succeeded  i have no more than hinted in awkward speech  my words seem gibberish to me  and yet i am stifled with desire to tell  oh he threw up his hands with a despairing gestureit is impossible  it is not understandable  it is incommunicable  but you do talk well she insisted  just think how you have improved in the short time i have known you  mr butler is a noted public speaker  he is always asked by the state committee to go out on stump during campaign  yet you talked just as well as he the other night at dinner  only he was more controlled  you get too excited but you will get over that with practice  why you would make a good public speaker you can go farif you want to  you are masterly  you can lead men i am sure and there is no reason why you should not succeed at anything you set your hand to just as you have succeeded with grammar  you would make a good lawyer  you should shine in politics  there is nothing to prevent you from making as great a success as mr butler has made  and minus the dyspepsia she added with a smile  they talked on she in her gently persistent way returning always to the need of thorough grounding in education and to the advantages of latin as part of the foundation for any career  she drew her ideal of the successful man and it was largely in her fathers image with a few unmistakable lines and touches of color from the image of mr butler  he listened eagerly with receptive ears lying on his back and looking up and joying in each movement of her lips as she talked  but his brain was not receptive  there was nothing alluring in the pictures she drew and he was aware of a dull pain of disappointment and of a sharper ache of love for her  in all she said there was no mention of his writing and the manuscripts he had brought to read lay neglected on the ground  at last in a pause he glanced at the sun measured its height above the horizon and suggested his manuscripts by picking them up  i had forgotten she said quickly  and i am so anxious to hear  he read to her a story one that he flattered himself was among his very best  he called it the wine of life and the wine of it that had stolen into his brain when he wrote it stole into his brain now as he read it  there was a certain magic in the original conception and he had adorned it with more magic of phrase and touch  all the old fire and passion with which he had written it were reborn in him and he was swayed and swept away so that he was blind and deaf to the faults of it but it was not so with ruth  her trained ear detected the weaknesses and exaggerations the overemphasis of the tyro and she was instantly aware each time the sentencerhythm tripped and faltered  she scarcely noted the rhythm otherwise except when it became too pompous at which moments she was disagreeably impressed with its amateurishness  that was her final judgment on the story as a wholeamateurish though she did not tell him so  instead when he had done she pointed out the minor flaws and said that she liked the story  but he was disappointed  her criticism was just  he acknowledged that but he had a feeling that he was not sharing his work with her for the purpose of schoolroom correction  the details did not matter  they could take care of themselves  he could mend them he could learn to mend them  out of life he had captured something big and attempted to imprison it in the story  it was the big thing out of life he had read to her not sentencestructure and semicolons  he wanted her to feel with him this big thing that was his that he had seen with his own eyes grappled with his own brain and placed there on the page with his own hands in printed words  well he had failed was his secret decision perhaps the editors were right  he had felt the big thing but he had failed to transmute it  he concealed his disappointment and joined so easily with her in her criticism that she did not realize that deep down in him was running a strong undercurrent of disagreement  this next thing ive called the pot he said unfolding the manuscript  it has been refused by four or five magazines now but still i think it is good  in fact i dont know what to think of it except that ive caught something there  maybe it wont affect you as it does me  its a short thingonly two thousand words  how dreadful she cried when he had finished  it is horrible unutterably horrible  he noted her pale face her eyes wide and tense and her clenched hands with secret satisfaction  he had succeeded  he had communicated the stuff of fancy and feeling from out of his brain  it had struck home  no matter whether she liked it or not it had gripped her and mastered her made her sit there and listen and forget details  it is life he said and life is not always beautiful  and yet perhaps because i am strangely made i find something beautiful there  it seems to me that the beauty is tenfold enhanced because it is there  but why couldnt the poor woman she broke in disconnectedly  then she left the revolt of her thought unexpressed to cry out oh  it is degrading  it is not nice  it is nasty  for the moment it seemed to him that his heart stood still  nasty  he had never dreamed it  he had not meant it  the whole sketch stood before him in letters of fire and in such blaze of illumination he sought vainly for nastiness  then his heart began to beat again  he was not guilty  why didnt you select a nice subject she was saying  we know there are nasty things in the world but that is no reason  she talked on in her indignant strain but he was not following her  he was smiling to himself as he looked up into her virginal face so innocent so penetratingly innocent that its purity seemed always to enter into him driving out of him all dross and bathing him in some ethereal effulgence that was as cool and soft and velvety as starshine we know there are nasty things in the world  he cuddled to him the notion of her knowing and chuckled over it as a love joke  the next moment in a flashing vision of multitudinous detail he sighted the whole sea of lifes nastiness that he had known and voyaged over and through and he forgave her for not understanding the story  it was through no fault of hers that she could not understand  he thanked god that she had been born and sheltered to such innocence  but he knew life its foulness as well as its fairness its greatness in spite of the slime that infested it and by god he was going to have his say on it to the world  saints in heavenhow could they be anything but fair and pure  no praise to them  but saints in slimeah that was the everlasting wonder  that was what made life worth while  to see moral grandeur rising out of cesspools of iniquity to rise himself and first glimpse beauty faint and far through muddripping eyes to see out of weakness and frailty and viciousness and all abysmal brutishness arising strength and truth and high spiritual endowment  he caught a stray sequence of sentences she was uttering  the tone of it all is low  and there is so much that is high  take in memoriam  he was impelled to suggest locksley hall and would have done so had not his vision gripped him again and left him staring at her the female of his kind who out of the primordial ferment creeping and crawling up the vast ladder of life for a thousand thousand centuries had emerged on the topmost rung having become one ruth pure and fair and divine and with power to make him know love and to aspire toward purity and to desire to taste divinityhim martin eden who too had come up in some amazing fashion from out of the ruck and the mire and the countless mistakes and abortions of unending creation  there was the romance and the wonder and the glory  there was the stuff to write if he could only find speech  saints in heaventhey were only saints and could not help themselves  but he was a man  you have strength he could hear her saying but it is untutored strength  like a bull in a china shop he suggested and won a smile  and you must develop discrimination  you must consult taste and fineness and tone  i dare too much he muttered  she smiled approbation and settled herself to listen to another story  i dont know what youll make of this he said apologetically  its a funny thing  im afraid i got beyond my depth in it but my intentions were good  dont bother about the little features of it  just see if you catch the feel of the big thing in it  it is big and it is true though the chance is large that i have failed to make it intelligible  he read and as he read he watched her  at last he had reached her he thought  she sat without movement her eyes steadfast upon him scarcely breathing caught up and out of herself he thought by the witchery of the thing he had created  he had entitled the story adventure and it was the apotheosis of adventurenot of the adventure of the storybooks but of real adventure the savage taskmaster awful of punishment and awful of reward faithless and whimsical demanding terrible patience and heartbreaking days and nights of toil offering the blazing sunlight glory or dark death at the end of thirst and famine or of the long drag and monstrous delirium of rotting fever through blood and sweat and stinging insects leading up by long chains of petty and ignoble contacts to royal culminations and lordly achievements  it was this all of it and more that he had put into his story and it was this he believed that warmed her as she sat and listened  her eyes were wide color was in her pale cheeks and before he finished it seemed to him that she was almost panting  truly she was warmed but she was warmed not by the story but by him  she did not think much of the story it was martins intensity of power the old excess of strength that seemed to pour from his body and on and over her  the paradox of it was that it was the story itself that was freighted with his power that was the channel for the time being through which his strength poured out to her  she was aware only of the strength and not of the medium and when she seemed most carried away by what he had written in reality she had been carried away by something quite foreign to itby a thought terrible and perilous that had formed itself unsummoned in her brain she had caught herself wondering what marriage was like and the becoming conscious of the waywardness and ardor of the thought had terrified her it was unmaidenly  it was not like her  she had never been tormented by womanhood and she had lived in a dreamland of tennysonian poesy dense even to the full significance of that delicate masters delicate allusions to the grossnesses that intrude upon the relations of queens and knights  she had been asleep always and now life was thundering imperatively at all her doors  mentally she was in a panic to shoot the bolts and drop the bars into place while wanton instincts urged her to throw wide her portals and bid the deliciously strange visitor to enter in  martin waited with satisfaction for her verdict  he had no doubt of what it would be and he was astounded when he heard her say  it is beautiful  it is beautiful she repeated with emphasis after a pause  of course it was beautiful but there was something more than mere beauty in it something more stingingly splendid which had made beauty its handmaiden  he sprawled silently on the ground watching the grisly form of a great doubt rising before him  he had failed  he was inarticulate he had seen one of the greatest things in the world and he had not expressed it  what did you think of the  he hesitated abashed at his first attempt to use a strange word  of the motif he asked  it was confused she answered  that is my only criticism in the large way  i followed the story but there seemed so much else  it is too wordy  you clog the action by introducing so much extraneous material  that was the major motif he hurriedly explained the big underrunning motif the cosmic and universal thing  i tried to make it keep time with the story itself which was only superficial after all  i was on the right scent but i guess i did it badly  i did not succeed in suggesting what i was driving at  but ill learn in time  she did not follow him  she was a bachelor of arts but he had gone beyond her limitations  this she did not comprehend attributing her incomprehension to his incoherence  you were too voluble she said  but it was beautiful in places  he heard her voice as from far off for he was debating whether he would read her the sea lyrics  he lay in dull despair while she watched him searchingly pondering again upon unsummoned and wayward thoughts of marriage  you want to be famous she asked abruptly  yes a little bit he confessed  that is part of the adventure  it is not the being famous but the process of becoming so that counts  and after all to be famous would be for me only a means to something else i want to be famous very much for that matter and for that reason  for your sake he wanted to add and might have added had she proved enthusiastic over what he had read to her  but she was too busy in her mind carving out a career for him that would at least be possible to ask what the ultimate something was which he had hinted at  there was no career for him in literature  of that she was convinced  he had proved it today with his amateurish and sophomoric productions  he could talk well but he was incapable of expressing himself in a literary way  she compared tennyson and browning and her favorite prose masters with him and to his hopeless discredit  yet she did not tell him her whole mind  her strange interest in him led her to temporize  his desire to write was after all a little weakness which he would grow out of in time  then he would devote himself to the more serious affairs of life  and he would succeed too  she knew that  he was so strong that he could not failif only he would drop writing  i wish you would show me all you write mr eden she said  he flushed with pleasure  she was interested that much was sure  and at least she had not given him a rejection slip  she had called certain portions of his work beautiful and that was the first encouragement he had ever received from any one  i will he said passionately  and i promise you miss morse that i will make good  i have come far i know that and i have far to go and i will cover it if i have to do it on my hands and knees  he held up a bunch of manuscript  here are the sea lyrics  when you get home ill turn them over to you to read at your leisure  and you must be sure to tell me just what you think of them  what i need you know above all things is criticism  and do please be frank with me  i will be perfectly frank she promised with an uneasy conviction that she had not been frank with him and with a doubt if she could be quite frank with him the next time     chapter xv   the first battle fought and finished martin said to the lookingglass ten days later  but there will be a second battle and a third battle and battles to the end of time unless  he had not finished the sentence but looked about the mean little room and let his eyes dwell sadly upon a heap of returned manuscripts still in their long envelopes which lay in a corner on the floor  he had no stamps with which to continue them on their travels and for a week they had been piling up  more of them would come in on the morrow and on the next day and the next till they were all in  and he would be unable to start them out again  he was a months rent behind on the typewriter which he could not pay having barely enough for the weeks board which was due and for the employment office fees  he sat down and regarded the table thoughtfully  there were ink stains upon it and he suddenly discovered that he was fond of it  dear old table he said ive spent some happy hours with you and youve been a pretty good friend when all is said and done  you never turned me down never passed me out a rewardofunmerit rejection slip never complained about working overtime  he dropped his arms upon the table and buried his face in them  his throat was aching and he wanted to cry  it reminded him of his first fight when he was six years old when he punched away with the tears running down his cheeks while the other boy two years his elder had beaten and pounded him into exhaustion  he saw the ring of boys howling like barbarians as he went down at last writhing in the throes of nausea the blood streaming from his nose and the tears from his bruised eyes  poor little shaver he murmured  and youre just as badly licked now youre beaten to a pulp  youre down and out  but the vision of that first fight still lingered under his eyelids and as he watched he saw it dissolve and reshape into the series of fights which had followed  six months later cheeseface that was the boy had whipped him again  but he had blacked cheesefaces eye that time  that was going some  he saw them all fight after fight himself always whipped and cheeseface exulting over him  but he had never run away  he felt strengthened by the memory of that  he had always stayed and taken his medicine  cheeseface had been a little fiend at fighting and had never once shown mercy to him  but he had stayed  he had stayed with it  next he saw a narrow alley between ramshackle frame buildings  the end of the alley was blocked by a onestory brick building out of which issued the rhythmic thunder of the presses running off the first edition of the enquirer  he was eleven and cheeseface was thirteen and they both carried the enquirer  that was why they were there waiting for their papers  and of course cheeseface had picked on him again and there was another fight that was indeterminate because at quarter to four the door of the pressroom was thrown open and the gang of boys crowded in to fold their papers  ill lick you tomorrow he heard cheeseface promise and he heard his own voice piping and trembling with unshed tears agreeing to be there on the morrow  and he had come there the next day hurrying from school to be there first and beating cheeseface by two minutes  the other boys said he was all right and gave him advice pointing out his faults as a scrapper and promising him victory if he carried out their instructions  the same boys gave cheeseface advice too  how they had enjoyed the fight  he paused in his recollections long enough to envy them the spectacle he and cheeseface had put up  then the fight was on and it went on without rounds for thirty minutes until the pressroom door was opened  he watched the youthful apparition of himself day after day hurrying from school to the enquirer alley  he could not walk very fast  he was stiff and lame from the incessant fighting  his forearms were black and blue from wrist to elbow what of the countless blows he had warded off and here and there the tortured flesh was beginning to fester  his head and arms and shoulders ached the small of his back achedhe ached all over and his brain was heavy and dazed  he did not play at school  nor did he study  even to sit still all day at his desk as he did was a torment  it seemed centuries since he had begun the round of daily fights and time stretched away into a nightmare and infinite future of daily fights  why couldnt cheeseface be licked he often thought that would put him martin out of his misery  it never entered his head to cease fighting to allow cheeseface to whip him  and so he dragged himself to the enquirer alley sick in body and soul but learning the long patience to confront his eternal enemy cheese face who was just as sick as he and just a bit willing to quit if it were not for the gang of newsboys that looked on and made pride painful and necessary  one afternoon after twenty minutes of desperate efforts to annihilate each other according to set rules that did not permit kicking striking below the belt nor hitting when one was down cheese face panting for breath and reeling offered to call it quits  and martin head on arms thrilled at the picture he caught of himself at that moment in the afternoon of long ago when he reeled and panted and choked with the blood that ran into his mouth and down his throat from his cut lips when he tottered toward cheeseface spitting out a mouthful of blood so that he could speak crying out that he would never quit though cheeseface could give in if he wanted to  and cheeseface did not give in and the fight went on  the next day and the next days without end witnessed the afternoon fight  when he put up his arms each day to begin they pained exquisitely and the first few blows struck and received racked his soul after that things grew numb and he fought on blindly seeing as in a dream dancing and wavering the large features and burning animal like eyes of cheeseface  he concentrated upon that face all else about him was a whirling void  there was nothing else in the world but that face and he would never know rest blessed rest until he had beaten that face into a pulp with his bleeding knuckles or until the bleeding knuckles that somehow belonged to that face had beaten him into a pulp and then one way or the other he would have rest  but to quitfor him martin to quitthat was impossible  came the day when he dragged himself into the enquirer alley and there was no cheeseface  nor did cheeseface come  the boys congratulated him and told him that he had licked cheeseface  but martin was not satisfied  he had not licked cheeseface nor had cheeseface licked him  the problem had not been solved  it was not until afterward that they learned that cheesefaces father had died suddenly that very day  martin skipped on through the years to the night in the nigger heaven at the auditorium  he was seventeen and just back from sea  a row started somebody was bullying somebody and martin interfered to be confronted by cheesefaces blazing eyes  ill fix you after de show his ancient enemy hissed  martin nodded  the niggerheaven bouncer was making his way toward the disturbance  ill meet you outside after the last act martin whispered the while his face showed undivided interest in the buckandwing dancing on the stage  the bouncer glared and went away  got a gang he asked cheeseface at the end of the act  sure  then i got to get one martin announced  between the acts he mustered his followingthree fellows he knew from the nail works a railroad fireman and half a dozen of the boo gang along with as many more from the dread eighteenandmarket gang  when the theatre let out the two gangs strung along inconspicuously on opposite sides of the street  when they came to a quiet corner they united and held a council of war  eighth street bridge is the place said a redheaded fellow belonging to cheesefaces gang  you kin fight in the middle under the electric light an whichever way the bulls come in we kin sneak the other way  thats agreeable to me martin said after consulting with the leaders of his own gang  the eighth street bridge crossing an arm of san antonio estuary was the length of three city blocks  in the middle of the bridge and at each end were electric lights  no policeman could pass those endlights unseen  it was the safe place for the battle that revived itself under martins eyelids  he saw the two gangs aggressive and sullen rigidly keeping apart from each other and backing their respective champions and he saw himself and cheeseface stripping  a short distance away lookouts were set their task being to watch the lighted ends of the bridge  a member of the boo gang held martins coat and shirt and cap ready to race with them into safety in case the police interfered  martin watched himself go into the centre facing cheeseface and he heard himself say as he held up his hand warningly  they aint no handshakin in this  understand  they aint nothin but scrap  no throwin up the sponge  this is a grudgefight an its to a finish  understand  somebodys goin to get licked  cheeseface wanted to demurmartin could see thatbut cheesefaces old perilous pride was touched before the two gangs  aw come on he replied  wots the good of chewin de rag about it im wit cheh to de finish  then they fell upon each other like young bulls in all the glory of youth with naked fists with hatred with desire to hurt to maim to destroy  all the painful thousand years gains of man in his upward climb through creation were lost  only the electric light remained a milestone on the path of the great human adventure  martin and cheese face were two savages of the stone age of the squatting place and the tree refuge  they sank lower and lower into the muddy abyss back into the dregs of the raw beginnings of life striving blindly and chemically as atoms strive as the stardust if the heavens strives colliding recoiling and colliding again and eternally again  god  we are animals  brutebeasts  martin muttered aloud as he watched the progress of the fight  it was to him with his splendid power of vision like gazing into a kinetoscope  he was both onlooker and participant  his long months of culture and refinement shuddered at the sight then the present was blotted out of his consciousness and the ghosts of the past possessed him and he was martin eden just returned from sea and fighting cheeseface on the eighth street bridge  he suffered and toiled and sweated and bled and exulted when his naked knuckles smashed home  they were twin whirlwinds of hatred revolving about each other monstrously  the time passed and the two hostile gangs became very quiet  they had never witnessed such intensity of ferocity and they were awed by it  the two fighters were greater brutes than they  the first splendid velvet edge of youth and condition wore off and they fought more cautiously and deliberately  there had been no advantage gained either way  its anybodys fight martin heard some one saying then he followed up a feint right and left was fiercely countered and felt his cheek laid open to the bone  no bare knuckle had done that  he heard mutters of amazement at the ghastly damage wrought and was drenched with his own blood  but he gave no sign  he became immensely wary for he was wise with knowledge of the low cunning and foul vileness of his kind  he watched and waited until he feigned a wild rush which he stopped midway for he had seen the glint of metal  hold up yer hand he screamed  thems brass knuckles an you hit me with em  both gangs surged forward growling and snarling  in a second there would be a freeforall fight and he would be robbed of his vengeance he was beside himself  you guys keep out he screamed hoarsely  understand  say dye understand  they shrank away from him  they were brutes but he was the archbrute a thing of terror that towered over them and dominated them  this is my scrap an they aint goin to be no buttin in  gimme them knuckles  cheeseface sobered and a bit frightened surrendered the foul weapon  you passed em to him you redhead sneakin in behind the push there martin went on as he tossed the knuckles into the water  i seen you an i was wonderin what you was up to  if you try anything like that again ill beat cheh to death  understand  they fought on through exhaustion and beyond to exhaustion immeasurable and inconceivable until the crowd of brutes its bloodlust sated terrified by what it saw begged them impartially to cease  and cheese face ready to drop and die or to stay on his legs and die a grisly monster out of whose features all likeness to cheeseface had been beaten wavered and hesitated but martin sprang in and smashed him again and again  next after a seeming century or so with cheeseface weakening fast in a mixup of blows there was a loud snap and martins right arm dropped to his side  it was a broken bone  everybody heard it and knew and cheeseface knew rushing like a tiger in the others extremity and raining blow on blow  martins gang surged forward to interfere  dazed by the rapid succession of blows martin warned them back with vile and earnest curses sobbed out and groaned in ultimate desolation and despair  he punched on with his left hand only and as he punched doggedly only halfconscious as from a remote distance he heard murmurs of fear in the gangs and one who said with shaking voice this aint a scrap fellows its murder an we ought to stop it  but no one stopped it and he was glad punching on wearily and endlessly with his one arm battering away at a bloody something before him that was not a face but a horror an oscillating hideous gibbering nameless thing that persisted before his wavering vision and would not go away and he punched on and on slower and slower as the last shreds of vitality oozed from him through centuries and aeons and enormous lapses of time until in a dim way he became aware that the nameless thing was sinking slowly sinking down to the rough boardplanking of the bridge and the next moment he was standing over it staggering and swaying on shaky legs clutching at the air for support and saying in a voice he did not recognize  dye want any more  say dye want any more  he was still saying it over and overdemanding entreating threatening to know if it wanted any morewhen he felt the fellows of his gang laying hands on him patting him on the back and trying to put his coat on him  and then came a sudden rush of blackness and oblivion  the tin alarmclock on the table ticked on but martin eden his face buried on his arms did not hear it  he heard nothing  he did not think  so absolutely had he relived life that he had fainted just as he fainted years before on the eighth street bridge  for a full minute the blackness and the blankness endured  then like one from the dead he sprang upright eyes flaming sweat pouring down his face shouting  i licked you cheeseface  it took me eleven years but i licked you  his knees were trembling under him he felt faint and he staggered back to the bed sinking down and sitting on the edge of it  he was still in the clutch of the past  he looked about the room perplexed alarmed wondering where he was until he caught sight of the pile of manuscripts in the corner  then the wheels of memory slipped ahead through four years of time and he was aware of the present of the books he had opened and the universe he had won from their pages of his dreams and ambitions and of his love for a pale wraith of a girl sensitive and sheltered and ethereal who would die of horror did she witness but one moment of what he had just lived throughone moment of all the muck of life through which he had waded  he arose to his feet and confronted himself in the lookingglass  and so you arise from the mud martin eden he said solemnly  and you cleanse your eyes in a great brightness and thrust your shoulders among the stars doing what all life has done letting the ape and tiger die and wresting highest heritage from all powers that be  he looked more closely at himself and laughed  a bit of hysteria and melodrama eh he queried  well never mind you licked cheeseface and youll lick the editors if it takes twice eleven years to do it in  you cant stop here  youve got to go on its to a finish you know     chapter xvi   the alarmclock went off jerking martin out of sleep with a suddenness that would have given headache to one with less splendid constitution though he slept soundly he awoke instantly like a cat and he awoke eagerly glad that the five hours of unconsciousness were gone  he hated the oblivion of sleep  there was too much to do too much of life to live  he grudged every moment of life sleep robbed him of and before the clock had ceased its clattering he was head and ears in the washbasin and thrilling to the cold bite of the water  but he did not follow his regular programme  there was no unfinished story waiting his hand no new story demanding articulation  he had studied late and it was nearly time for breakfast  he tried to read a chapter in fiske but his brain was restless and he closed the book  to day witnessed the beginning of the new battle wherein for some time there would be no writing  he was aware of a sadness akin to that with which one leaves home and family  he looked at the manuscripts in the corner  that was it  he was going away from them his pitiful dishonored children that were welcome nowhere  he went over and began to rummage among them reading snatches here and there his favorite portions  the pot he honored with reading aloud as he did adventure  joy his latestborn completed the day before and tossed into the corner for lack of stamps won his keenest approbation  i cant understand he murmured  or maybe its the editors who cant understand  theres nothing wrong with that  they publish worse every month  everything they publish is worsenearly everything anyway  after breakfast he put the typewriter in its case and carried it down into oakland  i owe a month on it he told the clerk in the store  but you tell the manager im going to work and that ill be in in a month or so and straighten up  he crossed on the ferry to san francisco and made his way to an employment office  any kind of work no trade he told the agent and was interrupted by a newcomer dressed rather foppishly as some workingmen dress who have instincts for finer things  the agent shook his head despondently  nothin doin eh said the other  well i got to get somebody today  he turned and stared at martin and martin staring back noted the puffed and discolored face handsome and weak and knew that he had been making a night of it  lookin for a job the other queried  what can you do  hard labor sailorizing run a typewriter no shorthand can sit on a horse willing to do anything and tackle anything was the answer  the other nodded  sounds good to me  my names dawson joe dawson an im tryin to scare up a laundryman  too much for me  martin caught an amusing glimpse of himself ironing fluffy white things that women wear  but he had taken a liking to the other and he added i might do the plain washing  i learned that much at sea  joe dawson thought visibly for a moment  look here lets get together an frame it up  willin to listen  martin nodded  this is a small laundry up country belongs to shelly hot springshotel you know  two men do the work boss and assistant  im the boss  you dont work for me but you work under me  think youd be willin to learn  martin paused to think  the prospect was alluring  a few months of it and he would have time to himself for study  he could work hard and study hard  good grub an a room to yourself joe said  that settled it  a room to himself where he could burn the midnight oil unmolested  but work like hell the other added  martin caressed his swelling shouldermuscles significantly  that came from hard work  then lets get to it  joe held his hand to his head for a moment gee but its a stemwinder  can hardly see  i went down the

stretching out his hand which the other shook  any advancefor railroad ticket and extras  i blew it in was joes sad answer with another reach at his aching head  all i got is a return ticket  and im brokewhen i pay my board  jump it joe advised  cant  owe it to my sister  joe whistled a long perplexed whistle and racked his brains to little purpose  ive got the price of the drinks he said desperately  come on an mebbe well cook up something  martin declined  waterwagon  this time martin nodded and joe lamented wish i was  but i somehow just cant he said in extenuation  after ive ben workin like hell all week i just got to booze up  if i didnt id cut my throat or burn up the premises  but im glad youre on the wagon stay with it  martin knew of the enormous gulf between him and this manthe gulf the books had made but he found no difficulty in crossing back over that gulf  he had lived all his life in the workingclass world and the camaraderie of labor was second nature with him  he solved the difficulty of transportation that was too much for the others aching head  he would send his trunk up to shelly hot springs on joes ticket as for himself there was his wheel  it was seventy miles and he could ride it on sunday and be ready for work monday morning  in the meantime he would go home and pack up  there was no one to say goodby to  ruth and her whole family were spending the long summer in the sierras at lake tahoe  he arrived at shelly hot springs tired and dusty on sunday night  joe greeted him exuberantly  with a wet towel bound about his aching brow he had been at work all day  part of last weeks washin mounted up me bein away to get you he explained  your box arrived all right  its in your room  but its a hell of a thing to call a trunk  an whats in it  gold bricks  joe sat on the bed while martin unpacked  the box was a packingcase for breakfast food and mr higginbotham had charged him half a dollar for it  two rope handles nailed on by martin had technically transformed it into a trunk eligible for the baggagecar  joe watched with bulging eyes a few shirts and several changes of underclothes come out of the box followed by books and more books  books clean to the bottom he asked  martin nodded and went on arranging the books on a kitchen table which served in the room in place of a washstand  gee joe exploded then waited in silence for the deduction to arise in his brain  at last it came  say you dont care for the girlsmuch he queried  no was the answer  i used to chase a lot before i tackled the books but since then theres no time  and there wont be any time here  all you can do is work an sleep  martin thought of his five hours sleep a night and smiled  the room was situated over the laundry and was in the same building with the engine that pumped water made electricity and ran the laundry machinery  the engineer who occupied the adjoining room dropped in to meet the new hand and helped martin rig up an electric bulb on an extension wire so that it travelled along a stretched cord from over the table to the bed  the next morning at quarterpast six martin was routed out for a quartertoseven breakfast  there happened to be a bathtub for the servants in the laundry building and he electrified joe by taking a cold bath  gee but youre a hummer joe announced as they sat down to breakfast in a corner of the hotel kitchen  with them was the engineer the gardener and the assistant gardener and two or three men from the stable  they ate hurriedly and gloomily with but little conversation and as martin ate and listened he realized how far he had travelled from their status  their small mental caliber was depressing to him and he was anxious to get away from them  so he bolted his breakfast a sickly sloppy affair as rapidly as they and heaved a sigh of relief when he passed out through the kitchen door  it was a perfectly appointed small steam laundry wherein the most modern machinery did everything that was possible for machinery to do martin after a few instructions sorted the great heaps of soiled clothes while joe started the masher and made up fresh supplies of soft soap compounded of biting chemicals that compelled him to swathe his mouth and nostrils and eyes in bathtowels till he resembled a mummy finished the sorting martin lent a hand in wringing the clothes  this was done by dumping them into a spinning receptacle that went at a rate of a few thousand revolutions a minute tearing the matter from the clothes by centrifugal force  then martin began to alternate between the dryer and the wringer between times shaking out socks and stockings by the afternoon one feeding and one stacking up they were running socks and stockings through the mangle while the irons were heating  then it was hot irons and underclothes till six oclock at which time joe shook his head dubiously  way behind he said  got to work after supper  and after supper they worked until ten oclock under the blazing electric lights until the last piece of underclothing was ironed and folded away in the distributing room  it was a hot california night and though the windows were thrown wide the room with its redhot ironingstove was a furnace  martin and joe down to undershirts bare armed sweated and panted for air  like trimming cargo in the tropics martin said when they went upstairs  youll do joe answered  you take hold like a good fellow  if you keep up the pace youll be on thirty dollars only one month  the second month youll be gettin your forty  but dont tell me you never ironed before  i know better  never ironed a rag in my life honestly until today martin protested  he was surprised at his weariness when he act into his room forgetful of the fact that he had been on his feet and working without let up for fourteen hours  he set the alarm clock at six and measured back five hours to one oclock  he could read until then  slipping off his shoes to ease his swollen feet he sat down at the table with his books  he opened fiske where he had left off to read  but he found trouble began to read it through a second time  then he awoke in pain from his stiffened muscles and chilled by the mountain wind that had begun to blow in through the window  he looked at the clock  it marked two  he had been asleep four hours  he pulled off his clothes and crawled into bed where he was asleep the moment after his head touched the pillow  tuesday was a day of similar unremitting toil  the speed with which joe worked won martins admiration  joe was a dozen of demons for work  he was keyed up to concert pitch and there was never a moment in the long day when he was not fighting for moments  he concentrated himself upon his work and upon how to save time pointing out to martin where he did in five motions what could be done in three or in three motions what could be done in two  elimination of waste motion martin phrased it as he watched and patterned after  he was a good workman himself quick and deft and it had always been a point of pride with him that no man should do any of his work for him or outwork him  as a result he concentrated with a similar singleness of purpose greedily snapping up the hints and suggestions thrown out by his working mate  he rubbed out collars and cuffs rubbing the starch out from between the double thicknesses of linen so that there would be no blisters when it came to the ironing and doing it at a pace that elicited joes praise  there was never an interval when something was not at hand to be done joe waited for nothing waited on nothing and went on the jump from task to task  they starched two hundred white shirts with a single gathering movement seizing a shirt so that the wristbands neckband yoke and bosom protruded beyond the circling right hand  at the same moment the left hand held up the body of the shirt so that it would not enter the starch and at the moment the right hand dipped into the starchstarch so hot that in order to wring it out their hands had to thrust and thrust continually into a bucket of cold water  and that night they worked till halfpast ten dipping fancy starchall the frilled and airy delicate wear of ladies  me for the tropics and no clothes martin laughed  and me out of a job joe answered seriously  i dont know nothin but laundrying  and you know it well  i ought to  began in the contra costa in oakland when i was eleven shakin out for the mangle  that was eighteen years ago an ive never done a tap of anything else  but this job is the fiercest i ever had ought to be one more man on it at least  we work tomorrow night  always run the mangle wednesday nightscollars an cuffs  martin set his alarm drew up to the table and opened fiske  he did not finish the first paragraph  the lines blurred and ran together and his head nodded  he walked up and down batting his head savagely with his fists but he could not conquer the numbness of sleep  he propped the book before him and propped his eyelids with his fingers and fell asleep with his eyes wide open  then he surrendered and scarcely conscious of what he did got off his clothes and into bed  he slept seven hours of heavy animallike sleep and awoke by the alarm feeling that he had not had enough  doin much readin joe asked  martin shook his head  never mind  we got to run the mangle tonight but thursday well knock off at six  thatll give you a chance  martin washed woollens that day by hand in a large barrel with strong softsoap by means of a hub from a wagon wheel mounted on a plunger pole that was attached to a springpole overhead  my invention joe said proudly  beats a washboard an your knuckles and besides it saves at least fifteen minutes in the week an fifteen minutes aint to be sneezed at in this shebang  running the collars and cuffs through the mangle was also joes idea that night while they toiled on under the electric lights he explained it  something no laundry ever does except this one  an i got to do it if im goin to get done saturday afternoon at three oclock  but i know how an thats the difference  got to have right heat right pressure and run em through three times  look at that  he held a cuff aloft couldnt do it better by hand or on a tiler  thursday joe was in a rage  a bundle of extra fancy starch had come in  im goin to quit he announced  i wont stand for it  im goin to quit it cold  whats the good of me workin like a slave all week a savin minutes an them acomin an ringin in fancystarch extras on me  this is a free country an im to tell that fat dutchman what i think of him  an i wont tell m in french  plain united states is good enough for me  him aringin in fancy starch extras  we got to work tonight he said the next moment reversing his judgment and surrendering to fate  and martin did no reading that night  he had seen no daily paper all week and strangely to him felt no desire to see one  he was not interested in the news  he was too tired and jaded to be interested in anything though he planned to leave saturday afternoon if they finished at three and ride on his wheel to oakland  it was seventy miles and the same distance back on sunday afternoon would leave him anything but rested for the second weeks work  it would have been easier to go on the train but the round trip was two dollars and a half and he was intent on saving money     chapter xvii   martin learned to do many things  in the course of the first week in one afternoon he and joe accounted for the two hundred white shirts  joe ran the tiler a machine wherein a hot iron was hooked on a steel string which furnished the pressure  by this means he ironed the yoke wristbands and neckband setting the latter at right angles to the shirt and put the glossy finish on the bosom  as fast as he finished them he flung the shirts on a rack between him and martin who caught them up and backed them  this task consisted of ironing all the unstarched portions of the shirts  it was exhausting work carried on hour after hour at top speed  out on the broad verandas of the hotel men and women in cool white sipped iced drinks and kept their circulation down  but in the laundry the air was sizzling  the huge stove roared red hot and white hot while the irons moving over the damp cloth sent up clouds of steam  the heat of these irons was different from that used by housewives  an iron that stood the ordinary test of a wet finger was too cold for joe and martin and such test was useless  they went wholly by holding the irons close to their cheeks gauging the heat by some secret mental process that martin admired but could not understand  when the fresh irons proved too hot they hooked them on iron rods and dipped them into cold water  this again required a precise and subtle judgment  a fraction of a second too long in the water and the fine and silken edge of the proper heat was lost and martin found time to marvel at the accuracy he developedan automatic accuracy founded upon criteria that were machinelike and unerring  but there was little time in which to marvel  all martins consciousness was concentrated in the work  ceaselessly active head and hand an intelligent machine all that constituted him a man was devoted to furnishing that intelligence  there was no room in his brain for the universe and its mighty problems  all the broad and spacious corridors of his mind were closed and hermetically sealed  the echoing chamber of his soul was a narrow room a conning tower whence were directed his arm and shoulder muscles his ten nimble fingers and the swiftmoving iron along its steaming path in broad sweeping strokes just so many strokes and no more just so far with each stroke and not a fraction of an inch farther rushing along interminable sleeves sides backs and tails and tossing the finished shirts without rumpling upon the receiving frame and even as his hurrying soul tossed it was reaching for another shirt this went on hour after hour while outside all the world swooned under the overhead california sun  but there was no swooning in that superheated room  the cool guests on the verandas needed clean linen  the sweat poured from martin  he drank enormous quantities of water but so great was the heat of the day and of his exertions that the water sluiced through the interstices of his flesh and out at all his pores always at sea except at rare intervals the work he performed had given him ample opportunity to commune with himself  the master of the ship had been lord of martins time but here the manager of the hotel was lord of martins thoughts as well  he had no thoughts save for the nerve racking bodydestroying toil  outside of that it was impossible to think  he did not know that he loved ruth  she did not even exist for his driven soul had no time to remember her  it was only when he crawled to bed at night or to breakfast in the morning that she asserted herself to him in fleeting memories  this is hell aint it joe remarked once  martin nodded but felt a rasp of irritation  the statement had been obvious and unnecessary  they did not talk while they worked conversation threw them out of their stride as it did this time compelling martin to miss a stroke of his iron and to make two extra motions before he caught his stride again  on friday morning the washer ran  twice a week they had to put through hotel linenthe sheets pillowslips spreads tablecloths and napkins  this finished they buckled down to fancy starch  it was slow work fastidious and delicate and martin did not learn it so readily  besides he could not take chances  mistakes were disastrous  see that joe said holding up a filmy corsetcover that he could have crumpled from view in one hand  scorch that an its twenty dollars out of your wages  so martin did not scorch that and eased down on his muscular tension though nervous tension rose higher than ever and he listened sympathetically to the others blasphemies as he toiled and suffered over the beautiful things that women wear when they do not have to do their own laundrying  fancy starch was martins nightmare and it was joes too  it was fancy starch that robbed them of their hardwon minutes they toiled at it all day  at seven in the evening they broke off to run the hotel linen through the mangle  at ten oclock while the hotel guests slept the two laundrymen sweated on at fancy starch till midnight till one till two  at halfpast two they knocked off  saturday morning it was fancy starch and odds and ends and at three in the afternoon the weeks work was done  you aint agoin to ride them seventy miles into oakland on top of this joe demanded as they sat on the stairs and took a triumphant smoke  got to was the answer  what are you goin fora girl  no to save two and a half on the railroad ticket  i want to renew some books at the library  why dont you send em down an up by express  thatll cost only a quarter each way  martin considered it  an take a rest tomorrow the other urged  you need it  i know i do  im plumb tuckered out  he looked it  indomitable never resting fighting for seconds and minutes all week circumventing delays and crushing down obstacles a fount of resistless energy a highdriven human motor a demon for work now that he had accomplished the weeks task he was in a state of collapse  he was worn and haggard and his handsome face drooped in lean exhaustion  he pulled his cigarette spiritlessly and his voice was peculiarly dead and monotonous  all the snap and fire had gone out of him  his triumph seemed a sorry one  an next week we got to do it all over again he said sadly  an whats the good of it all hey  sometimes i wish i was a hobo  they dont work an they get their livin  gee  i wish i had a glass of beer but i cant get up the gumption to go down to the village an get it  youll stay over an send your books dawn by express or else youre a damn fool  but what can i do here all day sunday martin asked  rest  you dont know how tired you are  why im that tired sunday i cant even read the papers  i was sick oncetyphoid  in the hospital two months an a half  didnt do a tap of work all that time  it was beautiful  it was beautiful he repeated dreamily a minute later  martin took a bath after which he found that the head laundryman had disappeared  most likely he had gone for a glass of beer martin decided but the halfmile walk down to the village to find out seemed a long journey to him  he lay on his bed with his shoes off trying to make up his mind  he did not reach out for a book  he was too tired to feel sleepy and he lay scarcely thinking in a semistupor of weariness until it was time for supper  joe did not appear for that function and when martin heard the gardener remark that most likely he was ripping the slats off the bar martin understood  he went to bed immediately afterward and in the morning decided that he was greatly rested  joe being still absent martin procured a sunday paper and lay down in a shady nook under the trees  the morning passed he knew not how  he did not sleep nobody disturbed him and he did not finish the paper  he came back to it in the afternoon after dinner and fell asleep over it  so passed sunday and monday morning he was hard at work sorting clothes while joe a towel bound tightly around his head with groans and blasphemies was running the washer and mixing softsoap  i simply cant help it he explained  i got to drink when saturday night comes around  another week passed a great battle that continued under the electric lights each night and that culminated on saturday afternoon at three oclock when joe tasted his moment of wilted triumph and then drifted down to the village to forget  martins sunday was the same as before he slept in the shade of the trees toiled aimlessly through the newspaper and spent long hours lying on his back doing nothing thinking nothing  he was too dazed to think though he was aware that he did not like himself  he was selfrepelled as though he had undergone some degradation or was intrinsically foul  all that was godlike in him was blotted out  the spur of ambition was blunted he had no vitality with which to feel the prod of it  he was dead  his soul seemed dead he was a beast a workbeast  he saw no beauty in the sunshine sifting down through the green leaves nor did the azure vault of the sky whisper as of old and hint of cosmic vastness and secrets trembling to disclosure  life was intolerably dull and stupid and its taste was bad in his mouth  a black screen was drawn across his mirror of inner vision and fancy lay in a darkened sickroom where entered no ray of light  he envied joe down in the village rampant tearing the slats off the bar his brain gnawing with maggots exulting in maudlin ways over maudlin things fantastically and gloriously drunk and forgetful of monday morning and the week of deadening toil to come  a third week went by and martin loathed himself and loathed life  he was oppressed by a sense of failure  there was reason for the editors refusing his stuff  he could see that clearly now and laugh at himself and the dreams he had dreamed  ruth returned his sea lyrics by mail he read her letter apathetically  she did her best to say how much she liked them and that they were beautiful  but she could not lie and she could not disguise the truth from herself  she knew they were failures and he read her disapproval in every perfunctory and unenthusiastic line of her letter  and she was right  he was firmly convinced of it as he read the poems over  beauty and wonder had departed from him and as he read the poems he caught himself puzzling as to what he had had in mind when he wrote them  his audacities of phrase struck him as grotesque his felicities of expression were monstrosities and everything was absurd unreal and impossible  he would have burned the sea lyrics on the spot had his will been strong enough to set them aflame  there was the engineroom but the exertion of carrying them to the furnace was not worth while  all his exertion was used in washing other persons clothes  he did not have any left for private affairs  he resolved that when sunday came he would pull himself together and answer ruths letter  but saturday afternoon after work was finished and he had taken a bath the desire to forget overpowered him  i guess ill go down and see how joes getting on was the way he put it to himself and in the same moment he knew that he lied  but he did not have the energy to consider the lie  if he had had the energy he would have refused to consider the lie because he wanted to forget  he started for the village slowly and casually increasing his pace in spite of himself as he neared the saloon  i thought you was on the waterwagon was joes greeting  martin did not deign to offer excuses but called for whiskey filling his own glass brimming before he passed the bottle  dont take all night about it he said roughly  the other was dawdling with the bottle and martin refused to wait for him tossing the glass off in a gulp and refilling it  now i can wait for you he said grimly but hurry up  joe hurried and they drank together  the work did it eh joe queried  martin refused to discuss the matter  its fair hell i know the other went on but i kind of hate to see you come off the wagon mart  well heres how  martin drank on silently biting out his orders and invitations and awing the barkeeper an effeminate country youngster with watery blue eyes and hair parted in the middle  its something scandalous the way they work us poor devils joe was remarking  if i didnt bowl up id break loose an burn down the shebang  my bowlin up is all that saves em i can tell you that  but martin made no answer  a few more drinks and in his brain he felt the maggots of intoxication beginning to crawl  ah it was living the first breath of life he had breathed in three weeks  his dreams came back to him  fancy came out of the darkened room and lured him on a thing of flaming brightness  his mirror of vision was silverclear a flashing dazzling palimpsest of imagery  wonder and beauty walked with him hand in hand and all power was his  he tried to tell it to joe but joe had visions of his own infallible schemes whereby he would escape the slavery of laundrywork and become himself the owner of a great steam laundry  i tell yeh mart they wont be no kids workin in my laundrynot on yer life  an they wont be no workin a livin soul after six pm  you hear me talk  theyll be machinery enough an hands enough to do it all in decent workin hours an mart shelp me ill make yeh superintendent of the shebangthe whole of it all of it  now heres the scheme  i get on the waterwagon an save my money for two yearssave an then  but martin turned away leaving him to tell it to the barkeeper until that worthy was called away to furnish drinks to two farmers who coming in accepted martins invitation  martin dispensed royal largess inviting everybody up farmhands a stableman and the gardeners assistant from the hotel the barkeeper and the furtive hobo who slid in like a shadow and like a shadow hovered at the end of the bar     chapter xviii   monday morning joe groaned over the first truck load of clothes to the washer  i say he began  dont talk to me martin snarled  im sorry joe he said at noon when they knocked off for dinner  tears came into the others eyes  thats all right old man he said  were in hell an we cant help ourselves  an you know i kind of like you a whole lot  thats what made ithurt  i cottoned to you from the first  martin shook his hand  lets quit joe suggested  lets chuck it an go hoboin  i aint never tried it but it must be dead easy  an nothin to do  just think of it nothin to do  i was sick once typhoid in the hospital an it was beautiful  i wish id get sick again  the week dragged on  the hotel was full and extra fancy starch poured in upon them  they performed prodigies of valor  they fought late each night under the electric lights bolted their meals and even got in a half hours work before breakfast  martin no longer took his cold baths every moment was drive drive drive and joe was the masterful shepherd of moments herding them carefully never losing one counting them over like a miser counting gold working on in a frenzy toilmad a feverish machine aided ably by that other machine that thought of itself as once having been one martin eden a man  but it was only at rare moments that martin was able to think  the house of thought was closed its windows boarded up and he was its shadowy caretaker  he was a shadow  joe was right  they were both shadows and this was the unending limbo of toil  or was it a dream  sometimes in the steaming sizzling heat as he swung the heavy irons back and forth over the white garments it came to him that it was a dream  in a short while or maybe after a thousand years or so he would awake in his little room with the inkstained table and take up his writing where he had left off the day before  or maybe that was a dream too and the awakening would be the changing of the watches when he would drop down out of his bunk in the lurching forecastle and go up on deck under the tropic stars and take the wheel and feel the cool tradewind blowing through his flesh  came saturday and its hollow victory at three oclock  guess ill go down an get a glass of beer joe said in the queer monotonous tones that marked his weekend collapse  martin seemed suddenly to wake up  he opened the kit bag and oiled his wheel putting graphite on the chain and adjusting the bearings  joe was halfway down to the saloon when martin passed by bending low over the handlebars his legs driving the ninetysix gear with rhythmic strength his face set for seventy miles of road and grade and dust  he slept in oakland that night and on sunday covered the seventy miles back  and on monday morning weary he began the new weeks work but he had kept sober  a fifth week passed and a sixth during which he lived and toiled as a machine with just a spark of something more in him just a glimmering bit of soul that compelled him at each weekend to scorch off the hundred and forty miles  but this was not rest  it was supermachinelike and it helped to crush out the glimmering bit of soul that was all that was left him from former life  at the end of the seventh week without intending it too weak to resist he drifted down to the village with joe and drowned life and found life until monday morning  again at the weekends he ground out the one hundred and forty miles obliterating the numbness of too great exertion by the numbness of still greater exertion  at the end of three months he went down a third time to the village with joe  he forgot and lived again and living he saw in clear illumination the beast he was making of himselfnot by the drink but by the work  the drink was an effect not a cause  it followed inevitably upon the work as the night follows upon the day  not by becoming a toilbeast could he win to the heights was the message the whiskey whispered to him and he nodded approbation  the whiskey was wise  it told secrets on itself  he called for paper and pencil and for drinks all around and while they drank his very good health he clung to the bar and scribbled  a telegram joe he said  read it  joe read it with a drunken quizzical leer  but what he read seemed to sober him  he looked at the other reproachfully tears oozing into his eyes and down his cheeks  you aint goin back on me mart he queried hopelessly  martin nodded and called one of the loungers to him to take the message to the telegraph office  hold on joe muttered thickly  lemme think  he held on to the bar his legs wobbling under him martins arm around him and supporting him while he thought  make that two laundrymen he said abruptly  here lemme fix it  what are you quitting for martin demanded  same reason as you  but im going to sea  you cant do that  nope was the answer but i can hobo all right all right  martin looked at him searchingly for a moment then cried  by god i think youre right  better a hobo than a beast of toil  why man youll live  and thats more than you ever did before  i was in hospital once joe corrected  it was beautiful  typhoiddid i tell you  while martin changed the telegram to two laundrymen joe went on  i never wanted to drink when i was in hospital  funny aint it  but when ive ben workin like a slave all week i just got to bowl up  ever noticed that cooks drink like hellan bakers too  its the work theyve sure got to  here lemme pay half of that telegram  ill shake you for it martin offered  come on everybody drink joe called as they rattled the dice and rolled them out on the damp bar  monday morning joe was wild with anticipation  he did not mind his aching head nor did he take interest in his work  whole herds of moments stole away and were lost while their careless shepherd gazed out of the window at the sunshine and the trees  just look at it he cried  an its all mine  its free  i can lie down under them trees an sleep for a thousan years if i want to  aw come on mart lets chuck it  whats the good of waitin another moment  thats the land of nothin to do out there an i got a ticket for itan it aint no return ticket bgosh  a few minutes later filling the truck with soiled clothes for the washer joe spied the hotel managers shirt  he knew its mark and with a sudden glorious consciousness of freedom he threw it on the floor and stamped on it  i wish you was in it you pigheaded dutchman he shouted  in it an right there where ive got you  take that an that an that damn you hold me back somebody  hold me back  martin laughed and held him to his work  on tuesday night the new laundrymen arrived and the rest of the week was spent breaking them into the routine  joe sat around and explained his system but he did no more work  not a tap he announced  not a tap  they can fire me if they want to but if they do ill quit  no more work in mine thank you kindly me for the freight cars an the shade under the trees  go to it you slaves  thats right  slave an sweat  slave an sweat  an when youre dead youll rot the same as me an whats it matter how you liveeh  tell me thatwhats it matter in the long run  on saturday they drew their pay and came to the parting of the ways  they aint no use in me askin you to change your mind an hit the road with me joe asked hopelessly  martin shook his head  he was standing by his wheel ready to start they shook hands and joe held on to his for a moment as he said  im goin to see you again mart before you an me die  thats straight dope  i feel it in my bones  goodby mart an be good  i like you like hell you know  he stood a forlorn figure in the middle of the road watching until martin turned a bend and was gone from sight  hes a good indian that boy he muttered  a good indian  then he plodded down the road himself to the water tank where half a dozen empties lay on a sidetrack waiting for the up freight     chapter xix   ruth and her family were home again and martin returned to oakland saw much of her  having gained her degree she was doing no more studying and he having worked all vitality out of his mind and body was doing no writing  this gave them time for each other that they had never had before and their intimacy ripened fast  at first martin had done nothing but rest  he had slept a great deal and spent long hours musing and thinking and doing nothing  he was like one recovering from some terrible bout if hardship  the first signs of reawakening came when he discovered more than languid interest in the daily paper  then he began to read againlight novels and poetry and after several days more he was head over heels in his longneglected fiske  his splendid body and health made new vitality and he possessed all the resiliency and rebound of youth  ruth showed her disappointment plainly when he announced that he was going to sea for another voyage as soon as he was well rested  why do you want to do that she asked  money was the answer  ill have to lay in a supply for my next attack on the editors  money is the sinews of war in my casemoney and patience  but if all you wanted was money why didnt you stay in the laundry  because the laundry was making a beast of me  too much work of that sort drives to drink  she stared at him with horror in her eyes  do you mean she quavered  it would have been easy for him to get out of it but his natural impulse was for frankness and he remembered his old resolve to be frank no matter what happened  yes he answered  just that  several times  she shivered and drew away from him  no man that i have ever known did thatever did that  then they never worked in the laundry at shelly hot springs he laughed bitterly  toil is a good thing  it is necessary for human health so all the preachers say and heaven knows ive never been afraid of it  but there is such a thing as too much of a good thing and the laundry up there is one of them  and thats why im going to sea one more voyage it will be my last i think for when i come back i shall break into the magazines  i am certain of it  she was silent unsympathetic and he watched her moodily realizing how impossible it was for her to understand what he had been through  some day i shall write it upthe degradation of toil or the psychology of drink in the workingclass or something like that for a title  never since the first meeting had they seemed so far apart as that day his confession told in frankness with the spirit of revolt behind had repelled her  but she was more shocked by the repulsion itself than by the cause of it  it pointed out to her how near she had drawn to him and once accepted it paved the way for greater intimacy  pity too was aroused and innocent idealistic thoughts of reform  she would save this raw young man who had come so far  she would save him from the curse of his early environment and she would save him from himself in spite of himself  and all this affected her as a very noble state of consciousness nor did she dream that behind it and underlying it were the jealousy and desire of love  they rode on their wheels much in the delightful fall weather and out in the hills they read poetry aloud now one and now the other noble uplifting poetry that turned ones thoughts to higher things renunciation sacrifice patience industry and high endeavor were the principles she thus indirectly preachedsuch abstractions being objectified in her mind by her father and mr butler and by andrew carnegie who from a poor immigrant boy had arisen to be the bookgiver of the world  all of which was appreciated and enjoyed by martin  he followed her mental processes more clearly now and her soul was no longer the sealed wonder it had been  he was on terms of intellectual equality with her  but the points of disagreement did not affect his love  his love was more ardent than ever for he loved her for what she was and even her physical frailty was an added charm in his eyes  he read of sickly elizabeth barrett who for years had not placed her feet upon the ground until that day of flame when she eloped with browning and stood upright upon the earth under the open sky and what browning had done for her martin decided he could do for ruth  but first she must love him  the rest would be easy  he would give her strength and health  and he caught glimpses of their life in the years to come wherein against a background of work and comfort and general wellbeing he saw himself and ruth reading and discussing poetry she propped amid a multitude of cushions on the ground while she read aloud to him  this was the key to the life they would live  and always he saw that particular picture  sometimes it was she who leaned against him while he read one arm about her her head upon his shoulder  sometimes they pored together over the printed pages of beauty  then too she loved nature and with generous imagination he changed the scene of their readingsometimes they read in closedin valleys with precipitous walls or in high mountain meadows and again down by the gray sanddunes with a wreath of billows at their feet or afar on some volcanic tropic isle where waterfalls descended and became mist reaching the sea in vapor veils that swayed and shivered to every vagrant wisp of wind  but always in the foreground lords of beauty and eternally reading and sharing lay he and ruth and always in the background that was beyond the background of nature dim and hazy were work and success and money earned that made them free of the world and all its treasures  i should recommend my little girl to be careful her mother warned her one day  i know what you mean  but it is impossible  he if not  ruth was blushing but it was the blush of maidenhood called upon for the first time to discuss the sacred things of life with a mother held equally sacred  your kind  her mother finished the sentence for her  ruth nodded  i did not want to say it but he is not  he is rough brutal strongtoo strong  he has not  she hesitated and could not go on  it was a new experience talking over such matters with her mother  and again her mother completed her thought for her  he has not lived a clean life is what you wanted to say  again ruth nodded and again a blush mantled her face  it is just that she said  it has not been his fault but he has played much with  with pitch  yes with pitch  and he frightens me  sometimes i am positively in terror of him when he talks in that free and easy way of the things he has doneas if they did not matter  they do matter dont they  they sat with their arms twined around each other and in the pause her mother patted her hand and waited for her to go on  but i am interested in him dreadfully she continued  in a way he is my protege  then too he is my first boy friendbut not exactly friend rather protege and friend combined  sometimes too when he frightens me it seems that he is a bulldog i have taken for a plaything like some of the frat girls and he is tugging hard and showing his teeth and threatening to break loose  again her mother waited  he interests me i suppose like the bulldog  and there is much good in him too but there is much in him that i would not like inin the other way  you see i have been thinking  he swears he smokes he drinks he has fought with his fists he has told me so and he likes it he says so  he is all that a man should not bea man i would want for my her voice sank very lowhusband  then he is too strong  my prince must be tall and slender and darka graceful bewitching prince  no there is no danger of my failing in love with martin eden  it would be the worst fate that could befall me  but it is not that that i spoke about her mother equivocated  have you thought about him  he is so ineligible in every way you know and suppose he should come to love you  but he doesalready she cried  it was to be expected mrs morse said gently  how could it be otherwise with any one who knew you  olney hates me she exclaimed passionately  and i hate olney  i feel always like a cat when he is around  i feel that i must be nasty to him and even when i dont happen to feel that way why hes nasty to me anyway  but i am happy with martin eden  no one ever loved me beforeno man i mean in that way  and it is sweet to be lovedthat way  you know what i mean mother dear  it is sweet to feel that you are really and truly a woman  she buried her face in her mothers lap sobbing you think i am dreadful i know but i am honest and i tell you just how i feel  mrs morse was strangely sad and happy  her childdaughter who was a bachelor of arts was gone but in her place was a womandaughter  the experiment had succeeded  the strange void in ruths nature had been filled and filled without danger or penalty  this rough sailorfellow had been the instrument and though ruth did not love him he had made her conscious of her womanhood  his hand trembles ruth was confessing her face for shames sake still buried  it is most amusing and ridiculous but i feel sorry for him too  and when his hands are too trembly and his eyes too shiny why i lecture him about his life and the wrong way he is going about it to mend it  but he worships me i know  his eyes and his hands do not lie  and it makes me feel grownup the thought of it the very thought of it and i feel that i am possessed of something that is by rights my ownthat makes me like the other girlsandand young women  and then too i knew that i was not like them before and i knew that it worried you  you thought you did not let me know that dear worry of yours but i did and i wanted toto make good as martin eden says  it was a holy hour for mother and daughter and their eyes were wet as they talked on in the twilight ruth all white innocence and frankness her mother sympathetic receptive yet calmly explaining and guiding  he is four years younger than you she said  he has no place in the world  he has neither position nor salary  he is impractical  loving you he should in the name of common sense be doing something that would give him the right to marry instead of paltering around with those stories of his and with childish dreams  martin eden i am afraid will never grow up  he does not take to responsibility and a mans work in the world like your father did or like all our friends mr butler for one  martin eden i am afraid will never be a moneyearner  and this world is so ordered that money is necessary to happinessoh no not these swollen fortunes but enough of money to permit of common comfort and decency  hehe has never spoken  he has not breathed a word  he has not attempted to but if he did i would not let him because you see i do not love him  i am glad of that  i should not care to see my daughter my one daughter who is so clean and pure love a man like him  there are noble men in the world who are clean and true and manly  wait for them  you will find one some day and you will love him and be loved by him and you will be happy with him as your father and i have been happy with each other  and there is one thing you must always carry in mind  yes mother  mrs morses voice was low and sweet as she said and that is the children  ihave thought about them ruth confessed remembering the wanton thoughts that had vexed her in the past her face again red with maiden shame that she should be telling such things  and it is that the children that makes mr eden impossible mrs morse went on incisively  their heritage must be clean and he is i am afraid not clean  your father has told me of sailors lives andand you understand  ruth pressed her mothers hand in assent feeling that she really did understand though her conception was of something vague remote and terrible that was beyond the scope of imagination  you know i do nothing without telling you she began  only sometimes you must ask me like this time  i wanted to tell you but i did not know how  it is false modesty i know it is that but you can make it easy for me  sometimes like this time you must ask me you must give me a chance  why mother you are a woman too she cried exultantly as they stood up catching her mothers hands and standing erect facing her in the twilight conscious of a strangely sweet equality between them  i should never have thought of you in that way if we had not had this talk i had to learn that i was a woman to know that you were one too  we are women together her mother said drawing her to her and kissing her  we are women together she repeated as they went out of the room their arms around each others waists their hearts swelling with a new sense of companionship  our little girl has become a woman mrs morse said proudly to her husband an hour later  that means he said after a long look at his wife that means she is in love  no but that she is loved was the smiling rejoinder  the experiment has succeeded  she is awakened at last  then well have to get rid of him  mr morse spoke briskly in matter offact businesslike tones  but his wife shook her head  it will not be necessary  ruth says he is going to sea in a few days  when he comes back she will not be here  we will send her to aunt claras  and besides a year in the east with the change in climate people ideas and everything is just the thing she needs     chapter xx   the desire to write was stirring in martin once more  stories and poems were springing into spontaneous creation in his brain and he made notes of them against the future time when he would give them expression  but he did not write  this was his little vacation he had resolved to devote it to rest and love and in both matters he prospered  he was soon spilling over with vitality and each day he saw ruth at the moment of meeting she experienced the old shock of his strength and health  be careful her mother warned her once again  i am afraid you are seeing too much of martin eden  but ruth laughed from security  she was sure of herself and in a few days he would be off to sea  then by the time he returned she would be away on her visit east  there was a magic however in the strength and health of martin  he too had been told of her contemplated eastern trip and he felt the need for haste  yet he did not know how to make love to a girl like ruth  then too he was handicapped by the possession of a great fund of experience with girls and women who had been absolutely different from her  they had known about love and life and flirtation while she knew nothing about such things  her prodigious innocence appalled him freezing on his lips all ardors of speech and convincing him in spite of himself of his own unworthiness  also he was handicapped in another way  he had himself never been in love before  he had liked women in that turgid past of his and been fascinated by some of them but he had not known what it was to love them  he had whistled in a masterful careless way and they had come to him  they had been diversions incidents part of the game men play but a small part at most  and now and for the first time he was a suppliant tender and timid and doubting  he did not know the way of love nor its speech while he was frightened at his loved ones clear innocence  in the course of getting acquainted with a varied world whirling on through the ever changing phases of it he had learned a rule of conduct which was to the effect that when one played a strange game he should let the other fellow play first  this had stood him in good stead a thousand times and trained him as an observer as well  he knew how to watch the thing that was strange and to wait for a weakness for a place of entrance to divulge itself  it was like sparring for an opening in fistfighting  and when such an opening came he knew by long experience to play for it and to play hard  so he waited with ruth and watched desiring to speak his love but not daring  he was afraid of shocking her and he was not sure of himself had he but known it he was following the right course with her  love came into the world before articulate speech and in its own early youth it had learned ways and means that it had never forgotten  it was in this old primitive way that martin wooed ruth  he did not know he was doing it at first though later he divined it  the touch of his hand on hers was vastly more potent than any word he could utter the impact of his strength on her imagination was more alluring than the printed poems and spoken passions of a thousand generations of lovers  whatever his tongue could express would have appealed in part to her judgment but the touch of hand the fleeting contact made its way directly to her instinct  her judgment was as young as she but her instincts were as old as the race and older  they had been young when love was young and they were wiser than convention and opinion and all the newborn things so her judgment did not act  there was no call upon it and she did not realize the strength of the appeal martin made from moment to moment to her lovenature  that he loved her on the other hand was as clear as day and she consciously delighted in beholding his lovemanifestationsthe glowing eyes with their tender lights the trembling hands and the never failing swarthy flush that flooded darkly under his sunburn  she even went farther in a timid way inciting him but doing it so delicately that he never suspected and doing it half consciously so that she scarcely suspected herself  she thrilled with these proofs of her power that proclaimed her a woman and she took an evelike delight in tormenting him and playing upon him  tonguetied by inexperience and by excess of ardor wooing unwittingly and awkwardly martin continued his approach by contact  the touch of his hand was pleasant to her and something deliciously more than pleasant  martin did not know it but he did know that it was not distasteful to her  not that they touched hands often save at meeting and parting but that in handling the bicycles in strapping on the books of verse they carried into the hills and in conning the pages of books side by side there were opportunities for hand to stray against hand and there were opportunities too for her hair to brush his cheek and for shoulder to touch shoulder as they leaned together over the beauty of the books  she smiled to herself at vagrant impulses which arose from nowhere and suggested that she rumple his hair while he desired greatly when they tired of reading to rest his head in her lap and dream with closed eyes about the future that was to be theirs  on sunday picnics at shellmound park and schuetzen park in the past he had rested his head on many laps and usually he had slept soundly and selfishly while the girls shaded his face from the sun and looked down and loved him and wondered at his lordly carelessness of their love  to rest his head in a girls lap had been the easiest thing in the world until now and now he found ruths lap inaccessible and impossible  yet it was right here in his reticence that the strength of his wooing lay  it was because of this reticence that he never alarmed her  herself fastidious and timid she never awakened to the perilous trend of their intercourse  subtly and unaware she grew toward him and closer to him while he sensing the growing closeness longed to dare but was afraid  once he dared one afternoon when he found her in the darkened living room with a blinding headache  nothing can do it any good she had answered his inquiries  and besides i dont take headache powders  doctor hall wont permit me  i can cure it i think and without drugs was martins answer  i am not sure of course but id like to try  its simply massage  i learned the trick first from the japanese  they are a race of masseurs you know  then i learned it all over again with variations from the hawaiians  they call it lomilomi  it can accomplish most of the things drugs accomplish and a few things that drugs cant  scarcely had his hands touched her head when she sighed deeply  that is so good she said  she spoke once again half an hour later when she asked arent you tired  the question was perfunctory and she knew what the answer would be  then she lost herself in drowsy contemplation of the soothing balm of his strength life poured from the ends of his fingers driving the pain before it or so it seemed to her until with the easement of pain she fell asleep and he stole away  she called him up by telephone that evening to thank him  i slept until dinner she said  you cured me completely mr eden and i dont know how to thank you  he was warm and bungling of speech and very happy as he replied to her and there was dancing in his mind throughout the telephone conversation the memory of browning and of sickly elizabeth barrett what had been done could be done again and he martin eden could do it and would do it for ruth morse  he went back to his room and to the volume of spencers sociology lying open on the bed  but he could not read  love tormented him and overrode his will so that despite all determination he found himself at the little inkstained table  the sonnet he composed that night was the first of a lovecycle of fifty sonnets which was completed within two months  he had the lovesonnets from the portuguese in mind as he wrote and he wrote under the best conditions for great work at a climacteric of living in the throes of his own sweet lovemadness  the many hours he was not with ruth he devoted to the lovecycle to reading at home or to the public readingrooms where he got more closely in touch with the magazines of the day and the nature of their policy and content  the hours he spent with ruth were maddening alike in promise and in inconclusiveness  it was a week after he cured her headache that a moonlight sail on lake merritt was proposed by norman and seconded by arthur and olney  martin was the only one capable of handling a boat and he was pressed into service  ruth sat near him in the stern while the three young fellows lounged amidships deep in a wordy wrangle over frat affairs  the moon had not yet risen and ruth gazing into the starry vault of the sky and exchanging no speech with martin experienced a sudden feeling of loneliness  she glanced at him  a puff of wind was heeling the boat over till the deck was awash and he one hand on tiller and the other on mainsheet was luffing slightly at the same time peering ahead to make out the nearlying north shore  he was unaware of her gaze and she watched him intently speculating fancifully about the strange warp of soul that led him a young man with signal powers to fritter away his time on the writing of stories and poems foredoomed to mediocrity and failure  her eyes wandered along the strong throat dimly seen in the starlight and over the firmpoised head and the old desire to lay her hands upon his neck came back to her  the strength she abhorred attracted her  her feeling of loneliness became more pronounced and she felt tired  her position on the heeling boat irked her and she remembered the headache he had cured and the soothing rest that resided in him  he was sitting beside her quite beside her and the boat seemed to tilt her toward him then arose in her the impulse to lean against him to rest herself against his strengtha vague halfformed impulse which even as she considered it mastered her and made her lean toward him  or was it the heeling of the boat  she did not know  she never knew  she knew only that she was leaning against him and that the easement and soothing rest were very good  perhaps it had been the boats fault but she made no effort to retrieve it  she leaned lightly against his shoulder but she leaned and she continued to lean when he shifted his position to make it more comfortable for her  it was a madness but she refused to consider the madness  she was no longer herself but a woman with a womans clinging need and though she leaned ever so lightly the need seemed satisfied  she was no longer tired  martin did not speak  had he the spell would have been broken but his reticence of love prolonged it  he was dazed and dizzy  he could not understand what was happening  it was too wonderful to be anything but a delirium  he conquered a mad desire to let go sheet and tiller and to clasp her in his arms  his intuition told him it was the wrong thing to do and he was glad that sheet and tiller kept his hands occupied and fended off temptation  but he luffed the boat less delicately spilling the wind shamelessly from the sail so as to prolong the tack to the north shore  the shore would compel him to go about and the contact would be broken  he sailed with skill stopping way on the boat without exciting the notice of the wranglers and mentally forgiving his hardest voyages in that they had made this marvellous night possible giving him mastery over sea and boat and wind so that he could sail with her beside him her dear weight against him on his shoulder  when the first light of the rising moon touched the sail illuminating the boat with pearly radiance ruth moved away from him  and even as she moved she felt him move away  the impulse to avoid detection was mutual  the episode was tacitly and secretly intimate  she sat apart from him with burning cheeks while the full force of it came home to her  she had been guilty of something she would not have her brothers see nor olney see  why had she done it  she had never done anything like it in her life and yet she had been moonlightsailing with young men before  she had never desired to do anything like it  she was overcome with shame and with the mystery of her own burgeoning womanhood she stole a glance at martin who was busy putting the boat about on the other tack and she could have hated him for having made her do an immodest and shameful thing  and he of all men  perhaps her mother was right and she was seeing too much of him  it would never happen again she resolved and she would see less of him in the future  she entertained a wild idea of explaining to him the first time they were alone together of lying to him of mentioning casually the attack of faintness that had overpowered her just before the moon came up  then she remembered how they had drawn mutually away before the revealing moon and she knew he would know it for a lie  in the days that swiftly followed she was no longer herself but a strange puzzling creature wilful over judgment and scornful of self analysis refusing to peer into the future or to think about herself and whither she was drifting  she was in a fever of tingling mystery alternately frightened and charmed and in constant bewilderment  she had one idea firmly fixed however which insured her security  she would not let martin speak his love  as long as she did this all would be well  in a few days he would be off to sea  and even if he did speak all would be well  it could not be otherwise for she did not love him  of course it would be a painful half hour for him and an embarrassing half hour for her because it would be her first proposal she thrilled deliciously at the thought  she was really a woman with a man ripe to ask for her in marriage  it was a lure to all that was fundamental in her sex  the fabric of her life of all that constituted her quivered and grew tremulous  the thought fluttered in her mind like a flameattracted moth  she went so far as to imagine martin proposing herself putting the words into his mouth and she rehearsed her refusal tempering it with kindness and exhorting him to true and noble manhood and especially he must stop smoking cigarettes  she would make a point of that  but no she must not let him speak at all  she could stop him and she had told her mother that she would  all flushed and burning she regretfully dismissed the conjured situation  her first proposal would have to be deferred to a more propitious time and a more eligible suitor     chapter xxi   came a beautiful fall day warm and languid palpitant with the hush of the changing season a california indian summer day with hazy sun and wandering wisps of breeze that did not stir the slumber of the air  filmy purple mists that were not vapors but fabrics woven of color hid in the recesses of the hills  san francisco lay like a blur of smoke upon her heights  the intervening bay was a dull sheen of molten metal whereon sailing craft lay motionless or drifted with the lazy tide  far tamalpais barely seen in the silver haze bulked hugely by the golden gate the latter a pale gold pathway under the westering sun  beyond the pacific dim and vast was raising on its skyline tumbled cloudmasses that swept landward giving warning of the first blustering breath of winter  the erasure of summer was at hand  yet summer lingered fading and fainting among her hills deepening the purple of her valleys spinning a shroud of haze from waning powers and sated raptures dying with the calm content of having lived and lived well  and among the hills on their favorite knoll martin and ruth sat side by side their heads bent over the same pages he reading aloud from the lovesonnets of the woman who had loved browning as it is given to few men to be loved  but the reading languished  the spell of passing beauty all about them was too strong  the golden year was dying as it had lived a beautiful and unrepentant voluptuary and reminiscent rapture and content freighted heavily the air  it entered into them dreamy and languorous weakening the fibres of resolution suffusing the face of morality or of judgment with haze and purple mist  martin felt tender and melting and from time to time warm glows passed over him  his head was very near to hers and when wandering phantoms of breeze stirred her hair so that it touched his face the printed pages swam before his eyes  i dont believe you know a word of what you are reading she said once when he had lost his place  he looked at her with burning eyes and was on the verge of becoming awkward when a retort came to his lips  i dont believe you know either  what was the last sonnet about  i dont know she laughed frankly  ive already forgotten  dont let us read any more  the day is too beautiful  it will be our last in the hills for some time he announced gravely theres a storm gathering out there on the searim  the book slipped from his hands to the ground and they sat idly and silently gazing out over the dreamy bay with eyes that dreamed and did not see  ruth glanced sidewise at his neck  she did not lean toward him  she was drawn by some force outside of herself and stronger than gravitation strong as destiny  it was only an inch to lean and it was accomplished without volition on her part  her shoulder touched his as lightly as a butterfly touches a flower and just as lightly was the counterpressure  she felt his shoulder press hers and a tremor run through him  then was the time for her to draw back  but she had become an automaton  her actions had passed beyond the control of her willshe never thought of control or will in the delicious madness that was upon her  his arm began to steal behind her and around her  she waited its slow progress in a torment of delight  she waited she knew not for what panting with dry burning lips a leaping pulse and a fever of expectancy in all her blood  the girdling arm lifted higher and drew her toward him drew her slowly and caressingly  she could wait no longer with a tired sigh and with an impulsive movement all her own unpremeditated spasmodic she rested her head upon his breast  his head bent over swiftly and as his lips approached hers flew to meet them  this must be love she thought in the one rational moment that was vouchsafed her  if it was not love it was too shameful  it could be nothing else than love  she loved the man whose arms were around her and whose lips were pressed to hers  she pressed more tightly to him with a snuggling movement of her body  and a moment later tearing herself half out of his embrace suddenly and exultantly she reached up and placed both hands upon martin edens sunburnt neck  so exquisite was the pang of love and desire fulfilled that she uttered a low moan relaxed her hands and lay halfswooning in his arms  not a word had been spoken and not a word was spoken for a long time twice he bent and kissed her and each time her lips met his shyly and her body made its happy nestling movement  she clung to him unable to release herself and he sat half supporting her in his arms as he gazed with unseeing eyes at the blur of the great city across the bay  for once there were no visions in his brain  only colors and lights and glows pulsed there warm as the day and warm as his love  he bent over her  she was speaking  when did you love me she whispered  from the first the very first the first moment i laid eye on you  i was mad for love of you then and in all the time that has passed since then i have only grown the madder  i am maddest now dear  i am almost a lunatic my head is so turned with joy  i am glad i am a woman martindear she said after a long sigh  he crushed her in his arms again and again and then asked  and you  when did you first know  oh i knew it all the time almost from the first  and i have been as blind as a bat he cried a ring of vexation in his voice  i never dreamed it until just how when iwhen i kissed you  i didnt mean that  she drew herself partly away and looked at him  i meant i knew you loved almost from the first  and you he demanded  it came to me suddenly  she was speaking very slowly her eyes warm and fluttery and melting a soft flush on her cheeks that did not go away  i never knew until just now whenyou put your arms around me and i never expected to marry you martin not until just now  how did you make me love you  i dont know he laughed unless just by loving you for i loved you hard enough to melt the heart of a stone much less the heart of the living breathing woman you are  this is so different from what i thought love would be she announced irrelevantly  what did you think it would be like  i didnt think it would be like this  she was looking into his eyes at the moment but her own dropped as she continued you see i didnt know what this was like  he offered to draw her toward him again but it was no more than a tentative muscular movement of the girdling arm for he feared that he might be greedy  then he felt her body yielding and once again she was close in his arms and lips were pressed on lips  what will my people say she queried with sudden apprehension in one of the pauses  i dont know  we can find out very easily any time we are so minded  but if mamma objects  i am sure i am afraid to tell her  let me tell her he volunteered valiantly  i think your mother does not like me but i can win her around  a fellow who can win you can win anything  and if we dont  yes  why well have each other  but theres no danger not winning your mother to our marriage  she loves you too well  i should not like to break her heart ruth said pensively  he felt like assuring her that mothers hearts were not so easily broken but instead he said and love is the greatest thing in the world  do you know martin you sometimes frighten me  i am frightened now when i think of you and of what you have been  you must be very very good to me  remember after all that i am only a child  i never loved before  nor i  we are both children together  and we are fortunate above most for we have found our first love in each other  but that is impossible she cried withdrawing herself from his arms with a swift passionate movement  impossible for you  you have been a sailor and sailors i have heard areare  her voice faltered and died away  are addicted to having a wife in every port he suggested  is that what you mean  yes she answered in a low voice  but that is not love  he spoke authoritatively  i have been in many ports but i never knew a passing touch of love until i saw you that first night  do you know when i said good night and went away i was almost arrested  arrested  yes  the policeman thought i was drunk and i was toowith love for you  but you said we were children and i said it was impossible for you and we have strayed away from the point  i said that i never loved anybody but you he replied  you are my first my very first  and yet you have been a sailor she objected  but that doesnt prevent me from loving you the first  and there have been womenother womenoh  and to martin edens supreme surprise she burst into a storm of tears that took more kisses than one and many caresses to drive away  and all the while there was running through his head kiplings line and the colonels lady and judy ogrady are sisters under their skins  it was true he decided though the novels he had read had led him to believe otherwise  his idea for which the novels were responsible had been that only formal proposals obtained in the upper classes  it was all right enough down whence he had come for youths and maidens to win each other by contact but for the exalted personages up above on the heights to make love in similar fashion had seemed unthinkable  yet the novels were wrong  here was a proof of it  the same pressures and caresses unaccompanied by speech that were efficacious with the girls of the workingclass were equally efficacious with the girls above the working class  they were all of the same flesh after all sisters under their skins and he might have known as much himself had he remembered his spencer  as he held ruth in his arms and soothed her he took great consolation in the thought that the colonels lady and judy ogrady were pretty much alike under their skins  it brought ruth closer to him made her possible  her dear flesh was as anybodys flesh as his flesh  there was no bar to their marriage  class difference was the only difference and class was extrinsic  it could be shaken off  a slave he had read had risen to the roman purple  that being so then he could rise to ruth  under her purity and saintliness and culture and ethereal beauty of soul she was in things fundamentally human just like lizzie connolly and all lizzie connollys  all that was possible of them was possible of her  she could love and hate maybe have hysterics and she could certainly be jealous as she was jealous now uttering her last sobs in his arms  besides i am older than you she remarked suddenly opening her eyes and looking up at him three years older  hush you are only a child and i am forty years older than you in experience was his answer  in truth they were children together so far as love was concerned and they were as naive and immature in the expression of their love as a pair of children and this despite the fact that she was crammed with a university education and that his head was full of scientific philosophy and the hard facts of life  they sat on through the passing glory of the day talking as lovers are prone to talk marvelling at the wonder of love and at destiny that had flung them so strangely together and dogmatically believing that they loved to a degree never attained by lovers before  and they returned insistently again and again to a rehearsal of their first impressions of each other and to hopeless attempts to analyze just precisely what they felt for each other and how much there was of it  the cloudmasses on the western horizon received the descending sun and the circle of the sky turned to rose while the zenith glowed with the same warm color  the rosy light was all about them flooding over them as she sang goodby sweet day  she sang softly leaning in the cradle of his arm her hands in his their hearts in each others hands     chapter xxii   mrs morse did not require a mothers intuition to read the advertisement in ruths face when she returned home  the flush that would not leave the cheeks told the simple story and more eloquently did the eyes large and bright reflecting an unmistakable inward glory  what has happened mrs morse asked having bided her time till ruth had gone to bed  you know ruth queried with trembling lips  for reply her mothers arm went around her and a hand was softly caressing her hair  he did not speak she blurted out  i did not intend that it should happen and i would never have let him speakonly he didnt speak  but if he did not speak then nothing could have happened could it  but it did just the same  in the name of goodness child what are you babbling about mrs morse was bewildered  i dont think i know what happened after all  what did happen  ruth looked at her mother in surprise  i thought you knew  why were engaged martin and i  mrs morse laughed with incredulous vexation  no he didnt speak ruth explained  he just loved me that was all i was as surprised as you are  he didnt say a word  he just put his arm around me  andand i was not myself  and he kissed me and i kissed him  i couldnt help it  i just had to  and then i knew i loved him  she paused waiting with expectancy the benediction of her mothers kiss but mrs morse was coldly silent  it is a dreadful accident i know ruth recommenced with a sinking voice  and i dont know how you will ever forgive me  but i couldnt help it  i did not dream that i loved him until that moment  and you must tell father for me  would it not be better not to tell your father  let me see martin eden and talk with him and explain  he will understand and release you  no no ruth cried starting up  i do not want to be released  i love him and love is very sweet  i am going to marry himof course if you will let me  we have other plans for you ruth dear your father and ioh no no no man picked out for you or anything like that  our plans go no farther than your marrying some man in your own station in life a good and honorable gentleman whom you will select yourself when you love him  but i love martin already was the plaintive protest  we would not influence your choice in any way but you are our daughter and we could not bear to see you make a marriage such as this  he has nothing but roughness and coarseness to offer you in exchange for all that is refined and delicate in you  he is no match for you in any way he could not support you  we have no foolish ideas about wealth but comfort is another matter and our daughter should at least marry a man who can give her thatand not a penniless adventurer a sailor a cowboy a smuggler and heaven knows what else who in addition to everything is harebrained and irresponsible  ruth was silent  every word she recognized as true  he wastes his time over his writing trying to accomplish what geniuses and rare men with college educations sometimes accomplish  a man thinking of marriage should be preparing for marriage  but not he  as i have said and i know you agree with me he is irresponsible  and why should he not be  it is the way of sailors  he has never learned to be economical or temperate  the spendthrift years have marked him  it is not his fault of course but that does not alter his nature  and have you thought of the years of licentiousness he inevitably has lived  have you thought of that daughter  you know what marriage means  ruth shuddered and clung close to her mother  i have thought  ruth waited a long time for the thought to frame itself  and it is terrible  it sickens me to think of it  i told you it was a dreadful accident my loving him but i cant help myself  could you help loving father  then it is the same with me  there is something in me in himi never knew it was there until todaybut it is there and it makes me love him  i never thought to love him but you see i do she concluded a certain faint triumph in her voice  they talked long and to little purpose in conclusion agreeing to wait an indeterminate time without doing anything  the same conclusion was reached a little later that night between mrs morse and her husband after she had made due confession of the miscarriage of her plans  it could hardly have come otherwise was mr morses judgment  this sailorfellow has been the only man she was in touch with  sooner or later she was going to awaken anyway and she did awaken and lo here was this sailorfellow the only accessible man at the moment and of course she promptly loved him or thought she did which amounts to the same thing  mrs morse took it upon herself to work slowly and indirectly upon ruth rather than to combat her  there would be plenty of time for this for martin was not in position to marry  let her see all she wants of him was mr morses advice  the more she knows him the less shell love him i wager  and give her plenty of contrast  make a point of having young people at the house  young women and young men all sorts of young men clever men men who have done something or who are doing things men of her own class gentlemen  she can gauge him by them  they will show him up for what he is  and after all he is a mere boy of twentyone  ruth is no more than a child  it is calf love with the pair of them and they will grow out of it  so the matter rested  within the family it was accepted that ruth and martin were engaged but no announcement was made  the family did not think it would ever be necessary  also it was tacitly understood that it was to be a long engagement  they did not ask martin to go to work nor to cease writing  they did not intend to encourage him to mend himself  and he aided and abetted them in their unfriendly designs for going to work was farthest from his thoughts  i wonder if youll like what i have done he said to ruth several days later  ive decided that boarding with my sister is too expensive and i am going to board myself  ive rented a little room out in north oakland retired neighborhood and all the rest you know and ive bought an oilburner on which to cook  ruth was overjoyed  the oilburner especially pleased her  that was the way mr butler began his start she said  martin frowned inwardly at the citation of that worthy gentleman and went on i put stamps on all my manuscripts and started them off to the editors again  then today i moved in and tomorrow i start to work  a position she cried betraying the gladness of her surprise in all her body nestling closer to him pressing his hand smiling  and you never told me  what is it  he shook his head  i meant that i was going to work at my writing  her face fell and he went on hastily  dont misjudge me  i am not going in this time with any iridescent ideas  it is to be a cold prosaic matteroffact business proposition  it is better than going to sea again and i shall earn more money than any position in oakland can bring an unskilled man  you see this vacation i have taken has given me perspective  i havent been working the life out of my body and i havent been writing at least not for publication  all ive done has been to love you and to think  ive read some too but it has been part of my thinking and i have read principally magazines  i have generalized about myself and the world my place in it and my chance to win to a place that will be fit for you  also ive been reading spencers philosophy of style and found out a lot of what was the matter with meor my writing rather and for that matter with most of the writing that is published every month in the magazines  but the upshot of it allof my thinking and reading and lovingis that i am going to move to grub street  i shall leave masterpieces alone and do hackworkjokes paragraphs feature articles humorous verse and society verseall the rot for which there seems so much demand  then there are the newspaper syndicates and the newspaper shortstory syndicates and the syndicates for the sunday supplements  i can go ahead and hammer out the stuff they want and earn the equivalent of a good salary by it  there are freelances you know who earn as much as four or five hundred a month  i dont care to become as they but ill earn a good living and have plenty of time to myself which i wouldnt have in any position  then ill have my spare time for study and for real work  in between the grind ill try my hand at masterpieces and ill study and prepare myself for the writing of masterpieces  why i am amazed at the distance i have come already  when i first tried to write i had nothing to write about except a few paltry experiences which i neither understood nor appreciated  but i had no thoughts  i really didnt  i didnt even have the words with which to think  my experiences were so many meaningless pictures  but as i began to add to my knowledge and to my vocabulary i saw something more in my experiences than mere pictures  i retained the pictures and i found their interpretation  that was when i began to do good work when i wrote adventure  joy the pot the wine of life the jostling street the lovecycle and the sea lyrics  i shall write more like them and better but i shall do it in my spare time  my feet are on the solid earth now  hackwork and income first masterpieces afterward  just to show you i wrote half a dozen jokes last night for the comic weeklies and just as i was going to bed the thought struck me to try my hand at a trioleta humorous one and inside an hour i had written four  they ought to be worth a dollar apiece  four dollars right there for a few afterthoughts on the way to bed  of course its all valueless just so much dull and sordid plodding but it is no more dull and sordid than keeping books at sixty dollars a month adding up endless columns of meaningless figures until one dies and furthermore the hackwork keeps me in touch with things literary and gives me time to try bigger things  but what good are these biggerthings these masterpieces ruth demanded  you cant sell them  oh yes i can he began but she interrupted  all those you named and which you say yourself are goodyou have not sold any of them  we cant get married on masterpieces that wont sell  then well get married on triolets that will sell he asserted stoutly putting his arm around her and drawing a very unresponsive sweetheart toward him  listen to this he went on in attempted gayety  its not art but its a dollar     he came in    when i was out    to borrow some tin    was why he came in    and he went without    so i was in    and he was out  the merry lilt with which he had invested the jingle was at variance with the dejection that came into his face as he finished  he had drawn no smile from ruth  she was looking at him in an earnest and troubled way  it may be a dollar she said but it is a jesters dollar the fee of a clown  dont you see martin the whole thing is lowering  i want the man i love and honor to be something finer and higher than a perpetrator of jokes and doggerel  you want him to be likesay mr butler he suggested  i know you dont like mr butler she began  mr butlers all right he interrupted  its only his indigestion i find fault with  but to save me i cant see any difference between writing jokes or comic verse and running a typewriter taking dictation or keeping sets of books  it is all a means to an end  your theory is for me to begin with keeping books in order to become a successful lawyer or man of business  mine is to begin with hackwork and develop into an able author  there is a difference she insisted  what is it  why your good work what you yourself call good you cant sell  you have tried you know thatbut the editors wont buy it  give me time dear he pleaded  the hackwork is only makeshift and i dont take it seriously  give me two years  i shall succeed in that time and the editors will be glad to buy my good work  i know what i am saying i have faith in myself  i know what i have in me i know what literature is now i know the average rot that is poured out by a lot of little men and i know that at the end of two years i shall be on the highroad to success  as for business i shall never succeed at it  i am not in sympathy with it  it strikes me as dull and stupid and mercenary and tricky  anyway i am not adapted for it  id never get beyond a clerkship and how could you and i be happy on the paltry earnings of a clerk  i want the best of everything in the world for you and the only time when i wont want it will be when there is something better  and im going to get it going to get all of it  the income of a successful author makes mr butler look cheap  a bestseller will earn anywhere between fifty and a hundred thousand dollarssometimes more and sometimes less but as a rule pretty close to those figures  she remained silent her disappointment was apparent  well he asked  i had hoped and planned otherwise  i had thought and i still think that the best thing for you would be to study shorthandyou already know typewritingand go into fathers office  you have a good mind and i am confident you would succeed as a lawyer     chapter xxiii   that ruth had little faith in his power as a writer did not alter her nor diminish her in martins eyes  in the breathing spell of the vacation he had taken he had spent many hours in selfanalysis and thereby learned much of himself  he had discovered that he loved beauty more than fame and that what desire he had for fame was largely for ruths sake  it was for this reason that his desire for fame was strong he wanted to be great in the worlds eyes to make good as he expressed it in order that the woman he loved should be proud of him and deem him worthy  as for himself he loved beauty passionately and the joy of serving her was to him sufficient wage  and more than beauty he loved ruth  he considered love the finest thing in the world  it was love that had worked the revolution in him changing him from an uncouth sailor to a student and an artist therefore to him the finest and greatest of the three greater than learning and artistry was love  already he had discovered that his brain went beyond ruths just as it went beyond the brains of her brothers or the brain of her father  in spite of every advantage of university training and in the face of her bachelorship of arts his power of intellect overshadowed hers and his year or so of selfstudy and equipment gave him a mastery of the affairs of the world and art and life that she could never hope to possess  all this he realized but it did not affect his love for her nor her love for him  love was too fine and noble and he was too loyal a lover for him to besmirch love with criticism  what did love have to do with ruths divergent views on art right conduct the french revolution or equal suffrage  they were mental processes but love was beyond reason it was superrational  he could not belittle love  he worshipped it love lay on the mountaintops beyond the valleyland of reason  it was a sublimates condition of existence the topmost peak of living and it came rarely  thanks to the school of scientific philosophers he favored he knew the biological significance of love but by a refined process of the same scientific reasoning he reached the conclusion that the human organism achieved its highest purpose in love that love must not be questioned but must be accepted as the highest guerdon of life  thus he considered the lover blessed over all creatures and it was a delight to him to think of gods own mad lover rising above the things of earth above wealth and judgment public opinion and applause rising above life itself and dying on a kiss  much of this martin had already reasoned out and some of it he reasoned out later  in the meantime he worked taking no recreation except when he went to see ruth and living like a spartan  he paid two dollars and a half a month rent for the small room he got from his portuguese landlady maria silva a virago and a widow hard working and harsher tempered rearing her large brood of children somehow and drowning her sorrow and fatigue at irregular intervals in a gallon of the thin sour wine that she bought from the corner grocery and saloon for fifteen cents  from detesting her and her foul tongue at first martin grew to admire her as he observed the brave fight she made  there were but four rooms in the little housethree when martins was subtracted  one of these the parlor gay with an ingrain carpet and dolorous with a funeral card and a deathpicture of one of her numerous departed babes was kept strictly for company  the blinds were always down and her barefooted tribe was never permitted to enter the sacred precinct save on state occasions  she cooked and all ate in the kitchen where she likewise washed starched and ironed clothes on all days of the week except sunday for her income came largely from taking in washing from her more prosperous neighbors  remained the bedroom small as the one occupied by martin into which she and her seven little ones crowded and slept  it was an everlasting miracle to martin how it was accomplished and from her side of the thin partition he heard nightly every detail of the going to bed the squalls and squabbles the soft chattering and the sleepy twittering noises as of birds  another source of income to maria were her cows two of them which she milked night and morning and which gained a surreptitious livelihood from vacant lots and the grass that grew on either side the public side walks attended always by one or more of her ragged boys whose watchful guardianship consisted chiefly in keeping their eyes out for the poundmen  in his own small room martin lived slept studied wrote and kept house  before the one window looking out on the tiny front porch was the kitchen table that served as desk library and typewriting stand the bed against the rear wall occupied twothirds of the total space of the room  the table was flanked on one side by a gaudy bureau manufactured for profit and not for service the thin veneer of which was shed day by day  this bureau stood in the corner and in the opposite corner on the tables other flank was the kitchenthe oilstove on a drygoods box inside of which were dishes and cooking utensils a shelf on the wall for provisions and a bucket of water on the floor  martin had to carry his water from the kitchen sink there being no tap in his room  on days when there was much steam to his cooking the harvest of veneer from the bureau was unusually generous  over the bed hoisted by a tackle to the ceiling was his bicycle  at first he had tried to keep it in the basement but the tribe of silva loosening the bearings and puncturing the tires had driven him out  next he attempted the tiny front porch until a howling southeaster drenched the wheel a nightlong then he had retreated with it to his room and slung it aloft  a small closet contained his clothes and the books he had accumulated and for which there was no room on the table or under the table  hand in hand with reading he had developed the habit of making notes and so copiously did he make them that there would have been no existence for him in the confined quarters had he not rigged several clotheslines across the room on which the notes were hung  even so he was crowded until navigating the room was a difficult task  he could not open the door without first closing the closet door and vice versa  it was impossible for him anywhere to traverse the room in a straight line  to go from the door to the head of the bed was a zigzag course that he was never quite able to accomplish in the dark without collisions  having settled the difficulty of the conflicting doors he had to steer sharply to the right to avoid the kitchen  next he sheered to the left to escape the foot of the bed but this sheer if too generous brought him against the corner of the table  with a sudden twitch and lurch he terminated the sheer and bore off to the right along a sort of canal one bank of which was the bed the other the table  when the one chair in the room was at its usual place before the table the canal was unnavigable  when the chair was not in use it reposed on top of the bed though sometimes he sat on the chair when cooking reading a book while the water boiled and even becoming skilful enough to manage a paragraph or two while steak was frying  also so small was the little corner that constituted the kitchen he was able sitting down to reach anything he needed  in fact it was expedient to cook sitting down standing up he was too often in his own way  in conjunction with a perfect stomach that could digest anything he possessed knowledge of the various foods that were at the same time nutritious and cheap  peasoup was a common article in his diet as well as potatoes and beans the latter large and brown and cooked in mexican style  rice cooked as american housewives never cook it and can never learn to cook it appeared on martins table at least once a day  dried fruits were less expensive than fresh and he had usually a pot of them cooked and ready at hand for they took the place of butter on his bread occasionally he graced his table with a piece of roundsteak or with a soupbone  coffee without cream or milk he had twice a day in the evening substituting tea but both coffee and tea were excellently cooked  there was need for him to be economical  his vacation had consumed nearly all he had earned in the laundry and he was so far from his market that weeks must elapse before he could hope for the first returns from his hackwork  except at such times as he saw ruth or dropped in to see his sister gertude he lived a recluse in each day accomplishing at least three days labor of ordinary men  he slept a scant five hours and only one with a constitution of iron could have held himself down as martin did day after day to nineteen consecutive hours of toil  he never lost a moment  on the lookingglass were lists of definitions and pronunciations when shaving or dressing or combing his hair he conned these lists over  similar lists were on the wall over the oilstove and they were similarly conned while he was engaged in cooking or in washing the dishes  new lists continually displaced the old ones  every strange or partly familiar word encountered in his reading was immediately jotted down and later when a sufficient number had been accumulated were typed and pinned to the wall or lookingglass  he even carried them in his pockets and reviewed them at odd moments on the street or while waiting in butcher shop or grocery to be served  he went farther in the matter  reading the works of men who had arrived he noted every result achieved by them and worked out the tricks by which they had been achievedthe tricks of narrative of exposition of style the points of view the contrasts the epigrams and of all these he made lists for study  he did not ape  he sought principles  he drew up lists of effective and fetching mannerisms till out of many such culled from many writers he was able to induce the general principle of mannerism and thus equipped to cast about for new and original ones of his own and to weigh and measure and appraise them properly  in similar manner he collected lists of strong phrases the phrases of living language phrases that bit like acid and scorched like flame or that glowed and were mellow and luscious in the midst of the arid desert of common speech  he sought always for the principle that lay behind and beneath  he wanted to know how the thing was done after that he could do it for himself  he was not content with the fair face of beauty  he dissected beauty in his crowded little bedroom laboratory where cooking smells alternated with the outer bedlam of the silva tribe and having dissected and learned the anatomy of beauty he was nearer being able to create beauty itself  he was so made that he could work only with understanding  he could not work blindly in the dark ignorant of what he was producing and trusting to chance and the star of his genius that the effect produced should be right and fine  he had no patience with chance effects  he wanted to know why and how  his was deliberate creative genius and before he began a story or poem the thing itself was already alive in his brain with the end in sight and the means of realizing that end in his conscious possession  otherwise the effort was doomed to failure  on the other hand he appreciated the chance effects in words and phrases that came lightly and easily into his brain and that later stood all tests of beauty and power and developed tremendous and incommunicable connotations  before such he bowed down and marvelled knowing that they were beyond the deliberate creation of any man  and no matter how much he dissected beauty in search of the principles that underlie beauty and make beauty possible he was aware always of the innermost mystery of beauty to which he did not penetrate and to which no man had ever penetrated  he knew full well from his spencer that man can never attain ultimate knowledge of anything and that the mystery of beauty was no less than that of lifenay more that the fibres of beauty and life were intertwisted and that he himself was but a bit of the same nonunderstandable fabric twisted of sunshine and stardust and wonder  in fact it was when filled with these thoughts that he wrote his essay entitled stardust in which he had his fling not at the principles of criticism but at the principal critics  it was brilliant deep philosophical and deliciously touched with laughter  also it was promptly rejected by the magazines as often as it was submitted  but having cleared his mind of it he went serenely on his way  it was a habit he developed of incubating and maturing his thought upon a subject and of then rushing into the typewriter with it  that it did not see print was a matter a small moment with him  the writing of it was the culminating act of a long mental process the drawing together of scattered threads of thought and the final generalizing upon all the data with which his mind was burdened  to write such an article was the conscious effort by which he freed his mind and made it ready for fresh material and problems  it was in a way akin to that common habit of men and women troubled by real or fancied grievances who periodically and volubly break their longsuffering silence and have their say till the last word is said     chapter xxiv   the weeks passed  martin ran out of money and publishers checks were far away as ever  all his important manuscripts had come back and been started out again and his hackwork fared no better  his little kitchen was no longer graced with a variety of foods  caught in the pinch with a part sack of rice and a few pounds of dried apricots rice and apricots was his menu three times a day for five days handrunning  then he startled to realize on his credit  the portuguese grocer to whom he had hitherto paid cash called a halt when martins bill reached the magnificent total of three dollars and eightyfive cents  for you see said the grocer you no catcha da work i losa da mon  and martin could reply nothing  there was no way of explaining  it was not true business principle to allow credit to a strongbodied young fellow of the workingclass who was too lazy to work  you catcha da job i let you have mora da grub the grocer assured martin  no job no grub  thata da business  and then to show that it was purely business foresight and not prejudice hava da drink on da housegood friends justa da same  so martin drank in his easy way to show that he was good friends with the house and then went supperless to bed  the fruit store where martin had bought his vegetables was run by an american whose business principles were so weak that he let martin run a bill of five dollars before stopping his credit  the baker stopped at two dollars and the butcher at four dollars  martin added his debts and found that he was possessed of a total credit in all the world of fourteen dollars and eightyfive cents  he was up with his typewriter rent but he estimated that he could get two months credit on that which would be eight dollars  when that occurred he would have exhausted all possible credit  the last purchase from the fruit store had been a sack of potatoes and for a week he had potatoes and nothing but potatoes three times a day an occasional dinner at ruths helped to keep strength in his body though he found it tantalizing enough to refuse further helping when his appetite was raging at sight of so much food spread before it  now and again though afflicted with secret shame he dropped in at his sisters at mealtime and ate as much as he daredmore than he dared at the morse table  day by day he worked on and day by day the postman delivered to him rejected manuscripts  he had no money for stamps so the manuscripts accumulated in a heap under the table  came a day when for forty hours he had not tasted food  he could not hope for a meal at ruths for she was away to san rafael on a two weeks visit and for very shames sake he could not go to his sisters  to cap misfortune the postman in his afternoon round brought him five returned manuscripts  then it was that martin wore his overcoat down into oakland and came back without it but with five dollars tinkling in his pocket  he paid a dollar each on account to the four tradesmen and in his kitchen fried steak and onions made coffee and stewed a large pot of prunes  and having dined he sat down at his tabledesk and completed before midnight an essay which he entitled the dignity of usury  having typed it out he flung it under the table for there had been nothing left from the five dollars with which to buy stamps  later on he pawned his watch and still later his wheel reducing the amount available for food by putting stamps on all his manuscripts and sending them out  he was disappointed with his hackwork  nobody cared to buy  he compared it with what he found in the newspapers weeklies and cheap magazines and decided that his was better far better than the average yet it would not sell  then he discovered that most of the newspapers printed a great deal of what was called plate stuff and he got the address of the association that furnished it  his own work that he sent in was returned along with a stereotyped slip informing him that the staff supplied all the copy that was needed  in one of the great juvenile periodicals he noted whole columns of incident and anecdote  here was a chance  his paragraphs were returned and though he tried repeatedly he never succeeded in placing one  later on when it no longer mattered he learned that the associate editors and subeditors augmented their salaries by supplying those paragraphs themselves  the comic weeklies returned his jokes and humorous verse and the light society verse he wrote for the large magazines found no abidingplace  then there was the newspaper storiette  he knew that he could write better ones than were published  managing to obtain the addresses of two newspaper syndicates he deluged them with storiettes when he had written twenty and failed to place one of them he ceased and yet from day to day he read storiettes in the dailies and weeklies scores and scores of storiettes not one of which would compare with his in his despondency he concluded that he had no judgment whatever that he was hypnotized by what he wrote and that he was a selfdeluded pretender  the inhuman editorial machine ran smoothly as ever  he folded the stamps in with his manuscript dropped it into the letterbox and from three weeks to a month afterward the postman came up the steps and handed him the manuscript  surely there were no live warm editors at the other end  it was all wheels and cogs and oilcupsa clever mechanism operated by automatons  he reached stages of despair wherein he doubted if editors existed at all  he had never received a sign of the existence of one and from absence of judgment in rejecting all he wrote it seemed plausible that editors were myths manufactured and maintained by office boys typesetters and pressmen  the hours he spent with ruth were the only happy ones he had and they were not all happy  he was afflicted always with a gnawing restlessness more tantalizing than in the old days before he possessed her love for now that he did possess her love the possession of her was far away as ever  he had asked for two years time was flying and he was achieving nothing  again he was always conscious of the fact that she did not approve what he was doing  she did not say so directly  yet indirectly she let him understand it as clearly and definitely as she could have spoken it  it was not resentment with her but disapproval though less sweetnatured women might have resented where she was no more than disappointed  her disappointment lay in that this man she had taken to mould refused to be moulded  to a certain extent she had found his clay plastic then it had developed stubbornness declining to be shaped in the image of her father or of mr butler  what was great and strong in him she missed or worse yet misunderstood  this man whose clay was so plastic that he could live in any number of pigeonholes of human existence she thought wilful and most obstinate because she could not shape him to live in her pigeonhole which was the only one she knew  she could not follow the flights of his mind and when his brain got beyond her she deemed him erratic  nobody elses brain ever got beyond her  she could always follow her father and mother her brothers and olney wherefore when she could not follow martin she believed the fault lay with him  it was the old tragedy of insularity trying to serve as mentor to the universal  you worship at the shrine of the established he told her once in a discussion they had over praps and vanderwater  i grant that as authorities to quote they are most excellentthe two foremost literary critics in the united states  every school teacher in the land looks up to vanderwater as the dean of american criticism  yet i read his stuff and it seems to me the perfection of the felicitous expression of the inane  why he is no more than a ponderous bromide thanks to gelett burgess  and praps is no better  his hemlock mosses for instance is beautifully written  not a comma is out of place and the toneahis lofty so lofty  he is the bestpaid critic in the united states though heaven forbid hes not a critic at all  they do criticism better in england  but the point is they sound the popular note and they sound it so beautifully and morally and contentedly  their reviews remind me of a british sunday  they are the popular mouthpieces  they back up your professors of english and your professors of english back them up  and there isnt an original idea in any of their skulls  they know only the establishedin fact they are the established  they are weak minded and the established impresses itself upon them as easily as the name of the brewery is impressed on a beer bottle  and their function is to catch all the young fellows attending the university to drive out of their minds any glimmering originality that may chance to be there and to put upon them the stamp of the established  i think i am nearer the truth she replied when i stand by the established than you are raging around like an iconoclastic south sea islander  it was the missionary who did the image breaking he laughed  and unfortunately all the missionaries are off among the heathen so there are none left at home to break those old images mr vanderwater and mr praps  and the college professors as well she added  he shook his head emphatically  no the science professors should live theyre really great  but it would be a good deed to break the heads of ninetenths of the english professorslittle microscopicminded parrots  which was rather severe on the professors but which to ruth was blasphemy  she could not help but measure the professors neat scholarly in fitting clothes speaking in wellmodulated voices breathing of culture and refinement with this almost indescribable young fellow whom somehow she loved whose clothes never would fit him whose heavy muscles told of damning toil who grew excited when he talked substituting abuse for calm statement and passionate utterance for cool selfpossession  they at least earned good salaries and wereyes she compelled herself to face itwere gentlemen while he could not earn a penny and he was not as they  she did not weigh martins words nor judge his argument by them  her conclusion that his argument was wrong was reachedunconsciously it is trueby a comparison of externals  they the professors were right in their literary judgments because they were successes  martins literary judgments were wrong because he could not sell his wares  to use his own phrase they made good and he did not make good  and besides it did not seem reasonable that he should be righthe who had stood so short a time before in that same living room blushing and awkward acknowledging his introduction looking fearfully about him at the brica brac his swinging shoulders threatened to break asking how long since swinburne died and boastfully announcing that he had read excelsior and the psalm of life  unwittingly ruth herself proved his point that she worshipped the established  martin followed the processes of her thoughts but forbore to go farther  he did not love her for what she thought of praps and vanderwater and english professors and he was coming to realize with increasing conviction that he possessed brainareas and stretches of knowledge which she could never comprehend nor know existed  in music she thought him unreasonable and in the matter of opera not only unreasonable but wilfully perverse  how did you like it she asked him one night on the way home from the opera  it was a night when he had taken her at the expense of a months rigid economizing on food  after vainly waiting for him to speak about it herself still tremulous and stirred by what she had just seen and heard she had asked the question  i liked the overture was his answer  it was splendid  yes but the opera itself  that was splendid too that is the orchestra was though id have enjoyed it more if those jumpingjacks had kept quiet or gone off the stage  ruth was aghast  you dont mean tetralani or barillo she queried  all of themthe whole kit and crew  but they are great artists she protested  they spoiled the music just the same with their antics and unrealities  but dont you like barillos voice ruth asked  he is next to caruso they say  of course i liked him and i liked tetralani even better  her voice is exquisiteor at least i think so  but but ruth stammered  i dont know what you mean then  you admire their voices yet say they spoiled the music  precisely that  id give anything to hear them in concert and id give even a bit more not to hear them when the orchestra is playing  im afraid i am a hopeless realist  great singers are not great actors  to hear barillo sing a love passage with the voice of an angel and to hear tetralani reply like another angel and to hear it all accompanied by a perfect orgy of glowing and colorful musicis ravishing most ravishing i do not admit it  i assert it  but the whole effect is spoiled when i look at themat tetralani five feet ten in her stocking feet and weighing a hundred and ninety pounds and at barillo a scant five feet four greasyfeatured with the chest of a squat undersized blacksmith and at the pair of them attitudinizing clasping their breasts flinging their arms in the air like demented creatures in an asylum and when i am expected to accept all this as the faithful illusion of a lovescene between a slender and beautiful princess and a handsome romantic young princewhy i cant accept it thats all  its rot its absurd its unreal  thats whats the matter with it  its not real  dont tell me that anybody in this world ever made love that way  why if id made love to you in such fashion youd have boxed my ears  but you misunderstand ruth protested  every form of art has its limitations  she was busy recalling a lecture she had heard at the university on the conventions of the arts  in painting there are only two dimensions to the canvas yet you accept the illusion of three dimensions which the art of a painter enables him to throw into the canvas  in writing again the author must be omnipotent  you accept as perfectly legitimate the authors account of the secret thoughts of the heroine and yet all the time you know that the heroine was alone when thinking these thoughts and that neither the author nor any one else was capable of hearing them  and so with the stage with sculpture with opera with every art form  certain irreconcilable things must be accepted  yes i understood that martin answered  all the arts have their conventions  ruth was surprised at his use of the word  it was as if he had studied at the university himself instead of being illequipped from browsing at haphazard through the books in the library  but even the conventions must be real  trees painted on flat cardboard and stuck up on each side of the stage we accept as a forest  it is a real enough convention  but on the other hand we would not accept a sea scene as a forest  we cant do it  it violates our senses  nor would you or rather should you accept the ravings and writhings and agonized contortions of those two lunatics tonight as a convincing portrayal of love  but you dont hold yourself superior to all the judges of music she protested  no no not for a moment  i merely maintain my right as an individual i have just been telling you what i think in order to explain why the elephantine gambols of madame tetralani spoil the orchestra for me  the worlds judges of music may all be right  but i am i and i wont subordinate my taste to the unanimous judgment of mankind  if i dont like a thing i dont like it thats all and there is no reason under the sun why i should ape a liking for it just because the majority of my fellowcreatures like it or make believe they like it  i cant follow the fashions in the things i like or dislike  but music you know is a matter of training ruth argued and opera is even more a matter of training  may it not be  that i am not trained in opera he dashed in  she nodded  the very thing he agreed  and i consider i am fortunate in not having been caught when i was young  if i had i could have wept sentimental tears tonight and the clownish antics of that precious pair would have but enhanced the beauty of their voices and the beauty of the accompanying orchestra  you are right  its mostly a matter of training  and i am too old now  i must have the real or nothing  an illusion that wont convince is a palpable lie and thats what grand opera is to me when little barillo throws a fit clutches mighty tetralani in his arms also in a fit and tells her how passionately he adores her  again ruth measured his thoughts by comparison of externals and in accordance with her belief in the established  who was he that he should be right and all the cultured world wrong  his words and thoughts made no impression upon her  she was too firmly intrenched in the established to have any sympathy with revolutionary ideas  she had always been used to music and she had enjoyed opera ever since she was a child and all her world had enjoyed it too  then by what right did martin eden emerge as he had so recently emerged from his ragtime and workingclass songs and pass judgment on the worlds music  she was vexed with him and as she walked beside him she had a vague feeling of outrage  at the best in her most charitable frame of mind she considered the statement of his views to be a caprice an erratic and uncalledfor prank  but when he took her in his arms at the door and kissed her good night in tender loverfashion she forgot everything in the outrush of her own love to him  and later on a sleepless pillow she puzzled as she had often puzzled of late as to how it was that she loved so strange a man and loved him despite the disapproval of her people  and next day martin eden cast hackwork aside and at white heat hammered out an essay to which he gave the title the philosophy of illusion  a stamp started it on its travels but it was destined to receive many stamps and to be started on many travels in the months that followed     chapter xxv   maria silva was poor and all the ways of poverty were clear to her poverty to ruth was a word signifying a notnice condition of existence  that was her total knowledge on the subject  she knew martin was poor and his condition she associated in her mind with the boyhood of abraham lincoln of mr butler and of other men who had become successes  also while aware that poverty was anything but delectable she had a comfortable middleclass feeling that poverty was salutary that it was a sharp spur that urged on to success all men who were not degraded and hopeless drudges  so that her knowledge that martin was so poor that he had pawned his watch and overcoat did not disturb her  she even considered it the hopeful side of the situation believing that sooner or later it would arouse him and compel him to abandon his writing  ruth never read hunger in martins face which had grown lean and had enlarged the slight hollows in the cheeks  in fact she marked the change in his face with satisfaction  it seemed to refine him to remove from him much of the dross of flesh and the too animallike vigor that lured her while she detested it  sometimes when with her she noted an unusual brightness in his eyes and she admired it for it made him appear more the poet and the scholarthe things he would have liked to be and which she would have liked him to be  but maria silva read a different tale in the hollow cheeks and the burning eyes and she noted the changes in them from day to day by them following the ebb and flow of his fortunes  she saw him leave the house with his overcoat and return without it though the day was chill and raw and promptly she saw his cheeks fill out slightly and the fire of hunger leave his eyes  in the same way she had seen his wheel and watch go and after each event she had seen his vigor bloom again  likewise she watched his toils and knew the measure of the midnight oil he burned  work  she knew that he outdid her though his work was of a different order  and she was surprised to behold that the less food he had the harder he worked  on occasion in a casual sort of way when she thought hunger pinched hardest she would send him in a loaf of new baking awkwardly covering the act with banter to the effect that it was better than he could bake  and again she would send one of her toddlers in to him with a great pitcher of hot soup debating inwardly the while whether she was justified in taking it from the mouths of her own flesh and blood  nor was martin ungrateful knowing as he did the lives of the poor and that if ever in the world there was charity this was it  on a day when she had filled her brood with what was left in the house maria invested her last fifteen cents in a gallon of cheap wine  martin coming into her kitchen to fetch water was invited to sit down and drink  he drank her verygood health and in return she drank his  then she drank to prosperity in his undertakings and he drank to the hope that james grant would show up and pay her for his washing  james grant was a journeymen carpenter who did not always pay his bills and who owed maria three dollars  both maria and martin drank the sour new wine on empty stomachs and it went swiftly to their heads  utterly differentiated creatures that they were they were lonely in their misery and though the misery was tacitly ignored it was the bond that drew them together  maria was amazed to learn that he had been in the azores where she had lived until she was eleven  she was doubly amazed that he had been in the hawaiian islands whither she had migrated from the azores with her people  but her amazement passed all bounds when he told her he had been on maui the particular island whereon she had attained womanhood and married kahului where she had first met her husbandhe martin had been there twice  yes she remembered the sugar steamers and he had been on themwell well it was a small world  and wailuku  that place too did he know the headluna of the plantation  yes and had had a couple of drinks with him  and so they reminiscenced and drowned their hunger in the raw sour wine to martin the future did not seem so dim  success trembled just before him  he was on the verge of clasping it  then he studied the deeplined face of the toilworn woman before him remembered her soups and loaves of new baking and felt spring up in him the warmest gratitude and philanthropy  maria he exclaimed suddenly  what would you like to have  she looked at him bepuzzled  what would you like to have now right now if you could get it  shoe alla da roun for da childsseven pairs da shoe  you shall have them he announced while she nodded her head gravely but i mean a big wish something big that you want  her eyes sparkled goodnaturedly  he was choosing to make fun with her maria with whom few made fun these days  think hard he cautioned just as she was opening her mouth to speak  alla right she answered  i thinka da hard  i lika da house dis houseall mine no paya da rent seven dollar da month  you shall have it he granted and in a short time  now wish the great wish  make believe i am god and i say to you anything you want you can have  then you wish that thing and i listen  maria considered solemnly for a space  you no fraid she asked warningly  no no he laughed im not afraid  go ahead  most verra big she warned again  all right  fire away  well den  she drew a big breath like a child as she voiced to the uttermost all she cared to demand of life  i lika da have one milka ranchgood milka ranch  plenty cow plenty land plenty grass  i lika da have near san lean my sister liva dere  i sella da milk in oakland i maka da plentee mon  joe an nick no runna da cow  dey goa to school  bimeby maka da good engineer worka da railroad  yes i lika da milka ranch  she paused and regarded martin with twinkling eyes  you shall have it he answered promptly  she nodded her head and touched her lips courteously to the wineglass and to the giver of the gift she knew would never be given  his heart was right and in her own heart she appreciated his intention as much as if the gift had gone with it  no maria he went on nick and joe wont have to peddle milk and all the kids can go to school and wear shoes the whole year round  it will be a firstclass milk rancheverything complete  there will be a house to live in and a stable for the horses and cowbarns of course  there will be chickens pigs vegetables fruit trees and everything like that and there will be enough cows to pay for a hired man or two  then you wont have anything to do but take care of the children  for that matter if you find a good man you can marry and take it easy while he runs the ranch  and from such largess dispensed from his future martin turned and took his one good suit of clothes to the pawnshop  his plight was desperate for him to do this for it cut him off from ruth  he had no secondbest suit that was presentable and though he could go to the butcher and the baker and even on occasion to his sisters it was beyond all daring to dream of entering the morse home so disreputably apparelled  he toiled on miserable and wellnigh hopeless  it began to appear to him that the second battle was lost and that he would have to go to work in doing this he would satisfy everybodythe grocer his sister ruth and even maria to whom he owed a months room rent  he was two months behind with his typewriter and the agency was clamoring for payment or for the return of the machine  in desperation all but ready to surrender to make a truce with fate until he could get a fresh start he took the civil service examinations for the railway mail  to his surprise he passed first  the job was assured though when the call would come to enter upon his duties nobody knew  it was at this time at the lowest ebb that the smoothrunning editorial machine broke down  a cog must have slipped or an oilcup run dry for the postman brought him one morning a short thin envelope  martin glanced at the upper lefthand corner and read the name and address of the transcontinental monthly  his heart gave a great leap and he suddenly felt faint the sinking feeling accompanied by a strange trembling of the knees  he staggered into his room and sat down on the bed the envelope still unopened and in that moment came understanding to him how people suddenly fall dead upon receipt of extraordinarily good news  of course this was good news  there was no manuscript in that thin envelope therefore it was an acceptance  he knew the story in the hands of the transcontinental  it was the ring of bells one of his horror stories and it was an even five thousand words  and since firstclass magazines always paid on acceptance there was a check inside  two cents a wordtwenty dollars a thousand the check must be a hundred dollars one hundred dollars  as he tore the envelope open every item of all his debts surged in his brain385 to the grocer butcher 400 flat baker 200 fruit store 500 total 1485  then there was room rent 250 another month in advance 250 two months typewriter 800 a month in advance 400 total 3185  and finally to be added his pledges plus interest with the pawnbrokerwatch 550 overcoat 550 wheel 775 suit of clothes 550 60  interest but what did it mattergrand total 5610  he saw as if visible in the air before him in illuminated figures the whole sum and the subtraction that followed and that gave a remainder of 4390  when he had squared every debt redeemed every pledge he would still have jingling in his pockets a princely 4390  and on top of that he would have a months rent paid in advance on the typewriter and on the room  by this time he had drawn the single sheet of typewritten letter out and spread it open  there was no check  he peered into the envelope held it to the light but could not trust his eyes and in trembling haste tore the envelope apart  there was no check  he read the letter skimming it line by line dashing through the editors praise of his story to the meat of the letter the statement why the check had not been sent  he found no such statement but he did find that which made him suddenly wilt  the letter slid from his hand  his eyes went lacklustre and he lay back on the pillow pulling the blanket about him and up to his chin  five dollars for the ring of bellsfive dollars for five thousand words  instead of two cents a word ten words for a cent  and the editor had praised it too  and he would receive the check when the story was published  then it was all poppycock two cents a word for minimum rate and payment upon acceptance  it was a lie and it had led him astray  he would never have attempted to write had he known that  he would have gone to workto work for ruth  he went back to the day he first attempted to write and was appalled at the enormous waste of timeand all for ten words for a cent  and the other high rewards of writers that he had read about must be lies too  his secondhand ideas of authorship were wrong for here was the proof of it  the transcontinental sold for twentyfive cents and its dignified and artistic cover proclaimed it as among the firstclass magazines  it was a staid respectable magazine and it had been published continuously since long before he was born  why on the outside cover were printed every month the words of one of the worlds great writers words proclaiming the inspired mission of the transcontinental by a star of literature whose first coruscations had appeared inside those selfsame covers  and the high and lofty heaveninspired transcontinental paid five dollars for five thousand words  the great writer had recently died in a foreign landin dire poverty martin remembered which was not to be wondered at considering the magnificent pay authors receive  well he had taken the bait the newspaper lies about writers and their pay and he had wasted two years over it  but he would disgorge the bait now  not another line would he ever write  he would do what ruth wanted him to do what everybody wanted him to doget a job  the thought of going to work reminded him of joejoe tramping through the land of nothingtodo  martin heaved a great sigh of envy  the reaction of nineteen hours a day for many days was strong upon him  but then joe was not in love had none of the responsibilities of love and he could afford to loaf through the land of nothingtodo  he martin had something to work for and go to work he would  he would start out early next morning to hunt a job  and he would let ruth know too that he had mended his ways and was willing to go into her fathers office  five dollars for five thousand words ten words for a cent the market price for art  the disappointment of it the lie of it the infamy of it were uppermost in his thoughts and under his closed eyelids in fiery figures burned the 385 he owed the grocer  he shivered and was aware of an aching in his bones  the small of his back ached especially  his head ached the top of it ached the back of it ached the brains inside of it ached and seemed to be swelling while the ache over his brows was intolerable  and beneath the brows planted under his lids was the merciless 385  he opened his eyes to escape it but the white light of the room seemed to sear the balls and forced him to close his eyes when the 385 confronted him again  five dollars for five thousand words ten words for a centthat particular thought took up its residence in his brain and he could no more escape it than he could the 385 under his eyelids  a change seemed to come over the latter and he watched curiously till 200 burned in its stead  ah he thought that was the baker  the next sum that appeared was 250  it puzzled him and he pondered it as if life and death hung on the solution  he owed somebody two dollars and a half that was certain but who was it  to find it was the task set him by an imperious and malignant universe and he wandered through the endless corridors of his mind opening all manner of lumber rooms and chambers stored with odds and ends of memories and knowledge as he vainly sought the answer  after several centuries it came to him easily without effort that it was maria  with a great relief he turned his soul to the screen of torment under his lids  he had solved the problem now he could rest  but no the 250 faded away and in its place burned 800  who was that  he must go the dreary round of his mind again and find out  how long he was gone on this quest he did not know but after what seemed an enormous lapse of time he was called back to himself by a knock at the door and by marias asking if he was sick  he replied in a muffled voice he did not recognize saying that he was merely taking a nap  he was surprised when he noted the darkness of night in the room  he had received the letter at two in the afternoon and he realized that he was sick  then the 800 began to smoulder under his lids again and he returned himself to servitude  but he grew cunning  there was no need for him to wander through his mind  he had been a fool  he pulled a lever and made his mind revolve about him a monstrous wheel of fortune a merrygoround of memory a revolving sphere of wisdom  faster and faster it revolved until its vortex sucked him in and he was flung whirling through black chaos  quite naturally he found himself at a mangle feeding starched cuffs  but as he fed he noticed figures printed in the cuffs  it was a new way of marking linen he thought until looking closer he saw 385 on one of the cuffs  then it came to him that it was the grocers bill and that these were his bills flying around on the drum of the mangle  a crafty idea came to him  he would throw the bills on the floor and so escape paying them  no sooner thought than done and he crumpled the cuffs spitefully as he flung them upon an unusually dirty floor  ever the heap grew and though each bill was duplicated a thousand times he found only one for two dollars and a half which was what he owed maria that meant that maria would not press for payment and he resolved generously that it would be the only one he would pay so he began searching through the castout heap for hers  he sought it desperately for ages and was still searching when the manager of the hotel entered the fat dutchman  his face blazed with wrath and he shouted in stentorian tones that echoed down the universe i shall deduct the cost of those cuffs from your wages  the pile of cuffs grew into a mountain and martin knew that he was doomed to toil for a thousand years to pay for them  well there was nothing left to do but kill the manager and burn down the laundry  but the big dutchman frustrated him seizing him by the nape of the neck and dancing him up and down  he danced him over the ironing tables the stove and the mangles and out into the wash room and over the wringer and washer  martin was danced until his teeth rattled and his head ached and he marvelled that the dutchman was so strong  and then he found himself before the mangle this time receiving the cuffs an editor of a magazine was feeding from the other side  each cuff was a check and martin went over them anxiously in a fever of expectation but they were all blanks  he stood there and received the blanks for a million years or so never letting one go by for fear it might be filled out  at last he found it  with trembling fingers he held it to the light  it was for five dollars  ha ha laughed the editor across the mangle  well then i shall kill you martin said he went out into the washroom to get the axe and found joe starching manuscripts  he tried to make him desist then swung the axe for him but the weapon remained poised in midair for martin found himself back in the ironing room in the midst of a snowstorm  no it was not snow that was falling but checks of large denomination the smallest not less than a thousand dollars  he began to collect them and sort them out in packages of a hundred tying each package securely with twine  he looked up from his task and saw joe standing before him juggling flat irons starched shirts and manuscripts  now and again he reached out and added a bundle of checks to the flying miscellany that soared through the roof and out of sight in a tremendous circle  martin struck at him but he seized the axe and added it to the flying circle  then he plucked martin and added him  martin went up through the roof clutching at manuscripts so that by the time he came down he had a large armful  but no sooner down than up again and a second and a third time and countless times he flew around the circle  from far off he could hear a childish treble singing waltz me around again willie around around around  he recovered the axe in the midst of the milky way of checks starched shirts and manuscripts and prepared when he came down to kill joe but he did not come down  instead at two in the morning maria having heard his groans through the thin partition came into his room to put hot flatirons against his body and damp cloths upon his aching eyes     chapter xxvi   martin eden did not go out to hunt for a job in the morning  it was late afternoon before he came out of his delirium and gazed with aching eyes about the room  mary one of the tribe of silva eight years old keeping watch raised a screech at sight of his returning consciousness maria hurried into the room from the kitchen  she put her workcalloused hand upon his hot forehead and felt his pulse  you lika da eat she asked  he shook his head  eating was farthest from his desire and he wondered that he should ever have been hungry in his life  im sick maria he said weakly  what is it  do you know  grip she answered  two or three days you alla da right  better you no eat now  bimeby plenty can eat tomorrow can eat maybe  martin was not used to sickness and when maria and her little girl left him he essayed to get up and dress  by a supreme exertion of will with rearing brain and eyes that ached so that he could not keep them open he managed to get out of bed only to be left stranded by his senses upon the table  half an hour later he managed to regain the bed where he was content to lie with closed eyes and analyze his various pains and weaknesses  maria came in several times to change the cold cloths on his forehead  otherwise she left him in peace too wise to vex him with chatter  this moved him to gratitude and he murmured to himself maria you getta da milka ranch all righta all right  then he remembered his longburied past of yesterday  it seemed a lifetime since he had received that letter from the transcontinental a lifetime since it was all over and done with and a new page turned  he had shot his bolt and shot it hard and now he was down on his back  if he hadnt starved himself he wouldnt have been caught by la grippe  he had been run down and he had not had the strength to throw off the germ of disease which had invaded his system this was what resulted  what does it profit a man to write a whole library and lose his own life he demanded aloud  this is no place for me  no more literature in mine  me for the countinghouse and ledger the monthly salary and the little home with ruth  two days later having eaten an egg and two slices of toast and drunk a cup of tea he asked for his mail but found his eyes still hurt too much to permit him to read  you read for me maria he said  never mind the big long letters throw them under the table  read me the small letters  no can was the answer  teresa she go to school she can  so teresa silva aged nine opened his letters and read them to him  he listened absently to a long dun from the typewriter people his mind busy with ways and means of finding a job  suddenly he was shocked back to himself  we offer you forty dollars for all serial rights in your story teresa slowly spelled out provided you allow us to make the alterations suggested  what magazine is that martin shouted  here give it to me  he could see to read now and he was unaware of the pain of the action it was the white mouse that was offering him forty dollars and the story was the whirlpool another of his early horror stories  he read the letter through again and again  the editor told him plainly that he had not handled the idea properly but that it was the idea they were buying because it was original  if they could cut the story down onethird they would take it and send him forty dollars on receipt of his answer  he called for pen and ink and told the editor he could cut the story down threethirds if he wanted to and to send the forty dollars right along  the letter despatched to the letterbox by teresa martin lay back and thought  it wasnt a lie after all  the white mouse paid on acceptance  there were three thousand words in the whirlpool  cut down a third there would be two thousand  at forty dollars that would be two cents a word  pay on acceptance and two cents a wordthe newspapers had told the truth  and he had thought the white mouse a thirdrater  it was evident that he did not know the magazines  he had deemed the transcontinental a firstrater and it paid a cent for ten words  he had classed the white mouse as of no account and it paid twenty times as much as the transcontinental and also had paid on acceptance  well there was one thing certain when he got well he would not go out looking for a job  there were more stories in his head as good as the whirlpool and at forty dollars apiece he could earn far more than in any job or position  just when he thought the battle lost it was won he had proved for his career  the way was clear  beginning with the white mouse he would add magazine after magazine to his growing list of patrons  hackwork could be put aside  for that matter it had been wasted time for it had not brought him a dollar  he would devote himself to work good work and he would pour out the best that was in him  he wished ruth was there to share in his joy and when he went over the letters left lying on his bed he found one from her  it was sweetly reproachful wondering what had kept him away for so dreadful a length of time  he reread the letter adoringly dwelling over her handwriting loving each stroke of her pen and in the end kissing her signature  and when he answered he told her recklessly that he had not been to see her because his best clothes were in pawn  he told her that he had been sick but was once more nearly well and that inside ten days or two weeks as soon as a letter could travel to new york city and return he would redeem his clothes and be with her  but ruth did not care to wait ten days or two weeks  besides her lover was sick  the next afternoon accompanied by arthur she arrived in the morse carriage to the unqualified delight of the silva tribe and of all the urchins on the street and to the consternation of maria  she boxed the ears of the silvas who crowded about the visitors on the tiny front porch and in more than usual atrocious english tried to apologize for her appearance  sleeves rolled up from soapflecked arms and a wet gunny sack around her waist told of the task at which she had been caught  so flustered was she by two such grand young people asking for her lodger that she forgot to invite them to sit down in the little parlor  to enter martins room they passed through the kitchen warm and moist and steamy from the big washing in progress  maria in her excitement jammed the bedroom and bedroomcloset doors together and for five minutes through the partly open door clouds of steam smelling of soap suds and dirt poured into the sick chamber  ruth succeeded in veering right and left and right again and in running the narrow passage between table and bed to martins side but arthur veered too wide and fetched up with clatter and bang of pots and pans in the corner where martin did his cooking  arthur did not linger long ruth occupied the only chair and having done his duty he went outside and stood by the gate the centre of seven marvelling silvas who watched him as they would have watched a curiosity in a sideshow  all about the carriage were gathered the children from a dozen blocks waiting and eager for some tragic and terrible denouement  carriages were seen on their street only for weddings and funerals  here was neither marriage nor death therefore it was something transcending experience and well worth waiting for  martin had been wild to see ruth  his was essentially a lovenature and he possessed more than the average mans need for sympathy  he was starving for sympathy which with him meant intelligent understanding and he had yet to learn that ruths sympathy was largely sentimental and tactful and that it proceeded from gentleness of nature rather than from understanding of the objects of her sympathy  so it was while martin held her hand and gladly talked that her love for him prompted her to press his hand in return and that her eyes were moist and luminous at sight of his helplessness and of the marks suffering had stamped upon his face  but while he told her of his two acceptances of his despair when he received the one from the transcontinental and of the corresponding delight with which he received the one from the white mouse she did not follow him  she heard the words he uttered and understood their literal import but she was not with him in his despair and his delight  she could not get out of herself  she was not interested in selling stories to magazines  what was important to her was matrimony  she was not aware of it however any more than she was aware that her desire that martin take a position was the instinctive and preparative impulse of motherhood  she would have blushed had she been told as much in plain set terms and next she might have grown indignant and asserted that her sole interest lay in the man she loved and her desire for him to make the best of himself  so while martin poured out his heart to her elated with the first success his chosen work in the world had received she paid heed to his bare words only gazing now and again about the room shocked by what she saw  for the first time ruth gazed upon the sordid face of poverty  starving lovers had always seemed romantic to herbut she had had no idea how starving lovers lived  she had never dreamed it could be like this  ever her gaze shifted from the room to him and back again  the steamy smell of dirty clothes which had entered with her from the kitchen was sickening  martin must be soaked with it ruth concluded if that awful woman washed frequently  such was the contagiousness of degradation when she looked at martin she seemed to see the smirch left upon him by his surroundings  she had never seen him unshaven and the three days growth of beard on his face was repulsive to her  not alone did it give him the same dark and murky aspect of the silva house inside and out but it seemed to emphasize that animallike strength of his which she detested  and here he was being confirmed in his madness by the two acceptances he took such pride in telling her about  a little longer and he would have surrendered and gone to work  now he would continue on in this horrible house writing and starving for a few more months  what is that smell she asked suddenly  some of marias washing smells i imagine was the answer  i am growing quite accustomed to them  no no not that  it is something else  a stale sickish smell  martin sampled the air before replying  i cant smell anything else except stale tobacco smoke he announced  thats it  it is terrible  why do you smoke so much martin  i dont know except that i smoke more than usual when i am lonely  and then too its such a longstanding habit  i learned when i was only a youngster  it is not a nice habit you know she reproved  it smells to heaven  thats the fault of the tobacco  i can afford only the cheapest  but wait until i get that fortydollar check  ill use a brand that is not offensive even to the angels  but that wasnt so bad was it two acceptances in three days  that fortyfive dollars will pay about all my debts  for two years work she queried  no for less than a weeks work  please pass me that book over on the far corner of the table the account book with the gray cover  he opened it and began turning over the pages rapidly  yes i was right four days for the ring of bells two days for the whirlpool  thats fortyfive dollars for a weeks work one hundred and eighty dollars a month  that beats any salary i can command  and besides im just beginning  a thousand dollars a month is not too much to buy for you all i want you to have  a salary of five hundred a month would be too small that fortyfive dollars is just a starter  wait till i get my stride then watch my smoke  ruth misunderstood his slang and reverted to cigarettes  you smoke more than enough as it is and the brand of tobacco will make no difference  it is the smoking itself that is not nice no matter what the brand may be  you are a chimney a living volcano a perambulating smokestack and you are a perfect disgrace martin dear you know you are  she leaned toward him entreaty in her eyes and as he looked at her delicate face and into her pure limpid eyes as of old he was struck with his own unworthiness  i wish you wouldnt smoke any more she whispered  please formy sake  all right i wont he cried  ill do anything you ask dear love anything you know that  a great temptation assailed her  in an insistent way she had caught glimpses of the large easygoing side of his nature and she felt sure if she asked him to cease attempting to write that he would grant her wish  in the swift instant that elapsed the words trembled on her lips but she did not utter them  she was not quite brave enough she did not quite dare  instead she leaned toward him to meet him and in his arms murmured  you know it is really not for my sake martin but for your own  i am sure smoking hurts you and besides it is not good to be a slave to anything to a drug least of all  i shall always be your slave he smiled  in which case i shall begin issuing my commands  she looked at him mischievously though deep down she was already regretting that she had not preferred her largest request  i live but to obey your majesty  well then my first commandment is thou shalt not omit to shave every day  look how you have scratched my cheek  and so it ended in caresses and lovelaughter  but she had made one point and she could not expect to make more than one at a time  she felt a womans pride in that she had made him stop smoking  another time she would persuade him to take a position for had he not said he would do anything she asked  she left his side to explore the room examining the clotheslines of notes overhead learning the mystery of the tackle used for suspending his wheel under the ceiling and being saddened by the heap of manuscripts under the table which represented to her just so much wasted time  the oilstove won her admiration but on investigating the food shelves she found them empty  why you havent anything to eat you poor dear she said with tender compassion  you must be starving  i store my food in marias safe and in her pantry he lied  it keeps better there  no danger of my starving  look at that  she had come back to his side and she saw him double his arm at the elbow the biceps crawling under his shirtsleeve and swelling into a knot of muscle heavy and hard  the sight repelled her  sentimentally she disliked it  but her pulse her blood every fibre of her loved it and yearned for it and in the old inexplicable way she leaned toward him not away from him  and in the moment that followed when he crushed her in his arms the brain of her concerned with the superficial aspects of life was in revolt while the heart of her the woman of her concerned with life itself exulted triumphantly  it was in moments like this that she felt to the uttermost the greatness of her love for martin for it was almost a swoon of delight to her to feel his strong arms about her holding her tightly hurting her with the grip of their fervor  at such moments she found justification for her treason to her standards for her violation of her own high ideals and most of all for her tacit disobedience to her mother and father  they did not want her to marry this man  it shocked them that she should love him  it shocked her too sometimes when she was apart from him a cool and reasoning creature  with him she loved himin truth at times a vexed and worried love but love it was a love that was stronger than she  this la grippe is nothing he was saying  it hurts a bit and gives one a nasty headache but it doesnt compare with breakbone fever  have you had that too she queried absently intent on the heavensent justification she was finding in his arms  and so with absent queries she led him on till suddenly his words startled her  he had had the fever in a secret colony of thirty lepers on one of the hawaiian islands  but why did you go there she demanded  such royal carelessness of body seemed criminal  because i didnt know he answered  i never dreamed of lepers  when i deserted the schooner and landed on the beach i headed inland for some place of hiding  for three days i lived off guavas ohiaapples and bananas all of which grew wild in the jungle  on the fourth day i found the traila mere foottrail  it led inland and it led up  it was the way i wanted to go and it showed signs of recent travel  at one place it ran along the crest of a ridge that was no more than a knifeedge  the trail wasnt three feet wide on the crest and on either side the ridge fell away in precipices hundreds of feet deep  one man with plenty of ammunition could have held it against a hundred thousand  it was the only way in to the hidingplace  three hours after i found the trail i was there in a little mountain valley a pocket in the midst of lava peaks  the whole place was terraced for taropatches fruit trees grew there and there were eight or ten grass huts  but as soon as i saw the inhabitants i knew what id struck  one sight of them was enough  what did you do ruth demanded breathlessly listening like any desdemona appalled and fascinated  nothing for me to do  their leader was a kind old fellow pretty far gone but he ruled like a king  he had discovered the little valley and founded the settlementall of which was against the law  but he had guns plenty of ammunition and those kanakas trained to the shooting of wild cattle and wild pig were dead shots  no there wasnt any running away for martin eden  he stayedfor three months  but how did you escape  id have been there yet if it hadnt been for a girl there a halfchinese quarterwhite and quarterhawaiian  she was a beauty poor thing and well educated  her mother in honolulu was worth a million or so  well this girl got me away at last  her mother financed the settlement you see so the girl wasnt afraid of being punished for letting me go  but she made me swear first never to reveal the hiding place and i never have  this is the first time i have even mentioned it  the girl had just the first signs of leprosy  the fingers of her right hand were slightly twisted and there was a small spot on her arm that was all  i guess she is dead now  but werent you frightened  and werent you glad to get away without catching that dreadful disease  well he confessed i was a bit shivery at first but i got used to it  i used to feel sorry for that poor girl though  that made me forget to be afraid  she was such a beauty in spirit as well as in appearance and she was only slightly touched yet she was doomed to lie there living the life of a primitive savage and rotting slowly away leprosy is far more terrible than you can imagine it  poor thing ruth murmured softly  its a wonder she let you get away  how do you mean martin asked unwittingly  because she must have loved you ruth said still softly  candidly now didnt she  martins sunburn had been bleached by his work in the laundry and by the indoor life he was living while the hunger and the sickness had made his face even pale and across this pallor flowed the slow wave of a blush he was opening his mouth to speak but ruth shut him off  never mind dont answer its not necessary she laughed  but it seemed to him there was something metallic in her laughter and that the light in her eyes was cold  on the spur of the moment it reminded him of a gale he had once experienced in the north pacific  and for the moment the apparition of the gale rose before his eyesa gale at night with a clear sky and under a full moon the huge seas glinting coldly in the moonlight  next he saw the girl in the leper refuge and remembered it was for love of him that she had let him go  she was noble he said simply  she gave me life  that was all of the incident but he heard ruth muffle a dry sob in her throat and noticed that she turned her face away to gaze out of the window  when she turned it back to him it was composed and there was no hint of the gale in her eyes  im such a silly she said plaintively  but i cant help it  i do so love you martin i do i do  i shall grow more catholic in time but at present i cant help being jealous of those ghosts of the past and you know your past is full of ghosts  it must be she silenced his protest  it could not be otherwise  and theres poor arthur motioning me to come  hes tired waiting  and now goodby dear  theres some kind of a mixture put up by the druggists that helps men to stop the use of tobacco she called back from the door and i am going to send you some  the door closed but opened again  i do i do she whispered to him and this time she was really gone  maria with worshipful eyes that none the less were keen to note the texture of ruths garments and the cut of them a cut unknown that produced an effect mysteriously beautiful saw her to the carriage  the crowd of disappointed urchins stared till the carriage disappeared from view then transferred their stare to maria who had abruptly become the most important person on the street  but it was one of her progeny who blasted marias reputation by announcing that the grand visitors had been for her lodger  after that maria dropped back into her old obscurity and martin began to notice the respectful manner in which he was regarded by the small fry of the neighborhood  as for maria martin rose in her estimation a full hundred per cent and had the portuguese grocer witnessed that afternoon carriagecall he would have allowed martin an additional threedollarsandeightyfivecents worth of credit     chapter xxvii   the sun of martins good fortune rose  the day after ruths visit he received a check for three dollars from a new york scandal weekly in payment for three of his triolets  two days later a newspaper published in chicago accepted his treasure hunters promising to pay ten dollars for it on publication  the price was small but it was the first article he had written his very first attempt to express his thought on the printed page  to cap everything the adventure serial for boys his second attempt was accepted before the end of the week by a juvenile monthly calling itself youth and age  it was true the serial was twenty one thousand words and they offered to pay him sixteen dollars on publication which was something like seventyfive cents a thousand words but it was equally true that it was the second thing he had attempted to write and that he was himself thoroughly aware of its clumsy worthlessness  but even his earliest efforts were not marked with the clumsiness of mediocrity  what characterized them was the clumsiness of too great strengththe clumsiness which the tyro betrays when he crushes butterflies with battering rams and hammers out vignettes with a warclub  so it was that martin was glad to sell his early efforts for songs  he knew them for what they were and it had not taken him long to acquire this knowledge  what he pinned his faith to was his later work he had striven to be something more than a mere writer of magazine fiction  he had sought to equip himself with the tools of artistry  on the other hand he had not sacrificed strength  his conscious aim had been to increase his strength by avoiding excess of strength  nor had he departed from his love of reality  his work was realism though he had endeavored to fuse with it the fancies and beauties of imagination  what he sought was an impassioned realism shot through with human aspiration and faith  what he wanted was life as it was with all its spiritgroping and soulreaching left in  he had discovered in the course of his reading two schools of fiction one treated of man as a god ignoring his earthly origin the other treated of man as a clod ignoring his heavensent dreams and divine possibilities  both the god and the clod schools erred in martins estimation and erred through too great singleness of sight and purpose there was a compromise that approximated the truth though it flattered not the school of god while it challenged the brutesavageness of the school of clod  it was his story adventure which had dragged with ruth that martin believed had achieved his ideal of the true in fiction and it was in an essay god and clod that he had expressed his views on the whole general subject  but adventure and all that he deemed his best work still went begging among the editors  his early work counted for nothing in his eyes except for the money it brought and his horror stories two of which he had sold he did not consider high work nor his best work  to him they were frankly imaginative and fantastic though invested with all the glamour of the real wherein lay their power  this investiture of the grotesque and impossible with reality he looked upon as a tricka skilful trick at best  great literature could not reside in such a field  their artistry was high but he denied the worthwhileness of artistry when divorced from humanness  the trick had been to fling over the face of his artistry a mask of humanness and this he had done in the halfdozen or so stories of the horror brand he had written before he emerged upon the high peaks of adventure joy the pot and the wine of life  the three dollars he received for the triolets he used to eke out a precarious existence against the arrival of the white mouse check  he cashed the first check with the suspicious portuguese grocer paying a dollar on account and dividing the remaining two dollars between the baker and the fruit store  martin was not yet rich enough to afford meat and he was on slim allowance when the white mouse check arrived  he was divided on the cashing of it  he had never been in a bank in his life much less been in one on business and he had a naive and childlike desire to walk into one of the big banks down in oakland and fling down his indorsed check for forty dollars  on the other hand practical common sense ruled that he should cash it with his grocer and thereby make an impression that would later result in an increase of credit reluctantly martin yielded to the claims of the grocer paying his bill with him in full and receiving in change a pocketful of jingling coin also he paid the other tradesmen in full redeemed his suit and his bicycle paid one months rent on the typewriter and paid maria the overdue month for his room and a month in advance  this left him in his pocket for emergencies a balance of nearly three dollars  in itself this small sum seemed a fortune  immediately on recovering his clothes he had gone to see ruth and on the way he could not refrain from jingling the little handful of silver in his pocket  he had been so long without money that like a rescued starving man who cannot let the unconsumed food out of his sight martin could not keep his hand off the silver  he was not mean nor avaricious but the money meant more than so many dollars and cents  it stood for success and the eagles stamped upon the coins were to him so many winged victories  it came to him insensibly that it was a very good world  it certainly appeared more beautiful to him  for weeks it had been a very dull and sombre world but now with nearly all debts paid three dollars jingling in his pocket and in his mind the consciousness of success the sun shone bright and warm and even a rainsquall that soaked unprepared pedestrians seemed a merry happening to him  when he starved his thoughts had dwelt often upon the thousands he knew were starving the world over but now that he was feasted full the fact of the thousands starving was no longer pregnant in his brain  he forgot about them and being in love remembered the countless lovers in the world  without deliberately thinking about it motifs for lovelyrics began to agitate his brain  swept away by the creative impulse he got off the electric car without vexation two blocks beyond his crossing  he found a number of persons in the morse home  ruths two girlcousins were visiting her from san rafael and mrs morse under pretext of entertaining them was pursuing her plan of surrounding ruth with young people  the campaign had begun during martins enforced absence and was already in full swing  she was making a point of having at the house men who were doing things  thus in addition to the cousins dorothy and florence martin encountered two university professors one of latin the other of english a young army officer just back from the philippines onetime schoolmate of ruths a young fellow named melville private secretary to joseph perkins head of the san francisco trust company and finally of the men a live bank cashier charles hapgood a youngish man of thirtyfive graduate of stanford university member of the nile club and the unity club and a conservative speaker for the republican party during campaignsin short a rising young man in every way  among the women was one who painted portraits another who was a professional musician and still another who possessed the degree of doctor of sociology and who was locally famous for her social settlement work in the slums of san francisco  but the women did not count for much in mrs morses plan  at the best they were necessary accessories  the men who did things must be drawn to the house somehow  dont get excited when you talk ruth admonished martin before the ordeal of introduction began  he bore himself a bit stiffly at first oppressed by a sense of his own awkwardness especially of his shoulders which were up to their old trick of threatening destruction to furniture and ornaments  also he was rendered selfconscious by the company  he had never before been in contact with such exalted beings nor with so many of them  melville the bank cashier fascinated him and he resolved to investigate him at the first opportunity  for underneath martins awe lurked his assertive ego and he felt the urge to measure himself with these men and women and to find out what they had learned from the books and life which he had not learned  ruths eyes roved to him frequently to see how he was getting on and she was surprised and gladdened by the ease with which he got acquainted with her cousins  he certainly did not grow excited while being seated removed from him the worry of his shoulders  ruth knew them for clever girls superficially brilliant and she could scarcely understand their praise of martin later that night at going to bed  but he on the other hand a wit in his own class a gay quizzer and laughtermaker at dances and sunday picnics had found the making of fun and the breaking of good natured lances simple enough in this environment  and on this evening success stood at his back patting him on the shoulder and telling him that he was making good so that he could afford to laugh and make laughter and remain unabashed  later ruths anxiety found justification  martin and professor caldwell had got together in a conspicuous corner and though martin no longer wove the air with his hands to ruths critical eye he permitted his own eyes to flash and glitter too frequently talked too rapidly and warmly grew too intense and allowed his aroused blood to redden his cheeks too much  he lacked decorum and control and was in decided contrast to the young professor of english with whom he talked  but martin was not concerned with appearances  he had been swift to note the others trained mind and to appreciate his command of knowledge furthermore professor caldwell did not realize martins concept of the average english professor  martin wanted him to talk shop and though he seemed averse at first succeeded in making him do it  for martin did not see why a man should not talk shop  its absurd and unfair he had told ruth weeks before this objection to talking shop  for what reason under the sun do men and women come together if not for the exchange of the best that is in them  and the best that is in them is what they are interested in the thing by which they make their living the thing theyve specialized on and sat up days and nights over and even dreamed about  imagine mr butler living up to social etiquette and enunciating his views on paul verlaine or the german drama or the novels of dannunzio  wed be bored to death  i for one if i must listen to mr butler prefer to hear him talk about his law its the best that is in him and life is so short that i want the best of every man and woman i meet  but ruth had objected there are the topics of general interest to all  there you mistake he had rushed on  all persons in society all cliques in societyor rather nearly all persons and cliquesape their betters  now who are the best betters  the idlers the wealthy idlers they do not know as a rule the things known by the persons who are doing something in the world  to listen to conversation about such things would mean to be bored wherefore the idlers decree that such things are shop and must not be talked about  likewise they decree the things that are not shop and which may be talked about and those things are the latest operas latest novels cards billiards cocktails automobiles horse shows trout fishing tunafishing biggame shooting yacht sailing and so forthand mark you these are the things the idlers know  in all truth they constitute the shoptalk of the idlers and the funniest part of it is that many of the clever people and all the wouldbe clever people allow the idlers so to impose upon them  as for me i want the best a mans got in him call it shop vulgarity or anything you please  and ruth had not understood  this attack of his on the established had seemed to her just so much wilfulness of opinion  so martin contaminated professor caldwell with his own earnestness challenging him to speak his mind  as ruth paused beside them she heard martin saying  you surely dont pronounce such heresies in the university of california  professor caldwell shrugged his shoulders  the honest taxpayer and the politician you know  sacramento gives us our appropriations and therefore we kowtow to sacramento and to the board of regents and to the party press or to the press of both parties  yes thats clear but how about you martin urged  you must be a fish out of the water  few like me i imagine in the university pond  sometimes i am fairly sure i am out of water and that i should belong in paris in grub street in a hermits cave or in some sadly wild bohemian crowd drinking claretdagored they call it in san franciscodining in cheap restaurants in the latin quarter and expressing vociferously radical views upon all creation  really i am frequently almost sure that i was cut out to be a radical  but then there are so many questions on which i am not sure  i grow timid when i am face to face with my human frailty which ever prevents me from grasping all the factors in any problemhuman vital problems you know  and as he talked on martin became aware that to his own lips had come the song of the trade wind     i am strongest at noon    but under the moon    i stiffen the bunt of the sail  he was almost humming the words and it dawned upon him that the other reminded him of the trade wind of the northeast trade steady and cool and strong  he was equable he was to be relied upon and withal there was a certain bafflement about him  martin had the feeling that he never spoke his full mind just as he had often had the feeling that the trades never blew their strongest but always held reserves of strength that were never used  martins trick of visioning was active as ever  his brain was a most accessible storehouse of remembered fact and fancy and its contents seemed ever ordered and spread for his inspection  whatever occurred in the instant present martins mind immediately presented associated antithesis or similitude which ordinarily expressed themselves to him in vision  it was sheerly automatic and his visioning was an unfailing accompaniment to the living present  just as ruths face in a momentary jealousy had called before his eyes a forgotten moonlight gale and as professor caldwell made him see again the northeast trade herding the white billows across the purple sea so from moment to moment not disconcerting but rather identifying and classifying new memoryvisions rose before him or spread under his eyelids or were thrown upon the screen of his consciousness  these visions came out of the actions and sensations of the past out of things and events and books of yesterday and last weeka countless host of apparitions that waking or sleeping forever thronged his mind  so it was as he listened to professor caldwells easy flow of speechthe conversation of a clever cultured manthat martin kept seeing himself down all his past  he saw himself when he had been quite the hoodlum wearing a stiffrim stetson hat and a squarecut doublebreasted coat with a certain swagger to the shoulders and possessing the ideal of being as tough as the police permitted  he did not disguise it to himself nor attempt to palliate it  at one time in his life he had been just a common hoodlum the leader of a gang that worried the police and terrorized honest workingclass householders  but his ideals had changed  he glanced about him at the wellbred welldressed men and women and breathed into his lungs the atmosphere of culture and refinement and at the same moment the ghost of his early youth in stiff rim and squarecut with swagger and toughness stalked across the room this figure of the corner hoodlum he saw merge into himself sitting and talking with an actual university professor  for after all he had never found his permanent abiding place  he had fitted in wherever he found himself been a favorite always and everywhere by virtue of holding his own at work and at play and by his willingness and ability to fight for his rights and command respect  but he had never taken root  he had fitted in sufficiently to satisfy his fellows but not to satisfy himself  he had been perturbed always by a feeling of unrest had heard always the call of something from beyond and had wandered on through life seeking it until he found books and art and love  and here he was in the midst of all this the only one of all the comrades he had adventured with who could have made themselves eligible for the inside of the morse home  but such thoughts and visions did not prevent him from following professor caldwell closely  and as he followed comprehendingly and critically he noted the unbroken field of the others knowledge  as for himself from moment to moment the conversation showed him gaps and open stretches whole subjects with which he was unfamiliar  nevertheless thanks to his spencer he saw that he possessed the outlines of the field of knowledge  it was a matter only of time when he would fill in the outline  then watch out he thoughtware shoal everybody  he felt like sitting at the feet of the professor worshipful and absorbent but as he listened he began to discern a weakness in the others judgmentsa weakness so stray and elusive that he might not have caught it had it not been ever present  and when he did catch it he leapt to equality at once  ruth came up to them a second time just as martin began to speak  ill tell you where you are wrong or rather what weakens your judgments he said  you lack biology  it has no place in your scheme of thingsoh i mean the real interpretative biology from the ground up from the laboratory and the testtube and the vitalized inorganic right on up to the widest aesthetic and sociological generalizations  ruth was appalled  she had sat two lecture courses under professor caldwell and looked up to him as the living repository of all knowledge  i scarcely follow you he said dubiously  martin was not so sure but what he had followed him  then ill try to explain he said  i remember reading in egyptian history something to the effect that understanding could not be had of egyptian art without first studying the land question  quite right the professor nodded  and it seems to me martin continued that knowledge of the land question in turn of all questions for that matter cannot be had without previous knowledge of the stuff and the constitution of life  how can we understand laws and institutions religions and customs without understanding not merely the nature of the creatures that made them but the nature of the stuff out of which the creatures are made  is literature less human than the architecture and sculpture of egypt  is there one thing in the known universe that is not subject to the law of evolutionoh i know there is an elaborate evolution of the various arts laid down but it seems to me to be too mechanical  the human himself is left out  the evolution of the tool of the harp of music and song and dance are all beautifully elaborated but how about the evolution of the human himself the development of the basic and intrinsic parts that were in him before he made his first tool or gibbered his first chant  it is that which you do not consider and which i call biology  it is biology in its largest aspects  i know i express myself incoherently but ive tried to hammer out the idea  it came to me as you were talking so i was not primed and ready to deliver it  you spoke yourself of the human frailty that prevented one from taking all the factors into consideration  and you in turnor so it seems to meleave out the biological factor the very stuff out of which has been spun the fabric of all the arts the warp and the woof of all human actions and achievements  to ruths amazement martin was not immediately crushed and that the professor replied in the way he did struck her as forbearance for martins youth  professor caldwell sat for a full minute silent and fingering his watch chain  do you know he said at last ive had that same criticism passed on me once beforeby a very great man a scientist and evolutionist joseph le conte  but he is dead and i thought to remain undetected and now you come along and expose me  seriously thoughand this is confessioni think there is something in your contentiona great deal in fact  i am too classical not enough uptodate in the interpretative branches of science and i can only plead the disadvantages of my education and a temperamental slothfulness that prevents me from doing the work  i wonder if youll believe that ive never been inside a physics or chemistry laboratory  it is true nevertheless  le conte was right and so are you mr eden at least to an extenthow much i do not know  ruth drew martin away with her on a pretext when she had got him aside whispering  you shouldnt have monopolized professor caldwell that way  there may be others who want to talk with him  my mistake martin admitted contritely  but id got him stirred up and he was so interesting that i did not think  do you know he is the brightest the most intellectual man i have ever talked with  and ill tell you something else  i once thought that everybody who went to universities or who sat in the high places in society was just as brilliant and intelligent as he  hes an exception she answered  i should say so  whom do you want me to talk to nowoh say bring me up against that cashierfellow  martin talked for fifteen minutes with him nor could ruth have wished better behavior on her lovers part  not once did his eyes flash nor his cheeks flush while the calmness and poise with which he talked surprised her  but in martins estimation the whole tribe of bank cashiers fell a few hundred per cent and for the rest of the evening he labored under the impression that bank cashiers and talkers of platitudes were synonymous phrases  the army officer he found goodnatured and simple a healthy wholesome young fellow content to occupy the place in life into which birth and luck had flung him  on learning that he had completed two years in the university martin was puzzled to know where he had stored it away  nevertheless martin liked him better than the platitudinous bank cashier  i really dont object to platitudes he told ruth later but what worries me into nervousness is the pompous smugly complacent superior certitude with which they are uttered and the time taken to do it  why i could give that man the whole history of the reformation in the time he took to tell me that the unionlabor party had fused with the democrats do you know he skins his words as a professional pokerplayer skins the cards that are dealt out to him  some day ill show you what i mean  im sorry you dont like him was her reply  hes a favorite of mr butlers  mr butler says he is safe and honestcalls him the rock peter and says that upon him any banking institution can well be built  i dont doubt itfrom the little i saw of him and the less i heard from him but i dont think so much of banks as i did  you dont mind my speaking my mind this way dear  no no it is most interesting  yes martin went on heartily im no more than a barbarian getting my first impressions of civilization  such impressions must be entertainingly novel to the civilized person  what did you think of my cousins ruth queried  i liked them better than the other women  theres plenty of fun in them along with paucity of pretence  then you did like the other women  he shook his head  that socialsettlement woman is no more than a sociological pollparrot i swear if you winnowed her out between the stars like tomlinson there would be found in her not one original thought  as for the portraitpainter she was a positive bore  shed make a good wife for the cashier  and the musician woman  i dont care how nimble her fingers are how perfect her technique how wonderful her expressionthe fact is she knows nothing about music  she plays beautifully ruth protested  yes shes undoubtedly gymnastic in the externals of music but the intrinsic spirit of music is unguessed by her  i asked her what music meant to heryou know im always curious to know that particular thing and she did not know what it meant to her except that she adored it that it was the greatest of the arts and that it meant more than life to her  you were making them talk shop ruth charged him  i confess it  and if they were failures on shop imagine my sufferings if they had discoursed on other subjects  why i used to think that up here where all the advantages of culture were enjoyed  he paused for a moment and watched the youthful shade of himself in stiffrim and squarecut enter the door and swagger across the room  as i was saying up here i thought all men and women were brilliant and radiant but now from what little ive seen of them they strike me as a pack of ninnies most of them and ninety percent of the remainder as bores  now theres professor caldwellhes different  hes a man every inch of him and every atom of his gray matter  ruths face brightened  tell me about him she urged  not what is large and brillianti know those qualities but whatever you feel is adverse  i am most curious to know  perhaps ill get myself in a pickle  martin debated humorously for a moment  suppose you tell me first  or maybe you find in him nothing less than the best  i attended two lecture courses under him and i have known him for two years that is why i am anxious for your first impression  bad impression you mean  well here goes  he is all the fine things you think about him i guess  at least he is the finest specimen of intellectual man i have met but he is a man with a secret shame  oh no no he hastened to cry  nothing paltry nor vulgar  what i mean is that he strikes me as a man who has gone to the bottom of things and is so afraid of what he saw that he makes believe to himself that he never saw it  perhaps thats not the clearest way to express it  heres another way  a man who has found the path to the hidden temple but has not followed it who has perhaps caught glimpses of the temple and striven afterward to convince himself that it was only a mirage of foliage  yet another way  a man who could have done things but who placed no value on the doing and who all the time in his innermost heart is regretting that he has not done them who has secretly laughed at the rewards for doing and yet still more secretly has yearned for the rewards and for the joy of doing  i dont read him that way she said  and for that matter i dont see just what you mean  it is only a vague feeling on my part martin temporized  i have no reason for it  it is only a feeling and most likely it is wrong  you certainly should know him better than i  from the evening at ruths martin brought away with him strange confusions and conflicting feelings  he was disappointed in his goal in the persons he had climbed to be with  on the other hand he was encouraged with his success  the climb had been easier than he expected he was superior to the climb and he did not with false modesty hide it from himself he was superior to the beings among whom he had climbedwith the exception of course of professor caldwell  about life and the books he knew more than they and he wondered into what nooks and crannies they had cast aside their educations  he did not know that he was himself possessed of unusual brain vigor nor did he know that the persons who were given to probing the depths and to thinking ultimate thoughts were not to be found in the drawing rooms of the worlds morses nor did he dream that such persons were as lonely eagles sailing solitary in the azure sky far above the earth and its swarming freight of gregarious life     chapter xxviii   but success had lost martins address and her messengers no longer came to his door  for twentyfive days working sundays and holidays he toiled on the shame of the sun a long essay of some thirty thousand words  it was a deliberate attack on the mysticism of the maeterlinck schoolan attack from the citadel of positive science upon the wonder dreamers but an attack nevertheless that retained much of beauty and wonder of the sort compatible with ascertained fact  it was a little later that he followed up the attack with two short essays the wonder dreamers and the yardstick of the ego  and on essays long and short he began to pay the travelling expenses from magazine to magazine  during the twentyfive days spent on the shame of the sun he sold hack work to the extent of six dollars and fifty cents  a joke had brought in fifty cents and a second one sold to a highgrade comic weekly had fetched a dollar  then two humorous poems had earned two dollars and three dollars respectively  as a result having exhausted his credit with the tradesmen though he had increased his credit with the grocer to five dollars his wheel and suit of clothes went back to the pawnbroker the typewriter people were again clamoring for money insistently pointing out that according to the agreement rent was to be paid strictly in advance  encouraged by his several small sales martin went back to hackwork perhaps there was a living in it after all  stored away under his table were the twenty storiettes which had been rejected by the newspaper short story syndicate  he read them over in order to find out how not to write newspaper storiettes and so doing reasoned out the perfect formula  he found that the newspaper storiette should never be tragic should never end unhappily and should never contain beauty of language subtlety of thought nor real delicacy of sentiment  sentiment it must contain plenty of it pure and noble of the sort that in his own early youth had brought his applause from nigger heaventhe forgodmycountryand theczar and imaybepoorbutiamhonest brand of sentiment  having learned such precautions martin consulted the duchess for tone and proceeded to mix according to formula  the formula consists of three parts 1 a pair of lovers are jarred apart 2 by some deed or event they are reunited 3 marriage bells  the third part was an unvarying quantity but the first and second parts could be varied an infinite number of times  thus the pair of lovers could be jarred apart by misunderstood motives by accident of fate by jealous rivals by irate parents by crafty guardians by scheming relatives and so forth and so forth they could be reunited by a brave deed of the man lover by a similar deed of the woman lover by change of heart in one lover or the other by forced confession of crafty guardian scheming relative or jealous rival by voluntary confession of same by discovery of some unguessed secret by lover storming girls heart by lover making long and noble selfsacrifice and so on endlessly  it was very fetching to make the girl propose in the course of being reunited and martin discovered bit by bit other decidedly piquant and fetching ruses  but marriage bells at the end was the one thing he could take no liberties with though the heavens rolled up as a scroll and the stars fell the wedding bells must go on ringing just the same  in quantity the formula prescribed twelve hundred words minimum dose fifteen hundred words maximum dose  before he got very far along in the art of the storiette martin worked out half a dozen stock forms which he always consulted when constructing storiettes  these forms were like the cunning tables used by mathematicians which may be entered from top bottom right and left which entrances consist of scores of lines and dozens of columns and from which may be drawn without reasoning or thinking thousands of different conclusions all unchallengably precise and true  thus in the course of half an hour with his forms martin could frame up a dozen or so storiettes which he put aside and filled in at his convenience  he found that he could fill one in after a day of serious work in the hour before going to bed  as he later confessed to ruth he could almost do it in his sleep  the real work was in constructing the frames and that was merely mechanical  he had no doubt whatever of the efficacy of his formula and for once he knew the editorial mind when he said positively to himself that the first two he sent off would bring checks  and checks they brought for four dollars each at the end of twelve days  in the meantime he was making fresh and alarming discoveries concerning the magazines  though the transcontinental had published the ring of bells no check was forthcoming  martin needed it and he wrote for it an evasive answer and a request for more of his work was all he received he had gone hungry two days waiting for the reply and it was then that he put his wheel back in pawn  he wrote regularly twice a week to the transcontinental for his five dollars though it was only semioccasionally that he elicited a reply  he did not know that the transcontinental had been staggering along precariously for years that it was a fourthrater or tenthrater without standing with a crazy circulation that partly rested on petty bullying and partly on patriotic appealing and with advertisements that were scarcely more than charitable donations  nor did he know that the transcontinental was the sole livelihood of the editor and the business manager and that they could wring their livelihood out of it only by moving to escape paying rent and by never paying any bill they could evade  nor could he have guessed that the particular five dollars that belonged to him had been appropriated by the business manager for the painting of his house in alameda which painting he performed himself on weekday afternoons because he could not afford to pay union wages and because the first scab he had employed had had a ladder jerked out from under him and been sent to the hospital with a broken collarbone  the ten dollars for which martin had sold treasure hunters to the chicago newspaper did not come to hand  the article had been published as he had ascertained at the file in the central readingroom but no word could he get from the editor  his letters were ignored  to satisfy himself that they had been received he registered several of them  it was nothing less than robbery he concludeda coldblooded steal while he starved he was pilfered of his merchandise of his goods the sale of which was the sole way of getting bread to eat  youth and age was a weekly and it had published twothirds of his twenty onethousandword serial when it went out of business  with it went all hopes of getting his sixteen dollars  to cap the situation the pot which he looked upon as one of the best things he had written was lost to him  in despair casting about frantically among the magazines he had sent it to the billow a society weekly in san francisco  his chief reason for submitting it to that publication was that having only to travel across the bay from oakland a quick decision could be reached  two weeks later he was overjoyed to see in the latest number on the newsstand his story printed in full illustrated and in the place of honor  he went home with leaping pulse wondering how much they would pay him for one of the best things he had done  also the celerity with which it had been accepted and published was a pleasant thought to him  that the editor had not informed him of the acceptance made the surprise more complete  after waiting a week two weeks and half a week longer desperation conquered diffidence and he wrote to the editor of the billow suggesting that possibly through some negligence of the business manager his little account had been overlooked  even if it isnt more than five dollars martin thought to himself it will buy enough beans and peasoup to enable me to write half a dozen like it and possibly as good  back came a cool letter from the editor that at least elicited martins admiration  we thank you it ran for your excellent contribution  all of us in the office enjoyed it immensely and as you see it was given the place of honor and immediate publication  we earnestly hope that you liked the illustrations  on rereading your letter it seems to us that you are laboring under the misapprehension that we pay for unsolicited manuscripts  this is not our custom and of course yours was unsolicited  we assumed naturally when we received your story that you understood the situation  we can only deeply regret this unfortunate misunderstanding and assure you of our unfailing regard  again thanking you for your kind contribution and hoping to receive more from you in the near future we remain etc  there was also a postscript to the effect that though the billow carried no freelist it took great pleasure in sending him a complimentary subscription for the ensuing year  after that experience martin typed at the top of the first sheet of all his manuscripts submitted at your usual rate  some day he consoled himself they will be submitted at my usual rate  he discovered in himself at this period a passion for perfection under the sway of which he rewrote and polished the jostling street the wine of life joy the sea lyrics and others of his earlier work as of old nineteen hours of labor a day was all too little to suit him he wrote prodigiously and he read prodigiously forgetting in his toil the pangs caused by giving up his tobacco  ruths promised cure for the habit flamboyantly labelled he stowed away in the most inaccessible corner of his bureau  especially during his stretches of famine he suffered from lack of the weed but no matter how often he mastered the craving it remained with him as strong as ever  he regarded it as the biggest thing he had ever achieved  ruths point of view was that he was doing no more than was right  she brought him the antitobacco remedy purchased out of her glove money and in a few days forgot all about it  his machinemade storiettes though he hated them and derided them were successful  by means of them he redeemed all his pledges paid most of his bills and bought a new set of tires for his wheel  the storiettes at least kept the pot aboiling and gave him time for ambitious work while the one thing that upheld him was the forty dollars he had received from the white mouse  he anchored his faith to that and was confident that the really firstclass magazines would pay an unknown writer at least an equal rate if not a better one  but the thing was how to get into the firstclass magazines  his best stories essays and poems went begging among them and yet each month he read reams of dull prosy inartistic stuff between all their various covers  if only one editor he sometimes thought would descend from his high seat of pride to write me one cheering line  no matter if my work is unusual no matter if it is unfit for prudential reasons for their pages surely there must be some sparks in it somewhere a few to warm them to some sort of appreciation  and thereupon he would get out one or another of his manuscripts such as adventure and read it over and over in a vain attempt to vindicate the editorial silence  as the sweet california spring came on his period of plenty came to an end  for several weeks he had been worried by a strange silence on the part of the newspaper storiette syndicate  then one day came back to him through the mail ten of his immaculate machinemade storiettes  they were accompanied by a brief letter to the effect that the syndicate was overstocked and that some months would elapse before it would be in the market again for manuscripts  martin had even been extravagant on the strength of those ten storiettes  toward the last the syndicate had been paying him five dollars each for them and accepting every one he sent  so he had looked upon the ten as good as sold and he had lived accordingly on a basis of fifty dollars in the bank  so it was that he entered abruptly upon a lean period wherein he continued selling his earlier efforts to publications that would not pay and submitting his later work to magazines that would not buy  also he resumed his trips to the pawnbroker down in oakland  a few jokes and snatches of humorous verse sold to the new york weeklies made existence barely possible for him  it was at this time that he wrote letters of inquiry to the several great monthly and quarterly reviews and learned in reply that they rarely considered unsolicited articles and that most of their contents were written upon order by wellknown specialists who were authorities in their various fields     chapter xxix   it was a hard summer for martin  manuscript readers and editors were away on vacation and publications that ordinarily returned a decision in three weeks now retained his manuscript for three months or more  the consolation he drew from it was that a saving in postage was effected by the deadlock  only the robberpublications seemed to remain actively in business and to them martin disposed of all his early efforts such as pearldiving the sea as a career turtlecatching and the northeast trades  for these manuscripts he never received a penny  it is true after six months correspondence he effected a compromise whereby he received a safety razor for turtlecatching and that the acropolis having agreed to give him five dollars cash and five yearly subscriptions for the northeast trades fulfilled the second part of the agreement  for a sonnet on stevenson he managed to wring two dollars out of a boston editor who was running a magazine with a matthew arnold taste and a penny dreadful purse  the peri and the pearl a clever skit of a poem of two hundred lines just finished white hot from his brain won the heart of the editor of a san francisco magazine published in the interest of a great railroad  when the editor wrote offering him payment in transportation martin wrote back to inquire if the transportation was transferable  it was not and so being prevented from peddling it he asked for the return of the poem  back it came with the editors regrets and martin sent it to san francisco again this time to the hornet a pretentious monthly that had been fanned into a constellation of the first magnitude by the brilliant journalist who founded it  but the hornets light had begun to dim long before martin was born  the editor promised martin fifteen dollars for the poem but when it was published seemed to forget about it  several of his letters being ignored martin indicted an angry one which drew a reply  it was written by a new editor who coolly informed martin that he declined to be held responsible for the old editors mistakes and that he did not think much of the peri and the pearl anyway  but the globe a chicago magazine gave martin the most cruel treatment of all  he had refrained from offering his sea lyrics for publication until driven to it by starvation  after having been rejected by a dozen magazines they had come to rest in the globe office  there were thirty poems in the collection and he was to receive a dollar apiece for them the first month four were published and he promptly received a cheek for four dollars but when he looked over the magazine he was appalled at the slaughter  in some cases the titles had been altered finis for instance being changed to the finish and the song of the outer reef to the song of the coral reef  in one case an absolutely different title a misappropriate title was substituted  in place of his own medusa lights the editor had printed the backward track  but the slaughter in the body of the poems was terrifying  martin groaned and sweated and thrust his hands through his hair  phrases lines and stanzas were cut out interchanged or juggled about in the most incomprehensible manner  sometimes lines and stanzas not his own were substituted for his  he could not believe that a sane editor could be guilty of such maltreatment and his favorite hypothesis was that his poems must have been doctored by the office boy or the stenographer martin wrote immediately begging the editor to cease publishing the lyrics and to return them to him  he wrote again and again begging entreating threatening but his letters were ignored  month by month the slaughter went on till the thirty poems were published and month by month he received a check for those which had appeared in the current number  despite these various misadventures the memory of the white mouse forty dollar check sustained him though he was driven more and more to hack work  he discovered a breadandbutter field in the agricultural weeklies and trade journals though among the religious weeklies he found he could easily starve  at his lowest ebb when his black suit was in pawn he made a tenstrikeor so it seemed to himin a prize contest arranged by the county committee of the republican party  there were three branches of the contest and he entered them all laughing at himself bitterly the while in that he was driven to such straits to live his poem won the first prize of ten dollars his campaign song the second prize of five dollars his essay on the principles of the republican party the first prize of twentyfive dollars  which was very gratifying to him until he tried to collect  something had gone wrong in the county committee and though a rich banker and a state senator were members of it the money was not forthcoming  while this affair was hanging fire he proved that he understood the principles of the democratic party by winning the first prize for his essay in a similar contest  and moreover he received the money twentyfive dollars  but the forty dollars won in the first contest he never received  driven to shifts in order to see ruth and deciding that the long walk from north oakland to her house and back again consumed too much time he kept his black suit in pawn in place of his bicycle  the latter gave him exercise saved him hours of time for work and enabled him to see ruth just the same  a pair of knee duck trousers and an old sweater made him a presentable wheel costume so that he could go with ruth on afternoon rides  besides he no longer had opportunity to see much of her in her own home where mrs morse was thoroughly prosecuting her campaign of entertainment  the exalted beings he met there and to whom he had looked up but a short time before now bored him  they were no longer exalted  he was nervous and irritable what of his hard times disappointments and close application to work and the conversation of such people was maddening  he was not unduly egotistic  he measured the narrowness of their minds by the minds of the thinkers in the books he read  at ruths home he never met a large mind with the exception of professor caldwell and caldwell he had met there only once  as for the rest they were numskulls ninnies superficial dogmatic and ignorant it was their ignorance that astounded him  what was the matter with them  what had they done with their educations  they had had access to the same books he had  how did it happen that they had drawn nothing from them  he knew that the great minds the deep and rational thinkers existed  he had his proofs from the books the books that had educated him beyond the morse standard  and he knew that higher intellects than those of the morse circle were to be found in the world  he read english society novels wherein he caught glimpses of men and women talking politics and philosophy  and he read of salons in great cities even in the united states where art and intellect congregated  foolishly in the past he had conceived that all wellgroomed persons above the working class were persons with power of intellect and vigor of beauty  culture and collars had gone together to him and he had been deceived into believing that college educations and mastery were the same things  well he would fight his way on and up higher  and he would take ruth with him  her he dearly loved and he was confident that she would shine anywhere  as it was clear to him that he had been handicapped by his early environment so now he perceived that she was similarly handicapped  she had not had a chance to expand  the books on her fathers shelves the paintings on the walls the music on the pianoall was just so much meretricious display  to real literature real painting real music the morses and their kind were dead  and bigger than such things was life of which they were densely hopelessly ignorant  in spite of their unitarian proclivities and their masks of conservative broadmindedness they were two generations behind interpretative science their mental processes were mediaeval while their thinking on the ultimate data of existence and of the universe struck him as the same metaphysical method that was as young as the youngest race as old as the caveman and olderthe same that moved the first pleistocene apeman to fear the dark that moved the first hasty hebrew savage to incarnate eve from adams rib that moved descartes to build an idealistic system of the universe out of the projections of his own puny ego and that moved the famous british ecclesiastic to denounce evolution in satire so scathing as to win immediate applause and leave his name a notorious scrawl on the page of history  so martin thought and he thought further till it dawned upon him that the difference between these lawyers officers business men and bank cashiers he had met and the members of the working class he had known was on a par with the difference in the food they ate clothes they wore neighborhoods in which they lived  certainly in all of them was lacking the something more which he found in himself and in the books  the morses had shown him the best their social position could produce and he was not impressed by it  a pauper himself a slave to the moneylender he knew himself the superior of those he met at the morses and when his one decent suit of clothes was out of pawn he moved among them a lord of life quivering with a sense of outrage akin to what a prince would suffer if condemned to live with goatherds  you hate and fear the socialists he remarked to mr morse one evening at dinner but why  you know neither them nor their doctrines  the conversation had been swung in that direction by mrs morse who had been invidiously singing the praises of mr hapgood  the cashier was martins black beast and his temper was a trifle short where the talker of platitudes was concerned  yes he had said charley hapgood is what they call a rising young mansomebody told me as much  and it is true  hell make the governors chair before he dies and who knows maybe the united states senate  what makes you think so mrs morse had inquired  ive heard him make a campaign speech  it was so cleverly stupid and unoriginal and also so convincing that the leaders cannot help but regard him as safe and sure while his platitudes are so much like the platitudes of the average voter thatoh well you know you flatter any man by dressing up his own thoughts for him and presenting them to him  i actually think you are jealous of mr hapgood ruth had chimed in  heaven forbid  the look of horror on martins face stirred mrs morse to belligerence  you surely dont mean to say that mr hapgood is stupid she demanded icily  no more than the average republican was the retort or average democrat either  they are all stupid when they are not crafty and very few of them are crafty  the only wise republicans are the millionnaires and their conscious henchmen  they know which side their bread is buttered on and they know why  i am a republican mr morse put in lightly  pray how do you classify me  oh you are an unconscious henchman  henchman  why yes  you do corporation work  you have no workingclass nor criminal practice  you dont depend upon wifebeaters and pickpockets for your income  you get your livelihood from the masters of society and whoever feeds a man is that mans master  yes you are a henchman you are interested in advancing the interests of the aggregations of capital you serve  mr morses face was a trifle red  i confess sir he said that you talk like a scoundrelly socialist  then it was that martin made his remark  you hate and fear the socialists but why  you know neither them nor their doctrines  your doctrine certainly sounds like socialism mr morse replied while ruth gazed anxiously from one to the other and mrs morse beamed happily at the opportunity afforded of rousing her liege lords antagonism  because i say republicans are stupid and hold that liberty equality and fraternity are exploded bubbles does not make me a socialist martin said with a smile  because i question jefferson and the unscientific frenchmen who informed his mind does not make me a socialist  believe me mr morse you are far nearer socialism than i who am its avowed enemy  now you please to be facetious was all the other could say  not at all  i speak in all seriousness  you still believe in equality and yet you do the work of the corporations and the corporations from day to day are busily engaged in burying equality  and you call me a socialist because i deny equality because i affirm just what you live up to  the republicans are foes to equality though most of them fight the battle against equality with the very word itself the slogan on their lips  in the name of equality they destroy equality  that was why i called them stupid  as for myself i am an individualist  i believe the race is to the swift the battle to the strong  such is the lesson i have learned from biology or at least think i have learned  as i said i am an individualist and individualism is the hereditary and eternal foe of socialism  but you frequent socialist meetings mr morse challenged  certainly just as spies frequent hostile camps  how else are you to learn about the enemy  besides i enjoy myself at their meetings  they are good fighters and right or wrong they have read the books  any one of them knows far more about sociology and all the other ologies than the average captain of industry  yes i have been to half a dozen of their meetings but that doesnt make me a socialist any more than hearing charley hapgood orate made me a republican  i cant help it mr morse said feebly but i still believe you incline that way  bless me martin thought to himself he doesnt know what i was talking about  he hasnt understood a word of it  what did he do with his education anyway  thus in his development martin found himself face to face with economic morality or the morality of class and soon it became to him a grisly monster  personally he was an intellectual moralist and more offending to him than platitudinous pomposity was the morality of those about him which was a curious hotchpotch of the economic the metaphysical the sentimental and the imitative  a sample of this curious messy mixture he encountered nearer home  his sister marian had been keeping company with an industrious young mechanic of german extraction who after thoroughly learning the trade had set up for himself in a bicyclerepair shop  also having got the agency for a lowgrade make of wheel he was prosperous  marian had called on martin in his room a short time before to announce her engagement during which visit she had playfully inspected martins palm and told his fortune  on her next visit she brought hermann von schmidt along with her  martin did the honors and congratulated both of them in language so easy and graceful as to affect disagreeably the peasantmind of his sisters lover  this bad impression was further heightened by martins reading aloud the halfdozen stanzas of verse with which he had commemorated marians previous visit  it was a bit of society verse airy and delicate which he had named the palmist  he was surprised when he finished reading it to note no enjoyment in his sisters face instead her eyes were fixed anxiously upon her betrothed and martin following her gaze saw spread on that worthys asymmetrical features nothing but black and sullen disapproval  the incident passed over they made an early departure and martin forgot all about it though for the moment he had been puzzled that any woman even of the working class should not have been flattered and delighted by having poetry written about her  several evenings later marian again visited him this time alone  nor did she waste time in coming to the point upbraiding him sorrowfully for what he had done  why marian he chided you talk as though you were ashamed of your relatives or of your brother at any rate  and i am too she blurted out  martin was bewildered by the tears of mortification he saw in her eyes the mood whatever it was was genuine  but marian why should your hermann be jealous of my writing poetry about my own sister  he aint jealous she sobbed  he says it was indecent obobscene  martin emitted a long low whistle of incredulity then proceeded to resurrect and read a carbon copy of the palmist  i cant see it he said finally proffering the manuscript to her read it yourself and show me whatever strikes you as obscenethat was the word wasnt it  he says so and he ought to know was the answer with a wave aside of the manuscript accompanied by a look of loathing  and he says youve got to tear it up  he says he wont have no wife of his with such things written about her which anybody can read  he says its a disgrace an he wont stand for it  now look here marian this is nothing but nonsense martin began then abruptly changed his mind  he saw before him an unhappy girl knew the futility of attempting to convince her husband or her and though the whole situation was absurd and preposterous he resolved to surrender  all right he announced tearing the manuscript into half a dozen pieces and throwing it into the wastebasket  he contented himself with the knowledge that even then the original type written manuscript was reposing in the office of a new york magazine marian and her husband would never know and neither himself nor they nor the world would lose if the pretty harmless poem ever were published  marian starting to reach into the wastebasket refrained  can i she pleaded  he nodded his head regarding her thoughtfully as she gathered the torn pieces of manuscript and tucked them into the pocket of her jacketocular evidence of the success of her mission  she reminded him of lizzie connolly though there was less of fire and gorgeous flaunting life in her than in that other girl of the working class whom he had seen twice but they were on a par the pair of them in dress and carriage and he smiled with inward amusement at the caprice of his fancy which suggested the appearance of either of them in mrs morses drawingroom  the amusement faded and he was aware of a great loneliness  this sister of his and the morse drawingroom were milestones of the road he had travelled  and he had left them behind  he glanced affectionately about him at his few books  they were all the comrades left to him  hello whats that he demanded in startled surprise  marian repeated her question  why dont i go to work  he broke into a laugh that was only halfhearted  that hermann of yours has been talking to you  she shook her head  dont lie he commanded and the nod of her head affirmed his charge  well you tell that hermann of yours to mind his own business that when i write poetry about the girl hes keeping company with its his business but that outside of that hes got no say so  understand  so you dont think ill succeed as a writer eh he went on  you think im no goodthat ive fallen down and am a disgrace to the family  i think it would be much better if you got a job she said firmly and he saw she was sincere  hermann says  damn hermann he broke out goodnaturedly  what i want to know is when youre going to get married  also you find out from your hermann if he will deign to permit you to accept a wedding present from me  he mused over the incident after she had gone and once or twice broke out into laughter that was bitter as he saw his sister and her betrothed all the members of his own class and the members of ruths class directing their narrow little lives by narrow little formulasherdcreatures flocking together and patterning their lives by one anothers opinions failing of being individuals and of really living life because of the childlike formulas by which they were enslaved  he summoned them before him in apparitional procession bernard higginbotham arm in arm with mr butler hermann von schmidt cheek by jowl with charley hapgood and one by one and in pairs he judged them and dismissed themjudged them by the standards of intellect and morality he had learned from the books  vainly he asked where are the great souls the great men and women  he found them not among the careless gross and stupid intelligences that answered the call of vision to his narrow room he felt a loathing for them such as circe must have felt for her swine when he had dismissed the last one and thought himself alone a latecomer entered unexpected and unsummoned  martin watched him and saw the stiffrim the squarecut doublebreasted coat and the swaggering shoulders of the youthful hoodlum who had once been he  you were like all the rest young fellow martin sneered  your morality and your knowledge were just the same as theirs  you did not think and act for yourself  your opinions like your clothes were ready made your acts were shaped by popular approval  you were cock of your gang because others acclaimed you the real thing  you fought and ruled the gang not because you liked toyou know you really despised itbut because the other fellows patted you on the shoulder  you licked cheese face because you wouldnt give in and you wouldnt give in partly because you were an abysmal brute and for the rest because you believed what every one about you believed that the measure of manhood was the carnivorous ferocity displayed in injuring and marring fellowcreatures anatomies  why you whelp you even won other fellows girls away from them not because you wanted the girls but because in the marrow of those about you those who set your moral pace was the instinct of the wild stallion and the bullseal  well the years have passed and what do you think about it now  as if in reply the vision underwent a swift metamorphosis  the stiff rim and the squarecut vanished being replaced by milder garments the toughness went out of the face the hardness out of the eyes and the face chastened and refined was irradiated from an inner life of communion with beauty and knowledge  the apparition was very like his present self and as he regarded it he noted the studentlamp by which it was illuminated and the book over which it pored  he glanced at the title and read the science of aesthetics  next he entered into the apparition trimmed the studentlamp and himself went on reading the science of aesthetics     chapter xxx   on a beautiful fall day a day of similar indian summer to that which had seen their love declared the year before martin read his lovecycle to ruth  it was in the afternoon and as before they had ridden out to their favorite knoll in the hills  now and again she had interrupted his reading with exclamations of pleasure and now as he laid the last sheet of manuscript with its fellows he waited her judgment  she delayed to speak and at last she spoke haltingly hesitating to frame in words the harshness of her thought  i think they are beautiful very beautiful she said but you cant sell them can you  you see what i mean she said almost pleaded this writing of yours is not practical  something is the mattermaybe it is with the marketthat prevents you from earning a living by it  and please dear dont misunderstand me  i am flattered and made proud and all thati could not be a true woman were it otherwisethat you should write these poems to me  but they do not make our marriage possible  dont you see martin  dont think me mercenary  it is love the thought of our future with which i am burdened  a whole year has gone by since we learned we loved each other and our wedding day is no nearer  dont think me immodest in thus talking about our wedding for really i have my heart all that i am at stake  why dont you try to get work on a newspaper if you are so bound up in your writing  why not become a reporterfor a while at least  it would spoil my style was his answer in a low monotonous voice you have no idea how ive worked for style  but those storiettes she argued  you called them hackwork  you wrote many of them  didnt they spoil your style  no the cases are different  the storiettes were ground out jaded at the end of a long day of application to style  but a reporters work is all hack from morning till night is the one paramount thing of life  and it is a whirlwind life the life of the moment with neither past nor future and certainly without thought of any style but reportorial style and that certainly is not literature  to become a reporter now just as my style is taking form crystallizing would be to commit literary suicide  as it is every storiette every word of every storiette was a violation of myself of my selfrespect of my respect for beauty  i tell you it was sickening  i was guilty of sin  and i was secretly glad when the markets failed even if my clothes did go into pawn  but the joy of writing the lovecycle  the creative joy in its noblest form that was compensation for everything  martin did not know that ruth was unsympathetic concerning the creative joy  she used the phraseit was on her lips he had first heard it  she had read about it studied about it in the university in the course of earning her bachelorship of arts but she was not original not creative and all manifestations of culture on her part were but harpings of the harpings of others  may not the editor have been right in his revision of your sea lyrics she questioned  remember an editor must have proved qualifications or else he would not be an editor  thats in line with the persistence of the established he rejoined his heat against the editorfolk getting the better of him  what is is not only right but is the best possible  the existence of anything is sufficient vindication of its fitness to existto exist mark you as the average person unconsciously believes not merely in present conditions but in all conditions  it is their ignorance of course that makes them believe such rottheir ignorance which is nothing more nor less than the henidical mental process described by weininger  they think they think and such thinkless creatures are the arbiters of the lives of the few who really think  he paused overcome by the consciousness that he had been talking over ruths head  im sure i dont know who this weininger is she retorted  and you are so dreadfully general that i fail to follow you  what i was speaking of was the qualification of editors  and ill tell you he interrupted  the chief qualification of ninety nine per cent of all editors is failure  they have failed as writers dont think they prefer the drudgery of the desk and the slavery to their circulation and to the business manager to the joy of writing  they have tried to write and they have failed  and right there is the cursed paradox of it  every portal to success in literature is guarded by those watchdogs the failures in literature  the editors subeditors associate editors most of them and the manuscriptreaders for the magazines and bookpublishers most of them nearly all of them are men who wanted to write and who have failed  and yet they of all creatures under the sun the most unfit are the very creatures who decide what shall and what shall not find its way into printthey who have proved themselves not original who have demonstrated that they lack the divine fire sit in judgment upon originality and genius  and after them come the reviewers just so many more failures  dont tell me that they have not dreamed the dream and attempted to write poetry or fiction for they have and they have failed  why the average review is more nauseating than codliver oil  but you know my opinion on the reviewers and the alleged critics  there are great critics but they are as rare as comets  if i fail as a writer i shall have proved for the career of editorship  theres bread and butter and jam at any rate  ruths mind was quick and her disapproval of her lovers views was buttressed by the contradiction she found in his contention  but martin if that be so if all the doors are closed as you have shown so conclusively how is it possible that any of the great writers ever arrived  they arrived by achieving the impossible he answered  they did such blazing glorious work as to burn to ashes those that opposed them  they arrived by course of miracle by winning a thousandtoone wager against them  they arrived because they were carlyles battlescarred giants who will not be kept down  and that is what i must do i must achieve the impossible  but if you fail  you must consider me as well martin  if i fail  he regarded her for a moment as though the thought she had uttered was unthinkable  then intelligence illumined his eyes  if i fail i shall become an editor and you will be an editors wife  she frowned at his facetiousnessa pretty adorable frown that made him put his arm around her and kiss it away  there thats enough she urged by an effort of will withdrawing herself from the fascination of his strength  i have talked with father and mother  i never before asserted myself so against them  i demanded to be heard  i was very undutiful  they are against you you know but i assured them over and over of my abiding love for you and at last father agreed that if you wanted to you could begin right away in his office  and then of his own accord he said he would pay you enough at the start so that we could get married and have a little cottage somewhere  which i think was very fine of himdont you  martin with the dull pain of despair at his heart mechanically reaching for the tobacco and paper which he no longer carried to roll a cigarette muttered something inarticulate and ruth went on  frankly though and dont let it hurt youi tell you to show you precisely how you stand with himhe doesnt like your radical views and he thinks you are lazy  of course i know you are not  i know you work hard  how hard even she did not know was the thought in martins mind  well then he said how about my views  do you think they are so radical  he held her eyes and waited the answer  i think them well very disconcerting she replied  the question was answered for him and so oppressed was he by the grayness of life that he forgot the tentative proposition she had made for him to go to work  and she having gone as far as she dared was willing to wait the answer till she should bring the question up again  she had not long to wait  martin had a question of his own to propound to her  he wanted to ascertain the measure of her faith in him and within the week each was answered  martin precipitated it by reading to her his the shame of the sun  why dont you become a reporter she asked when he had finished  you love writing so and i am sure you would succeed  you could rise in journalism and make a name for yourself  there are a number of great special correspondents  their salaries are large and their field is the world  they are sent everywhere to the heart of africa like stanley or to interview the pope or to explore unknown thibet  then you dont like my essay he rejoined  you believe that i have some show in journalism but none in literature  no no i do like it  it reads well  but i am afraid its over the heads of your readers  at least it is over mine  it sounds beautiful but i dont understand it  your scientific slang is beyond me  you are an extremist you know dear and what may be intelligible to you may not be intelligible to the rest of us  i imagine its the philosophic slang that bothers you was all he could say  he was flaming from the fresh reading of the ripest thought he had expressed and her verdict stunned him  no matter how poorly it is done he persisted dont you see anything in itin the thought of it i mean  she shook her head  no it is so different from anything i have read  i read maeterlinck and understand him  his mysticism you understand that martin flashed out  yes but this of yours which is supposed to be an attack upon him i dont understand  of course if originality counts  he stopped her with an impatient gesture that was not followed by speech he became suddenly aware that she was speaking and that she had been speaking for some time  after all your writing has been a toy to you she was saying  surely you have played with it long enough  it is time to take up life seriouslyour life martin  hitherto you have lived solely your own  you want me to go to work he asked  yes  father has offered  i understand all that he broke in but what i want to know is whether or not you have lost faith in me  she pressed his hand mutely her eyes dim  in your writing dear she admitted in a halfwhisper  youve read lots of my stuff he went on brutally  what do you think of it  is it utterly hopeless  how does it compare with other mens work  but they sell theirs and youdont  that doesnt answer my question  do you think that literature is not at all my vocation  then i will answer  she steeled herself to do it  i dont think you were made to write  forgive me dear  you compel me to say it and you know i know more about literature than you do  yes you are a bachelor of arts he said meditatively and you ought to know  but there is more to be said he continued after a pause painful to both  i know what i have in me  no one knows that so well as i  i know i shall succeed  i will not be kept down  i am afire with what i have to say in verse and fiction and essay  i do not ask you to have faith in that though  i do not ask you to have faith in me nor in my writing  what i do ask of you is to love me and have faith in love  a year ago i believed for two years  one of those years is yet to run and i do believe upon my honor and my soul that before that year is run i shall have succeeded  you remember what you told me long ago that i must serve my apprenticeship to writing  well i have served it  i have crammed it and telescoped it  with you at the end awaiting me i have never shirked  do you know i have forgotten what it is to fall peacefully asleep  a few million years ago i knew what it was to sleep my fill and to awake naturally from very glut of sleep  i am awakened always now by an alarm clock  if i fall asleep early or late i set the alarm accordingly and this and the putting out of the lamp are my last conscious actions  when i begin to feel drowsy i change the heavy book i am reading for a lighter one  and when i doze over that i beat my head with my knuckles in order to drive sleep away  somewhere i read of a man who was afraid to sleep  kipling wrote the story  this man arranged a spur so that when unconsciousness came his naked body pressed against the iron teeth well ive done the same  i look at the time and i resolve that not until midnight or not until one oclock or two oclock or three oclock shall the spur be removed  and so it rowels me awake until the appointed time  that spur has been my bedmate for months  i have grown so desperate that five and a half hours of sleep is an extravagance  i sleep four hours now  i am starved for sleep  there are times when i am lightheaded from want of sleep times when death with its rest and sleep is a positive lure to me times when i am haunted by longfellows lines     the sea is still and deep    all things within its bosom sleep    a single step and all is oer    a plunge a bubble and no more  of course this is sheer nonsense  it comes from nervousness from an overwrought mind  but the point is why have i done this  for you  to shorten my apprenticeship  to compel success to hasten  and my apprenticeship is now served  i know my equipment  i swear that i learn more each month than the average college man learns in a year  i know it i tell you  but were my need for you to understand not so desperate i should not tell you  it is not boasting  i measure the results by the books  your brothers today are ignorant barbarians compared with me and the knowledge i have wrung from the books in the hours they were sleeping  long ago i wanted to be famous  i care very little for fame now  what i want is you i am more hungry for you than for food or clothing or recognition  i have a dream of laying my head on your breast and sleeping an aeon or so and the dream will come true ere another year is gone  his power beat against her wave upon wave and in the moment his will opposed hers most she felt herself most strongly drawn toward him  the strength that had always poured out from him to her was now flowering in his impassioned voice his flashing eyes and the vigor of life and intellect surging in him  and in that moment and for the moment she was aware of a rift that showed in her certitudea rift through which she caught sight of the real martin eden splendid and invincible and as animaltrainers have their moments of doubt so she for the instant seemed to doubt her power to tame this wild spirit of a man  and another thing he swept on  you love me  but why do you love me the thing in me that compels me to write is the very thing that draws your love  you love me because i am somehow different from the men you have known and might have loved  i was not made for the desk and countinghouse for petty business squabbling and legal jangling  make me do such things make me like those other men doing the work they do breathing the air they breathe developing the point of view they have developed and you have destroyed the difference destroyed me destroyed the thing you love  my desire to write is the most vital thing in me had i been a mere clod neither would i have desired to write nor would you have desired me for a husband  but you forget she interrupted the quick surface of her mind glimpsing a parallel  there have been eccentric inventors starving their families while they sought such chimeras as perpetual motion doubtless their wives loved them and suffered with them and for them not because of but in spite of their infatuation for perpetual motion  true was the reply  but there have been inventors who were not eccentric and who starved while they sought to invent practical things and sometimes it is recorded they succeeded  certainly i do not seek any impossibilities  you have called it achieving the impossible she interpolated  i spoke figuratively  i seek to do what men have done before meto write and to live by my writing  her silence spurred him on  to you then my goal is as much a chimera as perpetual motion he demanded  he read her answer in the pressure of her hand on histhe pitying mother hand for the hurt child  and to her just then he was the hurt child the infatuated man striving to achieve the impossible  toward the close of their talk she warned him again of the antagonism of her father and mother  but you love me he asked  i do  i do she cried  and i love you not them and nothing they do can hurt me  triumph sounded in his voice  for i have faith in your love not fear of their enmity  all things may go astray in this world but not love  love cannot go wrong unless it be a weakling that faints and stumbles by the way     chapter xxxi   martin had encountered his sister gertrude by chance on broadwayas it proved a most propitious yet disconcerting chance  waiting on the corner for a car she had seen him first and noted the eager hungry lines of his face and the desperate worried look of his eyes  in truth he was desperate and worried  he had just come from a fruitless interview with the pawnbroker from whom he had tried to wring an additional loan on his wheel  the muddy fall weather having come on martin had pledged his wheel some time since and retained his black suit  theres the black suit the pawnbroker who knew his every asset had answered  you neednt tell me youve gone and pledged it with that jew lipka  because if you have  the man had looked the threat and martin hastened to cry  no no ive got it  but i want to wear it on a matter of business  all right the mollified usurer had replied  and i want it on a matter of business before i can let you have any more money  you dont think im in it for my health  but its a fortydollar wheel in good condition martin had argued and youve only let me have seven dollars on it  no not even seven six and a quarter you took the interest in advance  if you want some more bring the suit had been the reply that sent martin out of the stuffy little den so desperate at heart as to reflect it in his face and touch his sister to pity  scarcely had they met when the telegraph avenue car came along and stopped to take on a crowd of afternoon shoppers  mrs higginbotham divined from the grip on her arm as he helped her on that he was not going to follow her  she turned on the step and looked down upon him his haggard face smote her to the heart again  aint you comin she asked  the next moment she had descended to his side  im walkingexercise you know he explained  then ill go along for a few blocks she announced  mebbe itll do me good  i aint ben feelin any too spry these last few days  martin glanced at her and verified her statement in her general slovenly appearance in the unhealthy fat in the drooping shoulders the tired face with the sagging lines and in the heavy fall of her feet without elasticitya very caricature of the walk that belongs to a free and happy body  youd better stop here he said though she had already come to a halt at the first corner and take the next car  my goodnessif i aint all tired aready she panted  but im just as able to walk as you in them soles  theyre that thin theyll bust long before you git out to north oakland  ive a better pair at home was the answer  come out to dinner tomorrow she invited irrelevantly  mr higginbotham wont be there  hes goin to san leandro on business  martin shook his head but he had failed to keep back the wolfish hungry look that leapt into his eyes at the suggestion of dinner  you havent a penny mart and thats why youre walkin  exercise she tried to sniff contemptuously but succeeded in producing only a sniffle  here lemme see  and fumbling in her satchel she pressed a fivedollar piece into his hand  i guess i forgot your last birthday mart she mumbled lamely  martins hand instinctively closed on the piece of gold  in the same instant he knew he ought not to accept and found himself struggling in the throes of indecision  that bit of gold meant food life and light in his body and brain power to go on writing andwho was to saymaybe to write something that would bring in many pieces of gold  clear on his vision burned the manuscripts of two essays he had just completed  he saw them under the table on top of the heap of returned manuscripts for which he had no stamps and he saw their titles just as he had typed themthe high priests of mystery and the cradle of beauty  he had never submitted them anywhere  they were as good as anything he had done in that line  if only he had stamps for them  then the certitude of his ultimate success rose up in him an able ally of hunger and with a quick movement he slipped the coin into his pocket  ill pay you back gertrude a hundred times over he gulped out his throat painfully contracted and in his eyes a swift hint of moisture  mark my words he cried with abrupt positiveness  before the year is out ill put an even hundred of those little yellowboys into your hand i dont ask you to believe me  all you have to do is wait and see  nor did she believe  her incredulity made her uncomfortable and failing of other expedient she said  i know youre hungry mart  its sticking out all over you  come in to meals any time  ill send one of the children to tell you when mr higginbotham aint to be there  an mart  he waited though he knew in his secret heart what she was about to say so visible was her thought process to him  dont you think its about time you got a job  you dont think ill win out he asked  she shook her head  nobody has faith in me gertrude except myself  his voice was passionately rebellious  ive done good work already plenty of it and sooner or later it will sell  how do you know it is good  because  he faltered as the whole vast field of literature and the history of literature stirred in his brain and pointed the futility of his attempting to convey to her the reasons for his faith  well because its better than ninetynine per cent of what is published in the magazines  i wisht youd listen to reason she answered feebly but with unwavering belief in the correctness of her diagnosis of what was ailing him  i wisht youd listen to reason she repeated an come to dinner tomorrow  after martin had helped her on the car he hurried to the postoffice and invested three of the five dollars in stamps and when later in the day on the way to the morse home he stopped in at the postoffice to weigh a large number of long bulky envelopes he affixed to them all the stamps save three of the twocent denomination  it proved a momentous night for martin for after dinner he met russ brissenden  how he chanced to come there whose friend he was or what acquaintance brought him martin did not know  nor had he the curiosity to inquire about him of ruth  in short brissenden struck martin as anaemic and featherbrained and was promptly dismissed from his mind  an hour later he decided that brissenden was a boor as well what of the way he prowled about from one room to another staring at the pictures or poking his nose into books and magazines he picked up from the table or drew from the shelves  though a stranger in the house he finally isolated himself in the midst of the company huddling into a capacious morris chair and reading steadily from a thin volume he had drawn from his pocket  as he read he abstractedly ran his fingers with a caressing movement through his hair  martin noticed him no more that evening except once when he observed him chaffing with great apparent success with several of the young women  it chanced that when martin was leaving he overtook brissenden already half down the walk to the street  hello is that you martin said  the other replied with an ungracious grunt but swung alongside  martin made no further attempt at conversation and for several blocks unbroken silence lay upon them  pompous old ass  the suddenness and the virulence of the exclamation startled martin  he felt amused and at the same time was aware of a growing dislike for the other  what do you go to such a place for was abruptly flung at him after another block of silence  why do you martin countered  bless me i dont know came back  at least this is my first indiscretion  there are twentyfour hours in each day and i must spend them somehow  come and have a drink  all right martin answered  the next moment he was nonplussed by the readiness of his acceptance  at home was several hours hackwork waiting for him before he went to bed and after he went to bed there was a volume of weismann waiting for him to say nothing of herbert spencers autobiography which was as replete for him with romance as any thrilling novel  why should he waste any time with this man he did not like was his thought  and yet it was not so much the man nor the drink as was it what was associated with the drinkthe bright lights the mirrors and dazzling array of glasses the warm and glowing faces and the resonant hum of the voices of men  that was it it was the voices of men optimistic men men who breathed success and spent their money for drinks like men  he was lonely that was what was the matter with him that was why he had snapped at the invitation as a bonita strikes at a white rag on a hook  not since with joe at shelly hot springs with the one exception of the wine he took with the portuguese grocer had martin had a drink at a public bar mental exhaustion did not produce a craving for liquor such as physical exhaustion did and he had felt no need for it  but just now he felt desire for the drink or rather for the atmosphere wherein drinks were dispensed and disposed of  such a place was the grotto where brissenden and he lounged in capacious leather chairs and drank scotch and soda  they talked  they talked about many things and now brissenden and now martin took turn in ordering scotch and soda  martin who was extremely strongheaded marvelled at the others capacity for liquor and ever and anon broke off to marvel at the others conversation  he was not long in assuming that brissenden knew everything and in deciding that here was the second intellectual man he had met  but he noted that brissenden had what professor caldwell lackednamely fire the flashing insight and perception the flaming uncontrol of genius  living language flowed from him  his thin lips like the dies of a machine stamped out phrases that cut and stung or again pursing caressingly about the inchoate sound they articulated the thin lips shaped soft and velvety things mellow phrases of glow and glory of haunting beauty reverberant of the mystery and inscrutableness of life and yet again the thin lips were like a bugle from which rang the crash and tumult of cosmic strife phrases that sounded clear as silver that were luminous as starry spaces that epitomized the final word of science and yet said something morethe poets word the transcendental truth elusive and without words which could express and which none the less found expression in the subtle and all but ungraspable connotations of common words  he by some wonder of vision saw beyond the farthest outpost of empiricism where was no language for narration and yet by some golden miracle of speech investing known words with unknown significances he conveyed to martins consciousness messages that were incommunicable to ordinary souls  martin forgot his first impression of dislike  here was the best the books had to offer coming true  here was an intelligence a living man for him to look up to  i am down in the dirt at your feet martin repeated to himself again and again  youve studied biology he said aloud in significant allusion  to his surprise brissenden shook his head  but you are stating truths that are substantiated only by biology martin insisted and was rewarded by a blank stare  your conclusions are in line with the books which you must have read  i am glad to hear it was the answer  that my smattering of knowledge should enable me to shortcut my way to truth is most reassuring  as for myself i never bother to find out if i am right or not  it is all valueless anyway  man can never know the ultimate verities  you are a disciple of spencer martin cried triumphantly  i havent read him since adolescence and all i read then was his education  i wish i could gather knowledge as carelessly martin broke out half an hour later  he had been closely analyzing brissendens mental equipment you are a sheer dogmatist and thats what makes it so marvellous  you state dogmatically the latest facts which science has been able to establish only by a posteriori reasoning  you jump at correct conclusions  you certainly shortcut with a vengeance  you feel your way with the speed of light by some hyperrational process to truth  yes that was what used to bother father joseph and brother dutton brissenden replied  oh no he added i am not anything  it was a lucky trick of fate that sent me to a catholic college for my education where did you pick up what you know  and while martin told him he was busy studying brissenden ranging from a long lean aristocratic face and drooping shoulders to the overcoat on a neighboring chair its pockets sagged and bulged by the freightage of many books  brissendens face and long slender hands were browned by the sunexcessively browned martin thought  this sunburn bothered martin  it was patent that brissenden was no outdoor man  then how had he been ravaged by the sun  something morbid and significant attached to that sunburn was martins thought as he returned to a study of the face narrow with high cheekbones and cavernous hollows and graced with as delicate and fine an aquiline nose as martin had ever seen  there was nothing remarkable about the size of the eyes  they were neither large nor small while their color was a nondescript brown but in them smouldered a fire or rather lurked an expression dual and strangely contradictory  defiant indomitable even harsh to excess they at the same time aroused pity  martin found himself pitying him he knew not why though he was soon to learn  oh im a lunger brissenden announced offhand a little later having already stated that he came from arizona  ive been down there a couple of years living on the climate  arent you afraid to venture it up in this climate  afraid  there was no special emphasis of his repetition of martins word  but martin saw in that ascetic face the advertisement that there was nothing of which it was afraid  the eyes had narrowed till they were eaglelike and martin almost caught his breath as he noted the eagle beak with its dilated nostrils defiant assertive aggressive  magnificent was what he commented to himself his blood thrilling at the sight  aloud he quoted     under the bludgeoning of chance    my head is bloody but unbowed  you like henley brissenden said his expression changing swiftly to large graciousness and tenderness  of course i couldnt have expected anything else of you  ah henley  a brave soul  he stands out among contemporary rhymestersmagazine rhymestersas a gladiator stands out in the midst of a band of eunuchs  you dont like the magazines martin softly impeached  do you was snarled back at him so savagely as to startle him  ii write or rather try to write for the magazines martin faltered  thats better was the mollified rejoinder  you try to write but you dont succeed  i respect and admire your failure  i know what you write  i can see it with half an eye and theres one ingredient in it that shuts it out of the magazines  its guts and magazines have no use for that particular commodity  what they want is wishwash and slush and god knows they get it but not from you  im not above hackwork martin contended  on the contrary  brissenden paused and ran an insolent eye over martins objective poverty passing from the wellworn tie and the saw edged collar to the shiny sleeves of the coat and on to the slight fray of one cuff winding up and dwelling upon martins sunken cheeks  on the contrary hackwork is above you so far above you that you can never hope to rise to it  why man i could insult you by asking you to have something to eat  martin felt the heat in his face of the involuntary blood and brissenden laughed triumphantly  a full man is not insulted by such an invitation he concluded  you are a devil martin cried irritably  anyway i didnt ask you  you didnt dare  oh i dont know about that  i invite you now  brissenden half rose from his chair as he spoke as if with the intention of departing to the restaurant forthwith  martins fists were tightclenched and his blood was drumming in his temples  bosco  he eats em alive  eats em alive  brissenden exclaimed imitating the spieler of a locally famous snakeeater  i could certainly eat you alive martin said in turn running insolent eyes over the others diseaseravaged frame  only im not worthy of it  on the contrary martin considered because the incident is not worthy  he broke into a laugh hearty and wholesome  i confess you made a fool of me brissenden  that i am hungry and you are aware of it are only ordinary phenomena and theres no disgrace  you see i laugh at the conventional little moralities of the herd then you drift by say a sharp true word and immediately i am the slave of the same little moralities  you were insulted brissenden affirmed  i certainly was a moment ago  the prejudice of early youth you know i learned such things then and they cheapen what i have since learned they are the skeletons in my particular closet  but youve got the door shut on them now  i certainly have  sure  sure  then lets go and get something to eat  ill go you martin answered attempting to pay for the current scotch and soda with the last change from his two dollars and seeing the waiter bullied by brissenden into putting that change back on the table  martin pocketed it with a grimace and felt for a moment the kindly weight of brissendens hand upon his shoulder     chapter xxxii   promptly the next afternoon maria was excited by martins second visitor  but she did not lose her head this time for she seated brissenden in her parlors grandeur of respectability  hope you dont mind my coming brissenden began  no no not at all martin answered shaking hands and waving him to the solitary chair himself taking to the bed  but how did you know where i lived  called up the morses  miss morse answered the phone  and here i am he tugged at his coat pocket and flung a thin volume on the table theres a book by a poet  read it and keep it  and then in reply to martins protest what have i to do with books  i had another hemorrhage this morning  got any whiskey  no of course not  wait a minute  he was off and away  martin watched his long figure go down the outside steps and on turning to close the gate noted with a pang the shoulders which had once been broad drawn in now over the collapsed ruin of the chest  martin got two tumblers and fell to reading the book of verse henry vaughn marlows latest collection  no scotch brissenden announced on his return  the beggar sells nothing but american whiskey  but heres a quart of it  ill send one of the youngsters for lemons and well make a toddy martin offered  i wonder what a book like that will earn marlow he went on holding up the volume in question  possibly fifty dollars came the answer  though hes lucky if he pulls even on it or if he can inveigle a publisher to risk bringing it out  then one cant make a living out of poetry  martins tone and face alike showed his dejection  certainly not  what fool expects to  out of rhyming yes  theres bruce and virginia spring and sedgwick  they do very nicely  but poetrydo you know how vaughn marlow makes his livingteaching in a boys crammingjoint down in pennsylvania and of all private little hells such a billet is the limit  i wouldnt trade places with him if he had fifty years of life before him  and yet his work stands out from the ruck of the contemporary versifiers as a balas ruby among carrots  and the reviews he gets  damn them all of them the crass manikins  too much is written by the men who cant write about the men who do write martin concurred  why i was appalled at the quantities of rubbish written about stevenson and his work  ghouls and harpies brissenden snapped out with clicking teeth  yes i know the spawncomplacently pecking at him for his father damien letter analyzing him weighing him  measuring him by the yardstick of their own miserable egos martin broke in  yes thats it a good phrasemouthing and besliming the true and beautiful and good and finally patting him on the back and saying good dog fido  faugh  the little chattering daws of men richard realf called them the night he died  pecking at stardust martin took up the strain warmly at the meteoric flight of the mastermen  i once wrote a squib on themthe critics or the reviewers rather  lets see it brissenden begged eagerly  so martin unearthed a carbon copy of stardust and during the reading of it brissenden chuckled rubbed his hands and forgot to sip his toddy  strikes me youre a bit of stardust yourself flung into a world of cowled gnomes who cannot see was his comment at the end of it  of course it was snapped up by the first magazine  martin ran over the pages of his manuscript book  it has been refused by twentyseven of them  brissenden essayed a long and hearty laugh but broke down in a fit of coughing  say you neednt tell me you havent tackled poetry he gasped  let me see some of it  dont read it now martin pleaded  i want to talk with you  ill make up a bundle and you can take it home  brissenden departed with the lovecycle and the peri and the pearl returning next day to greet martin with  i want more  not only did he assure martin that he was a poet but martin learned that brissenden also was one  he was swept off his feet by the others work and astounded that no attempt had been made to publish it  a plague on all their houses was brissendens answer to martins volunteering to market his work for him  love beauty for its own sake was his counsel and leave the magazines alone  back to your ships and your seathats my advice to you martin eden  what do you want in these sick and rotten cities of men  you are cutting your throat every day you waste in them trying to prostitute beauty to the needs of magazinedom  what was it you quoted me the other dayoh yes man the latest of the ephemera  well what do you the latest of the ephemera want with fame  if you got it it would be poison to you  you are too simple too elemental and too rational by my faith to prosper on such pap  i hope you never do sell a line to the magazines  beauty is the only master to serve  serve her and damn the multitude  success what in hells success if it isnt right there in your stevenson sonnet which outranks henleys apparition in that lovecycle in those sea poems  it is not in what you succeed in doing that you get your joy but in the doing of it  you cant tell me  i know it  you know it  beauty hurts you  it is an everlasting pain in you a wound that does not heal a knife of flame  why should you palter with magazines  let beauty be your end  why should you mint beauty into gold  anyway you cant so theres no use in my getting excited over it  you can read the magazines for a thousand years and you wont find the value of one line of keats leave fame and coin alone sign away on a ship tomorrow and go back to your sea  not for fame but for love martin laughed  love seems to have no place in your cosmos in mine beauty is the handmaiden of love  brissenden looked at him pityingly and admiringly  you are so young martin boy so young  you will flutter high but your wings are of the finest gauze dusted with the fairest pigments  do not scorch them  but of course you have scorched them already  it required some glorified petticoat to account for that lovecycle and thats the shame of it  it glorifies love as well as the petticoat martin laughed  the philosophy of madness was the retort  so have i assured myself when wandering in hasheesh dreams  but beware  these bourgeois cities will kill you  look at that den of traitors where i met you  dry rot is no name for it  one cant keep his sanity in such an atmosphere  its degrading  theres not one of them who is not degrading man and woman all of them animated stomachs guided by the high intellectual and artistic impulses of clams  he broke off suddenly and regarded martin  then with a flash of divination he saw the situation  the expression on his face turned to wondering horror  and you wrote that tremendous lovecycle to herthat pale shrivelled female thing  the next instant martins right hand had shot to a throttling clutch on his throat and he was being shaken till his teeth rattled  but martin looking into his eyes saw no fear therenaught but a curious and mocking devil  martin remembered himself and flung brissenden by the neck sidelong upon the bed at the same moment releasing his hold  brissenden panted and gasped painfully for a moment then began to chuckle  you had made me eternally your debtor had you shaken out the flame he said  my nerves are on a hairtrigger these days martin apologized  hope i didnt hurt you  here let me mix a fresh toddy  ah you young greek brissenden went on  i wonder if you take just pride in that body of yours  you are devilish strong  you are a young panther a lion cub  well well it is you who must pay for that strength  what do you mean martin asked curiously passing aim a glass  here down this and be good  because brissenden sipped his toddy and smiled appreciation of it because of the women  they will worry you until you die as they have already worried you or else i was born yesterday  now theres no use in your choking me im going to have my say  this is undoubtedly your calf love but for beautys sake show better taste next time  what under heaven do you want with a daughter of the bourgeoisie  leave them alone pick out some great wanton flame of a woman who laughs at life and jeers at death and loves one while she may  there are such women and they will love you just as readily as any pusillanimous product of bourgeois sheltered life  pusillanimous martin protested  just so pusillanimous prattling out little moralities that have been prattled into them and afraid to live life  they will love you martin but they will love their little moralities more  what you want is the magnificent abandon of life the great free souls the blazing butterflies and not the little gray moths  oh you will grow tired of them too of all the female things if you are unlucky enough to live but you wont live  you wont go back to your ships and sea therefore youll hang around these pestholes of cities until your bones are rotten and then youll die  you can lecture me but you cant make me talk back martin said after all you have but the wisdom of your temperament and the wisdom of my temperament is just as unimpeachable as yours  they disagreed about love and the magazines and many things but they liked each other and on martins part it was no less than a profound liking  day after day they were together if for no more than the hour brissenden spent in martins stuffy room  brissenden never arrived without his quart of whiskey and when they dined together downtown he drank scotch and soda throughout the meal  he invariably paid the way for both and it was through him that martin learned the refinements of food drank his first champagne and made acquaintance with rhenish wines  but brissenden was always an enigma  with the face of an ascetic he was in all the failing blood of him a frank voluptuary  he was unafraid to die bitter and cynical of all the ways of living and yet dying he loved life to the last atom of it  he was possessed by a madness to live to thrill to squirm my little space in the cosmic dust whence i came as he phrased it once himself  he had tampered with drugs and done many strange things in quest of new thrills new sensations  as he told martin he had once gone three days without water had done so voluntarily in order to experience the exquisite delight of such a thirst assuaged  who or what he was martin never learned  he was a man without a past whose future was the imminent grave and whose present was a bitter fever of living     chapter xxxiii   martin was steadily losing his battle  economize as he would the earnings from hackwork did not balance expenses  thanksgiving found him with his black suit in pawn and unable to accept the morses invitation to dinner  ruth was not made happy by his reason for not coming and the corresponding effect on him was one of desperation  he told her that he would come after all that he would go over to san francisco to the transcontinental office collect the five dollars due him and with it redeem his suit of clothes  in the morning he borrowed ten cents from maria  he would have borrowed it by preference from brissenden but that erratic individual had disappeared  two weeks had passed since martin had seen him and he vainly cudgelled his brains for some cause of offence  the ten cents carried martin across the ferry to san francisco and as he walked up market street he speculated upon his predicament in case he failed to collect the money  there would then be no way for him to return to oakland and he knew no one in san francisco from whom to borrow another ten cents  the door to the transcontinental office was ajar and martin in the act of opening it was brought to a sudden pause by a loud voice from within which exclaimed but that is not the question mr ford  ford martin knew from his correspondence to be the editors name  the question is are you prepared to paycash and cash down i mean  i am not interested in the prospects of the transcontinental and what you expect to make it next year  what i want is to be paid for what i do and i tell you right now the christmas transcontinental dont go to press till i have the money in my hand  good day  when you get the money come and see me  the door jerked open and the man flung past martin with an angry countenance and went down the corridor muttering curses and clenching his fists  martin decided not to enter immediately and lingered in the hallways for a quarter of an hour  then he shoved the door open and walked in  it was a new experience the first time he had been inside an editorial office  cards evidently were not necessary in that office for the boy carried word to an inner room that there was a man who wanted to see mr ford  returning the boy beckoned him from halfway across the room and led him to the private office the editorial sanctum  martins first impression was of the disorder and cluttered confusion of the room next he noticed a bewhiskered youthfullooking man sitting at a roll top desk who regarded him curiously  martin marvelled at the calm repose of his face  it was evident that the squabble with the printer had not affected his equanimity  ii am martin eden martin began the conversation  and i want my five dollars was what he would have liked to say  but this was his first editor and under the circumstances he did not desire to scare him too abruptly  to his surprise mr ford leaped into the air with a you dont say so and the next moment with both hands was shaking martins hand effusively  cant say how glad i am to see you mr eden  often wondered what you were like  here he held martin off at arms length and ran his beaming eyes over martins secondbest suit which was also his worst suit and which was ragged and past repair though the trousers showed the careful crease he had put in with marias flatirons  i confess though i conceived you to be a much older man than you are your story you know showed such breadth and vigor such maturity and depth of thought  a masterpiece that storyi knew it when i had read the first halfdozen lines  let me tell you how i first read it  but no first let me introduce you to the staff  still talking mr ford led him into the general office where he introduced him to the associate editor mr white a slender frail little man whose hand seemed strangely cold as if he were suffering from a chill and whose whiskers were sparse and silky  and mr ends mr eden  mr ends is our business manager you know  martin found himself shaking hands with a crankyeyed baldheaded man whose face looked youthful enough from what little could be seen of it for most of it was covered by a snowwhite beard carefully trimmedby his wife who did it on sundays at which times she also shaved the back of his neck  the three men surrounded martin all talking admiringly and at once until it seemed to him that they were talking against time for a wager  we often wondered why you didnt call mr white was saying  i didnt have the carfare and i live across the bay martin answered bluntly with the idea of showing them his imperative need for the money  surely he thought to himself my glad rags in themselves are eloquent advertisement of my need  time and again whenever opportunity offered he hinted about the purpose of his business  but his admirers ears were deaf  they sang his praises told him what they had thought of his story at first sight what they subsequently thought what their wives and families thought but not one hint did they breathe of intention to pay him for it  did i tell you how i first read your story mr ford said  of course i didnt  i was coming west from new york and when the train stopped at ogden the trainboy on the new run brought aboard the current number of the transcontinental  my god martin thought you can travel in a pullman while i starve for the paltry five dollars you owe me  a wave of anger rushed over him  the wrong done him by the transcontinental loomed colossal for strong upon him were all the dreary months of vain yearning of hunger and privation and his present hunger awoke and gnawed at him reminding him that he had eaten nothing since the day before and little enough then  for the moment he saw red  these creatures were not even robbers  they were sneakthieves  by lies and broken promises they had tricked him out of his story  well he would show them  and a great resolve surged into his will to the effect that he would not leave the office until he got his money  he remembered if he did not get it that there was no way for him to go back to oakland  he controlled himself with an effort but not before the wolfish expression of his face had awed and perturbed them  they became more voluble than ever  mr ford started anew to tell how he had first read the ring of bells and mr ends at the same time was striving to repeat his nieces appreciation of the ring of bells said niece being a schoolteacher in alameda  ill tell you what i came for martin said finally  to be paid for that story all of you like so well  five dollars i believe is what you promised me would be paid on publication  mr ford with an expression on his mobile features of mediate and happy acquiescence started to reach for his pocket then turned suddenly to mr ends and said that he had left his money home  that mr ends resented this was patent and martin saw the twitch of his arm as if to protect his trousers pocket  martin knew that the money was there  i am sorry said mr ends but i paid the printer not an hour ago and he took my ready change  it was careless of me to be so short but the bill was not yet due and the printers request as a favor to make an immediate advance was quite unexpected  both men looked expectantly at mr white but that gentleman laughed and shrugged his shoulders  his conscience was clean at any rate  he had come into the transcontinental to learn magazineliterature instead of which he had principally learned finance  the transcontinental owed him four months salary and he knew that the printer must be appeased before the associate editor  its rather absurd mr eden to have caught us in this shape mr ford preambled airily  all carelessness i assure you  but ill tell you what well do  well mail you a check the first thing in the morning you have mr edens address havent you mr ends  yes mr ends had the address and the check would be mailed the first thing in the morning  martins knowledge of banks and checks was hazy but he could see no reason why they should not give him the check on this day just as well as on the next  then it is understood mr eden that well mail you the check tomorrow mr ford said  i need the money today martin answered stolidly  the unfortunate circumstancesif you had chanced here any other day mr ford began suavely only to be interrupted by mr ends whose cranky eyes justified themselves in his shortness of temper  mr ford has already explained the situation he said with asperity and so have i  the check will be mailed  i also have explained martin broke in and i have explained that i want the money today  he had felt his pulse quicken a trifle at the business managers brusqueness and upon him he kept an alert eye for it was in that gentlemans trousers pocket that he divined the transcontinentals ready cash was reposing  it is too bad mr ford began  but at that moment with an impatient movement mr ends turned as if about to leave the room  at the same instant martin sprang for him clutching him by the throat with one hand in such fashion that mr ends snowwhite beard still maintaining its immaculate trimness pointed ceilingward at an angle of fortyfive degrees  to the horror of mr white and mr ford they saw their business manager shaken like an astrakhan rug  dig up you venerable discourager of rising young talent martin exhorted  dig up or ill shake it out of you even if its all in nickels  then to the two affrighted onlookers keep away  if you interfere somebodys liable to get hurt  mr ends was choking and it was not until the grip on his throat was eased that he was able to signify his acquiescence in the diggingup programme  all together after repeated digs its trousers pocket yielded four dollars and fifteen cents  inside out with it martin commanded  an additional ten cents fell out  martin counted the result of his raid a second time to make sure  you next he shouted at mr ford  i want seventyfive cents more  mr ford did not wait but ransacked his pockets with the result of sixty cents  sure that is all martin demanded menacingly possessing himself of it what have you got in your vest pockets  in token of his good faith mr ford turned two of his pockets inside out  a strip of cardboard fell to the floor from one of them  he recovered it and was in the act of returning it when martin cried  whats thata ferry ticket  here give it to me  its worth ten cents  ill credit you with it  ive now got four dollars and ninety five cents including the ticket  five cents is still due me  he looked fiercely at mr white and found that fragile creature in the act of handing him a nickel  thank you martin said addressing them collectively  i wish you a good day  robber mr ends snarled after him  sneakthief martin retorted slamming the door as he passed out  martin was elatedso elated that when he recollected that the hornet owed him fifteen dollars for the peri and the pearl he decided forthwith to go and collect it  but the hornet was run by a set of clean shaven strapping young men frank buccaneers who robbed everything and everybody not excepting one another  after some breakage of the office furniture the editor an excollege athlete ably assisted by the business manager an advertising agent and the porter succeeded in removing martin from the office and in accelerating by initial impulse his descent of the first flight of stairs  come again mr eden glad to see you any time they laughed down at him from the landing above  martin grinned as he picked himself up  phew he murmured back  the transcontinental crowd were nannygoats but you fellows are a lot of prizefighters  more laughter greeted this  i must say mr eden the editor of the hornet called down that for a poet you can go some yourself  where did you learn that right crossif i may ask  where you learned that halfnelson martin answered  anyway youre going to have a black eye  i hope your neck doesnt stiffen up the editor wished solicitously what do you say we all go out and have a drink on itnot the neck of course but the little roughhouse  ill go you if i lose martin accepted  and robbers and robbed drank together amicably agreeing that the battle was to the strong and that the fifteen dollars for the peri and the pearl belonged by right to the hornets editorial staff     chapter xxxiv   arthur remained at the gate while ruth climbed marias front steps  she heard the rapid click of the typewriter and when martin let her in found him on the last page of a manuscript  she had come to make certain whether or not he would be at their table for thanksgiving dinner but before she could broach the subject martin plunged into the one with which he was full  here let me read you this he cried separating the carbon copies and running the pages of manuscript into shape  its my latest and different from anything ive done  it is so altogether different that i am almost afraid of it and yet ive a sneaking idea it is good  you be judge  its an hawaiian story  ive called it wikiwiki  his face was bright with the creative glow though she shivered in the cold room and had been struck by the coldness of his hands at greeting she listened closely while he read and though he from time to time had seen only disapprobation in her face at the close he asked  frankly what do you think of it  ii dont know she answered  will itdo you think it will sell  im afraid not was the confession  its too strong for the magazines  but its true on my word its true  but why do you persist in writing such things when you know they wont sell she went on inexorably  the reason for your writing is to make a living isnt it  yes thats right but the miserable story got away with me  i couldnt help writing it  it demanded to be written  but that character that wikiwiki why do you make him talk so roughly surely it will offend your readers and surely that is why the editors are justified in refusing your work  because the real wikiwiki would have talked that way  but it is not good taste  it is life he replied bluntly  it is real  it is true  and i must write life as i see it  she made no answer and for an awkward moment they sat silent  it was because he loved her that he did not quite understand her and she could not understand him because he was so large that he bulked beyond her horizon  well ive collected from the transcontinental he said in an effort to shift the conversation to a more comfortable subject  the picture of the bewhiskered trio as he had last seen them mulcted of four dollars and ninety cents and a ferry ticket made him chuckle  then youll come she cried joyously  that was what i came to find out  come he muttered absently  where  why to dinner tomorrow  you know you said youd recover your suit if you got that money  i forgot all about it he said humbly  you see this morning the poundman got marias two cows and the baby calf andwell it happened that maria didnt have any money and so i had to recover her cows for her  thats where the transcontinental fiver wentthe ring of bells went into the poundmans pocket  then you wont come  he looked down at his clothing  i cant  tears of disappointment and reproach glistened in her blue eyes but she said nothing  next thanksgiving youll have dinner with me in delmonicos he said cheerily or in london or paris or anywhere you wish  i know it  i saw in the paper a few days ago she announced abruptly that there had been several local appointments to the railway mail  you passed first didnt you  he was compelled to admit that the call had come for him but that he had declined it  i was so surei am so sureof myself he concluded  a year from now ill be earning more than a dozen men in the railway mail you wait and see  oh was all she said when he finished  she stood up pulling at her gloves  i must go martin  arthur is waiting for me  he took her in his arms and kissed her but she proved a passive sweetheart  there was no tenseness in her body her arms did not go around him and her lips met his without their wonted pressure  she was angry with him he concluded as he returned from the gate  but why  it was unfortunate that the poundman had gobbled marias cows  but it was only a stroke of fate  nobody could be blamed for it  nor did it enter his head that he could have done aught otherwise than what he had done  well yes he was to blame a little was his next thought for having refused the call to the railway mail  and she had not liked wiki wiki  he turned at the head of the steps to meet the lettercarrier on his afternoon round  the ever recurrent fever of expectancy assailed martin as he took the bundle of long envelopes  one was not long  it was short and thin and outside was printed the address of the new york outview  he paused in the act of tearing the envelope open  it could not be an acceptance  he had no manuscripts with that publication  perhapshis heart almost stood still at thewild thoughtperhaps they were ordering an article from him but the next instant he dismissed the surmise as hopelessly impossible  it was a short formal letter signed by the office editor merely informing him that an anonymous letter which they had received was enclosed and that he could rest assured the outviews staff never under any circumstances gave consideration to anonymous correspondence  the enclosed letter martin found to be crudely printed by hand  it was a hotchpotch of illiterate abuse of martin and of assertion that the so called martin eden who was selling stories to magazines was no writer at all and that in reality he was stealing stories from old magazines typing them and sending them out as his own  the envelope was postmarked san leandro  martin did not require a second thought to discover the author  higginbothams grammar higginbothams colloquialisms higginbothams mental quirks and processes were apparent throughout  martin saw in every line not the fine italian hand but the coarse grocers fist of his brotherinlaw  but why he vainly questioned  what injury had he done bernard higginbotham  the thing was so unreasonable so wanton  there was no explaining it  in the course of the week a dozen similar letters were forwarded to martin by the editors of various eastern magazines  the editors were behaving handsomely martin concluded  he was wholly unknown to them yet some of them had even been sympathetic  it was evident that they detested anonymity  he saw that the malicious attempt to hurt him had failed  in fact if anything came of it it was bound to be good for at least his name had been called to the attention of a number of editors  sometime perhaps reading a submitted manuscript of his they might remember him as the fellow about whom they had received an anonymous letter  and who was to say that such a remembrance might not sway the balance of their judgment just a trifle in his favor  it was about this time that martin took a great slump in marias estimation  he found her in the kitchen one morning groaning with pain tears of weakness running down her cheeks vainly endeavoring to put through a large ironing  he promptly diagnosed her affliction as la grippe dosed her with hot whiskey the remnants in the bottles for which brissenden was responsible and ordered her to bed  but maria was refractory  the ironing had to be done she protested and delivered that night or else there would be no food on the morrow for the seven small and hungry silvas  to her astonishment and it was something that she never ceased from relating to her dying day she saw martin eden seize an iron from the stove and throw a fancy shirtwaist on the ironingboard  it was kate flanagans best sunday waist than whom there was no more exacting and fastidiously dressed woman in marias world  also miss flanagan had sent special instruction that said waist must be delivered by that night as every one knew she was keeping company with john collins the blacksmith and as maria knew privily miss flanagan and mr collins were going next day to golden gate park  vain was marias attempt to rescue the garment  martin guided her tottering footsteps to a chair from where she watched him with bulging eyes  in a quarter of the time it would have taken her she saw the shirtwaist safely ironed and ironed as well as she could have done it as martin made her grant  i could work faster he explained if your irons were only hotter  to her the irons he swung were much hotter than she ever dared to use  your sprinkling is all wrong he complained next  here let me teach you how to sprinkle  pressure is whats wanted  sprinkle under pressure if you want to iron fast  he procured a packingcase from the woodpile in the cellar fitted a cover to it and raided the scrapiron the silva tribe was collecting for the junkman  with freshsprinkled garments in the box covered with the board and pressed by the iron the device was complete and in operation  now you watch me maria he said stripping off to his undershirt and gripping an iron that was what he called really hot  an when he feenish da iron he washa da wools as she described it afterward  he say maria you are da greata fool  i showa you how to washa da wools an he shows me too  ten minutes he maka da machineone barrel one wheelhub two poles justa like dat  martin had learned the contrivance from joe at the shelly hot springs the old wheelhub fixed on the end of the upright pole constituted the plunger  making this in turn fast to the springpole attached to the kitchen rafters so that the hub played upon the woollens in the barrel he was able with one hand thoroughly to pound them  no more maria washa da wools her story always ended  i maka da kids worka da pole an da hub an da barrel  him da smarta man mister eden  nevertheless by his masterly operation and improvement of her kitchen laundry he fell an immense distance in her regard  the glamour of romance with which her imagination had invested him faded away in the cold light of fact that he was an exlaundryman  all his books and his grand friends who visited him in carriages or with countless bottles of whiskey went for naught  he was after all a mere workingman a member of her own class and caste  he was more human and approachable but he was no longer mystery  martins alienation from his family continued  following upon mr higginbothams unprovoked attack mr hermann von schmidt showed his hand  the fortunate sale of several storiettes some humorous verse and a few jokes gave martin a temporary splurge of prosperity  not only did he partially pay up his bills but he had sufficient balance left to redeem his black suit and wheel  the latter by virtue of a twisted crankhanger required repairing and as a matter of friendliness with his future brotherinlaw he sent it to von schmidts shop  the afternoon of the same day martin was pleased by the wheel being delivered by a small boy  von schmidt was also inclined to be friendly was martins conclusion from this unusual favor  repaired wheels usually had to be called for  but when he examined the wheel he discovered no repairs had been made  a little later in the day he telephoned his sisters betrothed and learned that that person didnt want anything to do with him in any shape manner or form  hermann von schmidt martin answered cheerfully ive a good mind to come over and punch that dutch nose of yours  you come to my shop came the reply an ill send for the police  an ill put you through too  oh i know you but you cant make no rough house with me  i dont want nothin to do with the likes of you  youre a loafer thats what an i aint asleep  you aint goin to do no spongin off me just because im marryin your sister  why dont you go to work an earn an honest livin eh  answer me that  martins philosophy asserted itself dissipating his anger and he hung up the receiver with a long whistle of incredulous amusement  but after the amusement came the reaction and he was oppressed by his loneliness nobody understood him nobody seemed to have any use for him except brissenden and brissenden had disappeared god alone knew where  twilight was falling as martin left the fruit store and turned homeward his marketing on his arm  at the corner an electric car had stopped and at sight of a lean familiar figure alighting his heart leapt with joy it was brissenden and in the fleeting glimpse ere the car started up martin noted the overcoat pockets one bulging with books the other bulging with a quart bottle of whiskey     chapter xxxv   brissenden gave no explanation of his long absence nor did martin pry into it  he was content to see his friends cadaverous face opposite him through the steam rising from a tumbler of toddy  i too have not been idle brissenden proclaimed after hearing martins account of the work he had accomplished  he pulled a manuscript from his inside coat pocket and passed it to martin who looked at the title and glanced up curiously  yes thats it brissenden laughed  pretty good title eh ephemerait is the one word  and youre responsible for it what of your man who is always the erected the vitalized inorganic the latest of the ephemera the creature of temperature strutting his little space on the thermometer  it got into my head and i had to write it to get rid of it  tell me what you think of it  martins face flushed at first paled as he read on  it was perfect art  form triumphed over substance if triumph it could be called where the last conceivable atom of substance had found expression in so perfect construction as to make martins head swim with delight to put passionate tears into his eyes and to send chills creeping up and down his back  it was a long poem of six or seven hundred lines and it was a fantastic amazing unearthly thing  it was terrific impossible and yet there it was scrawled in black ink across the sheets of paper  it dealt with man and his soulgropings in their ultimate terms plumbing the abysses of space for the testimony of remotest suns and rainbow spectrums  it was a mad orgy of imagination wassailing in the skull of a dying man who half sobbed under his breath and was quick with the wild flutter of fading heartbeats  the poem swung in majestic rhythm to the cool tumult of interstellar conflict to the onset of starry hosts to the impact of cold suns and the flaming up of nebular in the darkened void and through it all unceasing and faint like a silver shuttle ran the frail piping voice of man a querulous chirp amid the screaming of planets and the crash of systems  there is nothing like it in literature martin said when at last he was able to speak  its wonderfulwonderful  it has gone to my head i am drunken with it  that great infinitesimal questioni cant shake it out of my thoughts  that questing eternal ever recurring thin little wailing voice of man is still ringing in my ears  it is like the deadmarch of a gnat amid the trumpeting of elephants and the roaring of lions  it is insatiable with microscopic desire  i now im making a fool of myself but the thing has obsessed me  you arei dont know what you areyou are wonderful thats all  but how do you do it  how do you do it  martin paused from his rhapsody only to break out afresh  i shall never write again  i am a dauber in clay  you have shown me the work of the real artificerartisan  genius  this is something more than genius  it transcends genius  it is truth gone mad  it is true man every line of it  i wonder if you realize that you dogmatist science cannot give you the lie  it is the truth of the sneer stamped out from the black iron of the cosmos and interwoven with mighty rhythms of sound into a fabric of splendor and beauty  and now i wont say another word  i am overwhelmed crushed  yes i will too  let me market it for you  brissenden grinned  theres not a magazine in christendom that would dare to publish ityou know that  i know nothing of the sort  i know theres not a magazine in christendom that wouldnt jump at it  they dont get things like that every day  thats no mere poem of the year  its the poem of the century  id like to take you up on the proposition  now dont get cynical martin exhorted  the magazine editors are not wholly fatuous  i know that  and ill close with you on the bet  ill wager anything you want that ephemera is accepted either on the first or second offering  theres just one thing that prevents me from taking you  brissenden waited a moment  the thing is bigthe biggest ive ever done  i know that  its my swan song  i am almighty proud of it  i worship it  its better than whiskey  it is what i dreamed ofthe great and perfect thingwhen i was a simple young man with sweet illusions and clean ideals  and ive got it now in my last grasp and ill not have it pawed over and soiled by a lot of swine  no i wont take the bet  its mine  i made it and ive shared it with you  but think of the rest of the world martin protested  the function of beauty is joymaking  its my beauty  dont be selfish  im not selfish  brissenden grinned soberly in the way he had when pleased by the thing his thin lips were about to shape  im as unselfish as a famished hog  in vain martin strove to shake him from his decision  martin told him that his hatred of the magazines was rabid fanatical and that his conduct was a thousand times more despicable than that of the youth who burned the temple of diana at ephesus  under the storm of denunciation brissenden complacently sipped his toddy and affirmed that everything the other said was quite true with the exception of the magazine editors his hatred of them knew no bounds and he excelled martin in denunciation when he turned upon them  i wish youd type it for me he said  you know how a thousand times better than any stenographer  and now i want to give you some advice he drew a bulky manuscript from his outside coat pocket  heres your shame of the sun  ive read it not once but twice and three timesthe highest compliment i can pay you  after what youve said about ephemera i must be silent  but this i will say when the shame of the sun is published it will make a hit  it will start a controversy that will be worth thousands to you just in advertising  martin laughed  i suppose your next advice will be to submit it to the magazines  by all means nothat is if you want to see it in print  offer it to the firstclass houses  some publishers reader may be mad enough or drunk enough to report favorably on it  youve read the books  the meat of them has been transmuted in the alembic of martin edens mind and poured into the shame of the sun and one day martin eden will be famous and not the least of his fame will rest upon that work  so you must get a publisher for itthe sooner the better  brissenden went home late that night and just as he mounted the first step of the car he swung suddenly back on martin and thrust into his hand a small tightly crumpled wad of paper  here take this he said  i was out to the races today and i had the right dope  the bell clanged and the car pulled out leaving martin wondering as to the nature of the crinkly greasy wad he clutched in his hand  back in his room he unrolled it and found a hundreddollar bill  he did not scruple to use it  he knew his friend had always plenty of money and he knew also with profound certitude that his success would enable him to repay it  in the morning he paid every bill gave maria three months advance on the room and redeemed every pledge at the pawnshop  next he bought marians wedding present and simpler presents suitable to christmas for ruth and gertrude  and finally on the balance remaining to him he herded the whole silva tribe down into oakland  he was a winter late in redeeming his promise but redeemed it was for the last least silva got a pair of shoes as well as maria herself  also there were horns and dolls and toys of various sorts and parcels and bundles of candies and nuts that filled the arms of all the silvas to overflowing  it was with this extraordinary procession trooping at his and marias heels into a confectioners in quest if the biggest candycane ever made that he encountered ruth and her mother  mrs morse was shocked  even ruth was hurt for she had some regard for appearances and her lover cheek by jowl with maria at the head of that army of portuguese ragamuffins was not a pretty sight  but it was not that which hurt so much as what she took to be his lack of pride and selfrespect  further and keenest of all she read into the incident the impossibility of his living down his workingclass origin  there was stigma enough in the fact of it but shamelessly to flaunt it in the face of the worldher worldwas going too far  though her engagement to martin had been kept secret their long intimacy had not been unproductive of gossip and in the shop glancing covertly at her lover and his following had been several of her acquaintances  she lacked the easy largeness of martin and could not rise superior to her environment  she had been hurt to the quick and her sensitive nature was quivering with the shame of it  so it was when martin arrived later in the day that he kept her present in his breastpocket deferring the giving of it to a more propitious occasion  ruth in tearspassionate angry tearswas a revelation to him  the spectacle of her suffering convinced him that he had been a brute yet in the soul of him he could not see how nor why  it never entered his head to be ashamed of those he knew and to take the silvas out to a christmas treat could in no way so it seemed to him show lack of consideration for ruth  on the other hand he did see ruths point of view after she had explained it and he looked upon it as a feminine weakness such as afflicted all women and the best of women     chapter xxxvi   come onill show you the real dirt brissenden said to him one evening in january  they had dined together in san francisco and were at the ferry building returning to oakland when the whim came to him to show martin the real dirt  he turned and fled across the waterfront a meagre shadow in a flapping overcoat with martin straining to keep up with him  at a wholesale liquor store he bought two gallondemijohns of old port and with one in each hand boarded a mission street car martin at his heels burdened with several quartbottles of whiskey  if ruth could see me now was his thought while he wondered as to what constituted the real dirt  maybe nobody will be there brissenden said when they dismounted and plunged off to the right into the heart of the workingclass ghetto south of market street  in which case youll miss what youve been looking for so long  and what the deuce is that martin asked  men intelligent men and not the gibbering nonentities i found you consorting with in that traders den  you read the books and you found yourself all alone  well im going to show you tonight some other men whove read the books so that you wont be lonely any more  not that i bother my head about their everlasting discussions he said at the end of a block  im not interested in book philosophy  but youll find these fellows intelligences and not bourgeois swine  but watch out theyll talk an arm off of you on any subject under the sun  hope nortons there he panted a little later resisting martins effort to relieve him of the two demijohns  nortons an idealista harvard man  prodigious memory  idealism led him to philosophic anarchy and his family threw him off  fathers a railroad president and many times millionnaire but the sons starving in frisco editing an anarchist sheet for twentyfive a month  martin was little acquainted in san francisco and not at all south of market so he had no idea of where he was being led  go ahead he said tell me about them beforehand  what do they do for a living  how do they happen to be here  hope hamiltons there  brissenden paused and rested his hands  strawn hamiltons his namehyphenated you knowcomes of old southern stock hes a tramplaziest man i ever knew though hes clerking or trying to in a socialist cooperative store for six dollars a week  but hes a confirmed hobo  tramped into town  ive seen him sit all day on a bench and never a bite pass his lips and in the evening when i invited him to dinnerrestaurant two blocks awayhave him say too much trouble old man  buy me a package of cigarettes instead  he was a spencerian like you till kreis turned him to materialistic monism  ill start him on monism if i can  nortons another monistonly he affirms naught but spirit  he can give kreis and hamilton all they want too  who is kreis martin asked  his rooms were going to  one time professorfired from universityusual story  a mind like a steel trap  makes his living any old way  i know hes been a street fakir when he was down  unscrupulous rob a corpse of a shroudanything  difference between himand the bourgeoisie is that he robs without illusion  hell talk nietzsche or schopenhauer or kant or anything but the only thing in this world not excepting mary that he really cares for is his monism  haeckel is his little tin god  the only way to insult him is to take a slap at haeckel  heres the hangout  brissenden rested his demijohn at the upstairs entrance preliminary to the climb  it was the usual twostory corner building with a saloon and grocery underneath  the gang lives heregot the whole upstairs to themselves  but kreis is the only one who has two rooms  come on  no lights burned in the upper hall but brissenden threaded the utter blackness like a familiar ghost  he stopped to speak to martin  theres one fellowstevensa theosophist  makes a pretty tangle when he gets going  just now hes dishwasher in a restaurant  likes a good cigar  ive seen him eat in a tencent hashhouse and pay fifty cents for the cigar he smoked afterward  ive got a couple in my pocket for him if he shows up  and theres another fellowparryan australian a statistician and a sporting encyclopaedia  ask him the grain output of paraguay for 1903 or the english importation of sheetings into china for 1890 or at what weight jimmy britt fought battling nelson or who was welterweight champion of the united states in 68 and youll get the correct answer with the automatic celerity of a slotmachine  and theres andy a stone mason has ideas on everything a good chessplayer and another fellow harry a baker red hot socialist and strong union man  by the way you remember cooks and waiters strikehamilton was the chap who organized that union and precipitated the strikeplanned it all out in advance right here in kreiss rooms  did it just for the fun of it but was too lazy to stay by the union  yet he could have risen high if he wanted to theres no end to the possibilities in that manif he werent so insuperably lazy  brissenden advanced through the darkness till a thread of light marked the threshold of a door  a knock and an answer opened it and martin found himself shaking hands with kreis a handsome brunette man with dazzling white teeth a drooping black mustache and large flashing black eyes  mary a matronly young blonde was washing dishes in the little back room that served for kitchen and dining room  the front room served as bedchamber and living room  overhead was the weeks washing hanging in festoons so low that martin did not see at first the two men talking in a corner  they hailed brissenden and his demijohns with acclamation and on being introduced martin learned they were andy and parry  he joined them and listened attentively to the description of a prizefight parry had seen the night before while brissenden in his glory plunged into the manufacture of a toddy and the serving of wine and whiskeyandsodas  at his command bring in the clan andy departed to go the round of the rooms for the lodgers  were lucky that most of them are here brissenden whispered to martin theres norton and hamilton come on and meet them  stevens isnt around i hear  im going to get them started on monism if i can  wait till they get a few jolts in them and theyll warm up  at first the conversation was desultory  nevertheless martin could not fail to appreciate the keen play of their minds  they were men with opinions though the opinions often clashed and though they were witty and clever they were not superficial  he swiftly saw no matter upon what they talked that each man applied the correlation of knowledge and had also a deepseated and unified conception of society and the cosmos nobody manufactured their opinions for them they were all rebels of one variety or another and their lips were strangers to platitudes  never had martin at the morses heard so amazing a range of topics discussed there seemed no limit save time to the things they were alive to  the talk wandered from mrs humphry wards new book to shaws latest play through the future of the drama to reminiscences of mansfield  they appreciated or sneered at the morning editorials jumped from labor conditions in new zealand to henry james and brander matthews passed on to the german designs in the far east and the economic aspect of the yellow peril wrangled over the german elections and bebels last speech and settled down to local politics the latest plans and scandals in the union labor party administration and the wires that were pulled to bring about the coast seamens strike  martin was struck by the inside knowledge they possessed  they knew what was never printed in the newspapersthe wires and strings and the hidden hands that made the puppets dance  to martins surprise the girl mary joined in the conversation displaying an intelligence he had never encountered in the few women he had met  they talked together on swinburne and rossetti after which she led him beyond his depth into the bypaths of french literature  his revenge came when she defended maeterlinck and he brought into action the carefullythoughtout thesis of the shame of the sun  several other men had dropped in and the air was thick with tobacco smoke when brissenden waved the red flag  heres fresh meat for your axe kreis he said a rosewhite youth with the ardor of a lover for herbert spencer  make a haeckelite of himif you can  kreis seemed to wake up and flash like some metallic magnetic thing while norton looked at martin sympathetically with a sweet girlish smile as much as to say that he would be amply protected  kreis began directly on martin but step by step norton interfered until he and kreis were off and away in a personal battle  martin listened and fain would have rubbed his eyes  it was impossible that this should be much less in the labor ghetto south of market  the books were alive in these men  they talked with fire and enthusiasm the intellectual stimulant stirring them as he had seen drink and anger stir other men what he heard was no longer the philosophy of the dry printed word written by halfmythical demigods like kant and spencer  it was living philosophy with warm red blood incarnated in these two men till its very features worked with excitement  now and again other men joined in and all followed the discussion with cigarettes going out in their hands and with alert intent faces  idealism had never attracted martin but the exposition it now received at the hands of norton was a revelation  the logical plausibility of it that made an appeal to his intellect seemed missed by kreis and hamilton who sneered at norton as a metaphysician and who in turn sneered back at them as metaphysicians  phenomenon and noumenon were bandied back and forth  they charged him with attempting to explain consciousness by itself  he charged them with wordjugglery with reasoning from words to theory instead of from facts to theory  at this they were aghast  it was the cardinal tenet of their mode of reasoning to start with facts and to give names to the facts  when norton wandered into the intricacies of kant kreis reminded him that all good little german philosophies when they died went to oxford  a little later norton reminded them of hamiltons law of parsimony the application of which they immediately claimed for every reasoning process of theirs  and martin hugged his knees and exulted in it all  but norton was no spencerian and he too strove for martins philosophic soul talking as much at him as to his two opponents  you know berkeley has never been answered he said looking directly at martin  herbert spencer came the nearest which was not very near  even the stanchest of spencers followers will not go farther  i was reading an essay of saleebys the other day and the best saleeby could say was that herbert spencer nearly succeeded in answering berkeley  you know what hume said hamilton asked  norton nodded but hamilton gave it for the benefit of the rest  he said that berkeleys arguments admit of no answer and produce no conviction  in his humes mind was the reply  and humes mind was the same as yours with this difference he was wise enough to admit there was no answering berkeley  norton was sensitive and excitable though he never lost his head while kreis and hamilton were like a pair of coldblooded savages seeking out tender places to prod and poke  as the evening grew late norton smarting under the repeated charges of being a metaphysician clutching his chair to keep from jumping to his feet his gray eyes snapping and his girlish face grown harsh and sure made a grand attack upon their position  all right you haeckelites i may reason like a medicine man but pray how do you reason  you have nothing to stand on you unscientific dogmatists with your positive science which you are always lugging about into places it has no right to be  long before the school of materialistic monism arose the ground was removed so that there could be no foundation  locke was the man john locke  two hundred years agomore than that even in his essay concerning the human understanding he proved the nonexistence of innate ideas  the best of it is that that is precisely what you claim  tonight again and again you have asserted the nonexistence of innate ideas  and what does that mean  it means that you can never know ultimate reality  your brains are empty when you are born  appearances or phenomena are all the content your minds can receive from your five senses  then noumena which are not in your minds when you are born have no way of getting in  i deny kreis started to interrupt  you wait till im done norton shouted  you can know only that much of the play and interplay of force and matter as impinges in one way or another on our senses  you see i am willing to admit for the sake of the argument that matter exists and what i am about to do is to efface you by your own argument  i cant do it any other way for you are both congenitally unable to understand a philosophic abstraction  and now what do you know of matter according to your own positive science  you know it only by its phenomena its appearances  you are aware only of its changes or of such changes in it as cause changes in your consciousness  positive science deals only with phenomena yet you are foolish enough to strive to be ontologists and to deal with noumena yet by the very definition of positive science science is concerned only with appearances  as somebody has said phenomenal knowledge cannot transcend phenomena  you cannot answer berkeley even if you have annihilated kant and yet perforce you assume that berkeley is wrong when you affirm that science proves the nonexistence of god or as much to the point the existence of matteryou know i granted the reality of matter only in order to make myself intelligible to your understanding  be positive scientists if you please but ontology has no place in positive science so leave it alone  spencer is right in his agnosticism but if spencer  but it was time to catch the last ferryboat for oakland and brissenden and martin slipped out leaving norton still talking and kreis and hamilton waiting to pounce on him like a pair of hounds as soon as he finished  you have given me a glimpse of fairyland martin said on the ferryboat  it makes life worth while to meet people like that  my mind is all worked up  i never appreciated idealism before  yet i cant accept it  i know that i shall always be a realist  i am so made i guess  but id like to have made a reply to kreis and hamilton and i think id have had a word or two for norton  i didnt see that spencer was damaged any  im as excited as a child on its first visit to the circus  i see i must read up some more  im going to get hold of saleeby  i still think spencer is unassailable and next time im going to take a hand myself  but brissenden breathing painfully had dropped off to sleep his chin buried in a scarf and resting on his sunken chest his body wrapped in the long overcoat and shaking to the vibration of the propellers     chapter xxxvii   the first thing martin did next morning was to go counter both to brissendens advice and command  the shame of the sun he wrapped and mailed to the acropolis  he believed he could find magazine publication for it and he felt that recognition by the magazines would commend him to the bookpublishing houses  ephemera he likewise wrapped and mailed to a magazine  despite brissendens prejudice against the magazines which was a pronounced mania with him martin decided that the great poem should see print  he did not intend however to publish it without the others permission  his plan was to get it accepted by one of the high magazines and thus armed again to wrestle with brissenden for consent  martin began that morning a story which he had sketched out a number of weeks before and which ever since had been worrying him with its insistent clamor to be created  apparently it was to be a rattling sea story a tale of twentiethcentury adventure and romance handling real characters in a real world under real conditions  but beneath the swing and go of the story was to be something elsesomething that the superficial reader would never discern and which on the other hand would not diminish in any way the interest and enjoyment for such a reader  it was this and not the mere story that impelled martin to write it  for that matter it was always the great universal motif that suggested plots to him  after having found such a motif he cast about for the particular persons and particular location in time and space wherewith and wherein to utter the universal thing  overdue was the title he had decided for it and its length he believed would not be more than sixty thousand wordsa bagatelle for him with his splendid vigor of production  on this first day he took hold of it with conscious delight in the mastery of his tools  he no longer worried for fear that the sharp cutting edges should slip and mar his work  the long months of intense application and study had brought their reward  he could now devote himself with sure hand to the larger phases of the thing he shaped and as he worked hour after hour he felt as never before the sure and cosmic grasp with which he held life and the affairs of life overdue would tell a story that would be true of its particular characters and its particular events but it would tell too he was confident great vital things that would be true of all time and all sea and all lifethanks to herbert spencer he thought leaning back for a moment from the table  ay thanks to herbert spencer and to the masterkey of life evolution which spencer had placed in his hands  he was conscious that it was great stuff he was writing  it will go  it will go was the refrain that kept sounding in his ears  of course it would go  at last he was turning out the thing at which the magazines would jump  the whole story worked out before him in lightning flashes he broke off from it long enough to write a paragraph in his notebook this would be the last paragraph in overdue but so thoroughly was the whole book already composed in his brain that he could write weeks before he had arrived at the end the end itself  he compared the tale as yet unwritten with the tales of the seawriters and he felt it to be immeasurably superior  theres only one man who could touch it he murmured aloud and thats conrad  and it ought to make even him sit up and shake hands with me and say well done martin my boy  he toiled on all day recollecting at the last moment that he was to have dinner at the morses  thanks to brissenden his black suit was out of pawn and he was again eligible for dinner parties  down town he stopped off long enough to run into the library and search for saleebys books  he drew out the cycle of life and on the car turned to the essay norton had mentioned on spencer  as martin read he grew angry his face flushed his jaw set and unconsciously his hand clenched unclenched and clenched again as if he were taking fresh grips upon some hateful thing out of which he was squeezing the life  when he left the car he strode along the sidewalk as a wrathful man will stride and he rang the morse bell with such viciousness that it roused him to consciousness of his condition so that he entered in good nature smiling with amusement at himself  no sooner however was he inside than a great depression descended upon him  he fell from the height where he had been upborne all day on the wings of inspiration bourgeois traders denbrissendens epithets repeated themselves in his mind  but what of that he demanded angrily  he was marrying ruth not her family  it seemed to him that he had never seen ruth more beautiful more spiritual and ethereal and at the same time more healthy  there was color in her cheeks and her eyes drew him again and againthe eyes in which he had first read immortality  he had forgotten immortality of late and the trend of his scientific reading had been away from it but here in ruths eyes he read an argument without words that transcended all worded arguments  he saw that in her eyes before which all discussion fled away for he saw love there  and in his own eyes was love and love was unanswerable  such was his passionate doctrine  the half hour he had with her before they went in to dinner left him supremely happy and supremely satisfied with life  nevertheless at table the inevitable reaction and exhaustion consequent upon the hard day seized hold of him  he was aware that his eyes were tired and that he was irritable  he remembered it was at this table at which he now sneered and was so often bored that he had first eaten with civilized beings in what he had imagined was an atmosphere of high culture and refinement  he caught a glimpse of that pathetic figure of him so long ago a selfconscious savage sprouting sweat at every pore in an agony of apprehension puzzled by the bewildering minutiae of eatingimplements tortured by the ogre of a servant striving at a leap to live at such dizzy social altitude and deciding in the end to be frankly himself pretending no knowledge and no polish he did not possess  he glanced at ruth for reassurance much in the same manner that a passenger with sudden panic thought of possible shipwreck will strive to locate the life preservers  well that much had come out of itlove and ruth  all the rest had failed to stand the test of the books  but ruth and love had stood the test for them he found a biological sanction  love was the most exalted expression of life  nature had been busy designing him as she had been busy with all normal men for the purpose of loving  she had spent ten thousand centuriesay a hundred thousand and a million centuriesupon the task and he was the best she could do  she had made love the strongest thing in him increased its power a myriad per cent with her gift of imagination and sent him forth into the ephemera to thrill and melt and mate  his hand sought ruths hand beside him hidden by the table and a warm pressure was given and received  she looked at him a swift instant and her eyes were radiant and melting  so were his in the thrill that pervaded him nor did he realize how much that was radiant and melting in her eyes had been aroused by what she had seen in his  across the table from him catercornered at mr morses right sat judge blount a local superior court judge  martin had met him a number of times and had failed to like him  he and ruths father were discussing labor union politics the local situation and socialism and mr morse was endeavoring to twit martin on the latter topic  at last judge blount looked across the table with benignant and fatherly pity martin smiled to himself  youll grow out of it young man he said soothingly  time is the best cure for such youthful distempers  he turned to mr morse  i do not believe discussion is good in such cases  it makes the patient obstinate  that is true the other assented gravely  but it is well to warn the patient occasionally of his condition  martin laughed merrily but it was with an effort  the day had been too long the days effort too intense and he was deep in the throes of the reaction  undoubtedly you are both excellent doctors he said but if you care a whit for the opinion of the patient let him tell you that you are poor diagnosticians  in fact you are both suffering from the disease you think you find in me  as for me i am immune  the socialist philosophy that riots halfbaked in your veins has passed me by  clever clever murmured the judge  an excellent ruse in controversy to reverse positions  out of your mouth  martins eyes were sparkling but he kept control of himself  you see judge ive heard your campaign speeches  by some henidical processhenidical by the way is a favorite word of mine which nobody understandsby some henidical process you persuade yourself that you believe in the competitive system and the survival of the strong and at the same time you indorse with might and main all sorts of measures to shear the strength from the strong  my young man  remember ive heard your campaign speeches martin warned  its on record your position on interstate commerce regulation on regulation of the railway trust and standard oil on the conservation of the forests on a thousand and one restrictive measures that are nothing else than socialistic  do you mean to tell me that you do not believe in regulating these various outrageous exercises of power  thats not the point  i mean to tell you that you are a poor diagnostician  i mean to tell you that i am not suffering from the microbe of socialism  i mean to tell you that it is you who are suffering from the emasculating ravages of that same microbe  as for me i am an inveterate opponent of socialism just as i am an inveterate opponent of your own mongrel democracy that is nothing else than pseudo socialism masquerading under a garb of words that will not stand the test of the dictionary  i am a reactionaryso complete a reactionary that my position is incomprehensible to you who live in a veiled lie of social organization and whose sight is not keen enough to pierce the veil  you make believe that you believe in the survival of the strong and the rule of the strong  i believe  that is the difference  when i was a trifle youngera few months youngeri believed the same thing  you see the ideas of you and yours had impressed me  but merchants and traders are cowardly rulers at best they grunt and grub all their days in the trough of moneygetting and i have swung back to aristocracy if you please  i am the only individualist in this room  i look to the state for nothing i look only to the strong man the man on horseback to save the state from its own rotten futility  nietzsche was right  i wont take the time to tell you who nietzsche was but he was right  the world belongs to the strongto the strong who are noble as well and who do not wallow in the swinetrough of trade and exchange  the world belongs to the true nobleman to the great blond beasts to the noncompromisers to the yessayers  and they will eat you up you socialistswho are afraid of socialism and who think yourselves individualists  your slavemorality of the meek and lowly will never save youoh its all greek i know and i wont bother you any more with it  but remember one thing  there arent half a dozen individualists in oakland but martin eden is one of them  he signified that he was done with the discussion and turned to ruth  im wrought up today he said in an undertone  all i want to do is to love not talk  he ignored mr morse who said  i am unconvinced  all socialists are jesuits  that is the way to tell them  well make a good republican out of you yet said judge blount  the man on horseback will arrive before that time martin retorted with good humor and returned to ruth  but mr morse was not content  he did not like the laziness and the disinclination for sober legitimate work of this prospective soninlaw of his for whose ideas he had no respect and of whose nature he had no understanding  so he turned the conversation to herbert spencer  judge blount ably seconded him and martin whose ears had pricked at the first mention of the philosophers name listened to the judge enunciate a grave and complacent diatribe against spencer  from time to time mr morse glanced at martin as much as to say there my boy you see  chattering daws martin muttered under his breath and went on talking with ruth and arthur  but the long day and the real dirt of the night before were telling upon him and besides still in his burnt mind was what had made him angry when he read it on the car  what is the matter ruth asked suddenly alarmed by the effort he was making to contain himself  there is no god but the unknowable and herbert spencer is its prophet judge blount was saying at that moment  martin turned upon him  a cheap judgment he remarked quietly  i heard it first in the city hall park on the lips of a workingman who ought to have known better  i have heard it often since and each time the claptrap of it nauseates me  you ought to be ashamed of yourself  to hear that great and noble mans name upon your lips is like finding a dewdrop in a cesspool  you are disgusting  it was like a thunderbolt  judge blount glared at him with apoplectic countenance and silence reigned  mr morse was secretly pleased  he could see that his daughter was shocked  it was what he wanted to doto bring out the innate ruffianism of this man he did not like  ruths hand sought martins beseechingly under the table but his blood was up  he was inflamed by the intellectual pretence and fraud of those who sat in the high places  a superior court judge  it was only several years before that he had looked up from the mire at such glorious entities and deemed them gods  judge blount recovered himself and attempted to go on addressing himself to martin with an assumption of politeness that the latter understood was for the benefit of the ladies  even this added to his anger  was there no honesty in the world  you cant discuss spencer with me he cried  you do not know any more about spencer than do his own countrymen  but it is no fault of yours i grant  it is just a phase of the contemptible ignorance of the times  i ran across a sample of it on my way here this evening  i was reading an essay by saleeby on spencer  you should read it  it is accessible to all men  you can buy it in any bookstore or draw it from the public library  you would feel ashamed of your paucity of abuse and ignorance of that noble man compared with what saleeby has collected on the subject  it is a record of shame that would shame your shame  the philosopher of the halfeducated he was called by an academic philosopher who was not worthy to pollute the atmosphere he breathed  i dont think you have read ten pages of spencer but there have been critics assumably more intelligent than you who have read no more than you of spencer who publicly challenged his followers to adduce one single idea from all his writingsfrom herbert spencers writings the man who has impressed the stamp of his genius over the whole field of scientific research and modern thought the father of psychology the man who revolutionized pedagogy so that today the child of the french peasant is taught the three rs according to principles laid down by him and the little gnats of men sting his memory when they get their very bread and butter from the technical application of his ideas  what little of worth resides in their brains is largely due to him  it is certain that had he never lived most of what is correct in their parrot learned knowledge would be absent  and yet a man like principal fairbanks of oxforda man who sits in an even higher place than you judge blounthas said that spencer will be dismissed by posterity as a poet and dreamer rather than a thinker yappers and blatherskites the whole brood of them  first principles is not wholly destitute of a certain literary power said one of them and others of them have said that he was an industrious plodder rather than an original thinker  yappers and blatherskites  yappers and blatherskites  martin ceased abruptly in a dead silence  everybody in ruths family looked up to judge blount as a man of power and achievement and they were horrified at martins outbreak  the remainder of the dinner passed like a funeral the judge and mr morse confining their talk to each other and the rest of the conversation being extremely desultory  then afterward when ruth and martin were alone there was a scene  you are unbearable she wept  but his anger still smouldered and he kept muttering the beasts  the beasts  when she averred he had insulted the judge he retorted  by telling the truth about him  i dont care whether it was true or not she insisted  there are certain bounds of decency and you had no license to insult anybody  then where did judge blount get the license to assault truth martin demanded  surely to assault truth is a more serious misdemeanor than to insult a pygmy personality such as the judges  he did worse than that he blackened the name of a great noble man who is dead  oh the beasts the beasts  his complex anger flamed afresh and ruth was in terror of him  never had she seen him so angry and it was all mystified and unreasonable to her comprehension  and yet through her very terror ran the fibres of fascination that had drawn and that still drew her to himthat had compelled her to lean towards him and in that mad culminating moment lay her hands upon his neck  she was hurt and outraged by what had taken place and yet she lay in his arms and quivered while he went on muttering the beasts  the beasts  and she still lay there when he said ill not bother your table again dear  they do not like me and it is wrong of me to thrust my objectionable presence upon them  besides they are just as objectionable to me  faugh  they are sickening  and to think of it i dreamed in my innocence that the persons who sat in the high places who lived in fine houses and had educations and bank accounts were worth while     chapter xxxviii   come on lets go down to the local  so spoke brissenden faint from a hemorrhage of half an hour beforethe second hemorrhage in three days  the perennial whiskey glass was in his hands and he drained it with shaking fingers  what do i want with socialism martin demanded  outsiders are allowed fiveminute speeches the sick man urged  get up and spout  tell them why you dont want socialism  tell them what you think about them and their ghetto ethics  slam nietzsche into them and get walloped for your pains  make a scrap of it  it will do them good  discussion is what they want and what you want too  you see id like to see you a socialist before im gone  it will give you a sanction for your existence  it is the one thing that will save you in the time of disappointment that is coming to you  i never can puzzle out why you of all men are a socialist martin pondered  you detest the crowd so  surely there is nothing in the canaille to recommend it to your aesthetic soul  he pointed an accusing finger at the whiskey glass which the other was refilling  socialism doesnt seem to save you  im very sick was the answer  with you it is different  you have health and much to live for and you must be handcuffed to life somehow as for me you wonder why i am a socialist  ill tell you  it is because socialism is inevitable because the present rotten and irrational system cannot endure because the day is past for your man on horseback  the slaves wont stand for it  they are too many and willy nilly theyll drag down the wouldbe equestrian before ever he gets astride  you cant get away from them and youll have to swallow the whole slavemorality  its not a nice mess ill allow  but its been a brewing and swallow it you must  you are antediluvian anyway with your nietzsche ideas  the past is past and the man who says history repeats itself is a liar  of course i dont like the crowd but whats a poor chap to do  we cant have the man on horseback and anything is preferable to the timid swine that now rule  but come on anyway  im loaded to the guards now and if i sit here any longer ill get drunk and you know the doctor saysdamn the doctor  ill fool him yet  it was sunday night and they found the small hall packed by the oakland socialists chiefly members of the working class  the speaker a clever jew won martins admiration at the same time that he aroused his antagonism  the mans stooped and narrow shoulders and weazened chest proclaimed him the true child of the crowded ghetto and strong on martin was the agelong struggle of the feeble wretched slaves against the lordly handful of men who had ruled over them and would rule over them to the end of time  to martin this withered wisp of a creature was a symbol  he was the figure that stood forth representative of the whole miserable mass of weaklings and inefficients who perished according to biological law on the ragged confines of life  they were the unfit  in spite of their cunning philosophy and of their antlike proclivities for cooperation nature rejected them for the exceptional man  out of the plentiful spawn of life she flung from her prolific hand she selected only the best  it was by the same method that men aping her bred race horses and cucumbers  doubtless a creator of a cosmos could have devised a better method but creatures of this particular cosmos must put up with this particular method  of course they could squirm as they perished as the socialists squirmed as the speaker on the platform and the perspiring crowd were squirming even now as they counselled together for some new device with which to minimize the penalties of living and outwit the cosmos  so martin thought and so he spoke when brissenden urged him to give them hell  he obeyed the mandate walking up to the platform as was the custom and addressing the chairman  he began in a low voice haltingly forming into order the ideas which had surged in his brain while the jew was speaking  in such meetings five minutes was the time allotted to each speaker but when martins five minutes were up he was in full stride his attack upon their doctrines but half completed  he had caught their interest and the audience urged the chairman by acclamation to extend martins time  they appreciated him as a foeman worthy of their intellect and they listened intently following every word  he spoke with fire and conviction mincing no words in his attack upon the slaves and their morality and tactics and frankly alluding to his hearers as the slaves in question  he quoted spencer and malthus and enunciated the biological law of development  and so he concluded in a swift resume no state composed of the slavetypes can endure  the old law of development still holds  in the struggle for existence as i have shown the strong and the progeny of the strong tend to survive while the weak and the progeny of the weak are crushed and tend to perish  the result is that the strong and the progeny of the strong survive and so long as the struggle obtains the strength of each generation increases  that is development  but you slavesit is too bad to be slaves i grantbut you slaves dream of a society where the law of development will be annulled where no weaklings and inefficients will perish where every inefficient will have as much as he wants to eat as many times a day as he desires and where all will marry and have progenythe weak as well as the strong  what will be the result  no longer will the strength and lifevalue of each generation increase  on the contrary it will diminish  there is the nemesis of your slave philosophy  your society of slavesof by and for slavesmust inevitably weaken and go to pieces as the life which composes it weakens and goes to pieces  remember i am enunciating biology and not sentimental ethics  no state of slaves can stand  how about the united states a man yelled from the audience  and how about it martin retorted  the thirteen colonies threw off their rulers and formed the republic socalled  the slaves were their own masters  there were no more masters of the sword  but you couldnt get along without masters of some sort and there arose a new set of mastersnot the great virile noble men but the shrewd and spidery traders and moneylenders  and they enslaved you over againbut not frankly as the true noble men would do with weight of their own right arms but secretly by spidery machinations and by wheedling and cajolery and lies  they have purchased your slave judges they have debauched your slave legislatures and they have forced to worse horrors than chattel slavery your slave boys and girls  two million of your children are toiling today in this traderoligarchy of the united states  ten millions of you slaves are not properly sheltered nor properly fed  but to return  i have shown that no society of slaves can endure because in its very nature such society must annul the law of development  no sooner can a slave society be organized than deterioration sets in  it is easy for you to talk of annulling the law of development but where is the new law of development that will maintain your strength  formulate it  is it already formulated  then state it  martin took his seat amidst an uproar of voices  a score of men were on their feet clamoring for recognition from the chair  and one by one encouraged by vociferous applause speaking with fire and enthusiasm and excited gestures they replied to the attack  it was a wild nightbut it was wild intellectually a battle of ideas  some strayed from the point but most of the speakers replied directly to martin  they shook him with lines of thought that were new to him and gave him insights not into new biological laws but into new applications of the old laws they were too earnest to be always polite and more than once the chairman rapped and pounded for order  it chanced that a cub reporter sat in the audience detailed there on a day dull of news and impressed by the urgent need of journalism for sensation  he was not a bright cub reporter  he was merely facile and glib  he was too dense to follow the discussion  in fact he had a comfortable feeling that he was vastly superior to these wordy maniacs of the working class  also he had a great respect for those who sat in the high places and dictated the policies of nations and newspapers  further he had an ideal namely of achieving that excellence of the perfect reporter who is able to make somethingeven a great dealout of nothing  he did not know what all the talk was about  it was not necessary  words like revolution gave him his cue  like a paleontologist able to reconstruct an entire skeleton from one fossil bone he was able to reconstruct a whole speech from the one word revolution  he did it that night and he did it well and since martin had made the biggest stir he put it all into his mouth and made him the archanarch of the show transforming his reactionary individualism into the most lurid red shirt socialist utterance  the cub reporter was an artist and it was a large brush with which he laid on the local colorwildeyed longhaired men neurasthenia and degenerate types of men voices shaken with passion clenched fists raised on high and all projected against a background of oaths yells and the throaty rumbling of angry men     chapter xxxix   over the coffee in his little room martin read next mornings paper  it was a novel experience to find himself headlined on the first page at that and he was surprised to learn that he was the most notorious leader of the oakland socialists  he ran over the violent speech the cub reporter had constructed for him and though at first he was angered by the fabrication in the end he tossed the paper aside with a laugh  either the man was drunk or criminally malicious he said that afternoon from his perch on the bed when brissenden had arrived and dropped limply into the one chair  but what do you care brissenden asked  surely you dont desire the approval of the bourgeois swine that read the newspapers  martin thought for a while then said  no i really dont care for their approval not a whit  on the other hand its very likely to make my relations with ruths family a trifle awkward  her father always contended i was a socialist and this miserable stuff will clinch his belief  not that i care for his opinionbut whats the odds  i want to read you what ive been doing to day  its overdue of course and im just about halfway through  he was reading aloud when maria thrust open the door and ushered in a young man in a natty suit who glanced briskly about him noting the oil burner and the kitchen in the corner before his gaze wandered on to martin  sit down brissenden said  martin made room for the young man on the bed and waited for him to broach his business  i heard you speak last night mr eden and ive come to interview you he began  brissenden burst out in a hearty laugh  a brother socialist the reporter asked with a quick glance at brissenden that appraised the colorvalue of that cadaverous and dying man  and he wrote that report martin said softly  why he is only a boy  why dont you poke him brissenden asked  id give a thousand dollars to have my lungs back for five minutes  the cub reporter was a trifle perplexed by this talking over him and around him and at him  but he had been commended for his brilliant description of the socialist meeting and had further been detailed to get a personal interview with martin eden the leader of the organized menace to society  you do not object to having your picture taken mr eden he said ive a staff photographer outside you see and he says it will be better to take you right away before the sun gets lower  then we can have the interview afterward  a photographer brissenden said meditatively  poke him martin  poke him  i guess im getting old was the answer  i know i ought but i really havent the heart  it doesnt seem to matter  for his mothers sake brissenden urged  its worth considering martin replied but it doesnt seem worth while enough to rouse sufficient energy in me  you see it does take energy to give a fellow a poking  besides what does it matter  thats rightthats the way to take it the cub announced airily though he had already begun to glance anxiously at the door  but it wasnt true not a word of what he wrote martin went on confining his attention to brissenden  it was just in a general way a description you understand the cub ventured and besides its good advertising  thats what counts  it was a favor to you  its good advertising martin old boy brissenden repeated solemnly  and it was a favor to methink of that was martins contribution  let me seewhere were you born mr eden the cub asked assuming an air of expectant attention  he doesnt take notes said brissenden  he remembers it all  that is sufficient for me  the cub was trying not to look worried  no decent reporter needs to bother with notes  that was sufficientfor last night  but brissenden was not a disciple of quietism and he changed his attitude abruptly  martin if you dont poke him ill do it myself if i fall dead on the floor the next moment  how will a spanking do martin asked  brissenden considered judicially and nodded his head  the next instant martin was seated on the edge of the bed with the cub face downward across his knees  now dont bite martin warned or else ill have to punch your face it would be a pity for it is such a pretty face  his uplifted hand descended and thereafter rose and fell in a swift and steady rhythm  the cub struggled and cursed and squirmed but did not offer to bite  brissenden looked on gravely though once he grew excited and gripped the whiskey bottle pleading here just let me swat him once  sorry my hand played out martin said when at last he desisted  it is quite numb  he uprighted the cub and perched him on the bed  ill have you arrested for this he snarled tears of boyish indignation running down his flushed cheeks  ill make you sweat for this  youll see  the pretty thing martin remarked  he doesnt realize that he has entered upon the downward path  it is not honest it is not square it is not manly to tell lies about ones fellowcreatures the way he has done and he doesnt know it  he has to come to us to be told brissenden filled in a pause  yes to me whom he has maligned and injured  my grocery will undoubtedly refuse me credit now  the worst of it is that the poor boy will keep on this way until he deteriorates into a firstclass newspaper man and also a firstclass scoundrel  but there is yet time quoth brissenden  who knows but what you may prove the humble instrument to save him  why didnt you let me swat him just once  id like to have had a hand in it  ill have you arrested the pair of you you bbbig brutes sobbed the erring soul  no his mouth is too pretty and too weak  martin shook his head lugubriously  im afraid ive numbed my hand in vain  the young man cannot reform  he will become eventually a very great and successful newspaper man  he has no conscience  that alone will make him great  with that the cub passed out the door in trepidation to the last for fear that brissenden would hit him in the back with the bottle he still clutched  in the next mornings paper martin learned a great deal more about himself that was new to him  we are the sworn enemies of society he found himself quoted as saying in a column interview  no we are not anarchists but socialists  when the reporter pointed out to him that there seemed little difference between the two schools martin had shrugged his shoulders in silent affirmation  his face was described as bilaterally asymmetrical and various other signs of degeneration were described  especially notable were his thuglike hands and the fiery gleams in his bloodshot eyes  he learned also that he spoke nightly to the workmen in the city hall park and that among the anarchists and agitators that there inflamed the minds of the people he drew the largest audiences and made the most revolutionary speeches  the cub painted a highlight picture of his poor little room its oilstove and the one chair and of the deathshead tramp who kept him company and who looked as if he had just emerged from twenty years of solitary confinement in some fortress dungeon  the cub had been industrious  he had scurried around and nosed out martins family history and procured a photograph of higginbothams cash store with bernard higginbotham himself standing out in front  that gentleman was depicted as an intelligent dignified businessman who had no patience with his brotherinlaws socialistic views and no patience with the brotherinlaw either whom he was quoted as characterizing as a lazy goodfornothing who wouldnt take a job when it was offered to him and who would go to jail yet  hermann von schmidt marians husband had likewise been interviewed  he had called martin the black sheep of the family and repudiated him  he tried to sponge off of me but i put a stop to that good and quick von schmidt had said to the reporter  he knows better than to come bumming around here  a man who wont work is no good take that from me  this time martin was genuinely angry  brissenden looked upon the affair as a good joke but he could not console martin who knew that it would be no easy task to explain to ruth  as for her father he knew that he must be overjoyed with what had happened and that he would make the most of it to break off the engagement  how much he would make of it he was soon to realize  the afternoon mail brought a letter from ruth  martin opened it with a premonition of disaster and read it standing at the open door when he had received it from the postman  as he read mechanically his hand sought his pocket for the tobacco and brown paper of his old cigarette days  he was not aware that the pocket was empty or that he had even reached for the materials with which to roll a cigarette  it was not a passionate letter  there were no touches of anger in it but all the way through from the first sentence to the last was sounded the note of hurt and disappointment  she had expected better of him  she had thought he had got over his youthful wildness that her love for him had been sufficiently worth while to enable him to live seriously and decently  and now her father and mother had taken a firm stand and commanded that the engagement be broken  that they were justified in this she could not but admit  their relation could never be a happy one it had been unfortunate from the first  but one regret she voiced in the whole letter and it was a bitter one to martin  if only you had settled down to some position and attempted to make something of yourself she wrote  but it was not to be  your past life had been too wild and irregular  i can understand that you are not to be blamed you could act only according to your nature and your early training  so i do not blame you martin  please remember that  it was simply a mistake  as father and mother have contended we were not made for each other and we should both be happy because it was discovered not too late   there is no use trying to see me she said toward the last it would be an unhappy meeting for both of us as well as for my mother i feel as it is that i have caused her great pain and worry  i shall have to do much living to atone for it  he read it through to the end carefully a second time then sat down and replied  he outlined the remarks he had uttered at the socialist meeting pointing out that they were in all ways the converse of what the newspaper had put in his mouth  toward the end of the letter he was gods own lover pleading passionately for love  please answer he said and in your answer you have to tell me but one thing  do you love me  that is allthe answer to that one question  but no answer came the next day nor the next  overdue lay untouched upon the table and each day the heap of returned manuscripts under the table grew larger  for the first time martins glorious sleep was interrupted by insomnia and he tossed through long restless nights three times he called at the morse home but was turned away by the servant who answered the bell  brissenden lay sick in his hotel too feeble to stir out and though martin was with him often he did not worry him with his troubles  for martins troubles were many  the aftermath of the cub reporters deed was even wider than martin had anticipated  the portuguese grocer refused him further credit while the greengrocer who was an american and proud of it had called him a traitor to his country and refused further dealings with himcarrying his patriotism to such a degree that he cancelled martins account and forbade him ever to attempt to pay it the talk in the neighborhood reflected the same feeling and indignation against martin ran high  no one would have anything to do with a socialist traitor  poor maria was dubious and frightened but she remained loyal  the children of the neighborhood recovered from the awe of the grand carriage which once had visited martin and from safe distances they called him hobo and bum  the silva tribe however stanchly defended him fighting more than one pitched battle for his honor and black eyes and bloody noses became quite the order of the day and added to marias perplexities and troubles  once martin met gertrude on the street down in oakland and learned what he knew could not be otherwisethat bernard higginbotham was furious with him for having dragged the family into public disgrace and that he had forbidden him the house  why dont you go away martin gertrude had begged  go away and get a job somewhere and steady down  afterwards when this all blows over you can come back  martin shook his head but gave no explanations  how could he explain he was appalled at the awful intellectual chasm that yawned between him and his people  he could never cross it and explain to them his positionthe nietzschean position in regard to socialism  there were not words enough in the english language nor in any language to make his attitude and conduct intelligible to them  their highest concept of right conduct in his case was to get a job  that was their first word and their last  it constituted their whole lexicon of ideas  get a job go to work  poor stupid slaves he thought while his sister talked small wonder the world belonged to the strong  the slaves were obsessed by their own slavery  a job was to them a golden fetich before which they fell down and worshipped  he shook his head again when gertrude offered him money though he knew that within the day he would have to make a trip to the pawnbroker  dont come near bernard now she admonished him  after a few months when he is cooled down if you want to you can get the job of drivin deliverywagon for him  any time you want me just send for me an ill come  dont forget  she went away weeping audibly and he felt a pang of sorrow shoot through him at sight of her heavy body and uncouth gait  as he watched her go the nietzschean edifice seemed to shake and totter  the slaveclass in the abstract was all very well but it was not wholly satisfactory when it was brought home to his own family  and yet if there was ever a slave trampled by the strong that slave was his sister gertrude  he grinned savagely at the paradox  a fine nietzscheman he was to allow his intellectual concepts to be shaken by the first sentiment or emotion that strayed alongay to be shaken by the slavemorality itself for that was what his pity for his sister really was  the true noble men were above pity and compassion  pity and compassion had been generated in the subterranean barracoons of the slaves and were no more than the agony and sweat of the crowded miserables and weaklings     chapter xl   overdue still continued to lie forgotten on the table  every manuscript that he had had out now lay under the table  only one manuscript he kept going and that was brissendens ephemera  his bicycle and black suit were again in pawn and the typewriter people were once more worrying about the rent  but such things no longer bothered him  he was seeking a new orientation and until that was found his life must stand still  after several weeks what he had been waiting for happened  he met ruth on the street  it was true she was accompanied by her brother norman and it was true that they tried to ignore him and that norman attempted to wave him aside  if you interfere with my sister ill call an officer norman threatened  she does not wish to speak with you and your insistence is insult  if you persist youll have to call that officer and then youll get your name in the papers martin answered grimly  and now get out of my way and get the officer if you want to  im going to talk with ruth  i want to have it from your own lips he said to her  she was pale and trembling but she held up and looked inquiringly  the question i asked in my letter he prompted  norman made an impatient movement but martin checked him with a swift look  she shook her head  is all this of your own free will he demanded  it is  she spoke in a low firm voice and with deliberation  it is of my own free will  you have disgraced me so that i am ashamed to meet my friends  they are all talking about me i know  that is all i can tell you  you have made me very unhappy and i never wish to see you again  friends  gossip  newspaper misreports  surely such things are not stronger than love  i can only believe that you never loved me  a blush drove the pallor from her face  after what has passed she said faintly  martin you do not know what you are saying  i am not common  you see she doesnt want to have anything to do with you norman blurted out starting on with her  martin stood aside and let them pass fumbling unconsciously in his coat pocket for the tobacco and brown papers that were not there  it was a long walk to north oakland but it was not until he went up the steps and entered his room that he knew he had walked it  he found himself sitting on the edge of the bed and staring about him like an awakened somnambulist  he noticed overdue lying on the table and drew up his chair and reached for his pen  there was in his nature a logical compulsion toward completeness  here was something undone  it had been deferred against the completion of something else  now that something else had been finished and he would apply himself to this task until it was finished  what he would do next he did not know  all that he did know was that a climacteric in his life had been attained  a period had been reached and he was rounding it off in workmanlike fashion  he was not curious about the future  he would soon enough find out what it held in store for him  whatever it was it did not matter  nothing seemed to matter  for five days he toiled on at overdue going nowhere seeing nobody and eating meagrely  on the morning of the sixth day the postman brought him a thin letter from the editor of the parthenon  a glance told him that ephemera was accepted  we have submitted the poem to mr cartwright bruce the editor went on to say and he has reported so favorably upon it that we cannot let it go  as an earnest of our pleasure in publishing the poem let me tell you that we have set it for the august number our july number being already made up  kindly extend our pleasure and our thanks to mr brissenden  please send by return mail his photograph and biographical data  if our honorarium is unsatisfactory kindly telegraph us at once and state what you consider a fair price  since the honorarium they had offered was three hundred and fifty dollars martin thought it not worth while to telegraph  then too there was brissendens consent to be gained  well he had been right after all  here was one magazine editor who knew real poetry when he saw it  and the price was splendid even though it was for the poem of a century  as for cartwright bruce martin knew that he was the one critic for whose opinions brissenden had any respect  martin rode down town on an electric car and as he watched the houses and crossstreets slipping by he was aware of a regret that he was not more elated over his friends success and over his own signal victory the one critic in the united states had pronounced favorably on the poem while his own contention that good stuff could find its way into the magazines had proved correct  but enthusiasm had lost its spring in him and he found that he was more anxious to see brissenden than he was to carry the good news  the acceptance of the parthenon had recalled to him that during his five days devotion to overdue he had not heard from brissenden nor even thought about him  for the first time martin realized the daze he had been in and he felt shame for having forgotten his friend  but even the shame did not burn very sharply  he was numb to emotions of any sort save the artistic ones concerned in the writing of overdue  so far as other affairs were concerned he had been in a trance  for that matter he was still in a trance  all this life through which the electric car whirred seemed remote and unreal and he would have experienced little interest and less shook if the great stone steeple of the church he passed had suddenly crumbled to mortardust upon his head  at the hotel he hurried up to brissendens room and hurried down again the room was empty  all luggage was gone  did mr brissenden leave any address he asked the clerk who looked at him curiously for a moment  havent you heard he asked  martin shook his head  why the papers were full of it  he was found dead in bed  suicide shot himself through the head  is he buried yet martin seemed to hear his voice like some one elses voice from a long way off asking the question  no  the body was shipped east after the inquest  lawyers engaged by his people saw to the arrangements  they were quick about it i must say martin commented  oh i dont know  it happened five days ago  five days ago  yes five days ago  oh martin said as he turned and went out  at the corner he stepped into the western union and sent a telegram to the parthenon advising them to proceed with the publication of the poem he had in his pocket but five cents with which to pay his carfare home so he sent the message collect  once in his room he resumed his writing  the days and nights came and went and he sat at his table and wrote on  he went nowhere save to the pawnbroker took no exercise and ate methodically when he was hungry and had something to cook and just as methodically went without when he had nothing to cook  composed as the story was in advance chapter by chapter he nevertheless saw and developed an opening that increased the power of it though it necessitated twenty thousand additional words  it was not that there was any vital need that the thing should be well done but that his artistic canons compelled him to do it well  he worked on in the daze strangely detached from the world around him feeling like a familiar ghost among these literary trappings of his former life  he remembered that some one had said that a ghost was the spirit of a man who was dead and who did not have sense enough to know it and he paused for the moment to wonder if he were really dead did unaware of it  came the day when overdue was finished  the agent of the typewriter firm had come for the machine and he sat on the bed while martin on the one chair typed the last pages of the final chapter  finis he wrote in capitals at the end and to him it was indeed finis  he watched the typewriter carried out the door with a feeling of relief then went over and lay down on the bed  he was faint from hunger  food had not passed his lips in thirtysix hours but he did not think about it  he lay on his back with closed eyes and did not think at all while the daze or stupor slowly welled up saturating his consciousness  half in delirium he began muttering aloud the lines of an anonymous poem brissenden had been fond of quoting to him  maria listening anxiously outside his door was perturbed by his monotonous utterance  the words in themselves were not significant to her but the fact that he was saying them was  i have done was the burden of the poem     i have done    put by the lute    song and singing soon are over    as the airy shades that hover    in among the purple clover    i have done    put by the lute    once i sang as early thrushes    sing among the dewy bushes    now im mute    i am like a weary linnet    for my throat has no song in it    i have had my singing minute    i have done    put by the lute  maria could stand it no longer and hurried away to the stove where she filled a quartbowl with soup putting into it the lions share of chopped meat and vegetables which her ladle scraped from the bottom of the pot  martin roused himself and sat up and began to eat between spoonfuls reassuring maria that he had not been talking in his sleep and that he did not have any fever  after she left him he sat drearily with drooping shoulders on the edge of the bed gazing about him with lacklustre eyes that saw nothing until the torn wrapper of a magazine which had come in the mornings mail and which lay unopened shot a gleam of light into his darkened brain  it is the parthenon he thought the august parthenon and it must contain ephemera  if only brissenden were here to see  he was turning the pages of the magazine when suddenly he stopped ephemera had been featured with gorgeous headpiece and beardsleylike margin decorations  on one side of the headpiece was brissendens photograph on the other side was the photograph of sir john value the british ambassador  a preliminary editorial note quoted sir john value as saying that there were no poets in america and the publication of ephemera was the parthenons  there take that sir john value cartwright bruce was described as the greatest critic in america and he was quoted as saying that ephemera was the greatest poem ever written in america  and finally the editors foreword ended with we have not yet made up our minds entirely as to the merits of ephemera perhaps we shall never be able to do so  but we have read it often wondering at the words and their arrangement wondering where mr brissenden got them and how he could fasten them together  then followed the poem  pretty good thing you died briss old man martin murmured letting the magazine slip between his knees to the floor  the cheapness and vulgarity of it was nauseating and martin noted apathetically that he was not nauseated very much  he wished he could get angry but did not have energy enough to try  he was too numb  his blood was too congealed to accelerate to the swift tidal flow of indignation  after all what did it matter  it was on a par with all the rest that brissenden had condemned in bourgeois society  poor briss martin communed he would never have forgiven me  rousing himself with an effort he possessed himself of a box which had once contained typewriter paper  going through its contents he drew forth eleven poems which his friend had written  these he tore lengthwise and crosswise and dropped into the waste basket  he did it languidly and when he had finished sat on the edge of the bed staring blankly before him  how long he sat there he did not know until suddenly across his sightless vision he saw form a long horizontal line of white  it was curious  but as he watched it grow in definiteness he saw that it was a coral reef smoking in the white pacific surges  next in the line of breakers he made out a small canoe an outrigger canoe  in the stern he saw a young bronzed god in scarlet hipcloth dipping a flashing paddle he recognized him  he was moti the youngest son of tati the chief and this was tahiti and beyond that smoking reef lay the sweet land of papara and the chiefs grass house by the rivers mouth  it was the end of the day and moti was coming home from the fishing  he was waiting for the rush of a big breaker whereon to jump the reef  then he saw himself sitting forward in the canoe as he had often sat in the past dipping a paddle that waited motis word to dig in like mad when the turquoise wall of the great breaker rose behind them  next he was no longer an onlooker but was himself in the canoe moti was crying out they were both thrusting hard with their paddles racing on the steep face of the flying turquoise  under the bow the water was hissing as from a steam jet the air was filled with driven spray there was a rush and rumble and longechoing roar and the canoe floated on the placid water of the lagoon  moti laughed and shook the salt water from his eyes and together they paddled in to the poundedcoral beach where tatis grass walls through the cocoanutpalms showed golden in the setting sun  the picture faded and before his eyes stretched the disorder of his squalid room  he strove in vain to see tahiti again  he knew there was singing among the trees and that the maidens were dancing in the moonlight but he could not see them  he could see only the littered writingtable the empty space where the typewriter had stood and the unwashed windowpane  he closed his eyes with a groan and slept     chapter xli   he slept heavily all night and did not stir until aroused by the postman on his morning round  martin felt tired and passive and went through his letters aimlessly  one thin envelope from a robber magazine contained for twentytwo dollars  he had been dunning for it for a year and a half  he noted its amount apathetically  the oldtime thrill at receiving a publishers check was gone  unlike his earlier checks this one was not pregnant with promise of great things to come  to him it was a check for twentytwo dollars that was all and it would buy him something to eat  another check was in the same mail sent from a new york weekly in payment for some humorous verse which had been accepted months before  it was for ten dollars  an idea came to him which he calmly considered  he did not know what he was going to do and he felt in no hurry to do anything  in the meantime he must live  also he owed numerous debts would it not be a paying investment to put stamps on the huge pile of manuscripts under the table and start them on their travels again  one or two of them might be accepted  that would help him to live  he decided on the investment and after he had cashed the checks at the bank down in oakland he bought ten dollars worth of postage stamps  the thought of going home to cook breakfast in his stuffy little room was repulsive to him  for the first time he refused to consider his debts he knew that in his room he could manufacture a substantial breakfast at a cost of from fifteen to twenty cents  but instead he went into the forum cafe and ordered a breakfast that cost two dollars  he tipped the waiter a quarter and spent fifty cents for a package of egyptian cigarettes  it was the first time he had smoked since ruth had asked him to stop  but he could see now no reason why he should not and besides he wanted to smoke  and what did the money matter  for five cents he could have bought a package of durham and brown papers and rolled forty cigarettesbut what of it  money had no meaning to him now except what it would immediately buy  he was chartless and rudderless and he had no port to make while drifting involved the least living and it was living that hurt  the days slipped along and he slept eight hours regularly every night though now while waiting for more checks he ate in the japanese restaurants where meals were served for ten cents his wasted body filled out as did the hollows in his cheeks  he no longer abused himself with short sleep overwork and overstudy  he wrote nothing and the books were closed  he walked much out in the hills and loafed long hours in the quiet parks  he had no friends nor acquaintances nor did he make any  he had no inclination  he was waiting for some impulse from he knew not where to put his stopped life into motion again  in the meantime his life remained run down planless and empty and idle  once he made a trip to san francisco to look up the real dirt  but at the last moment as he stepped into the upstairs entrance he recoiled and turned and fled through the swarming ghetto  he was frightened at the thought of hearing philosophy discussed and he fled furtively for fear that some one of the real dirt might chance along and recognize him  sometimes he glanced over the magazines and newspapers to see how ephemera was being maltreated  it had made a hit  but what a hit everybody had read it and everybody was discussing whether or not it was really poetry  the local papers had taken it up and daily there appeared columns of learned criticisms facetious editorials and serious letters from subscribers  helen della delmar proclaimed with a flourish of trumpets and rolling of tomtoms to be the greatest woman poet in the united states denied brissenden a seat beside her on pegasus and wrote voluminous letters to the public proving that he was no poet  the parthenon came out in its next number patting itself on the back for the stir it had made sneering at sir john value and exploiting brissendens death with ruthless commercialism  a newspaper with a sworn circulation of half a million published an original and spontaneous poem by helen della delmar in which she gibed and sneered at brissenden also she was guilty of a second poem in which she parodied him  martin had many times to be glad that brissenden was dead  he had hated the crowd so and here all that was finest and most sacred of him had been thrown to the crowd  daily the vivisection of beauty went on  every nincompoop in the land rushed into free print floating their wizened little egos into the public eye on the surge of brissendens greatness quoth one paper we have received a letter from a gentleman who wrote a poem just like it only better some time ago  another paper in deadly seriousness reproving helen della delmar for her parody said but unquestionably miss delmar wrote it in a moment of badinage and not quite with the respect that one great poet should show to another and perhaps to the greatest  however whether miss delmar be jealous or not of the man who invented ephemera it is certain that she like thousands of others is fascinated by his work and that the day may come when she will try to write lines like his  ministers began to preach sermons against ephemera and one who too stoutly stood for much of its content was expelled for heresy  the great poem contributed to the gayety of the world  the comic versewriters and the cartoonists took hold of it with screaming laughter and in the personal columns of society weeklies jokes were perpetrated on it to the effect that charley frensham told archie jennings in confidence that five lines of ephemera would drive a man to beat a cripple and that ten lines would send him to the bottom of the river  martin did not laugh nor did he grit his teeth in anger  the effect produced upon him was one of great sadness  in the crash of his whole world with love on the pinnacle the crash of magazinedom and the dear public was a small crash indeed  brissenden had been wholly right in his judgment of the magazines and he martin had spent arduous and futile years in order to find it out for himself  the magazines were all brissenden had said they were and more  well he was done he solaced himself  he had hitched his wagon to a star and been landed in a pestiferous marsh  the visions of tahiticlean sweet tahitiwere coming to him more frequently  and there were the low paumotus and the high marquesas he saw himself often now on board trading schooners or frail little cutters slipping out at dawn through the reef at papeete and beginning the long beat through the pearlatolls to nukahiva and the bay of taiohae where tamari he knew would kill a pig in honor of his coming and where tamaris flowergarlanded daughters would seize his hands and with song and laughter garland him with flowers  the south seas were calling and he knew that sooner or later he would answer the call  in the meantime he drifted resting and recuperating after the long traverse he had made through the realm of knowledge  when the parthenon check of three hundred and fifty dollars was forwarded to him he turned it over to the local lawyer who had attended to brissendens affairs for his family  martin took a receipt for the check and at the same time gave a note for the hundred dollars brissenden had let him have  the time was not long when martin ceased patronizing the japanese restaurants  at the very moment when he had abandoned the fight the tide turned  but it had turned too late  without a thrill he opened a thick envelope from the millennium scanned the face of a check that represented three hundred dollars and noted that it was the payment on acceptance for adventure  every debt he owed in the world including the pawnshop with its usurious interest amounted to less than a hundred dollars  and when he had paid everything and lifted the hundreddollar note with brissendens lawyer he still had over a hundred dollars in pocket  he ordered a suit of clothes from the tailor and ate his meals in the best cafes in town  he still slept in his little room at marias but the sight of his new clothes caused the neighborhood children to cease from calling him hobo and tramp from the roofs of woodsheds and over back fences  wikiwiki his hawaiian short story was bought by warrens monthly for two hundred and fifty dollars  the northern review took his essay the cradle of beauty and mackintoshs magazine took the palmistthe poem he had written to marian  the editors and readers were back from their summer vacations and manuscripts were being handled quickly  but martin could not puzzle out what strange whim animated them to this general acceptance of the things they had persistently rejected for two years nothing of his had been published  he was not known anywhere outside of oakland and in oakland with the few who thought they knew him he was notorious as a redshirt and a socialist  so there was no explaining this sudden acceptability of his wares  it was sheer jugglery of fate  after it had been refused by a number of magazines he had taken brissendens rejected advice and started the shame of the sun on the round of publishers  after several refusals singletree darnley  co accepted it promising fall publication  when martin asked for an advance on royalties they wrote that such was not their custom that books of that nature rarely paid for themselves and that they doubted if his book would sell a thousand copies  martin figured what the book would earn him on such a sale  retailed at a dollar on a royalty of fifteen per cent it would bring him one hundred and fifty dollars  he decided that if he had it to do over again he would confine himself to fiction  adventure onefourth as long had brought him twice as much from the millennium  that newspaper paragraph he had read so long ago had been true after all  the firstclass magazines did not pay on acceptance and they paid well  not two cents a word but four cents a word had the millennium paid him  and furthermore they bought good stuff too for were they not buying his  this last thought he accompanied with a grin  he wrote to singletree darnley  co offering to sell out his rights in the shame of the sun for a hundred dollars but they did not care to take the risk  in the meantime he was not in need of money for several of his later stories had been accepted and paid for  he actually opened a bank account where without a debt in the world he had several hundred dollars to his credit  overdue after having been declined by a number of magazines came to rest at the meredithlowell company martin remembered the five dollars gertrude had given him and his resolve to return it to her a hundred times over so he wrote for an advance on royalties of five hundred dollars  to his surprise a check for that amount accompanied by a contract came by return mail  he cashed the check into fivedollar gold pieces and telephoned gertrude that he wanted to see her  she arrived at the house panting and short of breath from the haste she had made  apprehensive of trouble she had stuffed the few dollars she possessed into her handsatchel and so sure was she that disaster had overtaken her brother that she stumbled forward sobbing into his arms at the same time thrusting the satchel mutely at him  id have come myself he said  but i didnt want a row with mr higginbotham and that is what would have surely happened  hell be all right after a time she assured him while she wondered what the trouble was that martin was in  but youd best get a job first an steady down  bernard does like to see a man at honest work  that stuff in the newspapers broke m all up  i never saw m so mad before  im not going to get a job martin said with a smile  and you can tell him so from me  i dont need a job and theres the proof of it  he emptied the hundred gold pieces into her lap in a glinting tinkling stream  you remember that fiver you gave me the time i didnt have carfare well there it is with ninetynine brothers of different ages but all of the same size  if gertrude had been frightened when she arrived she was now in a panic of fear  her fear was such that it was certitude  she was not suspicious  she was convinced  she looked at martin in horror and her heavy limbs shrank under the golden stream as though it were burning her  its yours he laughed  she burst into tears and began to moan my poor boy my poor boy  he was puzzled for a moment  then he divined the cause of her agitation and handed her the meredithlowell letter which had accompanied the check  she stumbled through it pausing now and again to wipe her eyes and when she had finished said  an does it mean that you come by the money honestly  more honestly than if id won it in a lottery  i earned it  slowly faith came back to her and she reread the letter carefully  it took him long to explain to her the nature of the transaction which had put the money into his possession and longer still to get her to understand that the money was really hers and that he did not need it  ill put it in the bank for you she said finally  youll do nothing of the sort  its yours to do with as you please and if you wont take it ill give it to maria  shell know what to do with it  id suggest though that you hire a servant and take a good long rest  im goin to tell bernard all about it she announced when she was leaving  martin winced then grinned  yes do he said  and then maybe hell invite me to dinner again  yes he willim sure he will she exclaimed fervently as she drew him to her and kissed and hugged him     chapter xlii   one day martin became aware that he was lonely  he was healthy and strong and had nothing to do  the cessation from writing and studying the death of brissenden and the estrangement from ruth had made a big hole in his life and his life refused to be pinned down to good living in cafes and the smoking of egyptian cigarettes  it was true the south seas were calling to him but he had a feeling that the game was not yet played out in the united states  two books were soon to be published and he had more books that might find publication  money could be made out of them and he would wait and take a sackful of it into the south seas  he knew a valley and a bay in the marquesas that he could buy for a thousand chili dollars  the valley ran from the horseshoe landlocked bay to the tops of the dizzy cloudcapped peaks and contained perhaps ten thousand acres  it was filled with tropical fruits wild chickens and wild pigs with an occasional herd of wild cattle while high up among the peaks were herds of wild goats harried by packs of wild dogs the whole place was wild  not a human lived in it and he could buy it and the bay for a thousand chili dollars  the bay as he remembered it was magnificent with water deep enough to accommodate the largest vessel afloat and so safe that the south pacific directory recommended it to the best careening place for ships for hundreds of miles around  he would buy a schoonerone of those yacht like coppered crafts that sailed like witchesand go trading copra and pearling among the islands  he would make the valley and the bay his headquarters  he would build a patriarchal grass house like tatis and have it and the valley and the schooner filled with darkskinned servitors  he would entertain there the factor of taiohae captains of wandering traders and all the best of the south pacific riffraff  he would keep open house and entertain like a prince  and he would forget the books he had opened and the world that had proved an illusion  to do all this he must wait in california to fill the sack with money already it was beginning to flow in  if one of the books made a strike it might enable him to sell the whole heap of manuscripts  also he could collect the stories and the poems into books and make sure of the valley and the bay and the schooner  he would never write again  upon that he was resolved  but in the meantime awaiting the publication of the books he must do something more than live dazed and stupid in the sort of uncaring trance into which he had fallen  he noted one sunday morning that the bricklayers picnic took place that day at shell mound park and to shell mound park he went  he had been to the workingclass picnics too often in his earlier life not to know what they were like and as he entered the park he experienced a recrudescence of all the old sensations  after all they were his kind these working people  he had been born among them he had lived among them and though he had strayed for a time it was well to come back among them  if it aint mart he heard some one say and the next moment a hearty hand was on his shoulder  where you ben all the time  off to sea  come on an have a drink  it was the old crowd in which he found himselfthe old crowd with here and there a gap and here and there a new face  the fellows were not bricklayers but as in the old days they attended all sunday picnics for the dancing and the fighting and the fun  martin drank with them and began to feel really human once more  he was a fool to have ever left them he thought and he was very certain that his sum of happiness would have been greater had he remained with them and let alone the books and the people who sat in the high places  yet the beer seemed not so good as of yore  it didnt taste as it used to taste  brissenden had spoiled him for steam beer he concluded and wondered if after all the books had spoiled him for companionship with these friends of his youth he resolved that he would not be so spoiled and he went on to the dancing pavilion  jimmy the plumber he met there in the company of a tall blond girl who promptly forsook him for martin  gee its like old times jimmy explained to the gang that gave him the laugh as martin and the blonde whirled away in a waltz  an i dont give a rap  im too damned glad to see m back  watch m waltz eh its like silk  whod blame any girl  but martin restored the blonde to jimmy and the three of them with half a dozen friends watched the revolving couples and laughed and joked with one another  everybody was glad to see martin back  no book of his been published he carried no fictitious value in their eyes  they liked him for himself  he felt like a prince returned from excile and his lonely heart burgeoned in the geniality in which it bathed  he made a mad day of it and was at his best  also he had money in his pockets and as in the old days when he returned from sea with a payday he made the money fly  once on the dancingfloor he saw lizzie connolly go by in the arms of a young workingman and later when he made the round of the pavilion he came upon her sitting by a refreshment table  surprise and greetings over he led her away into the grounds where they could talk without shouting down the music  from the instant he spoke to her she was his he knew it  she showed it in the proud humility of her eyes in every caressing movement of her proudly carried body and in the way she hung upon his speech  she was not the young girl as he had known her  she was a woman now and martin noted that her wild defiant beauty had improved losing none of its wildness while the defiance and the fire seemed more in control  a beauty a perfect beauty he murmured admiringly under his breath  and he knew she was his that all he had to do was to say come and she would go with him over the world wherever he led  even as the thought flashed through his brain he received a heavy blow on the side of his head that nearly knocked him down  it was a mans fist directed by a man so angry and in such haste that the fist had missed the jaw for which it was aimed  martin turned as he staggered and saw the fist coming at him in a wild swing  quite as a matter of course he ducked and the fist flew harmlessly past pivoting the man who had driven it  martin hooked with his left landing on the pivoting man with the weight of his body behind the blow  the man went to the ground sidewise leaped to his feet and made a mad rush  martin saw his passiondistorted face and wondered what could be the cause of the fellows anger  but while he wondered he shot in a straight left the weight of his body behind the blow  the man went over backward and fell in a crumpled heap  jimmy and others of the gang were running toward them  martin was thrilling all over  this was the old days with a vengeance with their dancing and their fighting and their fun  while he kept a wary eye on his antagonist he glanced at lizzie  usually the girls screamed when the fellows got to scrapping but she had not screamed  she was looking on with bated breath leaning slightly forward so keen was her interest one hand pressed to her breast her cheek flushed and in her eyes a great and amazed admiration  the man had gained his feet and was struggling to escape the restraining arms that were laid on him  she was waitin for me to come back he was proclaiming to all and sundry  she was waitin for me to come back an then that fresh guy comes buttin in  let go o me i tell yeh  im goin to fix m  whats eatin yer jimmy was demanding as he helped hold the young fellow back  that guys mart eden  hes nifty with his mits lemme tell you that an hell eat you alive if you monkey with m  he cant steal her on me that way the other interjected  he licked the flyin dutchman an you know him jimmy went on expostulating  an he did it in five rounds  you couldnt last a minute against him  see  this information seemed to have a mollifying effect and the irate young man favored martin with a measuring stare  he dont look it he sneered but the sneer was without passion  thats what the flyin dutchman thought jimmy assured him  come on now lets get outa this  theres lots of other girls  come on  the young fellow allowed himself to be led away toward the pavilion and the gang followed after him  who is he martin asked lizzie  and whats it all about anyway  already the zest of combat which of old had been so keen and lasting had died down and he discovered that he was selfanalytical too much so to live single heart and single hand so primitive an existence  lizzie tossed her head  oh hes nobody she said  hes just ben keepin company with me  i had to you see she explained after a pause  i was gettin pretty lonesome  but i never forgot  her voice sank lower and she looked straight before her  id throw m down for you any time  martin looking at her averted face knowing that all he had to do was to reach out his hand and pluck her fell to pondering whether after all there was any real worth in refined grammatical english and so forgot to reply to her  you put it all over him she said tentatively with a laugh  hes a husky young fellow though he admitted generously  if they hadnt taken him away he might have given me my hands full  who was that lady friend i seen you with that night she asked abruptly  oh just a lady friend was his answer  it was a long time ago she murmured contemplatively  it seems like a thousand years  but martin went no further into the matter  he led the conversation off into other channels  they had lunch in the restaurant where he ordered wine and expensive delicacies and afterward he danced with her and with no one but her till she was tired  he was a good dancer and she whirled around and around with him in a heaven of delight her head against his shoulder wishing that it could last forever  later in the afternoon they strayed off among the trees where in the good old fashion she sat down while he sprawled on his back his head in her lap he lay and dozed while she fondled his hair looked down on his closed eyes and loved him without reserve  looking up suddenly he read the tender advertisement in her face  her eyes fluttered down then they opened and looked into his with soft defiance  ive kept straight all these years she said her voice so low that it was almost a whisper  in his heart martin knew that it was the miraculous truth  and at his heart pleaded a great temptation  it was in his power to make her happy denied happiness himself why should he deny happiness to her  he could marry her and take her down with him to dwell in the grasswalled castle in the marquesas  the desire to do it was strong but stronger still was the imperative command of his nature not to do it  in spite of himself he was still faithful to love  the old days of license and easy living were gone  he could not bring them back nor could he go back to them he was changedhow changed he had not realized until now  i am not a marrying man lizzie he said lightly  the hand caressing his hair paused perceptibly then went on with the same gentle stroke  he noticed her face harden but it was with the hardness of resolution for still the soft color was in her cheeks and she was all glowing and melting  i did not mean that she began then faltered  or anyway i dont care  i dont care she repeated  im proud to be your friend  id do anything for you  im made that way i guess  martin sat up  he took her hand in his  he did it deliberately with warmth but without passion and such warmth chilled her  dont lets talk about it she said  you are a great and noble woman he said  and it is i who should be proud to know you  and i am i am  you are a ray of light to me in a very dark world and ive got to be straight with you just as straight as you have been  i dont care whether youre straight with me or not  you could do anything with me  you could throw me in the dirt an walk on me  an youre the only man in the world that can she added with a defiant flash  i aint taken care of myself ever since i was a kid for nothin  and its just because of that that im not going to he said gently you are so big and generous that you challenge me to equal generousness im not marrying and im notwell loving without marrying though ive done my share of that in the past  im sorry i came here today and met you  but it cant be helped now and i never expected it would turn out this way  but look here lizzie  i cant begin to tell you how much i like you  i do more than like you  i admire and respect you  you are magnificent and you are magnificently good  but whats the use of words  yet theres something id like to do  youve had a hard life let me make it easy for you  a joyous light welled into her eyes then faded out again  im pretty sure of getting hold of some money soonlots of it  in that moment he abandoned the idea of the valley and the bay the grass walled castle and the trim white schooner  after all what did it matter  he could go away as he had done so often before the mast on any ship bound anywhere  id like to turn it over to you  there must be something you wantto go to school or business college  you might like to study and be a stenographer  i could fix it for you  or maybe your father and mother are livingi could set them up in a grocery store or something  anything you want just name it and i can fix it for you  she made no reply but sat gazing straight before her dryeyed and motionless but with an ache in the throat which martin divined so strongly that it made his own throat ache  he regretted that he had spoken  it seemed so tawdry what he had offered hermere moneycompared with what she offered him  he offered her an extraneous thing with which he could part without a pang while she offered him herself along with disgrace and shame and sin and all her hopes of heaven  dont lets talk about it she said with a catch in her voice that she changed to a cough  she stood up  come on lets go home  im all tired out  the day was done and the merrymakers had nearly all departed  but as martin and lizzie emerged from the trees they found the gang waiting for them  martin knew immediately the meaning of it  trouble was brewing the gang was his bodyguard  they passed out through the gates of the park with straggling in the rear a second gang the friends that lizzies young man had collected to avenge the loss of his lady  several constables and special police officers anticipating trouble trailed along to prevent it and herded the two gangs separately aboard the train for san francisco  martin told jimmy that he would get off at sixteenth street station and catch the electric car into oakland  lizzie was very quiet and without interest in what was impending  the train pulled in to sixteenth street station and the waiting electric car could be seen the conductor of which was impatiently clanging the gong  there she is jimmy counselled  make a run for it an well hold em back  now you go  hit her up  the hostile gang was temporarily disconcerted by the manoeuvre then it dashed from the train in pursuit  the staid and sober oakland folk who sat upon the car scarcely noted the young fellow and the girl who ran for it and found a seat in front on the outside  they did not connect the couple with jimmy who sprang on the steps crying to the motorman  slam on the juice old man and beat it outa here  the next moment jimmy whirled about and the passengers saw him land his fist on the face of a running man who was trying to board the car  but fists were landing on faces the whole length of the car  thus jimmy and his gang strung out on the long lower steps met the attacking gang the car started with a great clanging of its gong and as jimmys gang drove off the last assailants they too jumped off to finish the job the car dashed on leaving the flurry of combat far behind and its dumfounded passengers never dreamed that the quiet young man and the pretty workinggirl sitting in the corner on the outside seat had been the cause of the row  martin had enjoyed the fight with a recrudescence of the old fighting thrills  but they quickly died away and he was oppressed by a great sadness  he felt very oldcenturies older than those careless care free young companions of his others days  he had travelled far too far to go back  their mode of life which had once been his was now distasteful to him  he was disappointed in it all  he had developed into an alien  as the steam beer had tasted raw so their companionship seemed raw to him  he was too far removed  too many thousands of opened books yawned between them and him  he had exiled himself  he had travelled in the vast realm of intellect until he could no longer return home  on the other hand he was human and his gregarious need for companionship remained unsatisfied  he had found no new home  as the gang could not understand him as his own family could not understand him as the bourgeoisie could not understand him so this girl beside him whom he honored high could not understand him nor the honor he paid her  his sadness was not untouched with bitterness as he thought it over  make it up with him he advised lizzie at parting as they stood in front of the workingmans shack in which she lived near sixth and market  he referred to the young fellow whose place he had usurped that day  i cantnow she said  oh go on he said jovially  all you have to do is whistle and hell come running  i didnt mean that she said simply  and he knew what she had meant  she leaned toward him as he was about to say good night  but she leaned not imperatively not seductively but wistfully and humbly  he was touched to the heart  his large tolerance rose up in him  he put his arms around her and kissed her and knew that upon his own lips rested as true a kiss as man ever received  my god she sobbed  i could die for you  i could die for you  she tore herself from him suddenly and ran up the steps  he felt a quick moisture in his eyes  martin eden he communed  youre not a brute and youre a damn poor nietzscheman  youd marry her if you could and fill her quivering heart full with happiness  but you cant you cant  and its a damn shame  a poor old tramp explains his poor old ulcers he muttered remembering his henly  life is i think a blunder and a shame  it isa blunder and a shame     chapter xliii   the shame of the sun was published in october  as martin cut the cords of the express package and the halfdozen complimentary copies from the publishers spilled out on the table a heavy sadness fell upon him  he thought of the wild delight that would have been his had this happened a few short months before and he contrasted that delight that should have been with his present uncaring coldness  his book his first book and his pulse had not gone up a fraction of a beat and he was only sad  it meant little to him now  the most it meant was that it might bring some money and little enough did he care for money  he carried a copy out into the kitchen and presented it to maria  i did it he explained in order to clear up her bewilderment  i wrote it in the room there and i guess some few quarts of your vegetable soup went into the making of it  keep it  its yours  just to remember me by you know  he was not bragging not showing off  his sole motive was to make her happy to make her proud of him to justify her long faith in him  she put the book in the front room on top of the family bible  a sacred thing was this book her lodger had made a fetich of friendship  it softened the blow of his having been a laundryman and though she could not understand a line of it she knew that every line of it was great she was a simple practical hardworking woman but she possessed faith in large endowment  just as emotionlessly as he had received the shame of the sun did he read the reviews of it that came in weekly from the clipping bureau  the book was making a hit that was evident  it meant more gold in the money sack  he could fix up lizzie redeem all his promises and still have enough left to build his grasswalled castle  singletree darnley  co had cautiously brought out an edition of fifteen hundred copies but the first reviews had started a second edition of twice the size through the presses and ere this was delivered a third edition of five thousand had been ordered  a london firm made arrangements by cable for an english edition and hotfooted upon this came the news of french german and scandinavian translations in progress  the attack upon the maeterlinck school could not have been made at a more opportune moment  a fierce controversy was precipitated saleeby and haeckel indorsed and defended the shame of the sun for once finding themselves on the same side of a question  crookes and wallace ranged up on the opposing side while sir oliver lodge attempted to formulate a compromise that would jibe with his particular cosmic theories  maeterlincks followers rallied around the standard of mysticism  chesterton set the whole world laughing with a series of alleged nonpartisan essays on the subject and the whole affair controversy and controversialists was wellnigh swept into the pit by a thundering broadside from george bernard shaw  needless to say the arena was crowded with hosts of lesser lights and the dust and sweat and din became terrific  it is a most marvellous happening singletree darnley  co wrote martin a critical philosophic essay selling like a novel  you could not have chosen your subject better and all contributory factors have been unwarrantedly propitious  we need scarcely to assure you that we are making hay while the sun shines  over forty thousand copies have already been sold in the united states and canada and a new edition of twenty thousand is on the presses  we are overworked trying to supply the demand  nevertheless we have helped to create that demand  we have already spent five thousand dollars in advertising  the book is bound to be a recordbreaker  please find herewith a contract in duplicate for your next book which we have taken the liberty of forwarding to you  you will please note that we have increased your royalties to twenty per cent which is about as high as a conservative publishing house dares go  if our offer is agreeable to you please fill in the proper blank space with the title of your book  we make no stipulations concerning its nature  any book on any subject  if you have one already written so much the better  now is the time to strike  the iron could not be hotter  on receipt of signed contract we shall be pleased to make you an advance on royalties of five thousand dollars  you see we have faith in you and we are going in on this thing big  we should like also to discuss with you the drawing up of a contract for a term of years say ten during which we shall have the exclusive right of publishing in bookform all that you produce  but more of this anon  martin laid down the letter and worked a problem in mental arithmetic finding the product of fifteen cents times sixty thousand to be nine thousand dollars  he signed the new contract inserting the smoke of joy in the blank space and mailed it back to the publishers along with the twenty storiettes he had written in the days before he discovered the formula for the newspaper storiette  and promptly as the united states mail could deliver and return came singletree darnley  cos check for five thousand dollars  i want you to come down town with me maria this afternoon about two oclock martin said the morning the check arrived  or better meet me at fourteenth and broadway at two oclock  ill be looking out for you  at the appointed time she was there but shoes was the only clew to the mystery her mind had been capable of evolving and she suffered a distinct shock of disappointment when martin walked her right by a shoe store and dived into a real estate office  what happened thereupon resided forever after in her memory as a dream  fine gentlemen smiled at her benevolently as they talked with martin and one another a typewriter clicked signatures were affixed to an imposing document her own landlord was there too and affixed his signature and when all was over and she was outside on the sidewalk her landlord spoke to her saying well maria you wont have to pay me no seven dollars and a half this month  maria was too stunned for speech  or next month or the next or the next her landlord said  she thanked him incoherently as if for a favor  and it was not until she had returned home to north oakland and conferred with her own kind and had the portuguese grocer investigate that she really knew that she was the owner of the little house in which she had lived and for which she had paid rent so long  why dont you trade with me no more the portuguese grocer asked martin that evening stepping out to hail him when he got off the car and martin explained that he wasnt doing his own cooking any more and then went in and had a drink of wine on the house  he noted it was the best wine the grocer had in stock  maria martin announced that night im going to leave you  and youre going to leave here yourself soon  then you can rent the house and be a landlord yourself  youve a brother in san leandro or haywards and hes in the milk business  i want you to send all your washing back unwashedunderstandunwashed and to go out to san leandro tomorrow or haywards or wherever it is and see that brother of yours  tell him to come to see me  ill be stopping at the metropole down in oakland hell know a good milkranch when he sees one  and so it was that maria became a landlord and the sole owner of a dairy with two hired men to do the work for her and a bank account that steadily increased despite the fact that her whole brood wore shoes and went to school  few persons ever meet the fairy princes they dream about but maria who worked hard and whose head was hard never dreaming about fairy princes entertained hers in the guise of an exlaundryman  in the meantime the world had begun to ask who is this martin eden  he had declined to give any biographical data to his publishers but the newspapers were not to be denied  oakland was his own town and the reporters nosed out scores of individuals who could supply information all that he was and was not all that he had done and most of what he had not done was spread out for the delectation of the public accompanied by snapshots and photographsthe latter procured from the local photographer who had once taken martins picture and who promptly copyrighted it and put it on the market  at first so great was his disgust with the magazines and all bourgeois society martin fought against publicity but in the end because it was easier than not to he surrendered  he found that he could not refuse himself to the special writers who travelled long distances to see him  then again each day was so many hours long and since he no longer was occupied with writing and studying those hours had to be occupied somehow so he yielded to what was to him a whim permitted interviews gave his opinions on literature and philosophy and even accepted invitations of the bourgeoisie  he had settled down into a strange and comfortable state of mind  he no longer cared  he forgave everybody even the cub reporter who had painted him red and to whom he now granted a full page with specially posed photographs  he saw lizzie occasionally and it was patent that she regretted the greatness that had come to him  it widened the space between them perhaps it was with the hope of narrowing it that she yielded to his persuasions to go to night school and business college and to have herself gowned by a wonderful dressmaker who charged outrageous prices she improved visibly from day to day until martin wondered if he was doing right for he knew that all her compliance and endeavor was for his sake  she was trying to make herself of worth in his eyesof the sort of worth he seemed to value  yet he gave her no hope treating her in brotherly fashion and rarely seeing her  overdue was rushed upon the market by the meredithlowell company in the height of his popularity and being fiction in point of sales it made even a bigger strike than the shame of the sun  week after week his was the credit of the unprecedented performance of having two books at the head of the list of bestsellers  not only did the story take with the fictionreaders but those who read the shame of the sun with avidity were likewise attracted to the seastory by the cosmic grasp of mastery with which he had handled it  first he had attacked the literature of mysticism and had done it exceeding well and next he had successfully supplied the very literature he had exposited thus proving himself to be that rare genius a critic and a creator in one  money poured in on him fame poured in on him he flashed cometlike through the world of literature and he was more amused than interested by the stir he was making  one thing was puzzling him a little thing that would have puzzled the world had it known  but the world would have puzzled over his bepuzzlement rather than over the little thing that to him loomed gigantic  judge blount invited him to dinner  that was the little thing or the beginning of the little thing that was soon to become the big thing  he had insulted judge blount treated him abominably and judge blount meeting him on the street invited him to dinner  martin bethought himself of the numerous occasions on which he had met judge blount at the morses and when judge blount had not invited him to dinner  why had he not invited him to dinner then he asked himself  he had not changed  he was the same martin eden  what made the difference  the fact that the stuff he had written had appeared inside the covers of books  but it was work performed  it was not something he had done since  it was achievement accomplished at the very time judge blount was sharing this general view and sneering at his spencer and his intellect  therefore it was not for any real value but for a purely fictitious value that judge blount invited him to dinner  martin grinned and accepted the invitation marvelling the while at his complacence  and at the dinner where with their womankind were half a dozen of those that sat in high places and where martin found himself quite the lion judge blount warmly seconded by judge hanwell urged privately that martin should permit his name to be put up for the styxthe ultraselect club to which belonged not the mere men of wealth but the men of attainment  and martin declined and was more puzzled than ever  he was kept busy disposing of his heap of manuscripts  he was overwhelmed by requests from editors  it had been discovered that he was a stylist with meat under his style  the northern review after publishing the cradle of beauty had written him for half a dozen similar essays which would have been supplied out of the heap had not burtons magazine in a speculative mood offered him five hundred dollars each for five essays  he wrote back that he would supply the demand but at a thousand dollars an essay  he remembered that all these manuscripts had been refused by the very magazines that were now clamoring for them  and their refusals had been coldblooded automatic stereotyped  they had made him sweat and now he intended to make them sweat  burtons magazine paid his price for five essays and the remaining four at the same rate were snapped up by mackintoshs monthly the northern review being too poor to stand the pace  thus went out to the world the high priests of mystery the wonderdreamers the yardstick of the ego philosophy of illusion god and clod art and biology critics and testtubes stardust and the dignity of usuryto raise storms and rumblings and mutterings that were many a day in dying down  editors wrote to him telling him to name his own terms which he did but it was always for work performed  he refused resolutely to pledge himself to any new thing  the thought of again setting pen to paper maddened him  he had seen brissenden torn to pieces by the crowd and despite the fact that him the crowd acclaimed he could not get over the shock nor gather any respect for the crowd  his very popularity seemed a disgrace and a treason to brissenden  it made him wince but he made up his mind to go on and fill the moneybag  he received letters from editors like the following about a year ago we were unfortunate enough to refuse your collection of lovepoems  we were greatly impressed by them at the time but certain arrangements already entered into prevented our taking them  if you still have them and if you will be kind enough to forward them we shall be glad to publish the entire collection on your own terms  we are also prepared to make a most advantageous offer for bringing them out in bookform  martin recollected his blankverse tragedy and sent it instead  he read it over before mailing and was particularly impressed by its sophomoric amateurishness and general worthlessness  but he sent it and it was published to the everlasting regret of the editor  the public was indignant and incredulous  it was too far a cry from martin edens high standard to that serious bosh  it was asserted that he had never written it that the magazine had faked it very clumsily or that martin eden was emulating the elder dumas and at the height of success was hiring his writing done for him  but when he explained that the tragedy was an early effort of his literary childhood and that the magazine had refused to be happy unless it got it a great laugh went up at the magazines expense and a change in the editorship followed  the tragedy was never brought out in bookform though martin pocketed the advance royalties that had been paid  colemans weekly sent martin a lengthy telegram costing nearly three hundred dollars offering him a thousand dollars an article for twenty articles  he was to travel over the united states with all expenses paid and select whatever topics interested him  the body of the telegram was devoted to hypothetical topics in order to show him the freedom of range that was to be his  the only restriction placed upon him was that he must confine himself to the united states  martin sent his inability to accept and his regrets by wire collect  wikiwiki published in warrens monthly was an instantaneous success it was brought out forward in a widemargined beautifully decorated volume that struck the holiday trade and sold like wildfire  the critics were unanimous in the belief that it would take its place with those two classics by two great writers the bottle imp and the magic skin  the public however received the smoke of joy collection rather dubiously and coldly  the audacity and unconventionality of the storiettes was a shock to bourgeois morality and prejudice but when paris went mad over the immediate translation that was made the american and english reading public followed suit and bought so many copies that martin compelled the conservative house of singletree darnley  co to pay a flat royalty of twentyfive per cent for a third book and thirty per cent flat for a fourth  these two volumes comprised all the short stories he had written and which had received or were receiving serial publication  the ring of bells and his horror stories constituted one collection the other collection was composed of adventure the pot the wine of life the whirlpool the jostling street and four other stories  the lowellmeredith company captured the collection of all his essays and the maxmillian company got his sea lyrics and the lovecycle the latter receiving serial publication in the ladies home companion after the payment of an extortionate price  martin heaved a sigh of relief when he had disposed of the last manuscript  the grasswalled castle and the white coppered schooner were very near to him  well at any rate he had discovered brissendens contention that nothing of merit found its way into the magazines  his own success demonstrated that brissenden had been wrong  and yet somehow he had a feeling that brissenden had been right after all  the shame of the sun had been the cause of his success more than the stuff he had written  that stuff had been merely incidental  it had been rejected right and left by the magazines  the publication of the shame of the sun had started a controversy and precipitated the landslide in his favor  had there been no shame of the sun there would have been no landslide and had there been no miracle in the go of the shame of the sun there would have been no landslide  singletree darnley  co attested that miracle  they had brought out a first edition of fifteen hundred copies and been dubious of selling it  they were experienced publishers and no one had been more astounded than they at the success which had followed  to them it had been in truth a miracle  they never got over it and every letter they wrote him reflected their reverent awe of that first mysterious happening  they did not attempt to explain it  there was no explaining it  it had happened  in the face of all experience to the contrary it had happened  so it was reasoning thus that martin questioned the validity of his popularity  it was the bourgeoisie that bought his books and poured its gold into his moneysack and from what little he knew of the bourgeoisie it was not clear to him how it could possibly appreciate or comprehend what he had written  his intrinsic beauty and power meant nothing to the hundreds of thousands who were acclaiming him and buying his books  he was the fad of the hour the adventurer who had stormed parnassus while the gods nodded  the hundreds of thousands read him and acclaimed him with the same brute nonunderstanding with which they had flung themselves on brissendens ephemera and torn it to piecesa wolfrabble that fawned on him instead of fanging him  fawn or fang it was all a matter of chance  one thing he knew with absolute certitude ephemera was infinitely greater than anything he had done  it was infinitely greater than anything he had in him  it was a poem of centuries  then the tribute the mob paid him was a sorry tribute indeed for that same mob had wallowed ephemera into the mire  he sighed heavily and with satisfaction  he was glad the last manuscript was sold and that he would soon be done with it all     chapter xliv   mr morse met martin in the office of the hotel metropole  whether he had happened there just casually intent on other affairs or whether he had come there for the direct purpose of inviting him to dinner martin never could quite make up his mind though he inclined toward the second hypothesis  at any rate invited to dinner he was by mr morseruths father who had forbidden him the house and broken off the engagement  martin was not angry  he was not even on his dignity  he tolerated mr morse wondering the while how it felt to eat such humble pie  he did not decline the invitation  instead he put it off with vagueness and indefiniteness and inquired after the family particularly after mrs morse and ruth  he spoke her name without hesitancy naturally though secretly surprised that he had had no inward quiver no old familiar increase of pulse and warm surge of blood  he had many invitations to dinner some of which he accepted  persons got themselves introduced to him in order to invite him to dinner  and he went on puzzling over the little thing that was becoming a great thing  bernard higginbotham invited him to dinner  he puzzled the harder  he remembered the days of his desperate starvation when no one invited him to dinner  that was the time he needed dinners and went weak and faint for lack of them and lost weight from sheer famine  that was the paradox of it  when he wanted dinners no one gave them to him and now that he could buy a hundred thousand dinners and was losing his appetite dinners were thrust upon him right and left  but why  there was no justice in it no merit on his part  he was no different  all the work he had done was even at that time work performed  mr and mrs morse had condemned him for an idler and a shirk and through ruth had urged that he take a clerks position in an office  furthermore they had been aware of his work performed  manuscript after manuscript of his had been turned over to them by ruth  they had read them  it was the very same work that had put his name in all the papers and it was his name being in all the papers that led them to invite him  one thing was certain the morses had not cared to have him for himself or for his work  therefore they could not want him now for himself or for his work but for the fame that was his because he was somebody amongst men andwhy notbecause he had a hundred thousand dollars or so  that was the way bourgeois society valued a man and who was he to expect it otherwise  but he was proud  he disdained such valuation  he desired to be valued for himself or for his work which after all was an expression of himself  that was the way lizzie valued him  the work with her did not even count  she valued him himself  that was the way jimmy the plumber and all the old gang valued him  that had been proved often enough in the days when he ran with them it had been proved that sunday at shell mound park  his work could go hang  what they liked and were willing to scrap for was just mart eden one of the bunch and a pretty good guy  then there was ruth  she had liked him for himself that was indisputable  and yet much as she had liked him she had liked the bourgeois standard of valuation more  she had opposed his writing and principally it seemed to him because it did not earn money  that had been her criticism of his lovecycle  she too had urged him to get a job  it was true she refined it to position but it meant the same thing and in his own mind the old nomenclature stuck  he had read her all that he wrotepoems stories essayswikiwiki the shame of the sun everything  and she had always and consistently urged him to get a job to go to workgood godas if he hadnt been working robbing sleep exhausting life in order to be worthy of her  so the little thing grew bigger  he was healthy and normal ate regularly slept long hours and yet the growing little thing was becoming an obsession  work performed  the phrase haunted his brain  he sat opposite bernard higginbotham at a heavy sunday dinner over higginbothams cash store and it was all he could do to restrain himself from shouting out  it was work performed  and now you feed me when then you let me starve forbade me your house and damned me because i wouldnt get a job  and the work was already done all done  and now when i speak you check the thought unuttered on your lips and hang on my lips and pay respectful attention to whatever i choose to say  i tell you your party is rotten and filled with grafters and instead of flying into a rage you hum and haw and admit there is a great deal in what i say  and why because im famous because ive a lot of money  not because im martin eden a pretty good fellow and not particularly a fool  i could tell you the moon is made of green cheese and you would subscribe to the notion at least you would not repudiate it because ive got dollars mountains of them  and it was all done long ago it was work performed i tell you when you spat upon me as the dirt under your feet  but martin did not shout out  the thought gnawed in his brain an unceasing torment while he smiled and succeeded in being tolerant  as he grew silent bernard higginbotham got the reins and did the talking he was a success himself and proud of it  he was selfmade  no one had helped him  he owed no man  he was fulfilling his duty as a citizen and bringing up a large family  and there was higginbothams cash store that monument of his own industry and ability  he loved higginbothams cash store as some men loved their wives  he opened up his heart to martin showed with what keenness and with what enormous planning he had made the store  and he had plans for it ambitious plans  the neighborhood was growing up fast  the store was really too small  if he had more room he would be able to put in a score of laborsaving and moneysaving improvements  and he would do it yet  he was straining every effort for the day when he could buy the adjoining lot and put up another twostory frame building  the upstairs he could rent and the whole groundfloor of both buildings would be higginbothams cash store his eyes glistened when he spoke of the new sign that would stretch clear across both buildings  martin forgot to listen  the refrain of work performed in his own brain was drowning the others clatter  the refrain maddened him and he tried to escape from it  how much did you say it would cost he asked suddenly  his brotherinlaw paused in the middle of an expatiation on the business opportunities of the neighborhood  he hadnt said how much it would cost  but he knew  he had figured it out a score of times  at the way lumber is now he said four thousand could do it  including the sign  i didnt count on that  itd just have to come onct the buildin was there  and the ground  three thousand more  he leaned forward licking his lips nervously spreading and closing his fingers while he watched martin write a check  when it was passed over to him he glanced at the amountseven thousand dollars  ii cant afford to pay more than six per cent he said huskily  martin wanted to laugh but instead demanded  how much would that be  lemme see  six per centsix times sevenfour hundred an twenty  that would be thirtyfive dollars a month wouldnt it  higginbotham nodded  then if youve no objection well arrange it this way  martin glanced at gertrude  you can have the principal to keep for yourself if youll use the thirtyfive dollars a month for cooking and washing and scrubbing  the seven thousand is yours if youll guarantee that gertrude does no more drudgery  is it a go  mr higginbotham swallowed hard  that his wife should do no more housework was an affront to his thrifty soul  the magnificent present was the coating of a pill a bitter pill  that his wife should not work it gagged him  all right then martin said  ill pay the thirtyfive a month and  he reached across the table for the check  but bernard higginbotham got his hand on it first crying  i accept  i accept  when martin got on the electric car he was very sick and tired  he looked up at the assertive sign  the swine he groaned  the swine the swine  when mackintoshs magazine published the palmist featuring it with decorations by berthier and with two pictures by wenn hermann von schmidt forgot that he had called the verses obscene  he announced that his wife had inspired the poem saw to it that the news reached the ears of a reporter and submitted to an interview by a staff writer who was accompanied by a staff photographer and a staff artist  the result was a full page in a sunday supplement filled with photographs and idealized drawings of marian with many intimate details of martin eden and his family and with the full text of the palmist in large type and republished by special permission of mackintoshs magazine  it caused quite a stir in the neighborhood and good housewives were proud to have the acquaintances of the great writers sister while those who had not made haste to cultivate it  hermann von schmidt chuckled in his little repair shop and decided to order a new lathe  better than advertising he told marian and it costs nothing  wed better have him to dinner she suggested  and to dinner martin came making himself agreeable with the fat wholesale butcher and his fatter wifeimportant folk they likely to be of use to a rising young man like hermann von schmidt  no less a bait however had been required to draw them to his house than his great brotherinlaw  another man at table who had swallowed the same bait was the superintendent of the pacific coast agencies for the asa bicycle company  him von schmidt desired to please and propitiate because from him could be obtained the oakland agency for the bicycle  so hermann von schmidt found it a goodly asset to have martin for a brotherinlaw but in his heart of hearts he couldnt understand where it all came in  in the silent watches of the night while his wife slept he had floundered through martins books and poems and decided that the world was a fool to buy them  and in his heart of hearts martin understood the situation only too well as he leaned back and gloated at von schmidts head in fancy punching it wellnigh off of him sending blow after blow home just rightthe chuckleheaded dutchman  one thing he did like about him however  poor as he was and determined to rise as he was he nevertheless hired one servant to take the heavy work off of marians hands  martin talked with the superintendent of the asa agencies and after dinner he drew him aside with hermann whom he backed financially for the best bicycle store with fittings in oakland  he went further and in a private talk with hermann told him to keep his eyes open for an automobile agency and garage for there was no reason that he should not be able to run both establishments successfully  with tears in her eyes and her arms around his neck marian at parting told martin how much she loved him and always had loved him  it was true there was a perceptible halt midway in her assertion which she glossed over with more tears and kisses and incoherent stammerings and which martin inferred to be her appeal for forgiveness for the time she had lacked faith in him and insisted on his getting a job  he cant never keep his money thats sure hermann von schmidt confided to his wife  he got mad when i spoke of interest an he said damn the principal and if i mentioned it again hed punch my dutch head off  thats what he saidmy dutch head  but hes all right even if he aint no business man  hes given me my chance an hes all right  invitations to dinner poured in on martin and the more they poured the more he puzzled  he sat the guest of honor at an arden club banquet with men of note whom he had heard about and read about all his life and they told him how when they had read the ring of bells in the transcontinental and the peri and the pearl in the hornet they had immediately picked him for a winner  my god and i was hungry and in rags he thought to himself  why didnt you give me a dinner then  then was the time  it was work performed  if you are feeding me now for work performed why did you not feed me then when i needed it  not one word in the ring of bells nor in the peri and the pearl has been changed no youre not feeding me now for work performed  you are feeding me because everybody else is feeding me and because it is an honor to feed me  you are feeding me now because you are herd animals because you are part of the mob because the one blind automatic thought in the mobmind just now is to feed me  and where does martin eden and the work martin eden performed come in in all this he asked himself plaintively then arose to respond cleverly and wittily to a clever and witty toast  so it went  wherever he happened to beat the press club at the redwood club at pink teas and literary gatheringsalways were remembered the ring of bells and the peri and the pearl when they were first published  and always was martins maddening and unuttered demand why didnt you feed me then  it was work performed  the ring of bells and the peri and the pearl are not changed one iota  they were just as artistic just as worth while then as now  but you are not feeding me for their sake nor for the sake of anything else i have written  youre feeding me because it is the style of feeding just now because the whole mob is crazy with the idea of feeding martin eden  and often at such times he would abruptly see slouch in among the company a young hoodlum in squarecut coat and under a stiffrim stetson hat  it happened to him at the gallina society in oakland one afternoon as he rose from his chair and stepped forward across the platform he saw stalk through the wide door at the rear of the great room the young hoodlum with the squarecut coat and stiffrim hat  five hundred fashionably gowned women turned their heads so intent and steadfast was martins gaze to see what he was seeing  but they saw only the empty centre aisle  he saw the young tough lurching down that aisle and wondered if he would remove the stiffrim which never yet had he seen him without  straight down the aisle he came and up the platform  martin could have wept over that youthful shade of himself when he thought of all that lay before him  across the platform he swaggered right up to martin and into the foreground of martins consciousness disappeared the five hundred women applauded softly with gloved hands seeking to encourage the bashful great man who was their guest  and martin shook the vision from his brain smiled and began to speak  the superintendent of schools good old man stopped martin on the street and remembered him recalling seances in his office when martin was expelled from school for fighting  i read your ring of bells in one of the magazines quite a time ago he said  it was as good as poe  splendid i said at the time splendid  yes and twice in the months that followed you passed me on the street and did not know me martin almost said aloud  each time i was hungry and heading for the pawnbroker  yet it was work performed  you did not know me then  why do you know me now  i was remarking to my wife only the other day the other was saying wouldnt it be a good idea to have you out to dinner some time  and she quite agreed with me  yes she quite agreed with me  dinner martin said so sharply that it was almost a snarl  why yes yes dinner you knowjust pot luck with us with your old superintendent you rascal he uttered nervously poking martin in an attempt at jocular fellowship  martin went down the street in a daze  he stopped at the corner and looked about him vacantly  well ill be damned he murmured at last  the old fellow was afraid of me     chapter xlv   kreis came to martin one daykreis of the real dirt and martin turned to him with relief to receive the glowing details of a scheme sufficiently wildcatty to interest him as a fictionist rather than an investor  kreis paused long enough in the midst of his exposition to tell him that in most of his shame of the sun he had been a chump  but i didnt come here to spout philosophy kreis went on  what i want to know is whether or not you will put a thousand dollars in on this deal  no im not chump enough for that at any rate martin answered  but ill tell you what i will do  you gave me the greatest night of my life you gave me what money cannot buy  now ive got money and it means nothing to me  id like to turn over to you a thousand dollars of what i dont value for what you gave me that night and which was beyond price you need the money  ive got more than i need  you want it  you came for it  theres no use scheming it out of me  take it  kreis betrayed no surprise  he folded the check away in his pocket  at that rate id like the contract of providing you with many such nights he said  too late  martin shook his head  that night was the one night for me  i was in paradise  its commonplace with you i know  but it wasnt to me  i shall never live at such a pitch again  im done with philosophy  i want never to hear another word of it  the first dollar i ever made in my life out of my philosophy kreis remarked as he paused in the doorway  and then the market broke  mrs morse drove by martin on the street one day and smiled and nodded he smiled back and lifted his hat  the episode did not affect him  a month before it might have disgusted him or made him curious and set him to speculating about her state of consciousness at that moment  but now it was not provocative of a second thought  he forgot about it the next moment  he forgot about it as he would have forgotten the central bank building or the city hall after having walked past them  yet his mind was preternaturally active  his thoughts went ever around and around in a circle  the centre of that circle was work performed it ate at his brain like a deathless maggot  he awoke to it in the morning  it tormented his dreams at night  every affair of life around him that penetrated through his senses immediately related itself to work performed  he drove along the path of relentless logic to the conclusion that he was nobody nothing  mart eden the hoodlum and mart eden the sailor had been real had been he but martin eden the famous writer did not exist  martin eden the famous writer was a vapor that had arisen in the mobmind and by the mobmind had been thrust into the corporeal being of mart eden the hoodlum and sailor  but it couldnt fool him  he was not that sunmyth that the mob was worshipping and sacrificing dinners to  he knew better  he read the magazines about himself and pored over portraits of himself published therein until he was unable to associate his identity with those portraits  he was the fellow who had lived and thrilled and loved who had been easygoing and tolerant of the frailties of life who had served in the forecastle wandered in strange lands and led his gang in the old fighting days  he was the fellow who had been stunned at first by the thousands of books in the free library and who had afterward learned his way among them and mastered them he was the fellow who had burned the midnight oil and bedded with a spur and written books himself but the one thing he was not was that colossal appetite that all the mob was bent upon feeding  there were things however in the magazines that amused him  all the magazines were claiming him  warrens monthly advertised to its subscribers that it was always on the quest after new writers and that among others it had introduced martin eden to the reading public  the white mouse claimed him so did the northern review and mackintoshs magazine until silenced by the globe which pointed triumphantly to its files where the mangled sea lyrics lay buried  youth and age which had come to life again after having escaped paying its bills put in a prior claim which nobody but farmers children ever read  the transcontinental made a dignified and convincing statement of how it first discovered martin eden which was warmly disputed by the hornet with the exhibit of the peri and the pearl  the modest claim of singletree darnley  co was lost in the din  besides that publishing firm did not own a magazine wherewith to make its claim less modest  the newspapers calculated martins royalties  in some way the magnificent offers certain magazines had made him leaked out and oakland ministers called upon him in a friendly way while professional begging letters began to clutter his mail  but worse than all this were the women  his photographs were published broadcast and special writers exploited his strong bronzed face his scars his heavy shoulders his clear quiet eyes and the slight hollows in his cheeks like an ascetics  at this last he remembered his wild youth and smiled  often among the women he met he would see now one now another looking at him appraising him selecting him  he laughed to himself  he remembered brissendens warning and laughed again  the women would never destroy him that much was certain  he had gone past that stage  once walking with lizzie toward night school she caught a glance directed toward him by a wellgowned handsome woman of the bourgeoisie the glance was a trifle too long a shade too considerative  lizzie knew it for what it was and her body tensed angrily  martin noticed noticed the cause of it told her how used he was becoming to it and that he did not care anyway  you ought to care she answered with blazing eyes  youre sick thats whats the matter  never healthier in my life  i weigh five pounds more than i ever did  it aint your body  its your head  somethings wrong with your think machine  even i can see that an i aint nobody  he walked on beside her reflecting  id give anything to see you get over it she broke out impulsively you ought to care when women look at you that way a man like you  its not natural  its all right enough for sissyboys  but you aint made that way  so help me id be willing an glad if the right woman came along an made you care  when he left lizzie at night school he returned to the metropole  once in his rooms he dropped into a morris chair and sat staring straight before him  he did not doze  nor did he think  his mind was a blank save for the intervals when unsummoned memory pictures took form and color and radiance just under his eyelids  he saw these pictures but he was scarcely conscious of themno more so than if they had been dreams  yet he was not asleep  once he roused himself and glanced at his watch  it was just eight oclock  he had nothing to do and it was too early for bed  then his mind went blank again and the pictures began to form and vanish under his eyelids  there was nothing distinctive about the pictures  they were always masses of leaves and shrublike branches shot through with hot sunshine  a knock at the door aroused him  he was not asleep and his mind immediately connected the knock with a telegram or letter or perhaps one of the servants bringing back clean clothes from the laundry  he was thinking about joe and wondering where he was as he said come in  he was still thinking about joe and did not turn toward the door  he heard it close softly  there was a long silence  he forgot that there had been a knock at the door and was still staring blankly before him when he heard a womans sob  it was involuntary spasmodic checked and stifledhe noted that as he turned about  the next instant he was on his feet  ruth he said amazed and bewildered  her face was white and strained  she stood just inside the door one hand against it for support the other pressed to her side  she extended both hands toward him piteously and started forward to meet him  as he caught her hands and led her to the morris chair he noticed how cold they were  he drew up another chair and sat down on the broad arm of it  he was too confused to speak  in his own mind his affair with ruth was closed and sealed  he felt much in the same way that he would have felt had the shelly hot springs laundry suddenly invaded the hotel metropole with a whole weeks washing ready for him to pitch into  several times he was about to speak and each time he hesitated  no one knows i am here ruth said in a faint voice with an appealing smile  what did you say  he was surprised at the sound of his own voice  she repeated her words  oh he said then wondered what more he could possibly say  i saw you come in and i waited a few minutes  oh he said again  he had never been so tonguetied in his life  positively he did not have an idea in his head  he felt stupid and awkward but for the life of him he could think of nothing to say  it would have been easier had the intrusion been the shelly hot springs laundry  he could have rolled up his sleeves and gone to work  and then you came in he said finally  she nodded with a slightly arch expression and loosened the scarf at her throat  i saw you first from across the street when you were with that girl  oh yes he said simply  i took her down to night school  well arent you glad to see me she said at the end of another silence  yes yes  he spoke hastily  but wasnt it rash of you to come here  i slipped in  nobody knows i am here  i wanted to see you  i came to tell you i have been very foolish  i came because i could no longer stay away because my heart compelled me to come becausebecause i wanted to come  she came forward out of her chair and over to him  she rested her hand on his shoulder a moment breathing quickly and then slipped into his arms  and in his large easy way desirous of not inflicting hurt knowing that to repulse this proffer of herself was to inflict the most grievous hurt a woman could receive he folded his arms around her and held her close  but there was no warmth in the embrace no caress in the contact  she had come into his arms and he held her that was all  she nestled against him and then with a change of position her hands crept up and rested upon his neck  but his flesh was not fire beneath those hands and he felt awkward and uncomfortable  what makes you tremble so he asked  is it a chill  shall i light the grate  he made a movement to disengage himself but she clung more closely to him shivering violently  it is merely nervousness she said with chattering teeth  ill control myself in a minute  there i am better already  slowly her shivering died away  he continued to hold her but he was no longer puzzled  he knew now for what she had come  my mother wanted me to marry charley hapgood she announced  charley hapgood that fellow who speaks always in platitudes martin groaned  then he added and now i suppose your mother wants you to marry me  he did not put it in the form of a question  he stated it as a certitude and before his eyes began to dance the rows of figures of his royalties  she will not object i know that much ruth said  she considers me quite eligible  ruth nodded  and yet i am not a bit more eligible now than i was when she broke our engagement he meditated  i havent changed any  im the same martin eden though for that matter im a bit worsei smoke now  dont you smell my breath  in reply she pressed her open fingers against his lips placed them graciously and playfully and in expectancy of the kiss that of old had always been a consequence  but there was no caressing answer of martins lips  he waited until the fingers were removed and then went on  i am not changed  i havent got a job  im not looking for a job furthermore i am not going to look for a job  and i still believe that herbert spencer is a great and noble man and that judge blount is an unmitigated ass  i had dinner with him the other night so i ought to know  but you didnt accept fathers invitation she chided  so you know about that  who sent him  your mother  she remained silent  then she did send him  i thought so  and now i suppose she has sent you  no one knows that i am here she protested  do you think my mother would permit this  shed permit you to marry me thats certain  she gave a sharp cry  oh martin dont be cruel  you have not kissed me once  you are as unresponsive as a stone  and think what i have dared to do  she looked about her with a shiver though half the look was curiosity  just think of where i am  i could die for you  i could die for youlizzies words were ringing in his ears  why didnt you dare it before he asked harshly  when i hadnt a job when i was starving  when i was just as i am now as a man as an artist the same martin eden  thats the question ive been propounding to myself for many a daynot concerning you merely but concerning everybody  you see i have not changed though my sudden apparent appreciation in value compels me constantly to reassure myself on that point  ive got the same flesh on my bones the same ten fingers and toes  i am the same  i have not developed any new strength nor virtue my brain is the same old brain  i havent made even one new generalization on literature or philosophy  i am personally of the same value that i was when nobody wanted me  and what is puzzling me is why they want me now  surely they dont want me for myself for myself is the same old self they did not want  then they must want me for something else for something that is outside of me for something that is not i  shall i tell you what that something is  it is for the recognition i have received  that recognition is not i  it resides in the minds of others  then again for the money i have earned and am earning  but that money is not i  it resides in banks and in the pockets of tom dick and harry  and is it for that for the recognition and the money that you now want me  you are breaking my heart she sobbed  you know i love you that i am here because i love you  i am afraid you dont see my point he said gently  what i mean is if you love me how does it happen that you love me now so much more than you did when your love was weak enough to deny me  forget and forgive she cried passionately  i loved you all the time remember that and i am here now in your arms  im afraid i am a shrewd merchant peering into the scales trying to weigh your love and find out what manner of thing it is  she withdrew herself from his arms sat upright and looked at him long and searchingly  she was about to speak then faltered and changed her mind  you see it appears this way to me he went on  when i was all that i am now nobody out of my own class seemed to care for me  when my books were all written no one who had read the manuscripts seemed to care for them  in point of fact because of the stuff i had written they seemed to care even less for me  in writing the stuff it seemed that i had committed acts that were to say the least derogatory  get a job everybody said  she made a movement of dissent  yes yes he said except in your case you told me to get a position the homely word job like much that i have written offends you  it is brutal  but i assure you it was no less brutal to me when everybody i knew recommended it to me as they would recommend right conduct to an immoral creature  but to return  the publication of what i had written and the public notice i received wrought a change in the fibre of your love  martin eden with his work all performed you would not marry your love for him was not strong enough to enable you to marry him  but your love is now strong enough and i cannot avoid the conclusion that its strength arises from the publication and the public notice  in your case i do not mention royalties though i am certain that they apply to the change wrought in your mother and father  of course all this is not flattering to me  but worst of all it makes me question love sacred love  is love so gross a thing that it must feed upon publication and public notice  it would seem so  i have sat and thought upon it till my head went around  poor dear head  she reached up a hand and passed the fingers soothingly through his hair  let it go around no more  let us begin anew now  i loved you all the time  i know that i was weak in yielding to my mothers will  i should not have done so  yet i have heard you speak so often with broad charity of the fallibility and frailty of humankind  extend that charity to me  i acted mistakenly  forgive me  oh i do forgive he said impatiently  it is easy to forgive where there is really nothing to forgive  nothing that you have done requires forgiveness  one acts according to ones lights and more than that one cannot do  as well might i ask you to forgive me for my not getting a job  i meant well she protested  you know that i could not have loved you and not meant well  true but you would have destroyed me out of your wellmeaning  yes yes he shut off her attempted objection  you would have destroyed my writing and my career  realism is imperative to my nature and the bourgeois spirit hates realism  the bourgeoisie is cowardly  it is afraid of life  and all your effort was to make me afraid of life you would have formalized me  you would have compressed me into a twoby four pigeonhole of life where all lifes values are unreal and false and vulgar  he felt her stir protestingly  vulgaritya hearty vulgarity ill admitis the basis of bourgeois refinement and culture as i say you wanted to formalize me to make me over into one of your own class with your classideals classvalues and classprejudices he shook his head sadly  and you do not understand even now what i am saying  my words do not mean to you what i endeavor to make them mean what i say is so much fantasy to you  yet to me it is vital reality  at the best you are a trifle puzzled and amused that this raw boy crawling up out of the mire of the abyss should pass judgment upon your class and call it vulgar  she leaned her head wearily against his shoulder and her body shivered with recurrent nervousness  he waited for a time for her to speak and then went on  and now you want to renew our love  you want us to be married  you want me  and yet listenif my books had not been noticed id nevertheless have been just what i am now  and you would have stayed away  it is all those damned books  dont swear she interrupted  her reproof startled him  he broke into a harsh laugh  thats it he said at a high moment when what seems your lifes happiness is at stake you are afraid of life in the same old wayafraid of life and a healthy oath  she was stung by his words into realization of the puerility of her act and yet she felt that he had magnified it unduly and was consequently resentful  they sat in silence for a long time she thinking desperately and he pondering upon his love which had departed  he knew now that he had not really loved her  it was an idealized ruth he had loved an ethereal creature of his own creating the bright and luminous spirit of his lovepoems  the real bourgeois ruth with all the bourgeois failings and with the hopeless cramp of the bourgeois psychology in her mind he had never loved  she suddenly began to speak  i know that much you have said is so  i have been afraid of life  i did not love you well enough  i have learned to love better  i love you for what you are for what you were for the ways even by which you have become  i love you for the ways wherein you differ from what you call my class for your beliefs which i do not understand but which i know i can come to understand  i shall devote myself to understanding them  and even your smoking and your swearingthey are part of you and i will love you for them too  i can still learn  in the last ten minutes i have learned much  that i have dared to come here is a token of what i have already learned  oh martin  she was sobbing and nestling close against him  for the first time his arms folded her gently and with sympathy and she acknowledged it with a happy movement and a brightening face  it is too late he said  he remembered lizzies words  i am a sick manoh not my body  it is my soul my brain  i seem to have lost all values  i care for nothing  if you had been this way a few months ago it would have been different  it is too late now  it is not too late she cried  i will show you  i will prove to you that my love has grown that it is greater to me than my class and all that is dearest to me  all that is dearest to the bourgeoisie i will flout  i am no longer afraid of life  i will leave my father and mother and let my name become a byword with my friends  i will come to you here and now in free love if you will and i will be proud and glad to be with you  if i have been a traitor to love i will now for loves sake be a traitor to all that made that earlier treason  she stood before him with shining eyes  i am waiting martin she whispered waiting for you to accept me look at me  it was splendid he thought looking at her  she had redeemed herself for all that she had lacked rising up at last true woman superior to the iron rule of bourgeois convention  it was splendid magnificent desperate  and yet what was the matter with him  he was not thrilled nor stirred by what she had done  it was splendid and magnificent only intellectually  in what should have been a moment of fire he coldly appraised her  his heart was untouched  he was unaware of any desire for her  again he remembered lizzies words  i am sick very sick he said with a despairing gesture  how sick i did not know till now  something has gone out of me  i have always been unafraid of life but i never dreamed of being sated with life  life has so filled me that i am empty of any desire for anything  if there were room i should want you now  you see how sick i am  he leaned his head back and closed his eyes and like a child crying that forgets its grief in watching the sunlight percolate through the teardimmed films over the pupils so martin forgot his sickness the presence of ruth everything in watching the masses of vegetation shot through hotly with sunshine that took form and blazed against this background of his eyelids  it was not restful that green foliage  the sunlight was too raw and glaring  it hurt him to look at it and yet he looked he knew not why  he was brought back to himself by the rattle of the doorknob  ruth was at the door  how shall i get out she questioned tearfully  i am afraid  oh forgive me he cried springing to his feet  im not myself you know  i forgot you were here  he put his hand to his head  you see im not just right  ill take you home  we can go out by the servants entrance  no one will see us  pull down that veil and everything will be all right  she clung to his arm through the dimlighted passages and down the narrow stairs  i am safe now she said when they emerged on the sidewalk at the same time starting to take her hand from his arm  no no ill see you home he answered  no please dont she objected  it is unnecessary  again she started to remove her hand  he felt a momentary curiosity  now that she was out of danger she was afraid  she was in almost a panic to be quit of him  he could see no reason for it and attributed it to her nervousness  so he restrained her withdrawing hand and started to walk on with her  halfway down the block he saw a man in a long overcoat shrink back into a doorway  he shot a glance in as he passed by and despite the high turnedup collar he was certain that he recognized ruths brother norman  during the walk ruth and martin held little conversation  she was stunned  he was apathetic  once he mentioned that he was going away back to the south seas and once she asked him to forgive her having come to him  and that was all  the parting at her door was conventional  they shook hands said good night and he lifted his hat the door swung shut and he lighted a cigarette and turned back for his hotel  when he came to the doorway into which he had seen norman shrink he stopped and looked in in a speculative humor  she lied he said aloud  she made believe to me that she had dared greatly and all the while she knew the brother that brought her was waiting to take her back  he burst into laughter  oh these bourgeois  when i was broke i was not fit to be seen with his sister when i have a bank account he brings her to me  as he swung on his heel to go on a tramp going in the same direction begged him over his shoulder  say mister can you give me a quarter to get a bed were the words  but it was the voice that made martin turn around  the next instant he had joe by the hand  dye remember that time we parted at the hot springs the other was saying  i said then wed meet again  i felt it in my bones  an here we are  youre looking good martin said admiringly and youve put on weight  i sure have  joes face was beaming  i never knew what it was to live till i hit hoboin  im thirty pounds heavier an feel tiptop all the time  why i was worked to skin an bone in them old days  hoboin sure agrees with me  but youre looking for a bed just the same martin chided and its a cold night  huh  lookin for a bed  joe shot a hand into his hip pocket and brought it out filled with small change  that beats hard graft he exulted  you just looked good thats why i battered you  martin laughed and gave in  youve several fullsized drunks right there he insinuated  joe slid the money back into his pocket  not in mine he announced  no gettin oryide for me though there aint nothin to stop me except i dont want to  ive ben drunk once since i seen you last an then it was unexpected bein on an empty stomach  when i work like a beast i drink like a beast  when i live like a man i drink like a mana jolt now an again when i feel like it an thats all  martin arranged to meet him next day and went on to the hotel  he paused in the office to look up steamer sailings  the mariposa sailed for tahiti in five days  telephone over tomorrow and reserve a stateroom for me he told the clerk  no deckstateroom but down below on the weathersidethe portside remember that the portside  youd better write it down  once in his room he got into bed and slipped off to sleep as gently as a child  the occurrences of the evening had made no impression on him  his mind was dead to impressions  the glow of warmth with which he met joe had been most fleeting  the succeeding minute he had been bothered by the exlaundrymans presence and by the compulsion of conversation  that in five more days he sailed for his loved south seas meant nothing to him  so he closed his eyes and slept normally and comfortably for eight uninterrupted hours  he was not restless  he did not change his position nor did he dream  sleep had become to him oblivion and each day that he awoke he awoke with regret  life worried and bored him and time was a vexation     chapter xlvi   say joe was his greeting to his oldtime workingmate next morning theres a frenchman out on twentyeighth street  hes made a pot of money and hes going back to france  its a dandy wellappointed small steam laundry  theres a start for you if you want to settle down here take this buy some clothes with it and be at this mans office by ten oclock  he looked up the laundry for me and hell take you out and show you around  if you like it and think it is worth the pricetwelve thousandlet me know and it is yours  now run along  im busy  ill see you later  now look here mart the other said slowly with kindling anger i come here this mornin to see you  savve  i didnt come here to get no laundry  i come a here for a talk for old friends sake and you shove a laundry at me  i tell you what you can do  you can take that laundry an go to hell  he was out of the room when martin caught him and whirled him around  now look here joe he said if you act that way ill punch your head  an for old friends sake ill punch it hard  savveyou will will you  joe had clinched and attempted to throw him and he was twisting and writhing out of the advantage of the others hold  they reeled about the room locked in each others arms and came down with a crash across the splintered wreckage of a wicker chair  joe was underneath with arms spread out and held and with martins knee on his chest  he was panting and gasping for breath when martin released him  now well talk a moment martin said  you cant get fresh with me  i want that laundry business finished first of all  then you can come back and well talk for old sakes sake  i told you i was busy  look at that  a servant had just come in with the morning mail a great mass of letters and magazines  how can i wade through that and talk with you  you go and fix up that laundry and then well get together  all right joe admitted reluctantly  i thought you was turnin me down but i guess i was mistaken  but you cant lick me mart in a standup fight  ive got the reach on you  well put on the gloves sometime and see martin said with a smile  sure as soon as i get that laundry going  joe extended his arm  you see that reach  itll make you go a few  martin heaved a sigh of relief when the door closed behind the laundryman  he was becoming antisocial  daily he found it a severer strain to be decent with people  their presence perturbed him and the effort of conversation irritated him  they made him restless and no sooner was he in contact with them than he was casting about for excuses to get rid of them  he did not proceed to attack his mail and for a half hour he lolled in his chair doing nothing while no more than vague halfformed thoughts occasionally filtered through his intelligence or rather at wide intervals themselves constituted the flickering of his intelligence  he roused himself and began glancing through his mail  there were a dozen requests for autographshe knew them at sight there were professional begging letters and there were letters from cranks ranging from the man with a working model of perpetual motion and the man who demonstrated that the surface of the earth was the inside of a hollow sphere to the man seeking financial aid to purchase the peninsula of lower california for the purpose of communist colonization  there were letters from women seeking to know him and over one such he smiled for enclosed was her receipt for pewrent sent as evidence of her good faith and as proof of her respectability  editors and publishers contributed to the daily heap of letters the former on their knees for his manuscripts the latter on their knees for his bookshis poor disdained manuscripts that had kept all he possessed in pawn for so many dreary months in order to find them in postage  there were unexpected checks for english serial rights and for advance payments on foreign translations  his english agent announced the sale of german translation rights in three of his books and informed him that swedish editions from which he could expect nothing because sweden was not a party to the berne convention were already on the market  then there was a nominal request for his permission for a russian translation that country being likewise outside the berne convention  he turned to the huge bundle of clippings which had come in from his press bureau and read about himself and his vogue which had become a furore  all his creative output had been flung to the public in one magnificent sweep  that seemed to account for it  he had taken the public off its feet the way kipling had that time when he lay near to death and all the mob animated by a mobmind thought began suddenly to read him  martin remembered how that same worldmob having read him and acclaimed him and not understood him in the least had abruptly a few months later flung itself upon him and torn him to pieces  martin grinned at the thought  who was he that he should not be similarly treated in a few more months  well he would fool the mob  he would be away in the south seas building his grass house trading for pearls and copra jumping reefs in frail outriggers catching sharks and bonitas hunting wild goats among the cliffs of the valley that lay next to the valley of taiohae  in the moment of that thought the desperateness of his situation dawned upon him  he saw cleared eyed that he was in the valley of the shadow all the life that was in him was fading fainting making toward death  he realized how much he slept and how much he desired to sleep  of old he had hated sleep  it had robbed him of precious moments of living four hours of sleep in the twentyfour had meant being robbed of four hours of life  how he had grudged sleep  now it was life he grudged life was not good its taste in his mouth was without tang and bitter this was his peril  life that did not yearn toward life was in fair way toward ceasing  some remote instinct for preservation stirred in him and he knew he must get away  he glanced about the room and the thought of packing was burdensome  perhaps it would be better to leave that to the last  in the meantime he might be getting an outfit  he put on his hat and went out stopping in at a gunstore where he spent the remainder of the morning buying automatic rifles ammunition and fishing tackle  fashions changed in trading and he knew he would have to wait till he reached tahiti before ordering his tradegoods  they could come up from australia anyway  this solution was a source of pleasure  he had avoided doing something and the doing of anything just now was unpleasant  he went back to the hotel gladly with a feeling of satisfaction in that the comfortable morris chair was waiting for him and he groaned inwardly on entering his room at sight of joe in the morris chair  joe was delighted with the laundry  everything was settled and he would enter into possession next day  martin lay on the bed with closed eyes while the other talked on  martins thoughts were far awayso far away that he was rarely aware that he was thinking  it was only by an effort that he occasionally responded  and yet this was joe whom he had always liked  but joe was too keen with life  the boisterous impact of it on martins jaded mind was a hurt  it was an aching probe to his tired sensitiveness  when joe reminded him that sometime in the future they were going to put on the gloves together he could almost have screamed  remember joe youre to run the laundry according to those old rules you used to lay down at shelly hot springs he said  no overworking no working at night  and no children at the mangles  no children anywhere  and a fair wage  joe nodded and pulled out a notebook  look at here  i was workin out them rules before breakfast this am what dye think of them  he read them aloud and martin approved worrying at the same time as to when joe would take himself off  it was late afternoon when he awoke  slowly the fact of life came back to him  he glanced about the room  joe had evidently stolen away after he had dozed off  that was considerate of joe he thought  then he closed his eyes and slept again  in the days that followed joe was too busy organizing and taking hold of the laundry to bother him much and it was not until the day before sailing that the newspapers made the announcement that he had taken passage on the mariposa  once when the instinct of preservation fluttered he went to a doctor and underwent a searching physical examination  nothing could be found the matter with him  his heart and lungs were pronounced magnificent  every organ so far as the doctor could know was normal and was working normally  there is nothing the matter with you mr eden he said positively nothing the matter with you  you are in the pink of condition  candidly i envy you your health  it is superb  look at that chest  there and in your stomach lies the secret of your remarkable constitution physically you are a man in a thousandin ten thousand  barring accidents you should live to be a hundred  and martin knew that lizzies diagnosis had been correct  physically he was all right  it was his thinkmachine that had gone wrong and there was no cure for that except to get away to the south seas  the trouble was that now on the verge of departure he had no desire to go  the south seas charmed him no more than did bourgeois civilization  there was no zest in the thought of departure while the act of departure appalled him as a weariness of the flesh  he would have felt better if he were already on board and gone  the last day was a sore trial  having read of his sailing in the morning papers bernard higginbotham gertrude and all the family came to say goodby as did hermann von schmidt and marian  then there was business to be transacted bills to be paid and everlasting reporters to be endured  he said goodby to lizzie connolly abruptly at the entrance to night school and hurried away  at the hotel he found joe too busy all day with the laundry to have come to him earlier  it was the last straw but martin gripped the arms of his chair and talked and listened for half an hour  you know joe he said that you are not tied down to that laundry there are no strings on it  you can sell it any time and blow the money any time you get sick of it and want to hit the road just pull out  do what will make you the happiest  joe shook his head  no more road in mine thank you kindly  hoboins all right exceptin for one thingthe girls  i cant help it but im a ladies man  i cant get along without em and youve got to get along without em when youre hoboin  the times ive passed by houses where dances an parties was goin on an heard the women laugh an saw their white dresses and smiling faces through the windowsgee  i tell you them moments was plain hell  i like dancin an picnics an walking in the moonlight an all the rest too well  me for the laundry and a good front with big iron dollars clinkin in my jeans  i seen a girl already just yesterday and dye know im feelin already id just as soon marry her as not  ive ben whistlin all day at the thought of it  shes a beaut with the kindest eyes and softest voice you ever heard  me for her you can stack on that  say why dont you get married with all this money to burn  you could get the finest girl in the land  martin shook his head with a smile but in his secret heart he was wondering why any man wanted to marry  it seemed an amazing and incomprehensible thing  from the deck of the mariposa at the sailing hour he saw lizzie connolly hiding in the skirts of the crowd on the wharf  take her with you came the thought  it is easy to be kind  she will be supremely happy  it was almost a temptation one moment and the succeeding moment it became a terror  he was in a panic at the thought of it  his tired soul cried out in protest  he turned away from the rail with a groan muttering man you are too sick you are too sick  he fled to his stateroom where he lurked until the steamer was clear of the dock  in the dining saloon at luncheon he found himself in the place of honor at the captains right and he was not long in discovering that he was the great man on board  but no more unsatisfactory great man ever sailed on a ship  he spent the afternoon in a deckchair with closed eyes dozing brokenly most of the time and in the evening went early to bed  after the second day recovered from seasickness the full passenger list was in evidence and the more he saw of the passengers the more he disliked them  yet he knew that he did them injustice  they were good and kindly people he forced himself to acknowledge and in the moment of acknowledgment he qualifiedgood and kindly like all the bourgeoisie with all the psychological cramp and intellectual futility of their kind they bored him when they talked with him their little superficial minds were so filled with emptiness while the boisterous high spirits and the excessive energy of the younger people shocked him  they were never quiet ceaselessly playing deckquoits tossing rings promenading or rushing to the rail with loud cries to watch the leaping porpoises and the first schools of flying fish  he slept much  after breakfast he sought his deckchair with a magazine he never finished  the printed pages tired him  he puzzled that men found so much to write about and puzzling dozed in his chair  when the gong awoke him for luncheon he was irritated that he must awaken there was no satisfaction in being awake  once he tried to arouse himself from his lethargy and went forward into the forecastle with the sailors  but the breed of sailors seemed to have changed since the days he had lived in the forecastle  he could find no kinship with these stolidfaced oxminded bestial creatures  he was in despair  up above nobody had wanted martin eden for his own sake and he could not go back to those of his own class who had wanted him in the past  he did not want them  he could not stand them any more than he could stand the stupid firstcabin passengers and the riotous young people  life was to him like strong white light that hurts the tired eyes of a sick person  during every conscious moment life blazed in a raw glare around him and upon him  it hurt  it hurt intolerably  it was the first time in his life that martin had travelled first class  on ships at sea he had always been in the forecastle the steerage or in the black depths of the coalhold passing coal  in those days climbing up the iron ladders out the pit of stifling heat he had often caught glimpses of the passengers in cool white doing nothing but enjoy themselves under awnings spread to keep the sun and wind away from them with subservient stewards taking care of their every want and whim and it had seemed to him that the realm in which they moved and had their being was nothing else than paradise  well here he was the great man on board in the midmost centre of it sitting at the captains right hand and yet vainly harking back to forecastle and stokehole in quest of the paradise he had lost  he had found no new one and now he could not find the old one  he strove to stir himself and find something to interest him  he ventured the petty officers mess and was glad to get away  he talked with a quartermaster off duty an intelligent man who promptly prodded him with the socialist propaganda and forced into his hands a bunch of leaflets and pamphlets  he listened to the man expounding the slavemorality and as he listened he thought languidly of his own nietzsche philosophy  but what was it worth after all  he remembered one of nietzsches mad utterances wherein that madman had doubted truth and who was to say  perhaps nietzsche had been right  perhaps there was no truth in anything no truth in truthno such thing as truth  but his mind wearied quickly and he was content to go back to his chair and doze  miserable as he was on the steamer a new misery came upon him  what when the steamer reached tahiti  he would have to go ashore  he would have to order his tradegoods to find a passage on a schooner to the marquesas to do a thousand and one things that were awful to contemplate  whenever he steeled himself deliberately to think he could see the desperate peril in which he stood  in all truth he was in the valley of the shadow and his danger lay in that he was not afraid  if he were only afraid he would make toward life  being unafraid he was drifting deeper into the shadow  he found no delight in the old familiar things of life  the mariposa was now in the northeast trades and this wine of wind surging against him irritated him  he had his chair moved to escape the embrace of this lusty comrade of old days and nights  the day the mariposa entered the doldrums martin was more miserable than ever  he could no longer sleep  he was soaked with sleep and perforce he must now stay awake and endure the white glare of life  he moved about restlessly  the air was sticky and humid and the rainsqualls were unrefreshing  he ached with life  he walked around the deck until that hurt too much then sat in his chair until he was compelled to walk again  he forced himself at last to finish the magazine and from the steamer library he culled several volumes of poetry  but they could not hold him and once more he took to walking  he stayed late on deck after dinner but that did not help him for when he went below he could not sleep  this surcease from life had failed him  it was too much  he turned on the electric light and tried to read  one of the volumes was a swinburne  he lay in bed glancing through its pages until suddenly he became aware that he was reading with interest  he finished the stanza attempted to read on then came back to it  he rested the book face downward on his breast and fell to thinking  that was it  the very thing  strange that it had never come to him before  that was the meaning of it all he had been drifting that way all the time and now swinburne showed him that it was the happy way out  he wanted rest and here was rest awaiting him  he glanced at the open porthole  yes it was large enough  for the first time in weeks he felt happy  at last he had discovered the cure of his ill  he picked up the book and read the stanza slowly aloud     from too much love of living    from hope and fear set free    we thank with brief thanksgiving    whatever gods may be    that no life lives forever    that dead men rise up never    that even the weariest river    winds somewhere safe to sea  he looked again at the open port  swinburne had furnished the key  life was ill or rather it had become illan unbearable thing  that dead men rise up never  that line stirred him with a profound feeling of gratitude  it was the one beneficent thing in the universe  when life became an aching weariness death was ready to soothe away to everlasting sleep  but what was he waiting for  it was time to go  he arose and thrust his head out the porthole looking down into the milky wash  the mariposa was deeply loaded and hanging by his hands his feet would be in the water  he could slip in noiselessly  no one would hear  a smother of spray dashed up wetting his face  it tasted salt on his lips and the taste was good  he wondered if he ought to write a swansong but laughed the thought away  there was no time  he was too impatient to be gone  turning off the light in his room so that it might not betray him he went out the porthole feet first  his shoulders stuck and he forced himself back so as to try it with one arm down by his side  a roll of the steamer aided him and he was through hanging by his hands  when his feet touched the sea he let go  he was in a milky froth of water the side of the mariposa rushed past him like a dark wall broken here and there by lighted ports  she was certainly making time  almost before he knew it he was astern swimming gently on the foamcrackling surface  a bonita struck at his white body and he laughed aloud  it had taken a piece out and the sting of it reminded him of why he was there  in the work to do he had forgotten the purpose of it  the lights of the mariposa were growing dim in the distance and there he was swimming confidently as though it were his intention to make for the nearest land a thousand miles or so away  it was the automatic instinct to live  he ceased swimming but the moment he felt the water rising above his mouth the hands struck out sharply with a lifting movement  the will to live was his thought and the thought was accompanied by a sneer  well he had willay will strong enough that with one last exertion it could destroy itself and cease to be  he changed his position to a vertical one  he glanced up at the quiet stars at the same time emptying his lungs of air  with swift vigorous propulsion of hands and feet he lifted his shoulders and half his chest out of water  this was to gain impetus for the descent  then he let himself go and sank without movement a white statue into the sea  he breathed in the water deeply deliberately after the manner of a man taking an anaesthetic  when he strangled quite involuntarily his arms and legs clawed the water and drove him up to the surface and into the clear sight of the stars  the will to live he thought disdainfully vainly endeavoring not to breathe the air into his bursting lungs  well he would have to try a new way  he filled his lungs with air filled them full  this supply would take him far down  he turned over and went down head first swimming with all his strength and all his will  deeper and deeper he went  his eyes were open and he watched the ghostly phosphorescent trails of the darting bonita  as he swam he hoped that they would not strike at him for it might snap the tension of his will  but they did not strike and he found time to be grateful for this last kindness of life  down down he swam till his arms and leg grew tired and hardly moved  he knew that he was deep  the pressure on his eardrums was a pain and there was a buzzing in his head  his endurance was faltering but he compelled his arms and legs to drive him deeper until his will snapped and the air drove from his lungs in a great explosive rush  the bubbles rubbed and bounded like tiny balloons against his cheeks and eyes as they took their upward flight  then came pain and strangulation  this hurt was not death was the thought that oscillated through his reeling consciousness  death did not hurt  it was life the pangs of life this awful suffocating feeling it was the last blow life could deal him  his wilful hands and feet began to beat and churn about spasmodically and feebly  but he had fooled them and the will to live that made them beat and churn  he was too deep down  they could never bring him to the surface  he seemed floating languidly in a sea of dreamy vision  colors and radiances surrounded him and bathed him and pervaded him  what was that  it seemed a lighthouse but it was inside his braina flashing bright white light  it flashed swifter and swifter  there was a long rumble of sound and it seemed to him that he was falling down a vast and interminable stairway  and somewhere at the bottom he fell into darkness  that much he knew  he had fallen into darkness  and at the instant he knew he ceased to know
