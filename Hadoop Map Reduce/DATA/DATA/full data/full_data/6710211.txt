6710211	complete poetical works  by bret harte   argonaut edition of the works of bret harte vol 8  p f collier  son  new york  copyright 1882 1896 and 1902  by houghton mifflin  company     biographical sketch  although bret hartes name is identified with californian life it was not till he was fifteen that the author of plain language from truthful james saw the country of his adoption  francis bret harte to give the full name which he carried till he became famous was born at albany new york august 25 1839  he went with his widowed mother to california in 1854 and was thrown as a young man into the hurlyburly which he more than any other writer has made real to distant and later people  he was by turns a miner schoolteacher express messenger printer and journalist  the types which live again in his pages are thus not only what he observed but what he himself impersonated in his own experience  he began trying his pen in the golden era of san francisco where he was working as a compositor and when the californian edited by charles henry webb was started in 1864 as a literary newspaper he was one of a group of brilliant young fellowsmark twain charles warren stoddard webb himself and prentice mulfordwho gave at once a new interest in california beside what mining and agriculture caused  here in an early number appeared the ballad of the emeu and he contributed many poems grave and gay as well as prose in a great variety of form  at the same time he was appointed secretary of the united states branch mint at san francisco holding the office till 1870  but bret hartes great opportunity came when the overland monthly was established in 1868 by anton roman  this magazine was the outgrowth of the racy exuberant literary spirit which had already found free expression in the journals named  an eager ambition to lift all the new life of the pacific into a recognized place in the world of letters made the young men we have named put their wits together in a monthly magazine which should rival the atlantic in boston and blackwood in edinburgh  the name was easily had and for a sign manual on the cover some one drew a grizzly bear that formidable exemplar of californian wildness  but the design did not quite satisfy until bret harte with a felicitous stroke drew two parallel lines just before the feet of the halting brute  now it was the grizzly of the wilderness drawing back before the railway of civilization and the picture was complete as an emblem  bret harte became by the common urgency of his companions the first editor of the overland and at once his own tales and poems began and in the second number appeared the luck of roaring camp which instantly brought him wide fame  in a few months he found himself besought for poems and articles sketches and stories in influential magazines and in 1871 he turned away from the pacific coast and took up his residence first in new york afterward in boston  no one says his old friend mr stoddard who knows mr harte and knew the california of his day wonders that he left it as he did eastern editors were crying for his work  cities vied with one another in the offer of tempting bait  when he turned his back on san francisco and started for boston he began a tour that the greatest author of any age might have been proud of  it was a veritable ovation that swelled from sea to sea the classic sheep was sacrificed all along the route  i have often thought that if bret harte had met with a fatal accident during that transcontinental journey the world would have declared with one voice that the greatest genius of his time was lost to it  in boston he entered into an arrangement with the predecessors of the publishers of this volume and his contributions appeared in their periodicals and were gathered into volumes  the arrangement in one form or another continued to the time of his death and has for witness a stately array of comely volumes but the prose has far outstripped the poetry  there are few writers of mr hartes prodigality of nature who have used with so much fine reserve their faculty for melodious verse and the present volume contains the entire body of his poetical work growing by minute accretions during thirty odd years  in 1878 he was appointed united states consul at crefeld germany and after that date he resided with little interruption on the continent or in england  he was transferred to glasgow in march 1880 and remained there until july 1885  during the rest of his life he made his home in london  his foreign residence is disclosed in a number of prose sketches and tales and in one or two poems but life abroad never dimmed the vividness of the impressions made on him by the experience of his early manhood when he partook of the elixir vitae of california and the stories which from year to year flowed from an apparently inexhaustible fountain glittered with the gold washed down from the mountain slopes of that country which through his imagination he had made so peculiarly his own  mr harte died suddenly at camberley england may 6 1902   contents        i national        john burns of gettysburg       how

gettysburg       have you heard the story that gossips tell      of burns of gettysburgno  ah well      brief is the glory that hero earns      briefer the story of poor john burns      he was the fellow who won renown      the only man who didnt back down      when the rebels rode through his native town      but held his own in the fight next day      when all his townsfolk ran away      that was in july sixtythree      the very day that general lee      flower of southern chivalry      baffled and beaten backward reeled      from a stubborn meade and a barren field       i might tell how but the day before      john burns stood at his cottage door      looking down the village street      where in the shade of his peaceful vine      he heard the low of his gathered kine      and felt their breath with incense sweet      or i might say when the sunset burned      the old farm gable he thought it turned      the milk that fell like a babbling flood      into the milkpail red as blood      or how he fancied the hum of bees      were bullets buzzing among the trees      but all such fanciful thoughts as these      were strange to a practical man like burns      who minded only his own concerns      troubled no more by fancies fine      than one of his calmeyed longtailed kine      quite oldfashioned and matteroffact      slow to argue but quick to act      that was the reason as some folk say      he fought so well on that terrible day       and it was terrible  on the right      raged for hours the heady fight      thundered the batterys double bass      difficult music for men to face      while on the leftwhere now the graves      undulate like the living waves      that all that day unceasing swept      up to the pits the rebels kept      round shot ploughed the upland glades      sown with bullets reaped with blades      shattered fences here and there      tossed their splinters in the air      the very trees were stripped and bare      the barns that once held yellow grain      were heaped with harvests of the slain      the cattle bellowed on the plain      the turkeys screamed with might and main      and brooding barnfowl left their rest      with strange shells bursting in each nest       just where the tide of battle turns      erect and lonely stood old john burns      how do you think the man was dressed      he wore an ancient long buff vest      yellow as saffronbut his best      and buttoned over his manly breast      was a bright blue coat with a rolling collar      and large gilt buttonssize of a dollar      with tails that the countryfolk called swaller      he wore a broadbrimmed bellcrowned hat      white as the locks on which it sat      never had such a sight been seen      for forty years on the village green      since old john burns was a country beau      and went to the quiltings long ago       close at his elbows all that day      veterans of the peninsula      sunburnt and bearded charged away      and striplings downy of lip and chin      clerks that the home guard mustered in      glanced as they passed at the hat he wore      then at the rifle his right hand bore      and hailed him from out their youthful lore      with scraps of a slangy repertoire      how are you white hat  put her through      your heads level and bully for you      called him daddybegged hed disclose      the name of the tailor who made his clothes      and what was the value he set on those      while burns unmindful of jeer and scoff      stood there picking the rebels off      with his long brown rifle and bellcrown hat      and the swallowtails they were laughing at       twas but a moment for that respect      which clothes all courage their voices checked      and something the wildest could understand      spake in the old mans strong right hand      and his corded throat and the lurking frown      of his eyebrows under his old bellcrown      until as they gazed there crept an awe      through the ranks in whispers and some men saw      in the antique vestments and long white hair      the past of the nation in battle there      and some of the soldiers since declare      that the gleam of his old white hat afar      like the crested plume of the brave navarre      that day was their oriflamme of war       so raged the battle  you know the rest      how the rebels beaten and backward pressed      broke at the final charge and ran      at which john burnsa practical man      shouldered his rifle unbent his brows      and then went back to his bees and cows       that is the story of old john burns      this is the moral the reader learns      in fighting the battle the questions whether      youll show a hat thats white or a feather     how are you sanitary

the grand review      in washingtons chiefest avenue      two hundred thousand men in blue          i think they said was the number      till i seemed to hear their trampling feet      the bugle blast and the drums quick beat      the clatter of hoofs in the stony street      the cheers of people who came to greet      and the thousand details that to repeat          would only my verse encumber      till i fell in a reverie sad and sweet          and then to a fitful slumber       when lo in a vision i seemed to stand      in the lonely capitol  on each hand      far stretched the portico dim and grand      its columns ranged like a martial band      of sheeted spectres whom some command          had called to a last reviewing      and the streets of the city were white and bare      no footfall echoed across the square      but out of the misty midnight air      i heard in the distance a trumpet blare      and the wandering nightwinds seemed to bear          the sound of a far tattooing       then i held my breath with fear and dread      for into the square with a brazen tread      there rode a figure whose stately head          oerlooked the review that morning      that never bowed from its firmset seat      when the living column passed its feet      yet now rode steadily up the street          to the phantom bugles warning       till it reached the capitol square and wheeled      and there in the moonlight stood revealed      a wellknown form that in state and field          had led our patriot sires      whose face was turned to the sleeping camp      afar through the rivers fog and damp      that showed no flicker nor waning lamp          nor wasted bivouac fires       and i saw a phantom army come      with never a sound of fife or drum      but keeping time to a throbbing hum          of wailing and lamentation      the martyred heroes of malvern hill      of gettysburg and chancellorsville      the men whose wasted figures fill          the patriot graves of the nation       and there came the nameless deadthe men      who perished in fever swamp and fen      the slowlystarved of the prison pen          and marching beside the others      came the dusky martyrs of pillows fight      with limbs enfranchised and bearing bright      i thoughtperhaps twas the pale moonlight          they looked as white as their brothers       and so all night marched the nations dead      with never a banner above them spread      nor a badge nor a motto brandished      no marksave the bare uncovered head          of the silent bronze reviewer      with never an arch save the vaulted sky      with never a flower save those that lie      on the distant gravesfor love could buy          no gift that was purer or truer       so all night long swept the strange array      so all night long till the morning gray      i watched for one who had passed away          with a reverent awe and wonder      till a blue cap waved in the lengthning line      and i knew that one who was kin of mine      had come and i spakeand lo that sign          awakened me from my slumber     the copperhead       1864       there is peace in the swamp where the copperhead sleeps      where the waters are stagnant the white vapor creeps      where the musk of magnolia hangs thick in the air      and the lilies phylacteries broaden in prayer      there is peace in the swamp though the quiet is death      though the mist is miasma the upastrees breath      though no echo awakes to the cooing of doves      there is peace yes the peace that the copperhead loves       go seek him he coils in the ooze and the drip      like a thong idly flung from the slavedrivers whip      but beware the false footstepthe stumble that brings      a deadlier lash than the overseer swings      never arrow so true never bullet so dread      as the straight steady stroke of that hammershaped head      whether slave or proud planter who braves that dull crest      woe

verdure rise      but oh the rain that gave it life        sprang first from human eyes       i come to wash away no stain        upon your wasted lea      i raise no banners save the ones        the

     with darker tints than those aurora spread      though shorn his rays his welcome disk concealed      in the dim smoke that veiled each battlefield      still striving upward in meridian pride      he climbed the walls that east and west divide      saw his bright face flashed back from golden sand      and sapphire seas that lave the western land       strange was the contrast that such scenes disclose      from his high vantage oer eternal snows      there wars alarm the brazen trumpet rings      here his lovesong the mailed cicala sings      there bayonets glitter through the forest glades      here yellow cornfields stack their peaceful blades      there the deep trench where valor finds a grave      here the long ditch that curbs the peaceful wave      there the bold sapper with his lighted train      here the dark tunnel and its stores of gain      here the full harvest and the wains advance      there the grim reaper and the ambulance       with scenes so adverse what mysterious bond      links our fair fortunes to the shores beyond      why come we herelast of a scattered fold      to pour new metal in the broken mould      to yield our tribute stamped with caesars face      to caesar stricken in the marketplace       ah love of country is the secret tie      that joins these contrasts neath one arching sky      though brighter paths our

should fit the people for their work sublime      when a new moses with his rod of steel      smote the tall cliffs with one wideringing peal      and the old miracle in record told      to the new nation was revealed in gold       judge not too idly that our toils are mean      though no new levies marshal on our green      nor deem too rashly that our gains are small      weighed with the

sinews of the nations arm      what nerves its hands to strike a deadlier blow      and hurl its legions on the rebel foe      lo for each town new rising oer our state      see the foes hamlet waste

here at the window well sit together      watching the currents that ebb and flow      watching the world as it drifts below      up the hot avenues dusty glow        isnt it pleasant this bright june weather       well it was after the war broke out        and i was a schoolgirl fresh from paris      papa had contracts and roamed about        and idid nothingfor i was an heiress      picked some lint now i think perhaps        knitted some stockingsa dozen nearly      havelocks made for the soldiers caps      stood at fairtables and peddled traps      quite at a profit  the shoulderstraps        thought i was pretty  ah thank you really       still it was stupid  ratatattat        those were the sounds of that battle summer      till the earth seemed a parchment round and flat        and every footfall the tap of a drummer      and day by day down the avenue went        cavalry infantry all together      till my pitying angel one day sent      my fate in the shape of a regiment      that halted just as the day was spent        here at our door in the bright june weather       none of your dandy warriors they        men from the west but where i know not      haggard and travelstained worn and gray        with never a ribbon or lace or bowknot      and i opened the window and leaning there        i felt in their presence the free winds blowing      my neck and shoulders and arms were bare      i did not dream they might think me fair      but i had some flowers that night in my hair        and here on my bosom a red rose glowing       and i looked from the window along the line        dusty and dirty and grim and solemn      till an eye like a bayonet flash met mine        and a dark face shone from the darkening column      and a quick flame leaped to my eyes and hair        till cheeks and shoulders burned all together      and the next i found myself standing there      with my eyelids wet and my cheeks less fair      and the rose from my bosom tossed high in air        like a blooddrop falling on plume and feather       then i drew back quickly there came a cheer        a rush of figures a noise and tussle      and then it was over and high and clear        my red rose bloomed on his guns black muzzle      then far in the darkness a sharp voice cried        and slowly and steadily all together      shoulder to shoulder and side to side      rising and falling and swaying wide      but bearing above them the rose my pride        they marched away in the twilight weather       and i leaned from my window and watched my rose        tossed on the waves of the surging column      warmed from above in the sunset glows        borne from below by an impulse solemn      then i shut the window  i heard no more        of my soldier friend nor my flower neither      but lived my life as i did before      i did not go as a nurse to the war      sick folks to me are a dreadful bore        so i didnt go to the hospital either       you smile o poet and what do you        you lean from your window and watch lifes column      trampling and struggling through dust and dew        filled with its purposes grave and solemn      and an act a gesture a facewho knows        touches your fancy to thrill and haunt you      and you pluck from your bosom the verse that grows      and down it flies like my red red rose      and you sit and

ii spanish idyls and legends     the miracle of padre junipero       this is the tale that the chronicle      tells of the wonderful miracle      wrought by the pious padre serro      the very reverend junipero       the heathen stood on his ancient mound      looking over the desert bound      into the distant hazy south      over the dusty and broad champaign      where with many a gaping mouth      and fissure cracked by the fervid drouth      for seven months had the wasted plain      known no moisture of dew or rain      the wells were empty and choked with sand      the rivers had perished from the land      only the seafogs to and fro      slipped like ghosts of the streams below      deep in its bed lay the rivers bones      bleaching in pebbles and milkwhite stones      and tracked oer the desert faint and far      its ribs shone bright on each sandy bar       thus they stood as the sun went down      over the foothills bare and brown      thus they looked to the south wherefrom      the paleface medicineman should come      not in anger or in strife      but to bringso ran the tale      the welcome springs of eternal life      the living waters that should not fail       said one he will come like manitou      unseen unheard in the falling dew      said another he will come full soon      out of the roundfaced watery moon      and another said he is here and lo      faltering staggering feeble and slow      out from the deserts blinding heat      the padre dropped at the heathens feet       they stood and gazed for a little space      down on his pallid and careworn face      and a smile of scorn went round the band      as they touched alternate with foot and hand      this mortal waif that the outer space      of dim mysterious sky and sand      flung with so little of christian grace      down on their barren sterile strand       said one to him it seems thy god      is a very pitiful kind of god      he could not shield thine aching eyes      from the blowing desert sands that rise      nor turn aside from thy old gray head      the glittering blade that is brandished      by the sun he set in the heavens high      he could not moisten thy lips when dry      the desert fire is in thy brain      thy limbs are racked with the feverpain      if this be the grace he showeth thee      who art his servant what may we      strange to his ways and his commands      seek at his unforgiving hands       drink but this cup said the padre straight      and thou shalt know whose mercy bore      these aching limbs to your heathen door      and purged my soul of its gross estate      drink in his name and thou shalt see      the hidden depths of this mystery      drink and he held the cup  one blow      from the heathen dashed to the ground below      the sacred cup that the padre bore      and the thirsty soil drank the precious store      of sacramental and holy wine      that emblem and consecrated sign      and blessed symbol of blood divine       then says the legend and they who doubt      the same as heretics be accurst      from the dry and feverish soil leaped out      a living fountain a wellspring burst      over the dusty and broad champaign      over the sandy and sterile plain      till the granite ribs and the milkwhite stones      that lay in the valleythe scattered bones      moved in the river and lived again       such was the wonderful miracle      wrought by the cup of wine that fell      from the hands of the pious padre serro      the very reverend junipero     the wonderful spring of san joaquin       of all the fountains that poets sing      crystal thermal or mineral spring      ponce de leons fount of youth      wells with bottoms of doubtful truth      in short of all the springs of time      that ever were flowing in fact or rhyme      that ever were tasted felt or seen      there were none like the spring of san joaquin       anno domini eighteenseven      father dominguez now in heaven      obiit eighteen twentyseven      found the spring and found it too      by his mules miraculous cast of a shoe      for his beasta descendant of balaams ass      stopped on the instant and would not pass       the padre thought the omen good      and bent his lips to the trickling flood      thenas the chronicles declare      on the honest faith of a true believer      his cheeks though wasted lank and bare      filled like a withered russet pear      in the vacuum of a glass receiver      and the snows that seventy winters bring      melted away in that magic spring       such at least was the wondrous news      the padre brought into santa cruz      the church of course had its own views      of who were worthiest to use      the magic spring but the prior claim      fell to the aged sick and lame      far and wide the people came      some from the healthful aptos creek      hastened to bring their helpless sick      even the fishers of rude soquel      suddenly found they were far from well      the brawny dwellers of san lorenzo      said in fact they had never been so      and all were ailingstrange to say      from pescadero to monterey       over the mountain they poured in      with leathern bottles and bags of skin      through the canyons a motley throng      trotted hobbled and limped along      the fathers gazed at the moving scene      with pious joy and with souls serene      and thena result perhaps foreseen      they laid out the mission of san joaquin       not in the eyes of faith alone      the good effects of the water shone      but skins grew rosy eyes waxed clear      of rough vaquero and muleteer      angular forms were rounded out      limbs grew supple and waists grew stout      and as for the girlsfor miles about      they had no equal  to this day      from pescadero to monterey      youll still find eyes in which are seen      the liquid graces of san joaquin       there is a limit to human bliss      and the mission of san joaquin had this      none went abroad to roam or stay      but they fell sick in the queerest way      a singular maladie du pays      with gastric symptoms so they spent      their days in a sensuous content      caring little for things unseen      beyond their bowers of living green      beyond the mountains that lay between      the world and the mission of san joaquin       winter passed and the summer came      the trunks of madrono all aflame      here and there through the underwood      like pillars of fire starkly stood      all of the breezy solitude        was filled with the spicing of pine and bay      and resinous odors mixed and blended        and dim and ghostlike far away      the smoke of the burning woods ascended      then of a sudden the mountains swam      the rivers piled their floods in a dam      the ridge above los gatos creek        arched its spine in a feline fashion      the forests waltzed till they grew sick        and nature shook in a speechless passion      and swallowed up in the earthquakes spleen      the wonderful spring of san joaquin      vanished and never more was seen       two days passed the mission folk      out of their rosy dream awoke      some of them looked a trifle white      but that no doubt was from earthquake fright      three days there was sore distress      headache nausea giddiness      four days faintings tenderness      of the mouth and fauces and in less      than one weekhere the story closes      we wont continue the prognosis      enough that now no trace is seen      of spring or mission of san joaquin       moral       you see the point  dont be too quick      to break bad habits better stick      like the mission folk to your arsenic     the angelus       heard at

only one thing holds its crumbling walls above the meaner dust      listen to the simple story of a womans love and trust       ii       count von resanoff the russian envoy of the mighty czar      stood beside the deep embrasures where the brazen cannon are       he with grave provincial magnates long had held serene debate      on the treaty of alliance and the high affairs of state       he from grave provincial magnates oft had turned to talk apart      with the commandantes daughter on the questions of the heart       until points of gravest import yielded slowly one by one      and by love was consummated what diplomacy begun       till beside the deep embrasures where the brazen cannon are      he received the twofold contract for approval of the czar       till beside the brazen cannon the betrothed bade adieu      and from sallyport and gateway north the russian eagles flew       iii       long beside the deep embrasures where the brazen cannon are      did they wait the promised bridegroom and the answer of the czar       day by day on wall and bastion beat the hollow empty breeze      day by day the sunlight glittered on the vacant smiling seas       week by week the near hills whitened in their dusty leather cloaks      week by week the far hills darkened from the fringing plain of oaks       till the rains came and far breaking on the fierce southwester tost      dashed the whole long coast with color and then vanished and were         lost       so each year the seasons shiftedwet and warm and drear and dry      half a year of clouds and flowers half a year of dust and sky       still it brought no ship nor messagebrought no tidings ill or meet      for the statesmanlike commander for the daughter fair and sweet       yet she heard the varying message voiceless to all ears beside      he will come the flowers whispered come no more the dry hills         sighed       still she found him with the waters lifted by the morning breeze      still she lost him with the folding of the great whitetented seas       until hollows chased the dimples from her cheeks of olive brown      and at times a swift shy moisture dragged the long sweet lashes down       or the small mouth curved and quivered as for some denied caress      and the fair young brow was knitted in an infantine distress       then the grim commander pacing where the brazen cannon are      comforted the maid with proverbs wisdom gathered from afar       bits of ancient observation by his fathers garnered each      as a pebble worn and polished in the current of his speech       those who wait the coming rider travel twice as far as he      tired wench and coming butter never did in time agree       he that getteth himself honey though a clown he shall have flies      in the end god grinds the miller in the dark the mole has eyes       he whose father is alcalde of his trial hath no fear      and be sure the count has reasons that will make his conduct clear       then the voice sententious faltered and the wisdom it would teach      lost itself in fondest trifles of his soft castilian speech       and on concha conchitita and conchita he would dwell      with the fond reiteration which the spaniard knows so well       so with proverbs and caresses half in faith and half in doubt      every day some hope was kindled flickered faded and went out       iv       yearly down the hillside sweeping came the stately cavalcade      bringing revel to vaquero joy and comfort to each maid       bringing days of formal visit social feast and rustic sport      of bullbaiting on the plaza of lovemaking in the court       vainly then at conchas lattice vainly as the idle wind      rose the thin high spanish tenor that bespoke the youth too kind       vainly leaning from their saddles caballeros bold and fleet      plucked for her the buried chicken from beneath their mustangs feet       so in vain the barren hillsides with their gay serapes blazed      blazed and vanished in the dustcloud that their flying hoofs had         raised       then the drum called from the rampart and once more with patient         mien      the commander and his daughter each took up the dull routine       each took up the petty duties of a life apart and lone      till the slow years wrought a music in its dreary monotone       v       forty years on wall and bastion swept the hollow idle breeze      since the russian eagle fluttered from the california seas       forty years on wall and bastion wrought its slow but sure decay      and st georges cross was lifted in the port of monterey       and the citadel was lighted and the hall was gayly drest      all to honor sir george simpson famous traveler and guest       far and near the people gathered to the costly banquet set      and exchanged congratulations with the english baronet       till the formal speeches ended and amidst the laugh and wine      some one spoke of conchas loverheedless of the warning sign       quickly then cried sir george simpson speak no ill of him i pray      he is dead  he died poor fellow forty years ago this day       died while speeding home to russia falling from a fractious horse      left a sweetheart too they tell me  married i suppose of course       lives she yet  a deathlike silence fell on banquet guests and         hall      and a trembling figure rising fixed the awestruck gaze of all       two black eyes in darkened orbits gleamed beneath the nuns white hood      black serge hid the wasted figure bowed and stricken where it stood       lives she yet sir george repeated  all were hushed as concha drew      closer yet her nuns attire  senor pardon she died too     for the king       northern mexico 1640       as you look from the plaza at leon west      you can see her house but the view is best      from the porch of the church where she lies at rest       where much of her past still lives i think      in the scowling brows and sidelong blink      of the worshiping throng that rise or sink       to the waxen saints that yellow and lank      lean out from their niches rank on rank      with a bloodless saviour on either flank       in the gouty pillars whose cracks begin      to show the adobe core within      a soul of earth in a whitewashed skin       and i think that the moral of all youll say      is the sculptured legend that moulds away      on a tomb in the choir por el rey       por el rey  well the king is gone      ages ago and the hapsburg one      shotbut the rock of the church lives on       por el rey  what matters indeed      if king or president succeed      to a country haggard with sloth and greed       as long as one granary is fat      and yonder priest in a shovel hat      peeps out from the bin like a sleek brown rat       what matters  naught if it serves to bring      the legend nearerno other thing      well spare the moral live the king       two hundred years ago they say      the viceroy marquis of monterey      rode with his retinue that way       grave as befitted spains grandee      grave as the substitute should be      of his most catholic majesty       yet from his black plumes curving grace      to his slim black gauntlets smaller space      exquisite as a piece of lace       two hundred years agoeen so      the marquis stopped where the limetrees blow      while leons seneschal bent him low       and begged that the marquis would that night take      his humble roof for the royal sake      and then as the custom demanded spake       the usual wish that his guest would hold      the house and all that it might enfold      as hiswith the bride scarce three days old       be sure that the marquis in his place      replied to all with the measured grace      of chosen speech and unmoved face       nor raised his head till his black plume swept      the hem of the ladys robe who kept      her place as her husband backward stept       and then i know not how nor why      a subtle flame in the ladys eye      unseen by the courtiers standing by       burned through his lace and titled wreath      burned through his bodys jeweled sheath      till it touched the steel of the man beneath       and yet mayhap no more was meant      than to point a wellworn compliment      and the ladys beauty her worst intent       howbeit the marquis bowed again      who rules with awe well serveth spain      but best whose law is love made plain       be sure that night no pillow prest      the seneschal but with the rest      watched as was due a royal guest       watched from the wall till he saw the square      fill with the moonlight white and bare      watched till he saw two shadows fare       out from his garden where the shade      that the old church tower and belfry made      like a benedictory hand was laid       few words spoke the seneschal as he turned      to his nearest sentry these monks have learned      that stolen fruit is sweetly earned       myself shall punish yon acolyte      who gathers my garden grapes by night      meanwhile wait thou till the morning light       yet not till the sun was riding high      did the sentry meet his commanders eye      nor then till the viceroy stood by       to the lovers of grave formalities      no greeting was ever so fine i wis      as this hosts and guests high courtesies       the seneschal feared as the wind was west      a blast from morena had chilled his rest      the viceroy languidly confest       that cares of state andhe dared to say      some fears that the king could not repay      the thoughtful zeal of his host some way       had marred his rest  yet he trusted much      none shared his wakefulness though such      indeed might be  if he dared to touch       a theme so finethe bride perchance      still slept  at least they missed her glance      to give this greeting countenance       be sure that the seneschal in turn      was deeply bowed with the grave concern      of the painful news his guest should learn       last night to her fathers dying bed      by a priest was the lady summoned      nor know we yet how well she sped       but hope for the best  the grave viceroy      though grieved his visit had such alloy      must still wish the seneschal great joy       of a bride so true to her filial trust      yet now as the day waxed on they must      to horse if theyd scape the noonday dust       nay said the seneschal at least      to mend the news of this funeral priest      myself shall ride as your escort east       the viceroy bowed  then turned aside      to his nearest follower with me ride      you and felipeon either side       and list  should anything me befall      mischance of ambush or musketball      cleave to his saddle yon seneschal       no more  then gravely in accents clear      took formal leave of his late good cheer      whiles the seneschal whispered a musketeer       carelessly stroking his pommel top      if from the saddle ye see me drop      riddle me quickly yon solemn fop       so these with many a compliment      each on his own dark thought intent      with grave politeness onward went       riding high and in sight of all      viceroy escort and seneschal      under the shade of the almandral       holding their secret hard and fast      silent and grave they ride at last      into the dusty traveled past       even like this they passed away      two hundred years ago today      what of the lady  who shall say       do the souls of the dying ever yearn      to some favored spot for the dusts return      for the homely peace of the family urn       i know not  yet did the seneschal      chancing in afteryears to fall      pierced by a flemish musketball       call to his side a trusty friar      and bid him swear as his last desire      to bear his corse to san pedros choir       at leon where neath a shield azure      should his mortal frame find sepulture      this much for the pains christ did endure       be sure that the friar loyally      fulfilled his trust by land and sea      till the spires of leon silently       rose through the green of the almandral      as if to beckon the seneschal      to his kindred dust neath the choir wall       i wot that the saints on either side      leaned from their niches openeyed      to see the doors of the church swing

some purpose i grant you dim      the don loved women and they loved him      each thought herself his last love  worst      many believed that they were his first      and such are these creatures since the fall      the very doubt had a charm for all       you laugh  you are young but iindeed      i have no patience  to proceed      you saw as you passed through the upper town      the eucinal where the road goes down      to san felipe  there one morn      they found diegohis mantle torn      and as many holes through his doublets band      as there were wronged husbandsyou understand       dying so said the gossips  dead      was what the friars who found him said      may be  quien sabe  who else should know      it was a hundred years ago      there was a funeral  small indeed      private  what would you  to proceed       scarcely the year had flown  one night      the commandante awoke in fright      hearing below his casements bar      the wellknown twang of the dons guitar      and rushed to the window just to see      his wife aswoon on the balcony       one week later don juan ramirez      found his own daughter the dona inez      pale as a ghost leaning out to hear      the song of that phantom cavalier      even alcalde pedro blas      saw it was said through his nieces glass      the shade of diego twice repass       what these gentlemen each confessed      heaven and the church only knows  at best      the case was a bad one  how to deal      with sin as a ghost they couldnt but feel      was an awful thing  till a certain fray      humbly offered to show the way       and the way was this  did i say before      that the fray was a stranger  no senor      strange very strange  i should have said      that the very week that the don lay dead      he came among us  bread he broke      silent nor ever to one he spoke      so he had vowed it  below his brows      his face was hidden  there are such vows       strange are they not  you do not use      snuff  a bad habit                             well the views      of the fray were these that the penance done      by the caballeros was right but one      was due from the cause and that in brief      was dona dolores gomez chief      and inez sanchicha concepcion      and carmenwell half the girls in town      on his tablets the friar had written down       these were to come on a certain day      and ask at the hands of the pious fray      for absolution  that done small fear      but the shade of diego would disappear       they came each knelt in her turn and place      to the pious fray with his hidden face      and voiceless lips and each again      took back her soul freed from spot or stain      till the dona inez with eyes downcast      and a tear on their fringes knelt her last       and thenperhaps that her voice was low      from fear or from shamethe monks said so      but the fray leaned forward when presto all      were thrilled by a scream and saw her fall      fainting beside the confessional       and so was the ghost of diego laid      as the fray had said  never more his shade      was seen at san gabriels mission  eh      the girl interests you  i dare say      nothing said she when they brought her to      only a faintness  they spoke more true      who said twas a stubborn soul but then      women are women and men are men       so to return  as i said before      having got the wolf by the same high law      we saved the lamb in the wolfs own jaw      and thats my moral  the tale i fear      but poorly told  yet it strikes me here      is stuff for a moral  whats your view      you smile don pancho  ah thats like you     at the hacienda       know i not whom thou mayst be        carved upon this olivetree          manuela of la torre      for

manuela of la torre      yet at night when winds are still      tinkles on the distant hill      a guitar and words that thrill        tell to me the old old story      old when first thy charms were sung      old when these old walls were young          manuela of la torre     friar pedros ride       it was the morning season of the year        it was the morning era of the land      the watercourses rang full loud and clear        portalas cross stood where portalas hand      had planted it when faith was taught by fear        when monks and missions held the sole command      of all that shore beside the peaceful sea      where springtides beat their longdrawn reveille       out of the mission of san luis rey        all in that brisk tumultuous spring weather      rode friar pedro in a pious way        with six dragoons in cuirasses of leather      each armed alike for either prayer or fray        handcuffs and missals they had slung together      and as an aid the gospel truth to scatter      each swung a lassoalias a riata       in sooth that year the harvest had been slack        the crop of converts scarce worth computation      some souls were lost whose owners had turned back        to save their bodies frequent flagellation      and some preferred the songs of birds alack        to latin matins and their souls salvation      and thought their own wild whoopings were less dreary      than father pedros droning miserere       to bring them back to matins and to prime        to pious works and secular submission      to prove to them that liberty was crime        this was in fact the padres present mission      to get new souls perchance at the same time        and bring them to a sense of their condition      that easy phrase which in the past and present      means making that condition most unpleasant       he saw the glebe land guiltless of a furrow        he saw the wild oats wrestle on the hill      he saw the gopher working in his burrow        he saw the squirrel scampering at his will      he saw all this and felt no doubt a thorough        and deep conviction of gods goodness still      he failed to see that in his glory he      yet left the humblest of his creatures free       he saw the flapping crow whose frequent note        voiced the monotony of land and sky      mocking with graceless wing and rusty coat        his priestly presence as he trotted by      he would have cursed the bird by bell and rote        but other game just then was in his eye      a savage camp whose occupants preferred      their heathen darkness to the living word       he rang his bell and at the martial sound        twelve silver spurs their jingling rowels clashed      six horses sprang across the level ground        as six dragoons in open order dashed      above their heads the lassos circled round        in every eye a pious fervor flashed      they charged the camp and in one moment more      they lassoed six and reconverted four       the friar saw the conflict from a knoll        and sang laus deo and cheered on his men      well thrown bautistathats another soul        after him gomeztry it once again      this way felipethere the heathen stole        bones of st francissurely that makes ten      te deum laudamusbut theyre very wild      non nobis domineall right my child       when at that momentas the story goes        a certain squaw who had her foes eluded      ran past the friar just before his nose        he stared a moment and in silence brooded      then in his breast a pious frenzy rose        and every other prudent thought excluded      he caught a lasso and dashed in a canter      after that occidental atalanta       high oer his head he swirled the dreadful noose        but as the practice was quite unfamiliar      his first cast tore felipes captive loose        and almost choked tiburcio camilla      and might have interfered with that brave youths        ability to gorge the tough tortilla      but all things come by practice and at last      his flying slipknot caught the maiden fast       then rose above the plain a mingled yell        of rage and triumpha demoniac whoop      the padre heard it like a passing knell        and would have loosened his unchristian loop      but the tough rawhide held the captive well        and held alas too well the captordupe      for with one bound the savage fled amain      dragging horse friar down the lonely plain       down the arroyo out across the mead        by heath and hollow sped the flying maid      dragging behind her still the panting steed        and helpless friar who in vain essayed      to cut the lasso or to check his speed        he felt himself beyond all human aid      and trusted to the saintsand for that matter      to some weak spot in felipes riata       alas the lasso had been duly blessed        and like baptism held the flying wretch      a doctrine that the priest had oft expressed        which like the lasso might be made to stretch      but would not break so neither could divest        themselves of it but like some awful fetch      the holy friar had to recognize      the image of his fate in heathen guise       he saw the glebe land guiltless of a furrow        he saw the wild oats wrestle on the hill      he saw the gopher standing in his burrow        he saw the squirrel scampering at his will      he saw all this and felt no doubt how thorough        the contrast was to his condition still      the squaw kept onward to the sea till night      and the cold seafog hid them both from sight       the morning came above the serried coast        lighting the snowpeaks with its beaconfires      driving before it all the fleetwinged host        of chattering birds above the mission spires      filling the land with light and joy but most        the savage woods with all their leafy lyres      in pearly tints and opal flame and fire      the morning came but not the holy friar       weeks passed away  in vain the fathers sought        some trace or token that might tell his story      some thought him dead or like elijah caught        up to the heavens in a blaze of glory      in this surmise some miracles were wrought        on his account and souls in purgatory      were thought to profit from his intercession      in brief his absence made a deep impression       a twelvemonth passed the welcome spring once more        made green the hills beside the whitefaced mission      spread her bright dais by the western shore        and sat enthroned a most resplendent vision      the heathen converts thronged the chapel door        at morning mass when says the old tradition      a frightful whoop throughout the church resounded      and to their feet the congregation bounded       a tramp of hoofs upon the beaten course        then came a sight that made the bravest quail      a phantom friar on a spectre horse        dragged by a creature decked with horns and tail      by the lone mission with the whirlwinds force        they madly swept and left a sulphurous trail      and that was allenough to tell the story      and leave unblessed those souls in purgatory       and ever after on that fatal day        that friar pedro rode abroad lassoing      a ghostly couple came and went away        with savage whoop and heathenish hallooing      which brought discredit on san luis rey        and proved the missions ruin and undoing      for ere ten years had passed the squaw and friar      performed to empty walls and fallen spire       the mission is no more upon its wall        the golden lizards slip or breathless pause      still as the sunshine brokenly that falls        through crannied roof and spiderwebs of gauze      no more the bell its solemn warning calls        a holier silence thrills and overawes      and the sharp lights and shadows of today      outline the mission of san luis rey     in the mission garden       1865

galleon      laden with odorous gums and spice      india cottons and india rice      and the richest silks of far cathay      was due at acapulco bay       due she was and overdue      galleon merchandise and crew      creeping along through rain and shine      through the tropics under the line      the trains were waiting outside the walls      the wives of sailors thronged the town      the traders sat by their empty stalls      and the viceroy himself came down      the bells in the tower were all atrip      te deums were on each fathers lip      the limes were ripening in the sun      for the sick of the coming galleon       all in vain  weeks passed away      and yet no galleon saw the bay      india goods advanced in price      the governor missed his favorite spice      the senoritas mourned for sandal      and the famous cottons of coromandel      and some for an absent lover lost      and one for a husbanddona julia      wife of the captain tempesttossed      in circumstances so peculiar      even the fathers unawares      grumbled a little at their prayers      and all along the coast that year      votive candles wore scarce and dear       never a tear bedims the eye      that time and patience will not dry      never a lip is curved with pain      that cant be kissed into smiles again      and these same truths as far as i know      obtained on the coast of mexico      more than two hundred years ago      in sixteen hundred and fiftyone      ten years after the deed was done      and folks had forgotten the galleon      the divers plunged in the gulf for pearls      white as the teeth of the indian girls      the traders sat by their full bazaars      the mules with many a weary load      and oxen dragging their creaking cars      came and went on the mountain road       where was the galleon all this while      wrecked on some lonely coral isle      burnt by the roving seamarauders      or sailing north under secret orders      had she found the anian passage famed      by lying maldonado claimed      and sailed through the sixtyfifth degree      direct to the north atlantic sea      or had she found the river of kings      of which de fonte told such strange things      in sixteen forty  never a sign      east or west or under the line      they saw of the missing galleon      never a sail or plank or chip      they found of the longlost treasureship      or enough to build a tale upon      but when she was lost and where and how      are the facts were coming to just now       take if you please the chart of that day      published at madridpor el rey      look for a spot in the old south sea      the hundred and eightieth degree      longitude west of madrid there      under the equatorial glare      just where the east and west are one      youll find the missing galleon      youll find the san gregorio yet      riding the seas with sails all set      fresh as upon the very day      she sailed from acapulco bay       how did she get there  what strange spell      kept her two hundred years so well      free from decay and mortal taint      what but the prayers of a patron saint       a hundred leagues from manilla town      the san gregorios helm came down      round she went on her heel and not      a cables length from a galliot      that rocked on the waters just abreast      of the galleons course which was westsouwest       then said the galleons commandante      general pedro sobriente      that was his rank on land and main      a regular custom of old spain      my pilot is dead of scurvy may      i ask the longitude time and day      the first two given and compared      the thirdthe commandante stared      the first of june  i make it second      said the stranger then youve wrongly reckoned      i make it first as you came this way      you should have lost dye see a day      lost a day as plainly see      on the hundred and eightieth degree      lost a day  yes if not rude      when did you make east longitude      on the ninth of mayour patrons day      on the ninthyou had no ninth of may      eighth and tenth was there but stay      too late for the galleon bore away       lost was the day they should have kept      lost unheeded and lost unwept      lost in a way that made search vain      lost in a trackless and boundless main      lost like the day of jobs awful curse      in his third chapter third and fourth verse      wrecked was their patrons only day      what would the holy fathers say       said the fray antonio estavan      the galleons chaplaina learned man      nothing is lost that you can regain      and the way to look for a thing is plain      to go where you lost it back again      back with your galleon till you see      the hundred and eightieth degree      wait till the rolling year goes round      and there will the missing day be found      for youll find if computations true      that sailing east will give to you      not only one ninth of may but two      one for the good saints present cheer      and one for the day we lost last year       back to the spot sailed the galleon      where for a twelvemonth off and on      the hundred and eightieth degree      she rose and fell on a tropic sea      but lo when it came to the ninth of may      all of a sudden becalmed she lay      one degree from that fatal spot      without the power to move a knot      and of course the moment she lost her way      gone was her chance to save that day       to cut a lengthening story short      she never saved it  made the sport      of evil spirits and baffling wind      she was always before or just behind      one day too soon or one day too late      and the sun meanwhile would never wait      she had two eighths as she idly lay      two tenths but never a ninth of may      and there she rides through two hundred years      of dreary penance and anxious fears      yet through the grace of the saint she served      captain and crew are still preserved       by a computation that still holds good      made by the holy brotherhood      the san gregorio will cross that line      in nineteen hundred and thirtynine      just three hundred years to a day      from the time she lost the ninth of may      and the folk in acapulco town      over the waters looking down      will see in the glow of the setting sun      the sails of the missing galleon      and the royal standard of philip rey      the gleaming mast and glistening spar      as she nears the surf of the outer bar      a te deum sung on her crowded

 that the spring near his house        dried right up on the green      and he sunk forty feet down for water but nary a drop to be seen       then the bar petered out        and the boys wouldnt stay

plain language from truthful james       table mountain 1870       which i wish to remark        and my language is plain      that for ways that are dark        and for tricks that are vain      the heathen chinee is peculiar       which the same i would rise to explain       ah sin was his name        and i shall not deny      in regard to the same        what that name might imply      but his smile it was pensive and childlike        as i frequent remarked to bill nye       it was august the third        and quite soft was the skies      which it might be inferred        that ah sin was likewise      yet he played it that day upon william        and me in a way i despise       which we had a small game        and ah sin took a hand      it was euchre  the same        he did not understand      but he smiled as he sat by the table        with the smile that was childlike and bland       yet the cards they were stocked        in a way that i grieve      and my feelings were shocked        at the state of nyes sleeve      which was stuffed full of aces and bowers        and the same with intent to deceive       but the hands that were played        by that heathen chinee      and the points that he made        were quite frightful to see      till at last he put down a right bower        which the same nye had dealt unto me       then i looked up at nye        and he gazed upon me      and he rose with a sigh        and said can this be      we are ruined by chinese cheap labor        and he went for that heathen chinee       in the scene that ensued        i did not take a hand      but the floor it was strewed        like the leaves on the strand      with the cards that ah sin had been hiding        in the game he did not understand       in his sleeves which were long        he had twentyfour packs      which was coming it strong        yet i state but the facts      and we found on his nails which were taper        what is frequent in tapersthats wax       which is why i remark        and my language is plain      that for ways that are dark        and for tricks that are vain      the heathen chinee is peculiar        which the same i am free to maintain     the society upon the stanislaus       i reside at table mountain and my name is truthful james      i am not up to small deceit or any sinful games      and ill tell in simple language what i know about the row      that broke up our society upon the stanislow       but first i would remark that it is not a proper plan      for any scientific gent to whale his fellowman      and if a member dont agree with his peculiar whim      to lay for that same member for to put a head on him       now nothing could be finer or more beautiful to see      than the first six months proceedings of that same society      till brown of calaveras brought a lot of fossil bones      that he found within a tunnel near the tenement of jones       then brown he read a paper and he reconstructed there      from those same bones an animal that was extremely rare      and jones then asked the chair for a suspension of the rules      till he could prove that those same bones was one of his lost mules       then brown he smiled a bitter smile and said he was at fault      it seemed he had been trespassing on joness family vault      he was a most sarcastic man this quiet mr brown      and on several occasions he had cleaned out the town       now i hold it is not decent for a scientific gent      to say another is an assat least to all intent      nor should the individual who happens to be meant      reply by heaving rocks at him to any great extent       then abner dean of angels raised a point of order when      a chunk of old red sandstone took him in the abdomen      and he smiled a kind of sickly smile and curled up on the floor      and the subsequent proceedings interested him no more       for in less time than i write it every member did engage      in a warfare with the remnants of a palaeozoic age      and the way they heaved those fossils in their anger was a sin      till the skull of an old mammoth caved the head of thompson in       and this is all i have to say of these improper games      for i live at table mountain and my name is truthful james      and ive told in simple language what i know about the row      that broke up our society upon the stanislow     luke       in the colorado park 1873       wots that youre readina novel  a novelwell darn my skin      you a man grown and bearded and histin such stuff ez that in

novels and thats whats the      matter with her       yet she was sweet on the jedge and stuck by him day and night      alone in the cabin up yertill she grew like a ghost all white      she wus only a slip of a thing ez light and ez up and away      ez rifle smoke blown through the woods but she wasnt my kindno         way       speakin o gals dye mind that house ez you rise the hill      a mile

whar i was hid      she did  oh its jist like her sass for shes peart ez a katydid       but what was i talking ofoh the jedge and his daughtershe read      novels the whole day long and i reckon she read them abed      and sometimes she read them out loud to the jedge on the porch where         he sat      and twas how lord augustus said this and how lady blanche she         said that       but the sickest of all that i heerd was a yarn thet they read bout         a chap      leatherstocking by name and a hunter chock full o the greenest         o sap      and they asked me to hear but i says miss mabel not any for me      when i likes i kin sling my own lies and thet chap and i shouldnt         agree       yet somehow or other that gal allus said that i brought her to mind      of folks about whom she had read or suthin belike of thet kind      and thar warnt no end o the names that she give me thet summer up         here      robin hood leatherstocking rob royoh i tell you the         critter was queer       and yet ef she hadnt been spiled she was harmless enough in her         way      she could jabber in french to her dad and they said that she knew         how to play      and she worked me that shotpouch up thar which the man doesnt         live ez kin use      and slippersyou see em down yerez would cradle an injins         papoose       yet along o them novels you see she was wastin and mopin away      and then she got shy with her tongue and at last she had nothin to         say      and whenever i happened around her face it was hid by a book      and it warnt till the day she left that she give me ez much ez a         look       and this was the way it was  it was night when i kem up here      to say to em all goodby for i reckoned to go for deer      at sun up the day they left  so i shook em all round by the hand      cept mabel and she was sick ez they give me to understand       but jist ez i passed the house next morning at dawn some one      like a little waver o mist got up on the hill with the sun      miss mabel it was aloneall wrapped in a mantle o lace      and she stood there straight in the road with a touch o the sun in         her face       and she looked me right in the eyeid seen suthin like it before      when i hunted a wounded doe to the edge o the clear lake shore      and i had my knee on its neck and i jist was raisin my knife      when it give me a look like that andwell it got off with its life       we are going today she said and i thought i would say goodby      to you in your own house lukethese woods and the bright blue sky      youve always been kind to us luke and papa has found you still      as good as the air he breathes and wholesome as laurel tree hill       and well always think of you luke as the thing we could not take         away      the balsam that dwells in the woods the rainbow that lives in the         spray      and youll sometimes think of me luke as you know you once used to         say      a rifle smoke blown through the woods a moment but never to stay       and then we shook hands  she turned but asuddent she tottered and         fell      and i caught her sharp by the waist and held her a minit  well      it was only a minit you know thet ez cold and ez white she lay      ez a snowflake here on my breast and thenwell she melted away       and was gone and thar are her books but i says not any for me      good enough may be for some but them and i mightnt agree      they spiled a decent gal ez might hev made some chap a wife      and look at meclar two hundredand never read one in my life     the babes in the woods       big pine flat 1871       something characteristic eh        humph  i reckon you mean by that      something that happened in our way        here at the crossin of big pine flat      times arent now as they used to be        when gold was flush and the boys were frisky      and a man would pull out his battery        for anythingmaybe the price of whiskey       nothing of that sort eh  thats strange        why i thought you might be diverted      hearing how jones of red rock range        drawed his hint to the unconverted      and saying whar will you have it shot        cherokee bob at the last debating      what was the question i forgot        but jones didnt like bobs way of stating       nothing of that kind eh  you mean        something milder  lets seeo joe      tell to the stranger that little scene        out of the babes in the woods  you know      babes was the name that we gave em sir        two lean lads in their teens and greener      than even the belt of spruce and fir        where they built their nest and each day grew leaner       no one knew where they came from  none        cared to ask if they had a mother      runaway schoolboys maybe  one        tall and dark as a spruce the other      blue and gold in the eyes and hair        soft and low in his speech but rarely      talking with us and we didnt care        to get at their secret at all unfairly       for they were so quiet so sad and shy        content to trust each other solely      that somehow wed always shut one eye        and never seem to observe them wholly      as they passed to their work  twas a wornout claim        and it paid them grub  they could live without it      for the boys had a way of leaving game        in their tent and forgetting all about it       yet no one asked for their secret  dumb        it lay in their big eyes heavy hollows      it was understood that no one should come        to their tent unawares save the bees and swallows      so they lived alone  until one warm night        i was sitting here at the tentdoorso sir      when out of the sunsets rosy light        up rose the sheriff of mariposa       i knew at once there was something wrong        for his hand and his voice shook just a little      and there isnt much you can fetch along        to make the sinews of jack hill brittle      go warn the babes he whispered hoarse        tell them im comingto get and scurry      for ive got a story thats badand worse        ive got a warrant gd dn it hurry       too late they had seen him cross the hill        i ran to their tent and found them lying      dead in each others arms and still        clasping the drug they had taken flying      and there lay their secret cold and bare        their life their trialthe old old story      for the sweet blue eyes and the golden hair        was a womans shame and a womans glory       who were they  ask no more or ask        the sun that visits their grave so lightly      ask of the whispering reeds or task        the mourning crickets that chirrup nightly      all of their life but its love forgot        everything tender and soft and mystic      these are our babes in the woodsyouve got        wellhuman naturethats characteristic     the latest chinese outrage       it was noon by the sun we had finished our game      and was passin remarks goin back to our claim      jones was countin his chips smith relievin his mind      of ideas that a straight should beat three of a kind      when johnson of elko came gallopin down      with a look on his face twixt a grin and a frown      and he calls drop your shovels and face right about      for them chinees from murphys are cleanin us out           with their chingaringchow           and their chiccolorow           theyre bent upon making           no slouch of a row       then jonesmy own pardnerlooks up with a sigh      its your washbill sez he and i answers you lie      but afore he could draw or the others could arm      up tumbles the bates boys who heard the alarm      and a yell from the hilltop and roar of a gong      mixed up with remarks like hi yi changawong      and bombs shells and crackers that crashed through the trees      revealed in their wartogs four hundred chinees           four hundred chinee           we are eight dont ye see           that made a square fifty           to just one o we       they were dressed in their best but i grieve that that same      was largely made up of our own to their shame      and my pardners best shirt and his trousers were hung      on a spear and above him were tauntingly swung      while that beggar chey lee like a conjurer sat      pullin out eggs and chickens from johnsons best hat      and batess game rooster was part of their loot      and all of smiths pigs were skyugled to boot      but the climax was reached and i like to have died      when my demijohn empty came down the hillside           down the hillside           what once held the pride           of robertson county           pitched down the hillside       then we axed for a

hundred is great odds i own      but this yers a white mani plays it alone      and he sprang up the hillsideto stop him none dare      till a yell from the top told a white man was there           a white man was there           we prayed he might spare           those misguided heathens           the few clothes they wear       they fled and he followed but no matter where      they fled to escape himthe white man was there      till we missed first his voice on the pinewooded slope      and we knew for the heathen henceforth was no hope      and the yells they grew fainter when petersen said      it simply was human to bury his dead           and then with slow tread           we crept up in dread           but found nary mortal there           living or dead       but there was his trail and the way that they came      and yonder no doubt he was bagging his game      when jones drops his pickaxe and thompson says shoo      and both of em points to a cage of bamboo      hanging down from a tree with a label that swung      conspicuous with letters in some foreign tongue      which when freely translated the same did appear      was the chinese for saying a white man is here           and as we drew near           in anger and fear           bound hand and foot johnson           looked down with a leer       in his mouth was an opium pipewhich was why      he leered at us so with a drunkenlike eye      they had shaved off his eyebrows and tacked on a cue      they had painted his face of a coppery hue      and rigged him all up in a heathenish suit      then softly departed each man with his loot           yes every galoot           and ah sin to boot           had left him there hanging           like ripening fruit       at a mass meeting held up at murphys next day      there were seventeen speakers and each had his say      there were twelve resolutions that instantly passed      and each resolution was worse than the last      there were fourteen

free was the touch of thompson upon his revolver      great the mortality incident on that lightness and freedom       yet not happy or gay was thompson the hero of angels      often spoke to himself in accents of anguish and sorrow      why do i make the graves of the frivolous youth who in folly      thoughtlessly pass my revolver forgetting its lightness and freedom       why in my daily walks does the surgeon drop his left eyelid      the undertaker smile and the sculptor of gravestone marbles      lean on his chisel and gaze  i care not oer much for attention      simple am i in my ways save but for this lightness and freedom       so spake that pensive manthis thompson the hero of angels      bitterly smiled to himself as he strode through the chapparal musing      why oh why echoed the pines in the dark olive depth far         resounding      why indeed whispered the sage brush that bent neath his feet         nonelastic       pleasant indeed was that morn that dawned oer the barroom at angels      where in their manhoods prime was gathered the pride of the hamlet      six took sugar in theirs and nine to the barkeeper lightly      smiled as they said well jim you can give us our regular fusil       suddenly as the gray hawk swoops down on the barnyard alighting      where pensively picking their corn the favorite pullets are         gathered      so in that festive

baldheaded snipe of the valley       as on its native plains the kangaroo startled by hunters      leaps with successive bounds and hurries away to the thickets      so leaped the crested hawk and quietly hopping behind him      ran and occasionally shot that baldheaded snipe of the valley       vain at the festive bar still lingered the people of angels      hearing afar in the woods the petulant pop of the pistol      never again returned the crested jay hawk of the mountains      never again was seen the baldheaded snipe of the valley       yet in the hamlet of angels when truculent speeches are uttered      when bloodshed and life alone will atone for some trifling         misstatement      maidens and men in their prime recall the last hero of angels      think of and vainly

thornbush clung       or where halfway the mountain side was furrowed        with many a seam and scar      or some abandoned tunnel dimly burrowed        a molehill seen so far       we looked in silence down across the distant        unfathomable reach      a silence broken by the guides consistent        and realistic speech       walker of murphys blew a hole through peters        for

of the ferry        and the dance that we had on the fork       of harrisons barn with its muster        of flags festooned over the wall      of the candles that shed their soft lustre        and tallow on headdress and shawl      of the steps that we took to one fiddle        of the dress of my queer visavis      and how i once went down the middle        with the man that shot sandy mcgee

recent        and theres something gone wrong with his lung      which is why it is proper and decent        i should write what he runs off his tongue       first he says miss hes read through your

with you miss he challenges fate      which the language that invalid uses        at times it were vain to relate       and he says that the mountains are fairer        for once being held in your thought      that each rock holds a wealth that is rarer        than ever by goldseeker sought      which are words he would put in these pages        by a party not given to guile      though the claim not at date paying wages        might produce in the sinful a smile       he remembers the ball at the ferry        and the ride and the gate and the vow      and the rose that you gave himthat very        same rose he is treasuring now      which his blanket hes kicked on his trunk miss        and insists on his legs being free      and his language to me from his bunk miss        is

    of that lottery drawed      by those sharps at the bay      and he says to me truthful how goes it      i replied it is far far from gay       for the camp has gone wild      on this lottery game      and has even beguiled      injin dick by the same      then said nye to me injins is pizen      but what is his number eh james       i replied 7 2      9 8 4 is his hand      when he started and drew      out a list which he scanned      then he softly went for his revolver      with language i cannot command       then i said william nye      but he turned upon me      and the look in his eye      was quite painful to see      and he says you mistake this poor injin      i protects from such sharps as you be       i was shocked and withdrew      but i grieve to relate      when he next met my view      injin dick was his mate      and the two around town was alying      in a frightfully dissolute state       which the war dance they had      round a tree at the bend      was a sight that was sad      and it seemed that the end      would not justify the proceedings      as i quiet remarked to a friend       for that injin he fled      the next day to his band      and we found william spread      very loose on the strand      with a peacefullike smile on his features      and a dollar greenback in his hand       which the same when rolled out      we observed with surprise      was what he no doubt      thought the number and prize      them figures in red in the corner      which the number of notes specifies       was it guile or a dream      is it nye that i doubt

levers much      and throttlevalves dont take to such          and as for jim          what happened to him      was one half fact and tother half whim       running one night on the line he saw      a houseas plain as the moral law      just by the moonlit bank and thence      came a drunken man with no more sense          than to drop on the rail          flat as a flail      as jim drove by with the midnight mail       down went the patentssteam reversed      too late for there came a thud  jim cursed      as the fireman there in the cab with him      kinder stared in the face of jim          and says what now          says jim what now      ive just run over a manthats how       the fireman stared at jim  they ran      back but they never found house nor man      nary a shadow within a mile      jim turned pale but he tried to smile          then on he tore          ten mile or more      in quicker time than hed made afore       would you believe it the very next night      up rose that house in the moonlight white      out comes the chap and drops as before      down goes the brake and the rest encore          and so in fact          each night that act      occurred till folks swore jim was cracked       humph let me see its a year now most      that i met jim east and says hows your ghost      gone says jim and more its plain      that ghost dont trouble me again

man  well says i i guess      its time to stop this yer foolishness          so i crammed on steam          when there came a scream      from my fireman that jest broke my dream       youve killed

whip and turning his quid of tobacco      while on the dusty road and blent with the rays of the moonlight      we saw the long curl of his lash and the juice of tobacco descending       danger  sir i believe youindeed i may say on that subject      you your existence might put to the hazard and turn of a wager      i have seen danger  oh no not me sir indeed i assure you      twas only the man with the dog that is sitting alone in yon wagon       it was the geiger grade a mile and a half from the summit      black as your hat was the night and never a star in the heavens      thundering down the grade the gravel and stones we sent flying      over the precipice sidea thousand feet plumb to the bottom       halfway down the grade i felt sir a thrilling and creaking      then a lurch to one side as we hung on the bank of the canyon      then looking up the road i saw in the distance behind me      the off hind wheel of the coach just loosed from its axle and         following       one glance alone i gave then gathered together my ribbons      shouted and flung them outspread on the straining necks of my         cattle      screamed at the top of my voice and lashed the air in my frenzy      while down the geiger grade on three wheels the vehicle thundered       speed was our only chance when again came the ominous rattle      crack and another wheel slipped away and was lost in the darkness      two only now were left yet such was our fearful momentum      upright erect and sustained on two wheels the vehicle thundered       as some huge boulder unloosed from its rocky shelf on the mountain      drives before it the hare and the timorous squirrel far leaping      so down the geiger grade rushed the pioneer coach and before it      leaped the wild horses and shrieked in advance of the danger         impending       but to be brief in my tale  again ere we came to the level      slipped from its axle a wheel so that to be plain in my statement      a matter of twelve hundred yards or more as the distance may be      we traveled upon one wheel until we drove up to the station       then sir we sank in a heap but picking myself from the ruins      i heard a noise up the grade and looking i saw in the distance      the three wheels following still like moons on the horizon whirling      till circling they gracefully sank on the road at the side of the         station       this is my story sir a trifle indeed i assure you      much more perchance might be saidbut i hold him of all men most         lightly      who swerves from the truth in his tale  no thank you well since      you are pressing      perhaps i dont care if i do you may give me the same jimno         sugar     a question of privilege       reported by truthful james       it was andrew jackson sutter who despising mr cutter for remarks         he heard him utter in debate upon the floor      swung him up into the skylight in the peaceful pensive twilight         and then keerlessly proceeded makin no account what we did      to wipe up with his person casual dust upon the floor       now a square fight never frets me nor unpleasantness upsets me but         the simple thing that gets menow the job is done and gone      and weve come home free and merry from the peaceful cemetery         leavin cutter there with sutterthat mebbee just a stutter      on the part of mr cutter caused the loss we deeply mourn       some bashful hesitation just like spellin punctooationmight have         worked an aggravation on to sutters mournful mind      for the witnesses all vary ez to wot was said and nary a galoot will         toot his horn except the way he is inclined       but they all allow that sutter had begun a kind of mutter when         uprose mr cutter with a sickening kind of ease      and proceeded then to wade in to the subject then prevadin is         profanity degradin in words like unto these       onlike the previous speaker mr sutter of yreka he was but a         humble seekerand not like hima cuss      it was here that mr sutter softly reached for mr cutter when the         latter with a stutter said accustomed to discuss       then sutter he rose grimly and sorter smilin dimly bowed onto the         chairman primlyjust like cutter ez could be      drawled he guessed he must fallbackasmr cutter owned the         packashe just had played thejackas here cutters gun         went crack as mr sutter gasped and ended every man can see       but william henry pryorjust in range of sutters firehere         evinced a wild desire to do somebody harm      and in the general scrimmage no one thought if sutters image was         a misplaced punctooationlike the hole in pryors arm       for we all waltzed in together never carin to ask whether it was         sutter or was cutter we woz tryin to abate      but we couldnt help perceivin when we took to inkstand heavin         that the process was relievin to the sharpness of debate       so weve come home free and merry from the peaceful cemetery and i         make no commentary on these simple childish games      things is various and humanand the man aint born of woman who is

wot you thought        and he knew wot you did      he could find things untaught        no matter whar hid      and he went to it blindfold and smiling being led by the hand like         a kid       then i glanced at bill nye        and i sez without pride      youll excuse us  weve nigh        on to nothin to hide      but if some gent will lend us a twenty well hide it whar folks         shall decide       it was billsons own self        who forked over the gold      with a smile  thars the pelf        he remarked  i make bold      to advance it and go twenty better that ill find it without being         told       then i passed it to nye        who repassed it to me      and we bandaged each eye        of that billsonez we      softly dropped that coin in his coat pocket ez the hull crowd         around us could see       that was all  hed one hand        locked in mine  then he groped      we could not understand        why that minit nye sloped      for we knew wed the dead thing on billsoneven more than we         dreamed of or hoped       for he stood thar in doubt        with his hand to his head      then he turned and lit out        through the door where nye fled      draggin me and the rest of us arter while we larfed till we         thought we was dead       till he overtook nye        and went through him  words fail      for what follers  kin i        paint our agonized wail      ez he drew from nyes pocket that twenty wot we sworn was in his own         coattail       and it was  but when found        it proved bogus and brass      and the question goes round        how the thing kem to pass      or if passed woz it passed thar by william and i listens and         echoes alas       for the days when the skill        of the keerds was no blind

nights was kinder lengthenin out the rains had jest begun      when all the camp came up to petes to have their usual fun      but we all sot kinder sadlike around the barroom stove      till smith got up permiskisslike and this remark he hove      thars a new game down in frisco that ez far ez i can see      beats euchre poker and vantoon they calls the spellin bee       then brown of calaveras simply hitched his chair and spake      poker is good enough for me and lanky jim sez shake      and bob allowed he warnt proud but he must say right thar      that the man who tackled euchre hed his education squar      this brought up lenny fairchild the schoolmaster who said      he knew the game and he would give instructions on that head       for instance take some simple word sez he like separate      now who can spell it  dog my skin ef thar was one in eight      this set the boys all wild at once  the chairs was put in row      and at the head was lanky jim and at the foot was joe      and high upon the bar itself the schoolmaster was raised      and the barkeep put his glasses down and sat and silent gazed       the first word out was parallel and seven let it be      till joe waltzed in his double l betwixt the a and e      for since he drilled them mexicans in san jacintos fight      thar warnt no prouder man got up than pistol joe that night      till rhythm came  he tried to smile then said they had him         there      and lanky jim with one long stride got up and took his chair       o little kids my pretty kids twas touchin to survey      these bearded men with weppings on like schoolboys at their play      theyd laugh with glee and shout to see each other lead the van      and bob sat up as monitor with a cue for a rattan      till the chair gave out incinerate and brown said hed be durned      if any such blamed word as that in school was ever learned       when phthisis came they all sprang up and vowed the man who rung      another blamed greek word on them be taken out and hung      as they sat down again i saw in bilsons eye a flash      and brown of calaveras was atwistin his mustache      and when at last brown slipped on gneiss and bilson took his chair      he dropped some casual words about some folks who dyed their hair       and then the chair grew very white and the chair said hed adjourn      but poker dick remarked that he would wait and get his turn      then with a tremblin voice and hand and with a wanderin eye      the chair next offered eiderduck and dick began with i      and bilson smiledthen bilson shrieked  just how the fight begun      i never knowed for bilson dropped and dick he moved up one       then certain gents arose and said theyd business down in camp      and ez the road was rather dark and ez the night was damp      theydhere got up threefingered jack and locked the door and         yelled      no not one mothers son goes out till that thar word is spelled      but while the words were on his lips he groaned and sank in pain      and sank with webster on his chest and worcester on his brain       below the bar dodged poker dick and tried to look ez he      was huntin up authorities

whitening down      was never as cold or white as they        ho starbuck and pinckney and tenterden        run for your shallops gather your men          scatter your boats on the lower bay       good cause for fear  in the thick midday      the hulk that lay by the rotting pier      filled with the children in happy play      parted its moorings and drifted clear        drifted clear beyond reach or call        thirteen children they were in all          all adrift in the lower bay       said a hardfaced skipper god help us all      she will not float till the turning tide      said his wife my darling will hear my call      whether in sea or heaven she bide        and she lifted a quavering voice and high        wild and strange as a seabirds cry          till they shuddered and wondered at her side       the fog drove down on each laboring crew      veiled each from each and the sky and shore      there was not a sound but the breath they drew      and the lap of water and creak of oar        and they felt the breath of the downs fresh blown        oer leagues of clover and cold gray stone          but not from the lips that had gone before       they came no more  but they tell the tale      that when fogs are thick on the harbor reef      the mackerel fishers shorten sail      for the signal they know will bring relief        for the voices of children still at play        in a phantom hulk that drifts alway          through channels whose waters never fail       it is but a foolish shipmans tale      a theme for a poets idle page      but still when the mists of doubt prevail      and we lie becalmed by the shores of age        we hear from the misty troubled shore        the voice of the children gone before          drawing the soul to its anchorage     a newport romance       they say that she died of a broken heart        i tell the tale as twas told to me      but her spirit lives and her soul is part        of this sad old house by the sea       her lover was fickle and fine and french        it was nearly a hundred years ago      when he sailed away from her armspoor wench        with the admiral rochambeau       i marvel much what periwigged phrase        won the heart of this sentimental quaker      at what goldlaced speech of those modish days        she listenedthe mischief take her       but she kept the posies of mignonette        that he gave and ever as their bloom failed      and faded though with her tears still wet        her youth with their own exhaled       till one night when the seafog wrapped a shroud        round spar and spire and tarn and tree      her soul went up on that lifted cloud        from this sad old house by the sea       and ever since then when the clock strikes two        she walks unbidden from room to room      and the air is filled that she passes through        with a subtle sad perfume       the delicate odor of mignonette        the ghost of a deadandgone bouquet      is all that tells of her story yet        could she think of a sweeter way        i sit in the sad old house tonight        myself a ghost from a farther sea      and i trust that this quaker woman might        in courtesy visit me       for the laugh is fled from porch and lawn        and the bugle died from the fort on the hill      and the twitter of girls on the stairs is gone        and the grand piano is still       somewhere in the darkness a clock strikes two        and there is no sound in the sad old house      but the long veranda dripping with dew        and in the wainscot a mouse       the light of my studylamp streams out        from the library door but has gone astray      in the depths of the darkened hall small doubt        but the quakeress knows the way       was it the trick of a sense oerwrought        with outward watching and inward fret      but i swear that the air just now was fraught        with the odor of mignonette       i open the window and seem almost        so still lies the oceanto hear the beat      of its great gulf artery off the coast        and to bask in its tropic heat       in my neighbors windows the gaslights flare        as the dancers swing in a waltz of strauss      and i wonder now could i fit that air        to the song of this sad old house       and no odor of mignonette there is        but the breath of morn on the dewy lawn      and mayhap from causes as slight as this        the quaint old legend is born       but the soul of that subtle sad perfume        as the spiced embalmings they say outlast      the mummy laid in his rocky tomb        awakens my buried past       and i think of the passion that shook my youth        of its aimless loves and its idle pains      and am thankful now for the certain truth        that only the sweet remains       and i hear no rustle of stiff brocade        and i see no face at my library door      for now that the ghosts of my heart are laid        she is viewless for evermore       but whether she came as a faint perfume        or whether a spirit in stole of white      i feel as i pass from the darkened room        she has been with my soul tonight

clear      some sweet home face his foolish thought surprises          and passes in a tear       some boyish vision of his eastern village          of uneventful toil      where golden harvests

dreaming just now when you spoke      or lost very like in the dust      of the years that slow fashioned the crust      on that bottle whose seal you last broke       twenty years was its age did you say      twenty years  ah my friend it is true      all the dreams that have flown since that day      all the hopes in that time passed away      old friend ive been drinking with you     fate       the sky is clouded the rocks are bare      the spray of the tempest is white in air      the winds are out with the waves at play      and i shall not tempt the sea today       the trail is narrow the wood is dim      the panther clings to the arching limb      and the lions whelps are abroad at play      and i shall not join in the chase today       but the ship sailed safely over the sea      and the hunters came from the chase in glee      and the town that was builded upon a rock      was swallowed up in the earthquake shock     grandmother tenterden       massachusetts shore 1800         i mind it was but yesterday      the sun was dim the air was chill      below the town below the hill      the sails of my sons ship did fill        my jacob who was cast away         he said god keep you mother dear      but did not turn to kiss his wife      they had some foolish idle strife      her tongue was like a twoedged knife        and he was proud as any peer         howbeit that night i took no note      of sea nor sky for all was drear      i marked not that the hills looked near      nor that the moon though curved and clear        through curdlike scud did drive and float         for with my darling went the joy      of autumn woods and meadows brown      i came to hate the little town      it seemed as if the sun went down        with him my only darling boy         it was the middle of the night      the wind it shifted westbysouth      it piled high up the harbor mouth      the marshes black with summer drouth        were all abroad with seafoam white         it was the middle of the night      the sea upon the garden leapt      and my sons wife in quiet slept      and i his mother waked and wept        when lo there came a sudden light         and there he stood  his seamans dress      all wet and dripping seemed to be      the pale blue fires of the sea      dripped from his garments constantly        i could not speak through cowardness         i come through night and storm he said      through storm and night and death said he      to kiss my wife if it so be      that strife still holds twixt her and me        for all beyond is peace he said         the sea is his and he who sent      the wind and wave can soothe their strife      and brief and foolish is our life      he stooped and kissed his sleeping wife        then sighed and like a dream he went         now when my darling kissed not me      but herhis wifewho did not wake      my heart within me seemed to break      i swore a vow nor thenceforth spake        of what my clearer eyes did see         and when the slow weeks brought him not      somehow we spake of aught beside      for sheher hope upheld her pride      and iin me all hope had died        and my son passed as if forgot         it was about the next springtide      she pined and faded where she stood      yet spake no word of ill or good      she had the hard cold edwards blood        in all her veinsand so she died         one time i thought before she passed      to give her peace but ere i spake      methought he will be first to break      the news in heaven and for his sake        i held mine back until the last         and here i sit nor care to roam      i only wait to hear his call      i doubt not that this day next fall      shall see me safe in port where all        and every ship at last comes home         and you have sailed the spanish main      and knew my jacob eh  mercy      ah god of wisdom hath the sea      yielded its dead to humble me        my boy my jacob turn again     guilds signal        william guild was engineer of the train which on the 19th of april      1813 plunged into meadow brook on the line of the stonington and      providence railroad  it was his custom as often as he passed his      home to whistle an alls well to his wife  he was found after      the disaster dead with his hand on the throttlevalve of his      engine        two low whistles quaint and clear        that was the signal the engineer      that was the signal that guild tis said      gave to his wife at providence      as through the sleeping town and thence              out in the night              on to the light        down past the farms lying white he sped       as a husbands greeting scant no doubt      yet to the woman looking out        watching and waiting no serenade      lovesong or midnight roundelay      said what that whistle seemed to say              to my trust true              so love to you        working or waiting goodnight it said       brisk young bagmen tourists fine      old commuters along the line        brakemen and porters glanced ahead      smiled as the signal sharp intense      pierced through the shadows of providence              nothing amiss              nothingit is        only guild calling his wife they said       summer and winter the old refrain      rang oer the billows of ripening grain        pierced through the budding boughs oerhead      flew down the track when the red leaves burned      like living coals from the engine spurned              sang as it flew              to our trust true        first of all duty  goodnight it said       and then one night it was heard no more      from stonington over rhode island shore        and the folk in providence smiled and said      as they turned in their beds the engineer      has once forgotten his midnight cheer              one only knew              to his trust true        guild lay under his engine dead     aspiring miss de laine       a chemical narrative       certain facts which serve to explain      the physical charms of miss addie de laine      who as the common reports obtain      surpassed in complexion the lily and rose      with a very sweet mouth and a retrousse nose      a figure like hebes or that which revolves      in a milliners window and partially solves      that question which mentor and moralist pains      if grace may exist minus feeling or brains       of course the young lady had beaux by the score      all that she wantedwhat girl could ask more      lovers that sighed and lovers that swore      lovers that danced and lovers that played      men of profession of leisure and trade      but one who was destined to take the high part      of holding that mythical treasure her heart      this lover the wonder and envy of town      was a practicing chemist a fellow called brown       i might here remark that twas doubted by many      in regard to the heart if miss addie had any      but no one could look in that eloquent face      with its exquisite outline and features of grace      and mark through the transparent skin how the tide      ebbed and flowed at the impulse of passion or pride      none could look who believed in the bloods circulation      as argued by harvey but saw confirmation      that here at least nature had triumphed oer art      and as far as complexion went she had a heart       but this par parenthesis  brown was the man      preferred of all others to carry her fan      hook her glove drape her shawl and do all that a belle      may demand of the lover she wants to treat well      folks wondered and stared that a fellow called brown      abstracted and solemn in manner a clown      ill dressed with a lingering smell of the shop      should appear as her escort at party or hop      some swore he had cooked up some villainous charm      or love philter not in the regular pharm      acopoeia and thus from pure malice prepense      had bewitched and bamboozled the young ladys sense      others thought with more reason the secret to lie      in a magical wash or indelible dye      while society with its censorious eye      and judgment impartial stood ready to damn      what wasnt improper as being a sham       for a fortnight the townfolk had all been agog      with a party the finest the season had seen      to be given in honor of miss pollywog      who was just coming out as a belle of sixteen      the guests were invited but one night before      a carriage drew up at the modest back door      of browns labratory and full in the glare      of a big purple bottle some closely veiled fair      alighted and entered to make matters plain      spite of veils and disguises twas addie de laine       as a bower for true love twas hardly the one      that a lady would choose to be wooed in or won      no odor of rose or sweet jessamines sigh      breathed a fragrance to hallow their pledge of troth by      nor the balm that exhales from the odorous thyme      but the gaseous effusions of chloride of lime      and salts which your chemist delights to explain      as the base of the smell of the rose and the drain      think of this o ye lovers of sweetness and know      what you smell when you snuff up lubin or pinaud       i pass by the greetings the transports and bliss      which of course duly followed a meeting like this      and come down to businessfor such the intent      of the lady who now oer the crucible leant      in the glow of a furnace of carbon and lime      like a fairy called up in the new pantomime      and give but her words as she coyly looked down      in reply to the questioning glances of brown      i am taking the drops and am using the paste      and the little white powders that had a sweet taste      which you told me would brighten the glance of my eye      and the depilatory and also the dye      and im charmed with the trial and now my dear brown      i have one other favornow ducky dont frown      only one for a chemist and genius like you      but a trifle and one you can easily do      now listen tomorrow you know is the night      of the birthday soiree of that pollywog fright      and im to be there and the dress i shall wear      is too lovely but  but what then ma chere      said brown as the lady came to a full stop      and glanced round the shelves of the little back shop      well i wanti want something to fill out the skirt      to the proper dimensions without being girt      in a stiff crinoline or caged in a hoop      that shows through ones skirt like the bars of a coop      something light that a lady may waltz in or polk      with a freedom that none but you masculine folk      ever know  for however poor woman aspires      shes always bound down to the earth by these wires      are you listening  nonsense dont stare like a spoon      idiotic some light thing and spacious and soon      something likewell in factsomething like a balloon       here she paused and here brown overcome by surprise      gave a doubting assent with still wondering eyes      and the lady departed  but just at the door      something happenedtis true it had happened before      in this sanctum of sciencea sibilant sound      like some element just from its trammels unbound      or two substances that their affinities found       the night of the anxiously looked for soiree      had come with its fair ones in gorgeous array      with the rattle of wheels and the tinkle of bells      and the how do ye dos and the hope you are wells      and the crush in the passage and last lingering look      you give as you hang your best hat on the hook      the rush of hot air as the door opens wide      and your entrythat blending of selfpossessed pride      and humility shown in your perfectbred stare      at the folk as if wondering how they got there      with other tricks worthy of vanity fair      meanwhile the safe topic the beat of the room      already was losing its freshness and bloom      young people were yawning and wondering when      the dance would come off and why didnt it then      when a vague expectation was thrilling the crowd      lo the door swung its hinges with utterance proud      and pompey announced with a trumpetlike strain      the entrance of brown and miss addie de laine       she entered but oh how imperfect the verb      to express to the senses her movement superb      to say that she sailed in more clearly might tell      her grace in its buoyant and billowy swell      her robe was a vague circumambient space      with shadowy boundaries made of pointlace      the rest was but guesswork and well might defy      the power of critical feminine eye      to define or describe twere as futile to try      the gossamer web of the cirrus to trace      floating far in the blue of a warm summer sky       midst the humming of praises and glances of beaux      that greet our fair maiden wherever she goes      brown slipped like a shadow grim silent and black      with a look of anxiety close in her track      once he whispered aside in her delicate ear      a sentence of warningit might be of fear      dont stand in a draught if you value your life      nothing moresuch advice might be given your wife      or your sweetheart in times of bronchitis and cough      without mystery romance or frivolous scoff      but hark to the music the dance has begun      the closely draped windows wide open are flung      the notes of the piccolo joyous and light      like bubbles burst forth on the warm summer night      round about go the dancers in circles they fly      trip trip go their feet as their skirts eddy by      and swifter and lighter but somewhat too plain      whisks the fair circumvolving miss addie de laine      taglioni and cerito well might have pined      for the vigor and ease that her movements combined      een rigelboche never flung higher her robe      in the naughtiest city thats known on the globe      twas amazing twas scandalous lost in surprise      some opened their mouths and a few shut their eyes       but hark  at the moment miss addie de laine      circling round at the outer edge of an ellipse      which brought her fair form to the window again      from the arms of her partner incautiously slips      and a shriek fills the air and the music is still      and the crowd gather round where her partner forlorn      still frenziedly points from the wide windowsill      into space and the night for miss addie was gone      gone like the bubble that bursts in the sun      gone like the grain when the reaper is done      gone like the dew on the fresh morning grass      gone without parting farewell and alas      gone with a flavor of hydrogen gas       when the weather is pleasant you frequently meet      a whiteheaded man slowly pacing the street      his trembling hand shading his lacklustre eye      half blind with continually scanning the sky      rumor points him as some astronomical sage      reperusing by day the celestial page      but the reader sagacious will recognize brown      trying vainly to conjure his lost sweetheart down      and learn the stern moral this story must teach      that genius may lift its love out of its reach     a legend of cologne               above the bones              st ursula owns      and those of the virgins she chaperons              above the boats              and the bridge that floats      and the rhine and the steamers smoky throats          above the chimneys and quainttiled roofs          above the clatter of wheels and hoofs          above newmarkets open space          above that consecrated place      where the genuine bones of the magi seen are      and the dozen shops of the real farina          higher than even old hohestrasse          whose houses threaten the timid passer              above them all              through scaffolds tall      and spires like delicate limbs in splinters              the great colognes              cathedral stones      climb through the storms of eight hundred winters               unfinished there              in high midair          the towers halt like a broken prayer              through years belated              unconsummated          the hope of its architect quite frustrated              its very youth              they say forsooth          with a quite improper purpose mated              and every stone              with a curse of its own          instead of that sermon shakespeare stated              since the day its choir              which all admire          by colognes archbishop was consecrated               ah that was a day              one well might say      to be marked with the largest whitest stone      to be found in the towers of all cologne              along the rhine              from old rheinstein      the people flowed like their own good wine              from rudesheim              and geisenheim      and every spot that is known to rhyme      from the famed cats castle of st goarshausen      to the pictured roofs of assmannshausen              and down the track              from quaint schwalbach          to the clustering tiles of bacharach              from bingen hence              to old coblentz      from every castellated crag      where the robber chieftains kept their swag      the folk flowed in and obercassel      shone with the pomp of knight and vassal          and pouring in from near and far          as the rhine to its bosom draws the ahr          or takes the arm of the sober mosel          so in cologne knight squire and losel          choked up the citys gates with men          from old st stephen to zint marjen           what had they come to see  ah me          i fear no glitter of pageantry              nor sacred zeal              for churchs weal      nor faith in the virgins bones to heal          nor childlike trust in frank confession          drew these who dyed in deep transgression              still in each nest              on every crest      kept stolen goods in their possession              but only their gout              for something new      more rare than the roast of a wandering jew              orto be exact              to seein fact          a christian soul in the very act          of being damned secundum artem          by the devil before a soul could part em               for a rumor had flown              throughout cologne      that the church in fact was the devils own              that its architect              being long suspect      had confessed to the bishop that he had wrecked          not only his own soul but had lost          the very first christian soul that crossed          the sacred threshold and all in fine          for that very beautiful design              of the wonderful choir              they were pleased to admire          and really he must be allowed to say          to speak in a purely business way          that taking the ruling market prices          of souls and churches in such a crisis              it would be shown              and his grace must own          it was really a bargain for cologne               such was the tale              that turned cheeks pale      with the thought that the enemy might prevail              and the church doors snap              with a thunderclap      on a christian soul in that devils trap              but a wiser few              who thought that they knew      colognes archbishop replied pooh pooh              just watch him and wait              and as sure as fate      youll find that the bishop will give checkmate               one here might note              how the popular vote      as shown in all legends and anecdote              declares that a breach              of trust to oerreach      the devil is something quite proper for each              and really if you              give the devil his due      in spite of the proverbits something youll rue              but to lie and deceive him              to use and to leave him      from job up to faust is the way to receive him              though no one has heard              it ever averred      that the father of lies ever yet broke his word              but has left this position              in every tradition      to be taken alone by the truthloving christian              bom from the tower              it is the hour      the host pours in in its pomp and power              of banners and pyx              and high crucifix      and crosiers and other processional sticks              and no end of marys              in quaint reliquaries      to gladden the souls of all true antiquaries              and an osculum pacis              a myth to the masses      who trusted their bones more to mail and cuirasses              all borne by the throng              who are marching along      to the square of the dom with processional song              with the flaring of dips              and bending of hips      and the chanting of hundred perfunctory lips              and some good little boys              who had come up from neuss      and the quirinuskirche to show off their voice              all march to the square              of the great dom and there      file right and left leaving alone and quite bare              a covered sedan              containingso ran      the rumorthe victim to take off the ban               they

sulphurous presence in that sacred place              two carmelites stand              on the right and left hand      of the covered sedan chair to wait the command              of the prelate to

and is fair               a woman and known              to them allone must own      too well known to the many today to be shown              as a martyr or een              as a christian  a queen      of pleasance and revel of glitter and sheen              so bad that the worst              of cologne spake up first      and declared twas an outrage to suffer one curst              and already a fief              of the satanic chief      to martyr herself for the churchs relief              but in vain fell their sneer              on the mob who i fear      on the whole felt a strong disposition to cheer               a woman and there              she stands in the glare      of the pitiless sun and their pitying stare              a woman still young              with garments that clung      to a figure though wasted with passion and wrung              with remorse and despair              yet still passing fair      with jewels and gold in her dark shining hair              and cheeks that are faint              neath her dyes and her paint      a woman most surelybut hardly a saint               she moves  she has gone              from their pity and scorn              she has mounted alone              the first step of stone      and the high swinging doors she wide open has thrown              then pauses and turns              as the altar blaze burns      on her cheeks and with one sudden gesture she spurns              archbishop and prior              knight ladye and friar      and her voice rings out high from the vault of the choir               o

    naught remains but a womans form prone on the floor              but they still see a trace              of that glow in her face      that they saw in the light of the altars high blaze              on the image that stands              with the babe in its hands      enshrined in the churches of all christian lands               a te deum sung              a censer high swung      with praise

marble or cold              in iron and brass              in gown and cuirass      the knights priests and bishops who came to that mass              and high oer the rest              with her babe

dost thou answer to my kiss      o sweetheart what is this            lieth there so cold     the old campfire       now shift the blanket pad before your saddle back you fling      and draw your cinch up tighter till the sweat drops from the ring      weve a dozen miles to cover ere we reach the next divide      our limbs are stiffer now than when we first set out to ride      and worse the horses know it and feel the leggrip tire      since in the days when long ago we sought the old campfire       yes twenty years  lord how wed scent its incense down the trail      through balm of bay and spice of spruce when eye and ear would fail      and worn and faint from useless quest we crept like this to rest      or flushed with luck and youthful hope we rode like this abreast      ay straighten up old friend and let the mustang think hes nigher      through looser rein and stirrup strain the welcome old campfire       you know the shout that would ring out before us down the glade      and start the blue jays like a flight of arrows through the shade      and sift the thin pine needles down like slanting shining rain      and send the squirrels scampering back to their holes again      until we saw blueveiled and dim or leaping like desire      that flame of twenty years ago which lit the old campfire       and then that rest on natures breast when talk had dropped and slow      the night wind went from tree to tree with challenge soft and low      we lay on lazy elbows propped or stood to stir the flame      till up the soaring redwoods shaft our shadows danced and came      as if to draw us with the sparks high oer its unseen spire      to the five stars that kept their ward above the old campfire       those picket stars whose tranquil watch half soothed half shamed         our sleep      what recked we then what beasts or men around might lurk or creep      we lay and heard with listless ears the faroff panthers cry      the near coyotes snarling snap the grizzlys deepdrawn sigh      the brown bears blundering human tread the gray wolves yelping         choir      beyond the magic circle drawn around the old campfire       and then that morn  was ever morn so filled with all things new      the light that fell through long brown aisles from out the kindling         blue      the creak and yawn of stretching boughs the jaybirds early call      the rattattat of woodpecker that waked the woodland hall      the fainter stir of lower life in fern and brake and brier      till flashing leaped the torch of day from last nights old campfire       well well well see it once again we should be near it now      its scarce a mile to where the trail strikes off to skirt the slough      and then the dip to indian spring the wooded rise andstrange      yet here should stand the blasted pine that marked our farther range      and herewhats this  a ragged swab of ruts and stumps and mire      sure this is not the sacred grove that hid the old campfire       yet heres the blaze i cut myself and theres the stumbling ledge      with quartz outcrop that lay atop now leveled to its edge      and mounds of mossgrown stumps beside the woodmans rotting chips      and gashes in the hillside that gape with dumb red lips      and yet above the shattered wreck and ruin curling higher      ah yesstill lifts the smoke that marked the welcome old campfire       perhaps some friend of twenty years still lingers there to raise      to weary hearts and tired eyes that beacon of old days      perhaps but stay tis gone and yet once more it lifts as though      to meet our tardy blundering steps and seems to move and lo      whirls by us in a rush of soundthe vanished funeral pyre      of hopes and fears that twenty years burned in the old campfire       for see beyond the prospect spreads with chimney spire and roof      two iron bands across the trail clank to our mustangs hoof      above them leap two blackened threads from limblopped tree to tree      to where the whitewashed station speeds its message to the sea      rein in  rein in  the quest is oer  the goal of our desire      is but the train whose track has lain across the old campfire     the stationmaster of lone prairie       an empty bench a sky of grayest etching      a bare bleak shed in blackest silhouette      twelve years of platform and before them stretching      twelve miles of prairie glimmering through the wet       north south east westthe same dull gray persistence      the tattered vapors of a vanished train      the narrowing rails that meet to pierce the distance      or break the columns of the faroff rain       naught but myself nor form nor figure breaking      the long hushed level and stark shining waste      nothing that moves to fill the vision aching      when the last shadow fled in sullen haste       nothing beyond  ah yes  from out the station      a stiff gaunt figure thrown against the sky      beckoning me with some wooden salutation      caught from his signals as the train flashed by       yielding me place beside him with dumb gesture      born of that reticence of sky and air      we sit apart yet wrapped in that one vesture      of silence sadness and unspoken care       each following his own thoughtaround us darkening      the rainwashed boundaries and stretching track      each following those dim parallels and hearkening      for longlost voices that will not come back       until unaskedi knew not why or wherefore      he yielded bit by bit his dreary past      like gathered clouds that seemed to thicken there for      some dull downdropping of their care at last       long had he lived there  as a boy had started      from the stacked corn the indians painted face      heard the wolves howl the wearying waste that parted      his fathers hut from the last campingplace       nature had mocked him thrice had claimed the reaping      with scythe of fire of lands she once had sown      sent the tornado round his hearthstone heaping      rafters dead faces that were like his own       then came the war time  when its shadow beckoned      he had walked dumbly where the flag had led      through swamp and fenunknown unpraised unreckoned      to famine fever and a prison bed       till the storm passed and the slow tide returning      cast him a wreck beneath his native sky      here at his watch gave him the chance of earning      scant means to livewho won the right to die       all this i heardor seemed to hearhalf blending      with the low murmur of the coming breeze      the call of some lost bird and the unending      and tireless sobbing of those grassy seas       until at last the spell of desolation      broke with a trembling star and faroff cry      the coming train  i glanced around the station      all was as empty as the upper sky       naught but myself nor form nor figure waking      the long hushed level and stark shining waste      naught but myself that cry and the dull shaking      of wheel and axle stopped in breathless haste       now thenlook sharp  eh what  the stationmaster      thars none  we stopped here of our own accord      the man got killed in that downtrain disaster      this time last evening  right there  all aboard     the mission bells of monterey       o bells that rang o bells that sang      above the martyrs wilderness      till from that reddened coastline sprang      the gospel seed to cheer and bless      what are your garnered sheaves today      o mission bells  eleison bells      o mission bells of monterey       o bells that crash o bells that clash      above the chimneycrowded plain      on wall and tower your voices dash      but never with the old refrain      in mart and temple gone astray      ye dangle bells  ye jangle bells      ye wrangle bells of monterey       o bells that die so far so nigh      come back once more across the sea      not with the zealots furious cry      not with the creeds austerity      come with his love alone to stay      o mission bells  eleison bells      o mission bells of monterey          this poem was set to music by monsieur charles gounod     crotalus

dead at pittsfield mass 1876       o poor romancerthou whose printed page      filled with rude speech and ruder forms of strife      was given to heroes in whose vulgar rage      no trace appears of gentler ways and life       thou who wast wont of commoner clay to build      some rough achilles or some ajax tall      thou whose free brush too oft was wont to gild      some single virtue till it dazzled all       what right hast thou beside this laureled bier      whereon all manhood lieswhereon the wreath      of harvard rests the civic crown and here      the starry flag and sword and

castra or caster      as your latin master      will further explain to you some day      though even the wisest err      and shakespeare writes cicester      while every visitor      who doesnt say cissiter      is in cirencester considered astray       a hundred miles from london town      where the river goes curving and broadening down      from treetop to spire and spire to mast      till it tumbles outright in the channel at last      a hundred miles from that flat foreshore      that the danes and the northmen haunt no more      theres a little cup in the cotswold hills      which a spring in a meadow bubbles and fills      spanned by a herons wingcrossed by a stride      calm and untroubled by dreams of pride      guiltless of fame or ambitions aims      that is the source of the lordly thames      remark here again that custom contemns      both tames and thamesyou must say tems      but why no matterfrom them you can see      cirencesters tall spires loom up oer the lea       a d five hundred and fiftytwo      the saxon invadersa terrible crew      had forced the lines of the britons through      and cirencester half mud and thatch      dry and crisp as a tinder match      was fiercely beleaguered by foes whod catch      at any device that could harry and rout      the folk that so boldly were holding out       for the streets of the townas youll see today      were twisted and curved in a curious way      that kept the invaders still at bay      and the longest bolt that a saxon drew      was stopped ere a dozen of yards it flew      by a turn in the street and a law so true      that even these robbersof all laws scorners      knew you couldnt shoot arrows around street corners       so they sat them down on a little knoll      and each man scratched his saxon poll      and stared at the sky where clear and high      the birds of that summer went singing by      as if in his glee each motley jester      were mocking the foes of cirencester      till the jeering crow and the saucy linnet      seemed all to be saying ah youre not in it       high oer their heads the mavis flew      and the ouzelcock so black of hue      and the throstle with his note so true      you remember what shakespeare sayshe knew      and the soaring lark that kept dropping through      like a bucket spilling in wells of blue      and the merlinseen on heraldic panes      with legs as vague as the queen of spains       and the dashing swift that would ricochet      from the tufts of grasses before them yet      like bold antaeuswould each time bring      new life from the earth barely touched by his wing      and the swallow and martlet that always knew      the straightest way home  here a saxon churl drew      his breathtapped his foreheadan idea had got through       so they brought them some nets which straightway they filled      with the swallows and martletsthe sweet birds who build      in the houses of manall that innocent guild      who sing at their labor on eaves and in thatch      and they stuck on their feathers a rude lighted match      made of resin and tow  then they let them all go      to be free  as a childlike diversion  ah no      to work cirencesters red ruin and woe       for straight to each nest they flew in wild quest      of their homes and their fledgelingsthat they loved the best      and straighter than arrow of saxon eer sped      they shot oer the curving streets high overhead      bringing fire and terror to roof tree and bed      till the town broke in flame wherever they came      to the britons red ruinthe saxons red shame       yet theyre all gone together  today youll dig up      from mound or from barrow some arrow or cup      their fame is forgottentheir story is ended      neath the feet of the race they have mixed with and blended      but the birds are unchangedthe ouzelcock sings      still gold on his crest and still black on his wings      and the lark chants on high as he mounts to the sky      still brown in his coat and still dim in his eye      while the swallow or martlet is still a free nester      in the eaves and the roofs of thricebuilt cirencester     lines to

i couldnt quite compare      to my other plain or fair          fellow creatures       in your simple oval frame      you were not well known to fame      but to metwas all the same          whoeer drew you      for your face i cant forget      though i oftentimes regret      that somehow i never yet          saw quite through you       yet each morning when i rise      i go first to greet your eyes      and in turn you scrutinize          my presentment      and when shades of evening fall      as you hang upon my wall      youre the last thing i recall          with contentment       it is weakness yet i know      that i never turned to go      anywhere for weal or woe          but i lingered      for one parting thrilling flash      from your eyes to give that dash      to the curl of my mustache          that i fingered       if to some you may seem plain      and when people glance again      where you hang their lips refrain          from confession      yet they turn in stealth

scenes        these might be my very last lines      for perhaps sir youll kindly remember        if some other things youve forgot      that you last wrote the 4th of december        just six months ago ifrom this spot       from this spot that you said was the fairest        for once being held in my thought      now really i call that the barest        ofwell i wont say what i ought      for here i am back from my riches        my triumphs my tours and all that      and youre not to be found in the ditches        or temples of poverty flat       from paris we went for the season        to london when pa wired stop      mama says his health was the reason        ive heard that some things took a drop      but she said if my patience id summon        i could go back with him to the flat      perhaps i was thinking of some one        who of mewellwas not thinking that       of course you will say that i never        replied to the letter you wrote      that is just like a man  but however        i read itor how could i quote      and as to the stories youve heard no        dont tell me you haventi know      youll not believe one blessed word joe        but just whence they came let them go       and they came from sade lotski of yolo        whose father sold clothes on the bar      you called him joblotski you know joe        and the boys said her value was par      well we met her in parisjust flaring        with diamonds and lost in a hat      and she asked me how joseph was faring        in his lovesuit on poverty flat       she thought it would shame me  i met her        with a look joe that made her eyes drop      and i said that your lovesuit fared better        than any suit out of their shop      and i didnt blush thenas im doing        to find myself here all alone      and left joe to do all the sueing        to a lover thats certainly flown       in this brandnew hotel called the lily        i wonder who gave it that name      i really am feeling quite silly        to think i was once called the same      and i stare from its windows and fancy        im labeled to each passerby      ah gone is the old necromancy        for nothing seems right to my eye       on that hill there are stores that i knew not        theres a streetwhere i once lost my way      and the copse where you once tied my shoeknot        is shamelessly open as day      and that bank by the springi once drank there        and you called the place eden you know      now im banished like evethough the bank there        is belonging to adams and co       theres the rustle of silk on the sidewalk        just now there passed by a tall hat      but theres gloom in this boom and this wild talk        of the future of poverty flat      theres a decorous chill in the air joe        where once we were simple and free      and i hear theyve been making a mayor joe        of the man who shot sandy mcgee       but theres still the lap lap of the river        theres the song of the pines deep and low      how my longing for them made me quiver        in the park that they call fontainebleau      theres the snowpeak that looked on our dances        and blushed when the morning said go      theres a lot that remains which one fancies        but somehow theres never a joe       perhaps on the whole it is better        for you might have been changed like the rest      though its strange that im trusting this letter        to papa just to have it addressed      he thinks he may find you and really        seems kinder now im all alone      you might have been here joe if merely        to look what im willing to own       well well thats all past so goodnight joe        goodnight to the river and flat      goodnight to whats wrong and whats right joe        goodnight to the past and all that      to harrisons barn and its dancers        to the moon and the white peak of snow      and goodnight to the canyon that answers        my joe with its echo of no

great stupid        like papa and some men that i know      instead of just trusting to cupid        and to me for your money  ah joe      just to think you sent never a word dear        till you wrote to papa for consent      now i know why they had me transferred here        and the health of papawhat that meant       now i know why they call this the lily        why the man who shot sandy mcgee      you made mayor  twas becauseoh you silly        he once went down the middle with me      ive been fooled to the top of my bent here        so come and ask pardonyou know      that youve

legend of the cliff house san francisco       where the sturdy ocean breeze      drives the spray of roaring seas      that the cliff house balconies           overlook      there in spite of rain that balked      with his sandals duly chalked      once upon a tightrope walked           mr cooke       but the jesters lightsome mien      and his spangles and his sheen      all had vanished when the scene           he forsook      yet in some delusive hope      in some vague desire to cope      one still came to view the rope           walked by cooke       amid beautys bright array      on that strange eventful day      partly hidden from the spray           in a nook      stood florinda vere de vere      who with winddisheveled hair      and a rapt distracted air           gazed on cooke       then she turned and quickly cried      to her lover at her side      while her form with love and pride          wildly shook      clifford snook oh hear me now      here i break each plighted vow      theres but one to whom i bow           and thats cooke       haughtily that young man spoke      i descend from noble folk      seven oaks and then sennoak           lastly snook      is the way my name i trace      shall a youth of noble race      in affairs of love give place           to a cooke       clifford snook i know thy claim      to that lineage and name      and i think ive read the same           in horne tooke      but i swear by all divine      never never to be thine      till thou canst upon yon line           walk like cooke       though to that gymnastic feat      he no closer might compete      than to strike a balancesheet           in a book      yet thenceforward from that day      he his figure would display      in some wild athletic way           after cooke       on some household eminence      on a clothesline or a fence      over ditches drains and thence           oer a brook      he by high ambition led      ever walked and balanced      till the people wondering said           how like cooke       step by step did he proceed      nerved by valor not by greed      and at last the crowning deed           undertook      misty was the midnight air      and the cliff was bleak and bare      when he came to do and dare           just like cooke       through the darkness oer the flow      stretched the line where he should go      straight across as flies the crow           or the rook      one wild glance around he cast      then he faced the ocean blast      and he strode the cable last           touched by cooke       vainly roared the angry seas      vainly blew the ocean breeze      but alas the walkers knees           had a crook      and before he reached the rock      did they both together knock      and he stumbled with a shock           unlike cooke       downward dropping in the dark      like an arrow to its mark      or a fishpole when a shark           bites the hook      dropped the pole he could not save      dropped the walker and the wave      swift engulfed the rival brave           of j cooke       came a roar across the sea      of sealions in their glee      in a tongue remarkably           like chinook      and the maddened seagull seemed      still to utter as he screamed      perish thus the wretch who deemed           himself cooke       but on misty moonlit nights      comes a skeleton in tights      walks once more the giddy heights           he mistook      and unseen to mortal eyes      purged of grosser earthly ties      now at last in spirit guise           outdoes cooke       still the sturdy ocean breeze      sweeps the spray of roaring seas      where the cliff house balconies           overlook      and the maidens in their prime      reading of this mournful rhyme      weep where in the olden time           walked j cooke     the ballad of the emeu       oh say have you seen at the willows so green        so charming and rurally true      a singular bird with a manner absurd        which they call the australian emeu            have you        ever seen this australian emeu       it trots all around with its head on the ground        or erects it quite out of your view      and the ladies all cry when its figure they spy        oh what a sweet pretty emeu            oh do        just look at that lovely emeu       one day to this spot when the weather was hot        came matilda hortense fortescue      and beside her there came a youth of high name        augustus florell montague            the two        both loved that wild foreign emeu       with two loaves of bread then they fed it instead        of the flesh of the white cockatoo      which once was its food in that wild neighborhood        where ranges the sweet kangaroo            that too        is game for the famous emeu       old saws and gimlets but its appetite whets        like the worldfamous bark of peru      theres nothing so hard that the bird will discard        and nothing its taste will eschew            that you        can give that longlegged emeu       the time slipped away in this innocent play        when up jumped the bold montague      wheres that specimen pin that i gayly did win        in raffle and gave unto you            fortescue        no word spoke the guilty emeu       quick tell me his name whom thou gavest that same        ere these hands in thy blood i imbrue      nay dearest she cried as she clung to his side        im innocent as that emeu            adieu        he replied miss m h fortescue       down she dropped at his feet all as white as a sheet        as wildly he fled from her view      he thought twas her sinfor he knew not the pin        had been gobbled up by the emeu           all through        the voracity of that emeu     mrs judge jenkins       being the only genuine sequel to maud muller       maud muller all that summer day      raked the meadow sweet with hay       yet looking down the distant lane      she hoped the judge would come again       but when he came with smile and bow      maud only blushed and stammered haow       and spoke of her pa and wondered whether      hed give consent they should wed together       old muller burst in tears and then      begged that the judge would lend him ten       for trade was dull and wages low      and the craps this year were somewhat slow       and ere the languid summer died      sweet maud became the judges bride       but on the day that they were mated      mauds brother bob was intoxicated       and mauds relations twelve in all      were very drunk at the judges hall       and when the summer came again      the young bride bore him babies twain       and the judge was blest but thought it strange      that bearing children made such a change       for maud grew broad and red and stout      and the waist that his arm once clasped about       was more than he now could span and he      sighed as he pondered ruefully       how that which in maud was native grace      in mrs jenkins was out of place       and thought of the twins and wished that they      looked less like the men who raked the hay       on mullers farm and dreamed with pain      of the day he wandered down the lane       and looking down that dreary track      he half regretted that he came back       for had he waited he might have wed      some maiden fair and thoroughbred       for there be women fair as she      whose verbs and nouns do more agree       alas for maiden alas for judge      and the sentimentalthats onehalf fudge       for maud soon thought the judge a bore      with all his learning and all his lore       and the judge would have bartered mauds fair face      for more refinement and social grace       if of all words of tongue and pen      the saddest are it might have been       more sad are these we daily see      it is but hadnt ought to be     a geological madrigal       i have found out a gift for my fair        i know

were ashen and sober        the streets they were dirty and drear      it was night in the month of october        of my most immemorial year      like the skies i was perfectly sober        as i stopped at the mansion of shear      at the nightingaleperfectly sober        and the willowy woodland down here       here once in an alley titanic        of tenpins i roamed with my soul        of tenpins with mary my soul      they were days when my heart was volcanic        and impelled me to frequently roll        and made me resistlessly roll      till my tenstrikes created a panic

      my thoughts were decidedly queer      for i knew not the month was october        and i marked not the night of the year      i forgot that sweet morceau of auber        that the band oft performed down here      and i mixed the sweet music of auber        with the nightingales music by shear       and now as the night was senescent        and stardials pointed to morn        and cardrivers hinted of morn      at the end of the path a liquescent        and bibulous lustre was born      twas made by the barkeeper present        who mixed a duplicate horn      his two hands

till it trailed in the dust      in agony sobbed letting sink her        parasol till it trailed in the dust        till it sorrowfully trailed in the dust       then i pacified mary and kissed her        and tempted her into the room        and conquered her scruples and gloom      and we passed to the end of the vista        but were stopped by the warning of doom        by some words that were warning of doom      and i said what is written sweet sister        at the opposite end of the room      she sobbed as she answered all liquors        must be paid for ere leaving the room       then

door just as skating was over and marbles about to begin      for the fence in our back yard was broken and i saw as i peeped         through the slat      there were johnnyjumpups all around her and i knew it was         spring just by that       i never knew whether she saw me for she didnt say nothing to me      but ma heres a slat in the fence broke and the boy that is next         door can see      but the next day i climbed on our woodshed as you know mamma says         ive a right      and she calls out well peekin is manners and i answered her         sass is perlite       but i wasnt a bit mad no papa and to prove it the very next day      when she ran past our fence in the morning i happened to get in her         way      for you know i am chunked and clumsy as she says are all boys of         my size      and she nearly upset me she did pa and laughed till tears came in         her eyes       and then we were friends from that moment for i knew that she told         kitty sage      and she wasnt a girl that would flatterthat she thought i was         tall for my age      and i gave her four apples that evening and took her to ride on my         sled      and  what am i telling you this for  why papa my neighbor is         dead       you dont hear one half i am sayingi really do think its too bad      why you might have seen crape on her doorknob and noticed today         ive been sad      and theyve got her a coffin of rosewood and they say they have         dressed her in white      and ive never once looked through the fence pa since she diedat         eleven last night       and ma says its decent and proper as i was her neighbor and friend      that i should go there to the funeral and she thinks that you ought         to attend      but i am so clumsy and awkward i know i shall be in the way      and suppose they should speak to me papa i wouldnt know just what         to say       so i think i will get up quite earlyi know i sleep late but i know      ill be sure to wake up if our bridget pulls the string that ill tie         to my toe      and ill crawl through the fence and ill gather the johnnyjumpups         as they grew      round her feet the first day that i saw her and papa ill give         them to you       for youre a big man and you know pa can come and go just where         you choose      and youll take the flowers in to her and surely theyll never         refuse      but papa dont say theyre from johnny they wont understand         dont you see      but just lay them down on her bosom and papa shell know theyre         from me     miss ediths modest request       my papa knows you and he says youre a man who makes reading for         books      but i never read nothing you wrote nor did papai know by his         looks      so i guess youre like me when i talk and i talk and i talk all         the day      and they only say do stop that child or nurse take miss edith         away       but papa said if i was good i could ask youalone by myself      if you wouldnt write me a book like that little one up on the shelf      i dont mean the pictures of course for to make them youve got to         be smart      but the reading that runs all around them you knowjust the         easiest part       you neednt mind what its about for no one will see it but me      and janethats my nurseand johnhes the coachmanjust         only us three      youre to write of a bad little girl that was wicked and bold and         all that      and then youre to write if you please something goodvery good         of a cat       this cat she was virtuous and meek and kind to her parents and         mild      and careful and neat in her ways though her mistress was such a bad         child      and hours she would sit and would gaze when her mistressthats me         was so bad      and blink just as if she would say oh edith you make my heart         sad       and yet you would scarcely believe it that beautiful angelic cat      was blamed by the servants for stealing whatever they said shed         get at      and when john drank my milkdont you tell me  i know just the         way it was done      they said twas the catand she sitting and washing her face in         the sun       and then there was dick my canary  when i left its cage open one         day      they all made believe that she ate it though i know that the bird         flew away      and why  just because she was playing with a feather she found on         the floor      as if cats couldnt play with a feather without people thinking         twas more       why once we were romping together when i knocked down a vase from         the shelf      that cat was as grieved and distressed as if she had done it herself      and she walked away sadly and hid herself and never came out until         tea      so they say for they sent me to bed and she never came even to me       no matter whatever happened it was laid at the door of that cat      why once when i tore my apronshe was wrapped in it and i called         rat      why they blamed that on her  i shall neverno not to my dying         day      forget the pained look that she gave me when they slapped me and         took me away       of course you know just what comes next when a child is as lovely         as that      she wasted quite slowly away it was goodness was killing that cat      i know it was nothing she ate for her taste was exceedingly nice      but they said she stole bobbys ice cream and caught a bad cold         from the ice       and youll promise to make me a book like that little one up on the         shelf      and youll call her naomi because its a name that she just gave         herself      for shed scratch at my door in the morning and whenever id call         out whos there      she would answer naomi naomi like a christian i vow and declare       and youll put me and her in a book  and mind youre to say i was         bad      and i might have been badder than that but for the example i had      and youll say that she was a maltese andwhats that you asked         is she dead      why please sir there aint any cat

edith saw from her window       our windows not much though it fronts on the street          theres a fly in the pane that gets nothin to eat          but its curious how people think its a treat              for me to look out of the window       why when company comes and theyre all speaking low          with their chairs drawn together then some one says oh          edith dearthats a good childnow run love and go              and amuse yourself there at the window       or bobthats my brothercomes in with his chum          and they whisper and chuckle the same words will come          and its edith look here  oh i say what a rum              lot of things you can see from that window       and yet as i told you theres only that fly          buzzing round in the pane and a bit of blue sky          and the girl in the opposite window that i              look at when she looks from her window       and yet ive been thinking id so like to see          if what goes on behind her goes on behind me          and then goodness gracious what fun it would be              for us both as we sit by our window       how wed know when the parcels were hid in a drawer          or things taken out that one never sees more          what people come in and go out of the door              that we never see from the window       and that night when the stranger came home with our jane          i might see what i heard then that sounded so plain          like when my wet fingers i rub on the pane              which they wont let me do on my window       and id know why papa shut the door with a slam          and said something funny that sounded like jam          and then edithwhere are you  i said here i am              ah thats right dear look out of the window       they say when im grown up these things will appear          more plain than they do when i look at them here          but i think i see some things uncommonly clear              as i sit and look down from the window       what things  oh the things that i make up you know          out of stories ive readand they all pass below          ali baba the forty thieves all in a row              go by as i look

   when he nods to me here at the window       and that manhes our neighborjust gone for a ride          has three wives in the churchyard that lie side by side          so i call him bluebeard in search of his bride              while im sister anne at the window       and what do i call you  well heres what i do          when my sister expects you she puts me here too          but i wait till you enter to see if its you              and theni just open the window       dear child  yes thats me  oh you ask what thats for          well papa says youre povertys self and whats more          i

not be familiar to all readers i will repeat here that it is the habit of navigators to drop a day from their calendar in crossing westerly the 180th degree of longitude of greenwich adding a day in coming east and that the idea of the lost galleon had an origin as prosaic as the log of the first china mail steamer from san francisco  the explanation of the custom and its astronomical relations belongs rather to the usual textbooks than to poetical narration  if any reader thinks i have overdrawn the credulous superstitions of the ancient navigators i refer him to the veracious statements of maldonado de fonte the later voyages of la perouse and anson and the charts of 1640  in the charts of that day spanish navigators reckoned longitude e 360 degrees from the meridian of the isle of ferro  for the sake of perspicuity before a modern audience the more recent meridian of madrid was substituted  the custom of dropping a day at some arbitrary point in crossing the pacific westerly i need not say remains unaffected by any change of meridian  i know not if any galleon was ever really missing  for two hundred and fifty years an annual trip was made between acapulco and manila  it may be some satisfaction to the more severely practical of my readers to know that according to the best statistics of insurance the loss during that period would be exactly three vessels and six hundredths of a vessel which would certainly justify me in this summary disposition of one  the pliocene skull  this extraordinary fossil is in the possession of prof josiah d whitney of the state geological survey of california  the poem was based on the following paragraph from the daily press of 1868 a human skull has been found in california in the pliocene formation  this skull is the remnant not only of the earliest pioneer of this state but the oldest known human being the skull was found in a shaft 150 feet deep two miles from angels in calaveras county by a miner named james watson who gave it to mr scribner a merchant who gave it to dr jones who sent it to the state geological survey  the published volume of the state survey of the geology of california states that man existed here contemporaneously with the mastodon but this fossil proves that he was here before the mastodon was known to exist
