28315730	the days work  part i  by rudyard kipling     contents  part i  the bridgebuilders  a walking delegate  the ship that found herself  the tomb of his ancestors  the devil and the deep sea  william the conqueror part i  william the conqueror  part ii  the son of his father  the bridgebuilders  the least that findlayson of the public works department expected was a cie he dreamed of a c s i  indeed his friends told him that he deserved more  for three years he had endured heat and cold disappointment discomfort danger and disease with responsibility almost to topheavy for one pair of shoulders and day by day through that time the great kashi bridge over the ganges had grown under his charge now in less than three months if all went well his excellency the viceroy would open the bridge in state an archbishop would bless it and the first trainload of soldiers would come over it and there would be speeches  findlayson c e sat in his trolley on a construction line that ran along one of the main revetments  the huge stonefaced banks that flared away north and south for three miles on either side of the river and permitted himself to think of the end with its approaches his work was one mile and threequarters in length a latticegirder bridge trussed with the findlayson truss standing on sevenandtwenty brick piers each one of those piers was twentyfour feet in diameter capped with red agra stone and sunk eighty feet below the shifting sand of the ganges bed  above them was a railwayline fifteen feet broad above that again a cartroad of eighteen feet flanked with footpaths  at either end rose towers of red brick loopholed for musketry and pierced for big guns and the ramp of the road was being pushed forward to their haunches the raw earthends were crawling and alive with hundreds upon hundreds of tiny asses climbing out of the yawning borrowpit below with sackfuls of stuff and the hot afternoon air was filled with the noise of hooves the rattle of the drivers sticks and the swish and rolldown of the dirt  the river was very low and on the dazzling white sand between the three centre piers stood squat cribs of railwaysleepers filled within and daubed without with mud to support the last of the girders as those were riveted up in the little deep water left by the drought an overhead crane travelled to and fro along its spilepier jerking sections of iron into place snorting and backing and grunting as an elephant grunts in the timberyard  riveters by the hundred swarmed about the lattice sidework and the iron roof of the railway line hung from invisible staging under the bellies of the girders clustered round the throats of the piers and rode on the overhang of the footpathstanchions their firepots and the spurts of flame that answered each hammerstroke showing no more than pale yellow in the suns glare  east and west and north and south the constructiontrains rattled and shrieked up and down the embankments the piled trucks of brown and white stone banging behind them till the sideboards were unpinned and with a roar and a grumble a few thousand tons more material were flung out to hold the river in place findlayson c e turned on his trolley and looked over the face of the country that he had changed for seven miles around  looked back on the humming village of five thousand workmen up stream and down along the vista of spurs and sand across the river to the far piers lessening in the haze overhead to the guardtowers and only he knew how strong those were  and with a sigh of contentment saw that his work was good  there stood his bridge before him in the sunlight lacking only a few weeks work on the girders of the three middle piers  his bridge raw and ugly as original sin but pukka  permanent  to endure when all memory of the builder yea even of the splendid findlayson truss has perished  practically the thing was done  hitchcock his assistant cantered along the line on a little switchtailed kabuli pony who through long practice could have trotted securely over trestleand nodded to his chief  all but said he with a smile  ive been thinking about it the senior answered not half a bad job for two men is it  one  and a half  gad what a coopers hill cub i was when i came on the works hitchcock felt very old in the crowded experiences of the past three years that had taught him power and responsibility  you were rather a colt said findlayson i wonder how youll like going back to officework when this jobs over  i shall hate it said the young man and as he went on his eye followed findlaysons and he muttered isnt it damned good  i think well go up the service together findlayson said to himself  youre too good a youngster to waste on another man  cub thou wast assistant thou art  personal assistant and at simla thou shalt be if any credit comes to me out of the business  indeed the burden of the work had fallen altogether on findlayson and his assistant the young man whom he had chosen because of his rawness to break to his own needs  there were labour contractors by the halfhundred  fitters and riveters european borrowed from the railway workshops with perhaps twenty white and halfcaste subordinates to direct under direction the bevies of workmen  but none knew better than these two who trusted each other how the underlings were not to be trusted  they had been tried many times in sudden crises  by slipping of booms by breaking of tackle failure of cranes and the wrath of the river  but no stress had brought to light any man among men whom findlayson and hitchcock would have honoured by working as remorselessly as they worked themselves findlayson thought it over from the beginning the months of officework destroyed at a blow when the government of india at the last moment added two feet to the width of the bridge under the impression that bridges were cut out of paper and so brought to ruin at least half an acre of calculations and hitchcock new to disappointment buried his head in his arms and wept the heartbreaking delays over the filling of the contracts in england the futile correspondences hinting at great wealth of commissions if one only one rather doubtful consignment were passed the war that followed the refusal the careful polite obstruction at the other end that followed the war till young hitchcock putting one months leave to another month and borrowing ten days from findlayson spent his poor little savings of a year in a wild dash to london and there as his own tongue asserted and the later consignments proved put the fear of god into a man so great that he feared only parliament and said so till hitchcock wrought with him across his own dinner table and  he feared the kashi bridge and all who spoke in its name  then there was the cholera that came in the night to the village by the bridge works and after the cholera smote the smallpox  the fever they had always with them  hitchcock had been appointed a magistrate of the third class with whipping powers for the better government of the community and findlayson watched him wield his powers temperately learning what to overlook and what to look after  it was a long long reverie and it covered storm sudden freshets death in every manner and shape violent and awful rage against red tape half frenzying a mind that knows it should be busy on other things drought sanitation finance birth wedding burial and riot in the village of twenty warring castes argument expostulation persuasion and the blank despair that a man goes to bed upon thankful that his rifle is all in pieces in the guncase behind everything rose the black frame of the kashi bridge  plate by plate girder by girder span by span  and each pier of it recalled hitchcock the allround man who had stood by his chief without failing from the very first to this last  so the bridge was two mens work  unless one counted peroo as peroo certainly counted himself he was a lascar a kharva from bulsar familiar with every port between rockhampton and london who had risen to the rank of serang on the british india boats but wearying of routine musters and clean clothes had thrown up the service and gone inland where men of his calibre were sure of employment  for his knowledge of tackle and the handling of heavy weights peroo was worth almost any price he might have chosen to put upon his services but custom decreed the wage of the overheadmen and peroo was not within many silver pieces of his proper value neither running water nor extreme heights made him afraid and as an exserang he knew how to hold authority  no piece of iron was so big or so badly placed that peroo could not devise a tackle to lift it  a looseended sagging arrangement rigged with a scandalous amount of talking but perfectly equal to the work in hand it was peroo who had saved the girder of number seven pier from destruction when the new wirerope jammed in the eye of the crane and the huge plate tilted in its slings threatening to slide out sideways  then the native workmen lost their heads with great shoutings and hitchcocks right arm was broken by a falling tplate and he buttoned it up in his coat and swooned and came to and directed for four hours till peroo from the top of the crane reported alls well and the plate swung home there was no one like peroo serang to lash and guy and hold to control the donkeyengines to hoist a fallen locomotive craftily out of the borrowpit into which it had tumbled to strip and dive if need be to see how the concrete blocks round the piers stood the scouring of mother gunga or to adventure upstream on a monsoon night and report on the state of the embankmentfacings  he would interrupt the fieldcouncils of findlayson and hitchcock without fear till his wonderful english or his still more wonderful lingua franca half portuguese and half malay ran out and he was forced to take string and show the knots that he would recommend  he controlled his own gang of tackle men  mysterious relatives from kutch mandvi gathered month by month and tried to the uttermost  no consideration of family or kin allowed peroo to keep weak hands or a giddy head on the payroll  my honour is the honour of this bridge he would say to the abouttobedismissed  what do i care for your honour go and work on a steamer  that is all you are fit for  the little cluster of huts where he and his gang lived centred round the tattered dwelling of a seapriest  one who had never set foot on black water but had been chosen as ghostly counsellor by two generations of searovers all unaffected by port missions or those creeds which are thrust upon sailors by agencies along thames bank  the priest of the lascars had nothing to do with their caste or indeed with anything at all  he ate the offerings of his church and slept and smoked and slept again for said peroo who had haled him a thousand miles inland he is a very holy man  he never cares what you eat so long as you do not eat beef and that is good because on land we worship shiva we kharvas but at sea on the kumpanis boats we attend strictly to the orders of the burra malum the first mate and on this bridge we observe what finlinson sahib says  finlinson sahib had that day given orders to clear the scaffolding from the guardtower on the right bank and peroo with his mates was casting loose and lowering down the bamboo poles and planks as swiftly as ever they had whipped the cargo out of a coaster  from his trolley he could hear the whistle of the serangs silver pipe and the creek and clatter of the pulleys  peroo was standing on the topmost coping of the tower clad in the blue dungaree of his abandoned service and as findlayson motioned to him to be careful for his was no life to throw away he gripped the last pole and shading his eyes shipfashion answered with the longdrawn wail of the focsle lookout  ham dekhta hai i am looking out  findlayson laughed and then sighed  it was years since he had seen a steamer and he was sick for home as his trolley passed under the tower peroo descended by a rope apefashion and cried it looks well now sahib  our bridge is all but done  what think you mother gunga will say when the rail runs over  she has said little so far  it was never mother gunga that delayed us  there is always time for her and none the less there has been delay  has the sahib forgotten last autumns flood when the stoneboats were sunk without warning  or only a halfdays warning  yes but nothing save a big flood could hurt us now  the spurs are holding well on the west bank  mother gunga eats great allowances  there is always room for more stone on the revetments i tell this to the chota sahib  he meant hitchcock  and he laughs  no matter peroo  another year thou wilt be able to build a bridge in thine own fashion  the lascar grinned  then it will not be in this way  with stonework sunk under water as the qyetta was sunk  i like sussuspensheen bridges that fly from bank to bank with one big step like a gangplank  then no water can hurt  when does the lord sahib come to open the bridge  in three months when the weather is cooler  ho ho he is like the burra malum he sleeps below while the work is being done then he comes upon the quarterdeck and touches with his finger and says this is not clean  dam jibboonwallah  but the lord sahib does not call me a dam jibboonwallah peroo  no sahib but he does not come on deck till the work is all finished  even the burra malum of the nerbudda said once at tuticorin   bah go  i am busy  i also said peroo with an unshaken countenance  may i take the light dinghy now and row along the spurs  to hold them with thy hands  they are i think sufficiently heavy  nay sahib  it is thus  at sea on the black water we have room to be blown up and down without care  here we have no room at all look you we have put the river into a dock and run her between stone sills  findlayson smiled at the we  we have bitted and bridled her  she is not like the sea that can beat against a soft beach she is mother gunga  in irons  his voice fell a little  peroo thou hast been up and down the world more even than i  speak true talk now how much dost thou in thy heart believe of mother gunga  all that our priest says  london is london sahib  sydney is sydney and port darwin is port darwin  also mother gunga is mother gunga and when i come back to her banks i know this and worship  in london i did poojah to the big temple by the river for the sake of the god within      yes i will not take the cushions in the dinghy  findlayson mounted his horse and trotted to the shed of a bungalow that he shared with his assistant  the place had become home to him in the last three years  he had grilled in the heat sweated in the rains and shivered with fever under the rude thatch roof the limewash beside the door was covered with rough drawings and formulae and the sentrypath trodden in the matting of the verandah showed where he had walked alone  there is no eighthour limit to an engineers work and the evening meal with hitchcock was eaten booted and spurred over their cigars they listened to the hum of the village as the gangs came up from the riverbed and the lights began to twinkle  peroo has gone up the spurs in your dinghy  hes taken a couple of nephews with him and hes lolling in the stern like a commodore said hitchcock  thats all right  hes got something on his mind youd think that ten years in the british india boats would have knocked most of his religion out of him  so it has said hitchcock chuckling  i overheard him the other day in the middle of a most atheistical talk with that fat old guru of theirs peroo denied the efficacy of prayer and wanted the guru to go to sea and watch a gale out with him and see if he could stop a monsoon  all the same if you carried off his guru hed leave us like a shot  he was yarning away to me about praying to the dome of st pauls when he was in london  he told me that the first time he went into the engineroom of a steamer when he was a boy he prayed to the lowpressure cylinder  not half a bad thing to pray to either  hes propitiating his own gods now and he wants to know what mother gunga will think of a bridge being run across her  whos there  a shadow darkened the doorway and a telegram was put into hitchcocks hand  she ought to be pretty well used to it by this time only a tar  it ought to be rallis answer about the new rivets     great heavens  hitchcock jumped to his feet  what is it said the senior and took the form thats what mother gunga thinks is it he said reading keep cool young un weve got all our work cut out for us lets see muir wired half an hour ago floods on the ramgunga look out  well that gives us  one two  nine and a half for the flood to reach melipur ghaut and sevens sixteen and a half to lataoli  say fifteen hours before it comes down to us  curse that hillfed sewer of a ramgunga findlayson this is two months before anything could have been expected and the left bank is littered up with stuff still  two full months before the time  thats why it comes  ive only known indian rivers for fiveandtwenty years and i dont pretend to understand  here comes another tar findlayson opened the telegram  cockran this time from the ganges canal heavy rains here bad  he might have saved the last word well we dont want to know any more  weve got to work the gangs all night and clean up the riverbed  youll take the east bank and work out to meet me in the middle  get everything that floats below the bridge we shall have quite enough rivercraft coming down adrift anyhow without letting the stoneboats ram the piers what have you got on the east bank that needs looking after  pontoon  one big pontoon with the overhead crane on it  tother overhead crane on the mended pontoon with the cartroad rivets from twenty to twentythree piers  two construction lines and a turningspur  the pilework must take its chance said hitchcock  all right  roll up everything you can lay hands on  well give the gang fifteen minutes more to eat their grub  close to the verandah stood a big nightgong never used except for flood or fire in the village hitchcock had called for a fresh horse and was off to his side of the bridge when findlayson took the clothbound stick and smote with the rubbing stroke that brings out the full thunder of the metal  long before the last rumble ceased every nightgong in the village had taken up the warning to these were added the hoarse screaming of conches in the little temples the throbbing of drums and tomtoms and from the european quarters where the riveters lived mccartneys bugle a weapon of offence on sundays and festivals brayed desperately calling to stables  engine after engine toiling home along the spurs at the end of her days work whistled in answer till the whistles were answered from the far bank  then the big gong thundered thrice for a sign that it was flood   and not fire conch drum and whistle echoed the call and the village quivered to the sound of bare feet running upon soft earth  the order in all cases was to stand by the days work and wait instructions  the gangs poured by in the dusk men stopping to knot a loincloth or fasten a sandal gangforemen shouting to their subordinates as they ran or paused by the toolissue sheds for bars and mattocks locomotives creeping down their tracks wheeldeep in the crowd till the brown torrent disappeared into the dusk of the riverbed raced over the pilework swarmed along the lattices clustered by the cranes and stood still  each man in his place  then the troubled beating of the gong carried the order to take up everything and bear it beyond highwater mark and the flarelamps broke out by the hundred between the webs of dull iron as the riveters began a nights work racing against the flood that was to come  the girders of the three centre piers  those that stood on the cribs were all but in position  they needed just as many rivets as could be driven into them for the flood would assuredly wash out their supports and the ironwork would settle down on the caps of stone if they were not blocked at the ends  a hundred crowbars strained at the sleepers of the temporary line that fed the unfinished piers  it was heaved up in lengths loaded into trucks and backed up the bank beyond floodlevel by the groaning locomotives  the toolsheds on the sands melted away before the attack of shouting armies and with them went the stacked ranks of government stores ironhound boxes of rivets pliers cutters duplicate parts of the rivetingmachines spare pumps and chains  the big crane would be the last to be shifted for she was hoisting all the heavy stuff up to the main structure of the bridge  the concrete blocks on the fleet of stoneboats were dropped overside where there was any depth of water to guard the piers and the empty boats themselves were poled under the bridge downstream  it was here that peroos pipe shrilled loudest for the first stroke of the big gong had brought the dinghy back at racing speed and peroo and his people were stripped to the waist working for the honour and credit which are better than life  i knew she would speak he cried i knew but the telegraph gives us good warning o sons of unthinkable begetting  children of unspeakable shame  are we here for the look of the thing  it was two feet of wirerope frayed at the ends and it did wonders as peroo leaped from gunnel to gunnel shouting the language of the sea  findlayson was more troubled for the stone boats than anything else  mccartney with his gangs was blocking up the ends of the three doubtful spans but boats adrift if the flood chanced to be a high one might endanger the girders and there was a very fleet in the shrunken channel  get them behind the swell of the guard tower he shouted down to peroo  it will be deadwater there  get them below the bridge  accha very good i know we are mooring them with wirerope was the answer heh listen to the chota sahib  he is working hard  from across the river came an almost continuous whistling of locomotives backed by the rumble of stone  hitchcock at the last minute was spending a few hundred more trucks of tarakee stone in reinforcing his spurs and embankments  the bridge challenges mother gunga said peroo with a laugh  but when she talks i know whose voice will be the loudest  for hours the naked men worked screaming and shouting under the lights  it was a hot moonless night the end of it was darkened by clouds and a sudden squall that made findlayson very grave  she moves said peroo just before the dawn mother gunga is awake hear he dipped his hand over the side of a boat and the current mumbled on it  a little wave hit the side of a pier with a crisp slap  six hours before her time said findlayson mopping his forehead savagely  now we cant depend on anything wed better clear all hands out of the riverbed  again the big gong beat and a second time there was the rushing of naked feet on earth and ringing iron the clatter of tools ceased  in the silence men heard the dry yawn of water crawling over thirsty sand  foreman after foreman shouted to findlayson who had posted himself by the guardtower that his section of the riverbed had been cleaned out and when the last voice dropped findlayson hurried over the bridge till the iron plating of the permanent way gave place to the temporary plankwalk over the three centre piers and there he met hitchcock  all clear your side said findlayson  the whisper rang in the  box of lattice work  yes and the east channels filling now were utterly out of our reckoning  when is this thing down on us  theres no saying  shes filling as fast as she can  look  findlayson pointed to the planks below his feet where the sand burned and defiled by months of work was beginning to whisper and fizz  what orders said hitchcock  call the roll  count stores  sit on your hunkers  and pray for the bridge  thats all i can think of good night  dont risk your life trying to fish out anything that may go downstream  oh ill be as prudent as you are  night heavens how shes filling  heres the rain in earnest  findlayson picked his way back to his bank sweeping the last of mccartneys riveters before him the gangs had spread themselves along the embankments regardless of the cold rain of the dawn and there they waited for the flood only peroo kept his men together behind the swell of the guardtower where the stoneboats lay tied fore and aft with hawsers wirerope and chains  a shrill wail ran along the line growing to a yell half fear and half wonder the face of the river whitened from bank to hank between the stone facings and the faraway spurs went out in spouts of foam  mother gunga had come bankhigh in haste and a wall of chocolatecoloured water was her messenger  there was a shriek above the roar of the water the complaint of the spans coming down on their blocks as the cribs were whirled out from under their bellies  the stoneboats groaned and ground each other in the eddy that swung round the abutment and their clumsy masts rose higher and higher against the dim skyline  before she was shut between these walls we knew what she would do  now she isthus cramped god only knows what she will do said peroo watching the furious turmoil round the guardtower ohe fight then fight hard for it is thus that a woman wears herself out  but mother gunga would not fight as peroo desired after the first downstream plunge there came no more walls of water but the river lifted herself bodily as a snake when she drinks in midsummer plucking and fingering along the revetments and banking up behind the piers till even findlayson began to recalculate the strength of his work  when day came the village gasped only last night men said turning to each other it was as a town in the riverbed look now  and they looked and wondered afresh at the deep water the racing water that licked the throat of the piers  the farther bank was veiled by rain into which the bridge ran out and vanished the spurs upstream were marked by no more than eddies and spoutings and downstream the pent river once freed of her guidelines had spread like a sea to the horizon then hurried by rolling in the water dead men and oxen together with here and there a patch of thatched roof that melted when it touched a pier  big flood said peroo and findlayson nodded  it was as big a flood as he had any wish to watch his bridge would stand what was upon her now but not very much more and if by any of a thousand chances there happened to be a weakness in the embankments mother gunga would carry his honour to the sea with the other raffle worst of all there was nothing to do except to sit still and findlayson sat still under his macintosh till his helmet became pulp on his head and his boots were overankle in mire he took no count of time for the river was marking the hours inch by inch and foot by foot along the embankment and he listened numb and hungry to the straining of the stoneboats the hollow thunder under the piers and the hundred noises that make the full note of a flood  once a dripping servant brought him food but he could not eat and once he thought that he heard a faint toot from a locomotive across the river and then he smiled the bridges failure would hurt his assistant not a little hut hitchcock was a young man with his big work yet to do for himself the crash meant everything  everything that made a hard life worth the living they would say the men of his own profession    he remembered the halfpitying things that he himself had said when lockharts new waterworks burst and broke down in brickheaps and sludge and lockharts spirit broke in him and he died  he remembered what he himself had said when the sumao bridge went out in the big cyclone by the sea and most he remembered poor hartopps face three weeks later when the shame had marked it  his bridge was twice the size of hartopps and it carried the findlayson truss as well as the new piershoe  the findlayson bolted shoe there were no excuses in his service government might listen perhaps but his own kind would judge him by his bridge as that stood or fell he went over it in his head plate by plate span by span brick by brick pier by pier remembering comparing estimating and recalculating lest there should be any mistake and through the long hours and through the flights of formulae that danced and wheeled before him a cold fear would come to pinch his heart his side of the sum was beyond question but what man knew mother gungas arithmetic even as he was making all sure by the multiplication table the river might be scooping a pothole to the very bottom of any one of those eightyfoot piers that carried his reputation  again a servant came to him with food but his mouth was dry and he could only drink and return to the decimals in his brain and the river was still rising peroo in a mat shelter coat crouched at his feet watching now his face and now the face of the river but saying nothing  at last the lascar rose and floundered through the mud towards the village but he was careful to leave an ally to watch the boats  presently he returned most irreverently driving before him the priest of his creed  a fat old man with a grey beard that whipped the wind with the wet cloth that blew over his shoulder  never was seen so lamentable a guru  what good are offerings and little kerosene lamps and dry grain shouted peroo if squatting in the mud is all that thou canst do  thou hast dealt long with the gods when they were contented and wellwishing  now they are angry speak to them  what is a man against the wrath of gods whined the priest cowering as the wind took him let me go to the temple and i will pray there  son of a pig pray here is there no return for salt fish and curry powder and dried onions call aloud tell mother gunga we have had enough bid her be still for the night i cannot pray but i have been serving in the kumpanis boats and when men did not obey my orders i   a flourish of the wirerope colt rounded the sentence and the priest breaking free from his disciple fled to the village  fat pig said peroo after all that we have done for him when the flood is down i will see to it that we get a new guru finlinson sahib it darkens for night now and since yesterday nothing has been eaten be wise sahib no man can endure watching and great thinking on an empty belly  lie down sahib  the river will do what the river will dothe bridge is mine i cannot leave it  wilt thou hold it up with thy hands then said peroo laughing i was troubled for my boats and sheers before the flood came  now we are in the hands of the gods the sahib will not eat and lie down take these then they are meat and good toddy together and they kill all weariness besides the fever that follows the rain i have eaten nothing else today at all  he took a small tin tobaccobox from his sodden waistbelt and thrust it into findlaysons hand saying nay do not be afraid  it is no more than opium  clean malwa opium  findlayson shook two or three of the darkbrown pellets into his hand and hardly knowing what he did swallowed them the stuff was at least a good guard against fever the fever that was creeping upon him out of the wet mud and he had seen what peroo could do in the stewing mists of autumn on the strength of a dose from the tin box  peroo nodded with bright eyes  in a little  in a little the sahib will find that he thinks well again i too will  he dived into his treasurebox resettled the raincoat over his head and squatted down to watch the boats  it was too dark now to see beyond the first pier and the night seemed to have given the river new strength findlayson stood with his chin on his chest thinking  there was one point about one of the piers  the seventh  that he had not fully settled in his mind  the figures would not shape themselves to the eye except one by one and at enormous intervals of time  there was a sound rich and mellow in his ears like the deepest note of a doublebass  an entrancing sound upon which he pondered for several hours as it seemed then peroo was at his elbow shouting that a wire hawser had snapped and the stoneboats were loose  findlayson saw the fleet open and swing out fanwise to a longdrawn shriek of wire straining across gunnels  a tree hit them they will all go cried peroo the main hawser has parted what does the sahib do  an immensely complex plan had suddenly flashed into findlaysons mind  he saw the ropes running from boat to boat in straight lines and angles  each rope a line of white fire but there was one rope which was the master rope he could see that rope  if he could pull it once it was absolutely and mathematically certain that the disordered fleet would reassemble itself in the backwater behind the guardtower  but why he wondered was peroo clinging so desperately to his waist as he hastened down the bank it was necessary to put the lascar aside gently and slowly because it was necessary to save the boats and further to demonstrate the extreme ease of the problem that looked so difficult  and then  but it was of no conceivable importance   a wirerope raced through his hand burning it the high bank disappeared  and with it all the slowly dispersing factors of the problem he was sitting in the rainy darkness  sitting in a boat that spun like a top and peroo was standing over him  i had forgotten said the lascar slowly that to those fasting and unused the opium is worse than any wine those who die in gunga go to the gods still i have no desire to present myself before such great ones can the sahib swim  what need he can fly  fly as swiftly as the wind was the thick answer  he is mad muttered peroo under his breath and he threw me aside like a bundle of dungcakes well he will not know his death the boat cannot live an hour here even if she strike nothing it is not good to look at death with a clear eye  he refreshed himself again from the tin box squatted down in the bows of the reeling pegged and stitched craft staring through the mist at the nothing that was there  a warm drowsiness crept over findlayson the chief engineer whose duty was with his bridge the heavy raindrops struck him with a thousand tingling little thrills and the weight of all time since time was made hung heavy on his eyelids he thought and perceived that he was perfectly secure for the water was so solid that a man could surely step out upon it and standing still with his legs apart to keep his balance  this was the most important point  would be borne with great and easy speed to the shore but yet a better plan came to him  it needed only an exertion of will for the soul to hurl the body ashore as wind drives paper to waft it kitefashion to the bank thereafter  the boat spun dizzily  suppose the high wind got under the freed body  would it tower up like a kite and pitch headlong on the faraway sands or would it duck about beyond control through all eternity findlayson gripped the gunnel to anchor himself for it seemed that he was on the edge of taking the flight before he had settled all his plans opium has more effect on the white man than the black peroo was only comfortably indifferent to accidents she cannot live he grunted her seams open already if she were even a dinghy with oars we could have ridden it out but a box with holes is no good finlinson sahib she fills  accha i am going away come thou also in his mind findlayson had already escaped from the boat and was circling high in air to find a rest for the sole of his foot his body  he was really sorry for its gross helplessness  lay in the stern the water rushing about its knees  how very ridiculous he said to himself from his eyrie  that  is findlayson   chief of the kashi bridge the poor beast is going to be drowned too drowned when its close to shore im  im on shore already why doesnt it come along  to his intense disgust he found his soul back in his body again and that body spluttering and choking in deep water the pain of the reunion was atrocious but it was necessary also to fight for the body he was conscious of grasping wildly at wet sand and striding prodigiously as one strides in a dream to keep foothold in the swirling water till at last he hauled himself clear of the hold of the river and dropped panting on wet earth  not this night said peroo in his ear the gods have protected us  the lascar moved his feet cautiously and they rustled among dried stumps this is some island of last years indigocrop he went on we shall find no men here but have great care sahib all the snakes of a hundred miles have been flooded out  here comes the lightning on the heels of the wind now we shall be able to look but walk carefully  findlayson was far and far beyond any fear of snakes or indeed any merely human emotion he saw after he had rubbed the water from his eyes with an immense clearness and trod so it seemed to himself with worldencompassing strides  somewhere in the night of time he had built a bridge  a bridge that spanned illimitable levels of shining seas but the deluge had swept it away leaving this one island under heaven for findlayson and his companion sole survivors of the breed of man  an incessant lightning forked and blue showed all that there was to be seen on the little patch in the flood  a clump of thorn a clump of swaying creaking bamboos and a grey gnarled peepul overshadowing a hindoo shrine from whose dome floated a tattered red flag the holy man whose summer restingplace it was had long since abandoned it and the weather had broken the reddaubed image of his god  the two men stumbled heavylimbed and heavyeyed over the ashes of a brickset cookingplace and dropped down under the shelter of the branches while the rain and river roared together  the stumps of the indigo crackled and there was a smell of cattle as a huge and dripping brahminee bull shouldered his way under the tree the flashes revealed the trident mark of shiva on his flank the insolence of head and hump the luminous staglike eyes the brow crowned with a wreath of sodden marigold blooms and the silky dewlap that almost swept the ground  there was a noise behind him of other beasts coming up from the floodline through the thicket a sound of heavy feet and deep breathing  here be more beside ourselves said findlayson his head against the tree pole looking through halfshut eyes wholly at ease  truly said peroo thickly and no small ones  what are they then i do not see clearly  the gods who else look  ah true the gods surely  the gods findlayson smiled as his head fell forward on his chest  peroo was eminently right  after the flood who should be alive in the land except the gods that made it  the gods to whom his village prayed nightly  the gods who were in all mens mouths and about all mens ways he could not raise his head or stir a finger for the trance that held him and peroo was smiling vacantly at the lightning  the bull paused by the shrine his head lowered to the damp earth a green parrot in the branches preened his wet wings and screamed against the thunder as the circle under the tree filled with the shifting shadows of beasts there was a black buck at the bulls heelssuch a buck as findlayson in his faraway life upon earth might have seen in dreams  a buck with a royal head ebon back silver belly and gleaming straight horns  beside him her head bowed to the ground the green eyes burning under the heavy brows with restless tail switching the dead grass paced a tigress fullbellied and deepjowled  the bull crouched beside the shrine and there leaped from the darkness a monstrous grey ape who seated himself manwise in the place of the fallen image and the rain spilled like jewels from the hair of his neck and shouldersother shadows came and went behind the circle among them a drunken man flourishing staff and drinkingbottle then a hoarse bellow broke out from near the ground the flood lessens even now it cried  hour by hour the water falls and their bridge still stands  my bridge said findlayson to himself that must be very old work now what have the gods to do with my bridge  his eyes rolled in the darkness following the roar a mugger  the bluntnosed fordhaunting mugger of the ganges draggled herself before the beasts lashing furiously to right and left with her tail  they have made it too strong for me in all this night i have only torn away a handful of planks the walls stand the towers stand they have chained my flood and the river is not free any more heavenly ones take this yoke away give me clear water between bank and bank it is i mother gunga that speak the justice of the gods  deal me the justice of the gods  what said i whispered peroo  this is in truth a punchayet of the gods now we know that all the world is dead save you and i sahib  the parrot screamed and fluttered again and the tigress her ears flat to her head snarled wickedly  somewhere in the shadow a great trunk and gleaming tusks swayed to and fro and a low gurgle broke the silence that followed on the snarl  we be here said a deep voice the great ones  one only and very many  shiv my father is here with indra kali has spoken already  hanuman listens also  kashi is without her kotwal tonight shouted the man with the drinkingbottle flinging his staff to the ground while the island rang to the baying of hounds  give her the justice of the gods  ye were still when they polluted my waters the great crocodile bellowed ye made no sign when my river was trapped between the walls  i had no help save my own strength and that failed  the strength of mother gunga failed  before their guardtowers  what could i do  i have done everything  finish now heavenly ones  i brought the death i rode the spotted sickness from hut to hut of their workmen and yet they would not cease a noseslitten hideworn ass lame scissorlegged and galled limped forward i cast the death at them out of my nostrils but they would not cease  peroo would have moved but the opium lay heavy upon him   bah he said spitting here is sitala herself mata  the smallpox has the sahib a handkerchief to put over his face  little help they fed me the corpses for a month and i flung them out on my sandbars but their work went forward  demons they are and sons of demons and ye left mother gunga alone for their firecarriage to make a mock of the justice of the gods on the bridgebuilders  the bull turned the cud in his mouth and answered slowly if the justice of the gods caught all who made a mock of holy things there would be many dark altars in the land mother  but this goes beyond a mock said the tigress darting forward a griping paw thou knowest shiv and ye too heavenly ones ye know that they have defiled gunga surely they must come to the destroyer let indra judge  the buck made no movement as he answered  how long has this evil been  three years as men count years said the mugger close pressed to the earth  does mother gunga die then in a year that she is so anxious to see vengeance now the deep sea was where she runs but yesterday and tomorrow the sea shall cover her again as the gods count that which men call time can any say that this their bridge endures till tomorrow said the buck  there was a long hush and in the clearing of the storm the full moon stood up above the dripping trees  judge ye then said the river sullenly i have spoken my shame  the flood falls still i can do no more  for my own part   it was the voice of the great ape seated within the shrine  it pleases me well to watch these men remembering that i also builded no small bridge in the worlds youth  they say too snarled the tiger that these men came of the wreck of thy armies hanuman and therefore thou hast aided   they toil as my armies toiled in lanka and they believe that their toil endures indra is too high but shiv thou knowest how the land is threaded with their firecarriages  yea i know said the bull their gods instructed them in the matter  a laugh ran round the circle  their gods what should their gods know they were born yesterday and those that made them are scarcely yet cold said the mugger tomorrow their gods will die  ho said peroo mother gunga talks good talk i told that to the padresahib who preached on the mombassa and he asked the burra malum to put me in irons for a great rudeness  surely they make these things to please their gods said the bull again  not altogether the elephant rolled forth it is for the profit of my mahajuns  my fat moneylenders that worship me at each new year when they draw my image at the head of the accountbooks  i looking over their shoulders by lamplight see that the names in the books are those of men in far places  for all the towns are drawn together by the firecarriage and the money comes and goes swiftly and the accountbooks grow as fat as  myself and i who am ganesh of good luck i bless my peoples  they have changed the face of the landwhich is my land they have killed and made new towns on my banks said the mugger  it is but the shifting of a little dirt let the dirt dig in the dirt if it pleases the dirt answered the elephant  but afterwards said the tiger afterwards they will see that mother gunga can avenge no insult and they fall away from her first and later from us all one by one in the end ganesh we are left with naked altars  the drunken man staggered to his feet and hiccupped vehemently  kali lies  my sister lies  also this my stick is the kotwal of kashi and he keeps tally of my pilgrims  when the time comes to worship bhaironand it is always time  the firecarriages move one by one and each bears a thousand pilgrims  they do not come afoot any more but rolling upon wheels and my honour is increased  gunga i have seen thy bed at pryag black with the pilgrims said the ape leaning forward and but for the firecarriage they would have come slowly and in fewer numbers remember  they come to me always bhairon went on thickly  by day and night they pray to me all the common people in the fields and the roads who is like bhairon today what talk is this of changing faiths is my staff kotwal of kashi for nothing he keeps the tally and he says that never were so many altars as today and the fire carriage serves them well  bhairon am i  bhairon of the common people and the chiefest of the heavenly ones today  also my staff says   peace thou lowed the bull  the worship of the schools is mine and they talk very wisely asking whether i be one or many as is the delight of my people and ye know what i am  kali my wife thou knowest also yea i know said the tigress with lowered head  greater am i than gunga also for ye know who moved the minds of men that they should count gunga holy among the rivers  who die in that water  ye know how  men say  come to us without punishment and gunga knows that the firecarriage  has borne to her scores upon scores of such anxious ones and kali knows that she has held her chiefest festivals among the pilgrimages that are fed by the firecarriage who smote at pooree under the image there her thousands in a day and a night and bound the sickness to the wheels of the firecarriages so that it ran from one end of the land to the other  who but kali  before the firecarriage came it was a heavy toil  the firecarriages have served thee well mother of death  but i speak for mine own altars who am not bhairon of the common folk but shiv  men go to and fro making words and telling talk of strange gods and i listen faith follows faith among my people in the schools  and i have no anger for when all words are said and the new talk is ended to shiv men return at the last  true it is true murmured hanuman to shiv and to the others mother they return i creep from temple to temple in the north where they worship one god and his prophet and presently my image is alone within their shrines  small thanks said the buck turning his head slowly i am that one and his prophet also  even so father said hanuman and to the south i go who am the oldest of the gods as men know the gods and presently i touch the shrines of the new faith and the woman whom we know is hewn twelvearmed and still they call her mary  small thanks brother said the tigress i am that woman  even so sister and i go west among the firecarriages and stand before the bridgebuilders in many shapes and because of me they change their faiths and are very wise ho ho i am the builder of bridges indeed  bridges between this and that and each bridge leads surely to us in the end be content gunga neither these men nor those that follow them mock thee at all  am i alone then heavenly ones shall i smooth out my flood lest unhappily i bear away their walls will indra dry my springs in the  hills and make me crawl humbly between their wharfs  shall i bury me in the sand ere i offend  and all for the sake of a little iron bar with the firecarriage atop truly mother gunga is always young said ganesh the elephant a child had not spoken more foolishly let the dirt dig in the dirt ere it return to the dirt  i know only that my people grow rich and praise me shiv has said that the men of the schools do not forget bhairon is content for his crowd of the common people and hanuman laughs  surely i laugh said the ape my altars are few beside those of ganesh or bhairon but the firecarriages bring me new worshippers from beyond the black water  the men who believe that their god is toil  i run before them beckoning and they follow hanuman  give them the toil that they desire then said the river make a bar across my flood and throw the water back upon the bridge once thou wast strong in lanka hanuman stoop and lift my bed  who gives life can take life the ape scratched in the mud with a long forefinger and yet who would profit by the killing very many would die  there came up from the water a snatch of a lovesong such as the boys sing when they watch their cattle in the noon heats of late spring the parrot screamed joyously sidling along his branch with lowered head as the song grew louder and in a patch of clear moonlight stood revealed the young herd the darling of the gopis the idol of dreaming maids and of mothers ere their children are born  krishna the wellbeloved  he stooped to knot up his long wet hair and the parrot fluttered to his shoulder  fleeting and singing and singing and fleeting hiccupped bhairon  those make thee late for the council brother  and then said krishna with a laugh throwing back his head ye can do little without me or karma here he fondled the parrots plumage and laughed again what is this sitting and talking together i heard mother gunga roaring in the dark and so came quickly from a hut where i lay warm and what have ye done to karma that he is so wet and silent and what does mother gunga here are the heavens full that ye must come paddling in the mud beastwise karma what do they do  gunga has prayed for a vengeance on the bridgebuilders and kali is with her now she bids hanuman whelm the bridge that her honour may be made great cried the parrot i waited here knowing that thou wouldst come o my master  and the heavenly ones said nothing  did gunga and the mother of sorrows outtalk them did none speak for my people  nay said ganesh moving uneasily from foot to foot i said it was but dirt at play and why should we stamp it flat  i was content to let them toil well content said hanuman  what had i to do with gungas anger said the bull  i am bhairon of the common folk and this my staff is kotwal of all kashi i spoke for the common people  thou the young gods eyes sparkled  am i not the first of the gods in their mouths today returned bhairon unabashed for the sake of the common people i said  very many wise things which i have now forgotten but this my staff  krishna turned impatiently saw the mugger at his feet and kneeling slipped an arm round the cold neck mother he said gently get thee to thy flood again the matter is not for thee what harm shall thy honour take of this live dirt thou hast given them their fields new year after year and by thy flood they are made strong they come all to thee at the last what need to slay them now have pity mother for a little  and it is only for a littleif it be only for a little   the slow beast began  are they gods then krishna returned with a laugh his eyes looking into the dull eyes of the river be certain that it is only for a little the heavenly ones have heard thee and presently justice will be done go now mother to the flood again men and cattle are thick on the waters  the banks fall  the villages melt because of thee  but the bridge  the bridge stands the mugger turned grunting into the undergrowth as krishna rose  it is ended said the tigress viciously there is no more justice from the heavenly ones ye have made shame and sport of gunga who asked no more than a few score lives  of my people  who lie under the leafroofs of the village yonder  of the young girls and the young men who sing to them in the dark of the child that will be born next morn  of that which was begotten tonight said krishna and when all is done what profit tomorrow sees them at work ay if ye swept the bridge out from end to end they would begin anew hear me bhairon is drunk always hanuman mocks his people with new riddles  nay but they are very old ones the ape said laughing  shiv hears the talk of the schools and the dreams of the holy men ganesh thinks only of his fat traders but i  i live with these my people asking for  no gifts and so receiving them hourly  and very tender art thou of thy people said the tigress  they are my own the old women dream of me turning in their sleep the maids look and listen for me when they go to fill their lotahs by the river i walk by the young men waiting without the gates at dusk and i call over my shoulder to the whitebeards ye know heavenly ones that i alone of us all walk upon the earth continually and have no pleasure in our heavens so long as a green blade springs here or there are two voices at twilight in the standing crops  wise are ye but ye live far off forgetting whence ye came so  do i not forget and the firecarriage feeds your shrines ye say and the firecarriages bring a thousand pilgrims where but ten came in the old years true that is true today  but tomorrow they are dead brother said ganesh  peace said the bull as hanuman leaned forward again and tomorrow beloved  what of tomorrow  this only a new word creeping from mouth to mouth among the common folk  a word that neither man nor god can lay hold of  an evil word  a little lazy word among the common folk saying and none know who set that word afoot that they weary of ye heavenly ones  the gods laughed together softly and then beloved  they said  and to cover that weariness they my people will bring to thee shiv and to thee ganesh at first greater offerings and a louder noise of worship but the word has gone abroad and after they will pay fewer dues to your fat brahmins next they will forget your altars but so slowly that no man can say how his forgetfulness began  i knew  i knew  i spoke this also but they would not hear said the tigress we should have slainwe should have slain  it is too late now ye should have slain at the beginning when the men from across the water had taught our folk nothing now my people see their work and go away thinking they do not think of the heavenly ones altogether they think of the firecarriage and the other things that the bridgebuilders have done and when your priests thrust forward hands asking alms they give a little unwillingly that is the beginning among one or two or five or ten  for i moving among my people know what is in their hearts  and the end jester of the gods what shall the end be said ganesh  the end shall be as it was in the beginning o slothful son of shiv the flame shall die upon the altars and the prayer upon the tongue till ye become little gods again  gods of the jungle names that the hunters of rats and noosers of dogs whisper in the thicket and among the caves raggods pot godlings of the tree and the villagemark as ye were at the beginning that is the end ganesh for thee and for bhairon  bhairon of the common people  it is very far away grunted bhairon also it is a lie  many women have kissed krishna they told him this to cheer their own hearts when the grey hairs came and he has told us the tale said the bull below his breath  their gods came and we changed them i took the woman and made her twelvearmed so shall we twist all their gods said hanuman  their gods this is no question of their gods  one or three  man or woman  the matter is with the people  move and not the gods of the bridgebuilders said krishna  so be it i have made a man worship the firecarriage as it stood still breathing smoke and he knew not that he worshipped me said hanuman the ape they will only change a little the names of their gods  i shall lead the builders of the bridges as of old shiv shall be worshipped in the schools by such as doubt and despise their fellows ganesh shall have his mahajuns and bhairon the donkeydrivers the pilgrims and the sellers of toys beloved they will do no more than change the names and that we have seen a thousand times  surely they will do no more than change the names echoed ganesh but there was an uneasy movement among the gods  they will change more than the names me alone they cannot kill so long as a maiden and a man meet together or the spring follows the winter rains heavenly ones not for nothing have i walked upon the earth my people know not now what they know but i who live with them i read their hearts great kings the beginning of the end is born already the firecarriages shout the names of new gods that are not the old under new names drink now and eat greatly  bathe your faces in the smoke of the altars before they grow cold take dues and listen to the cymbals and the drums heavenly ones while yet there are flowers and songs as men count time the end is far off but as we who know reckon it is today i have spoken  the young god ceased and his brethren looked at each other long in silence  this i have not heard before peroo whispered in his companions ear and yet sometimes when i oiled the brasses in the engineroom of the goorkha i have wondered if our priests were so wise  so wise the day is coming sahib  they will be gone by the morning  a yellow light broadened in the sky and the tone of the river changed  as the darkness withdrew  suddenly the elephant trumpeted aloud as though man had goaded him  let indra judge father of all speak thou what of the things we have heard  has krishna lied indeed or   ye know said the buck rising to his feet ye know the riddle of the gods  when brahm ceases to dream the heavens and the hells and earth disappear  be content brahm dreams still  the dreams come and go and the nature of the dreams changes but still brahm dreams  krishna has walked too long upon earth and yet i love him the more for the tale he has told the gods change beloved  all save one  ay all save one that makes love in the hearts of men said krishna knotting his girdle it is but a little time to wait and ye shall know if i lietruly it is but a little time as thou sayest and we shall know get thee to thy huts again beloved and make sport for the young things for still brahm dreams  go my children brahm dreams and till he wakes the gods die not  whither went they  said the lascar awestruck shivering a little with the cold  god knows said findlayson the river and the island lay in full daylight now and there was never mark of hoof or pug on the wet earth under the peepul only a parrot screamed in the branches bringing down showers of waterdrops as he fluttered his wings  up we are cramped with cold has the opium died out  canst thou move sahib  findlayson staggered to his feet and shook himself his bead swam and ached but the work of the opium was over and as he sluiced his forehead in a pool the chief engineer of the kashi bridge was wondering how he had managed to fall upon the island what chances the day offered of return and above all how his work stood  peroo i have forgotten much i was under the guardtower watching the river and then  did the flood sweep us away  no the boats broke loose sahib and if the sahib had forgotten about the opium decidedly peroo would not remind him in striving to retie them so it seemed to me but it was dark  a rope caught the sahib and threw him upon a boat  considering that we two with hitchcock sahib built as it were that bridge i came also upon the boat which came riding on horseback as it were on the nose of this island and so splitting cast us ashore i made a great cry when the boat left the wharf and without doubt hitchcock sahib will come for us as for the bridge so many have died in the building that it cannot falla fierce sun that drew out all the smell of the sodden land had followed the storm and in that clear light there was no room for a man to think of the dreams of the dark findlayson stared upstream across the blaze of moving water till his eyes ached there was no sign of any bank to the ganges much less of a bridgeline  we came down far he said it was wonderful that we were not drowned a hundred times  that was the least of the wonder for no man dies before his time  i have seen sydney i have seen london and twenty great ports but  peroo looked at the damp discoloured shrine under the peepul  never man has seen that we saw here  what  has the sahib forgotten or do we black men only see the gods  there was a fever upon me findlayson was still looking uneasily across the water  it seemed that the island was full of beasts and men talking but i do not remember a boat could live in this water now i think  oho then it is true when brahm ceases to dream the gods die now i know indeed what he meant once too the guru said as much to me but then i did not understand now i am wise  what said findlayson over his shoulder  peroo went on as if he were talking to himself six  seven  ten monsoons since i was watch on the focsle of the rewah  the kumpanis big boat  and there was a big tufan green and black water beating and i held fast to the lifelines choking under the waters then i thought of the gods  of those whom we saw tonight  he stared curiously at findlaysons back but the white man was looking across the flood yes i say of those whom we saw this night past and i called upon them to protect me and while i prayed still keeping my lookout a big wave came and threw me forward upon the ring of the great black bowanchor and the rewah rose high and high leaning towards the lefthand side and the water drew away from beneath her nose and i lay upon my belly holding the ring and looking down into those great deeps then i thought even in the face of death if i lose hold i die and for me neither the rewah nor my place by the galley where the rice is cooked nor bombay nor calcuttanor even london will be any more for me how shall i be sure i said  that the gods to whom i pray will abide at all this i thought and the rewah dropped her nose as a hammer falls and all the sea came in and slid me backwards along the focsle and over the break of the focsle and i very badly bruised my shin against the donkeyengine but i did not die and i have seen the gods  they are good for live men but for the dead      they have spoken themselves therefore when i come to the village i will beat the guru for talking riddles which are no riddles  when brahm ceases to dream the gods go  look upstream the light blinds is there smoke yonder  peroo shaded his eyes with his hands he is a wise man and quick  hitchcock sahib would not trust a rowboat  he has borrowed the rao sahibs steamlaunch and comes to look for us  i have always said that there should have been a steamlaunch on the bridge works for us  the territory of the rao of baraon lay within ten miles of the bridge and findlayson and hitchcock had spent a fair portion of their scanty leisure in playing billiards and shooting blackbuck with the young man  he had been bearled by an english tutor of sporting tastes for some five or six years and was now royally wasting the revenues accumulated during his minority by the indian government his steamlaunch with its silverplated rails striped silk awning and mahogany decks was a new toy which findlayson had found horribly in the way when the rao came to look at the bridge works  its great luck murmured findlayson but he was none the less afraid wondering what news might be of the bridge  the gaudy blueandwhite funnel came downstream swiftly  they could see hitchcock in the bows with a pair of operaglasses and his face was unusually white then peroo hailed and the launch made for the tail of the island the rao sahib in tweed shootingsuit and a sevenhued turban waved his royal hand and hitchcock shouted but he need have asked no questions for findlaysons first demand was for his bridge  all serene gad i never expected to see you again findlayson youre seven koss downstream yes theres not a stone shifted anywhere but how are you i borrowed the rao sahibs launch and he was good enough to come along jump inah finlinson you are very well eh that was most unprecedented calamity last night eh my royal palace too it leaks like the devil and the crops will also be short all about my country now you shall back her out hitchcock i  i do not understand steamengines you are wet you are cold finlinson i have some things to eat here and you will take a good drink  im immensely grateful rao sahib i believe youve saved my life  how did hitchcock   oho his hair was upon end he rode to me in the middle of the night and woke me up in the arms of morpheus i was most truly concerned finlinson so i came too my headpriest he is very angry just now we will go quick mister hitchcock i am due to attend at twelve fortyfive in the state temple where we sanctify some new idol if not so i would have asked you to spend the day with me they are dambore these religious ceremonies finlinson eh  peroo well known to the crew had possessed himself of the inlaid wheel and was taking the launch craftily upstream but while he steered he was in his mind handling two feet of partially untwisted wirerope and the back upon which he beat was the back of his guru  end of the bridgebuilders    a walking delegate  according to the custom of vermont sunday afternoon is saltingtime on the farm and unless something very important happens we attend to the salting ourselves  dave and pete the red oxen are treated first they stay in the home meadow ready for work on monday  then come the cows with pan the calf who should have been turned into veal long ago but survived on account of his manners and lastly the horses scattered through the seventy acres of the back pasture  you must go down by the brook that feeds the clicking bubbling waterram up through the sugarbush where the young maple undergrowth closes round you like a shallow sea next follow the faint line of an old countyroad running past two green hollows fringed with wild rose that mark the cellars of two ruined houses then by lost orchard where nobody ever comes except in cidertime then across another brook and so into the back pasture  half of it is pine and hemlock and spruce with sumach and little juniper bushes and the other half is grey rock and boulder and moss with green streaks of brake and swamp but the horses like it well enough  our own and the others that are turned down there to feed at fifty cents a week  most people walk to the back pasture and find it very rough work but one can get there in a buggy if the horse knows what is expected of him  the safest conveyance is our coupe this began life as a buckboard and we bought it for five dollars from a sorrowful man who had no other sort of possessions and the seat came off one night when we were turning a corner in a hurry  after that alteration it made a beautiful saltingmachine if you held tight because there was nothing to catch your feet when you fell out and the slats rattled tunes  one sunday afternoon we went out with the salt as usual  it was a broiling hot day and we could not find the horses anywhere till we let tedda gabler the bobtailed mare who throws up the dirt with her big hooves exactly as a tedder throws hay have her head  clever as she is she tipped the coupe over in a hidden brook before she came out on a ledge of rock where all the horses had gathered and were switching flies the deacon was the first to call to her  he is a very dark irongrey fouryearold son of grandee he has been handled since he was two was driven in a light cart before he was three and now ranksas an absolutely steady ladys horse  proof against steamrollers gradecrossings and street processions  salt said the deacon joyfully  youre dreffle late tedda  any  any place to cramp the coupe tedda panted  it weighs turrble this weather id a come sooner but they didnt know what they wanted  ner haow fell out twice both of em  i dont understand sech foolishness  you look considerble het up guess youd better cramp her under them pines an cool off a piece  tedda scrambled on the ledge and cramped the coupe in the shade of a tiny little wood of pines while my companion and i lay down among the brown silky needles and gasped all the home horses were gathered round us enjoying their sunday leisure  there were rod and rick the seniors on the farm  they were the regular roadpair bay with black points full brothers aged sons of a hambletonian sire and a morgan dam  there were nip and tuck sealbrowns rising six brother and sister black hawks by birth perfectly matched just finishing their education and as handsome a pair as man could wish to find in a fortymile drive  there was muldoon our excarhorse bought at a venture and any colour you choose that is not white and tweezy who comes from kentucky with an affliction of his left hip which makes him a little uncertain how his hind legs are moving  he and muldoon had been hauling gravel all the week for our new road  the deacon you know already  last of all and eating something was our faithful marcus aurelius antoninus the black buggyhorse who had seen us through every state of weather and road the horse who was always standing in harness before some door or other  a philosopher with the appetite of a shark and the manners of an archbishop tedda gabler was a new tradewith a reputation for vice which was really the result of bad driving  she had one working gait which she could hold till further notice a roman nose a large prominent eye a shavingbrush of a tail and an irritable temper  she took her salt through her bridle but the others trotted up nuzzling and wickering for theirs till we emptied it on the clean rocks  they were all standing at ease on three legs for the most part talking the ordinary gossip of the back pasture  about the scarcity of water and gaps in the fence and how the early windfalls tasted that season  when little rick blew the last few grains of his allowance into a crevice and said  hurry boys  might ha knowed that livery plug would be around  we heard a clatter of hooves and there climbed up from the ravine below a fiftycenter transienta walleyed yellow framehouse of a horse sent up to board from a liverystable in town where they called him the lamb and never let him out except at night and to strangers my companion who knew and had broken most of the horses looked at the ragged hammerhead as it rose and said quietly  niice beast maneater if he gets the chance  see his eye kicker too  see his hocks  western horse  the animal lumbered up snuffling and grunting  his feet showed that he had not worked for weeks and weeks and our creatures drew together significantly  as usual he said with an underhung sneerbowin your heads before the oppressor that comes to spend his leisure gloatin over you  mines done said the deacon he licked up the remnant of his salt dropped his nose in his masters hand and sang a little grace all to himself  the deacon has the most enchanting manners of any one i know  an fawnin on them for what is your inalienable right its humiliatin said the yellow horse sniffing to see if he could find a few spare grains  go daown hill then boney the deacon replied  guess youll find somethin to eat still if yer haint hogged it all youve ett moren any three of us today  an day fore that  an the last two months  sence youve been here  i am not addressin myself to the young an immature  i am speakin to those whose opinion an experience commands respect  i saw rod raise his head as though he were about to make a remark then he dropped it again and stood threecornered like a ploughhorse  rod can cover his mile in a shade under three minutes on an ordinary road to an ordinary buggy he is tremendously powerful behind but like most hambletonians he grows a trifle sullen as he gets older  no one can love rod very much but no one can help respecting him  i wish to wake those the yellow horse went on to an abidin sense o their wrongs an their injuries an their outrages  haows that said marcus aurelius antoninus dreamily he thought boney was talking of some kind of feed  an when i say outrages and injuries  boney waved his tail furiously  i mean em too great oats thats just what i do mean plain an straight  the gentleman talks quite earnest said tuck the mare to nip her brothertheres no doubt thinkin broadens the horizons o the mind his language is quite lofty  hesh sis nip answered  he haint widened nothin cep the circle hes ett in pasture they feed words fer beddin where he comes from  its elegant talkin though tuck returned with an unconvinced toss of her pretty lean little head  the yellow horse heard her and struck an attitude which he meant to be extremely impressive it made him look as though he had been badly stuffed  now i ask you i ask you without prejudice an without favourwhat has man the oppressor ever done for you  are you not inalienably entitled to the free air o heaven blowin acrost this boundless prairie  hev ye ever wintered here said the deacon merrily while the others snickered  its kinder cool  not yet said boney  i come from the boundless confines o kansas where the noblest of our kind have their abidinplace among the sunflowers on the threshold o the settin sun in his glory  an they sent you ahead as a sample  said rick with an amused quiver of his long beautifully groomed tail as thick and as fine and as wavy as a quadroons back hair  kansas sir needs no advertisement  her native sons rely on themselves an their native sires  yes sir  then tweezy lifted up his wise and polite old head  his affliction makes him bashful as a rule but he is ever the most courteous of horses  excuse me suh he said slowly but unless i have been misinfohmed most of your prominent siahs suh are impoted from kentucky an im from paduky  there was the least little touch of pride in the last words  any horse dat knows beans said muldoon suddenly he had been standing with his hairy chin on tweezys broad quarters gits outer kansas fore dey crip his shoes  i blew in dere from ioway in de days o me youth an innocence an i wuz grateful when dey boxed me fer n york  you cant tell me anything about kansas i dont wanter fergit  de belt line stables aint no hoffman house but deyre vanderbilts longside  kansas  what the horses o kansas think today the horses of america will think tomorrow an i tell you that when the horses of america rise in their might the day o the oppressor is ended  there was a pause till rick said with a little grunt  ef you put it that way every one of us has riz in his might cep marcus mebbe  marky j ever rise in yer might  nope said marcus aurelius antoninus thoughtfully quidding over a mouthful of grass i seen a heap o fools try though  you admit that you riz  said the kansas horse excitedly then why  why in kansas did you ever go under again  horse cant walk on his hind legs all the time said the deacon  not when hes jerked over on his back fore he knows what fetched him weve all done it boney said rick nip an tuck they tried it spite o what the deacon told em an the deacon he tried it spite o what me an rod told him an me an rod tried it spite o what grandee told us an i guess grandee he tried it spite oo what his dam told him its the same old circus from generation to generation colt cant see why hes called on to back same old rearm on end  straight up same old feelin that youve bested em this time same old little yank at your mouth when youre up good an tall same old pegasusact wonderin where youll light same old wop when you hit the dirt with your head where your tail should be and your inards shook up like a branmash same old voice in your ear waal ye little fool an what did you reckon to make by that were through with risin in our might on this farm we go to pole er single accordin ez were hitched  an man the oppressor sets an gloats over you same as hes settin now haint that been your experience madam  this last remark was addressed to tedda and any one could see with half an eye that poor old anxious fidgety tedda stamping at the flies must have left a wild and tumultuous youth behind her  pends on the man she answered shifting from one foot to the other and addressing herself to the home horses they abused me dreffle when i was young i guess i was sperrity an nervous some but they didnt allow for thattwas in monroe county noo york an sence then till i come here ive run away with more men than ud fill a boardinhouse why the man that sold me here he says to the boss s he  mind now ive warned you  twont be none of my fault if she sheds you daown the road  dont you drive her in a topbuggy ner thout winkers s he ner thought this bit ef you look to come home behind her n the fust thing the boss did was to git the topbuggy  cant say as i like topbuggies said rick they dont balance good  suit me to a haar said marcus aurelius antoninus  topbuggy means the babys in behind an i kin stop while she gathers the pretty flowers  yes an pick a maouthful too the womenfolk all say i hev to be humoured an i dont kerry things to the sweatinpoint  course ive no prejudice against a topbuggy s long s i can see it tedda went on quickly its hafseein the pesky thing bobbin an balancn behind the winkers gits on my nerves  then the boss looked at the bit theyd sold with me an s he jiminy christmas  this ud make a clotheshorse stan n end then he gave me a plain bar bit an fitted it s if there was some feelin to my maouth  haint ye got any miss tedda said tuck who has a mouth like velvet and knows it  might a had miss tuck but ive forgot then he give me an open bridle my styles an open bridle  an  i dunno as i ought to tell this by rights he give  me  a kiss  my said tuck i cant tell fer the shoes o me what makes some men so fresh  pshaw sis said nip whats the sense in actin so you git a kiss reglar s hitchinup time  well you neednt tell smarty said tuck with a squeal and a kick  id heard o kisses o course tedda went on but they hadnt come my way specially  i dont mind tellin i was that took aback at that mans doins he might ha lit firecrackers on my saddle then we went out jest s if a kiss was nothin an i wasnt three strides into my gait fore i felt the boss knoo his business an was trustin me so i studied to please him an whenever took the whip from the dash  a whip drives me plumb distracted  an the upshot was that  waal ive come up the back pasture today an the coupes tipped clear over twice an ive waited till twuz fixed each time you kin judge for yourselves i dont set up to be no better than my neighbours specially with my tail snipped off the way tis but i want you all to know teddas quit fightin in harness or out of it cep when theres a born fool in the pasture stuffin his stummick with board that aint rightly hisn cause he haint earned it  meanin me madam said the yellow horse   ef the shoe fits clinch it said tedda snorting i named no names though to be sure some folks are mean enough an greedy enough to do thout em  theres a deal to be forgiven to ignorance said the yellow horse with an ugly look in his blue eye  seeminly yes or some folks ud ha been kicked raound the pasture bout onct a minute sence they came  board er no board  but what you do not understand if you will excuse me madam is that the whole principle o servitood which includes keep an feed starts from a radically false basis an i am proud to say that me an the majority o the horses o kansas think the entire concern should be relegated to the limbo of exploded superstitions i say were too progressive for that i say were too enlightened for that twas good enough s long s we didnt think but naow  but naow  a new loominary has arisen on the horizon  meanin you said the deacon  the horses o kansas are behind me with their multitoodinous thunderin hooves an we say simply but grandly that we take our stand with all four feet on the inalienable rights of the horse pure and simple the hightoned child o nature fed by the same wavin grass cooled by the same ripplin brook yes an warmed by the same genrous sun as falls impartially on the outside an the inside of the pampered machine o the trottintrack or the bloated coupehorses o these yere eastern cities are we not the same flesh an blood  not by a bushel an a half said the deacon under his breath  grandee never was in kansas  my aint that elegant though abaout the wavin grass an the ripplin brooks tuck whispered in nips ear the gentlemans real convincin i think  i say we are the same flesh an blood are we to be separated horse from horse by the artificial barriers of a trottinrecord or are we to look down upon each other on the strength o the gifts o nature  an extry inch below the knee or slightly more powerful quarters whats the use o them advantages to you man the oppressor comes along an sees youre likely an goodlookin an grinds you to the face o the earth what for for his own pleasure for his own convenience  young an old black an bay white an grey theres no distinctions made between us  were ground up together under the remorseless teeth o the engines of oppression   guess his breechin must ha broke goin daownhill said the deacon slippery road maybe an the buggy come onter him an he didnt know nough to hold back that dont feel like teeth though maybe he busted a shaft an it pricked him  an i come to you from kansas wavin the tail o friendship to all an sundry an in the name of the uncounted millions o pureminded hightoned horses now strugglin towards the light o freedom i say to you rub noses with us in our sacred an holy cause the power is yourn without you i say man the oppressor cannot move himself from place to place without you he cannot reap he cannot sow he cannot plough  mighty odd place kansas said marcus aurelius antoninus seeminly they reap in the spring an plough in the fall guess its right fer them but twould make me kinder giddy  the producs of your untirin industry would rot on the ground if you did not weakly consent to help him let em rot i say let him call you to the stables in vain an nevermore let him shake his ensnarin oats under your nose in vain let the brahmas roost in the buggy an the rats run riot round the reaper let him walk on his two hind feet till they blame well drop off win no more souldestroyn races for his pleasure then an not till then will man the oppressor know where hes at quit workin fellowsufferers an slaves kick rear plunge lie down on the shafts an woller smash an destroy the conflict will be but short an the victory is certain after that we can press our inalienable rights to eight quarts o oats a day two good blankets an a flynet an the best o stablin  the yellow horse shut his yellow teeth with a triumphant snap and tuck said with a sigh  seemss if somethin ought to be done dont seem right somehow oppressin us an all to my way o thinkin  said muldoon in a faraway and sleepy voice  who in vermonts goin to haul de inalienable oats dey weigh like sam hill an sixty bushel at dat allowance aint goin to last tree weeks here an deres de winter hay for five monts  we can settle those minor details when the great cause is won said the yellow horse let us return simply but grandly to our inalienable rights  the right o freedom on these yere verdant hills an no invijjus distinctions o track an pedigree  what in stables jer call an invijjus distinction said the deacon stiffly  fer one thing bein a bloated pampered trotter jest because you happen to be raised that way an couldnt no more help trottin than eatin  do ye know anythin about trotters said the deacon  ive seen em trot that was enough for me i dont want to know any more trottin s immoral  waal ill tell you this much they dont bloat an they dont pamp  much i dont hold out to be no trotter myself though i am free to say i had hopes that way  onct but i do say fer ive seen em trained that a trotter dont trot with his feet he trots with his head an he does more work  ef you know what that is  in a week than you er your sire ever done in all your lives hes everlastingly at it a trotter is an when he isnt hes studyin haow you seen em trot much you hev you was hitched to a rail back o the stand in a buckboard with a soapbox nailed on the slats an a frowzy bufflo atop while your man peddled rum fer lemonade to little boys as thought they was actin manly till you was both run off the track an jailed you intoed shufflin swaybacked windsuckin skate you  dont get het up deacon said tweezy quietly now suh would you consider a foxtrot an singlefoot an rack an pace an amble distinctions not worth distinguishin i assuah you gentlemen there was a time befo i was afflicted in my hip if youll pardon me miss tuck when i was quite celebrated in paduky for all those gaits an in my opinion the deacons corect when he says that a hose of any position in society gets his gaits by his haid an not by  his ah limbs miss tuck i reckon im very little good now but im rememberin the things i used to do befo i took to transpotin real estate with the help an assistance of this gentleman here he looked at muldoon  invijjus arterficial hind legs  said the excarhorse with a grunt of

crowd but any horse dats worked on de belt four years dont train wid no simple child o nature  not by de whole length o n york  but can it be possible that with your experience and at your time of life you do not believe that all horses are free and equal said the yellow horsenot till theyre dead muldoon answered quietly an den it depends on de gross total o buttons an mucilage dey gits outer youse at barren island  they tell me youre a prominent philosopher the yellow horse turned to marcus can you deny a basic and pivotal statement such as this  i dont deny anythin said marcus aurelius antoninus cautiously but ef you ast me i should say twuz more different sorts o clipped oats of a lie than anythin ive had my teeth into sence i wuz foaled  are you a horse said the yellow horse  them that knows me best low i am  aint i a horse  yep one kind ofthen aint you an me equal  how fer kin you go in a day to a loaded buggy drawin five hundred pounds marcus asked carelessly  that has nothing to do with the case the yellow horse answered excitedly  theres nothing i know hez more to do with the case marcus replied  kin ye yank a full car outer de tracks ten times in de mornin said muldoon  kin ye go to keene  fortytwo mile in an afternoon  with a mate said rick an turn out bright an early next mornin  was there evah any time in your careah suh  i am not referrin to the present circumstances but our mutual glorious past  when you could carry a pretty girl to market hahnsome an let her knit all the way on account o the smoothness o the motion said tweezy  kin you keep your feet through the west river bridge with the narrergage comin in on one side an the montreal flyer the other an the old bridge teeterin between said the deacon kin you put your nose down on the cowcatcher of a locomotive when youre waitin at the depot an let em play curfew shall not ring tonight with the big brass bell  kin you hold back when the brichin breaks kin you stop fer orders when your nigh hind legs over your trace an ye feel good of a frosty mornin said nip who had only learned that trick last winter and thought it was the crown of horsely knowledge  whats the use o talk in said tedda gabler scornfully what kin ye do  i rely on my simple rights  the inalienable rights o my unfettered horsehood an i am proud to say i have never since my first shoes lowered myself to obeyin the will o man  must ha had a heap o whips broke over yer yaller back said tedda  hev ye found it paid any  sorrer has been my portion since the day i was foaled  blows an boots an whips an insults  injury outrage an oppression i would not endoor the degradin badges o servitood that connect us with the buggy an the farmwagon  its amazin difficult to draw a buggy thout traces er collar er

fer some of us tedda snorted  i only ask that each horse should work for himself an enjoy the profit of his labours let him work intelligently an not as a machine  there aint no horse that works like a machine marcus began  theres no way o workin that doesnt mean goin to pole er single  they never put me in the powermachine  er under saddle said rick  oh shucks  were talkin same ez we graze said nip raound an raound in circles rod we haint heard from you yet an youve more knowhow than any span here  rod the offhorse of the pair had been standing with one hip lifted like a tired cow and you could only tell by the quick flutter of the haw across his eye from time to time that he was paying any attention to the argument he thrust his jaw out sidewise as his habit is when he pulls and changed his leg his voice was hard and heavy and his ears were close to his big plain hambletonian head  how old are you he said to the yellow horse  nigh thirteen i guess  mean age ugly age im gettin that way myself how long hev ye been pawin this firefanged stablelitter  if you mean my principles ive held em sence i was three  mean age ugly age teeth give heaps o trouble then set a colt to actin crazy fer a while youve kep it up seeminly dye talk much to your neighbours fer a steady thing  i uphold the principles o the cause wherever i am pastured  done a heap o good i guess  i am proud to say i have taught a few of my companions the principles o freedom an liberty  meanin they ran away er kicked when they got the chanst  i was talkin in the abstrac an not in the concrete  my teachins educated them  what a horse specially a young horse hears in the abstrac hes liable to do in the concord you was handled late i presoom  four risin five  thats where the trouble began driv by a woman like ez not  eh  not fer long said the yellow horse with a snap of his teeth  spilled her  i heerd she never drove again  any childern  buckboards full of em  men too  i have shed consideble men in my time  by kickin  any way that come along fallin back over the dash is as handy as most  they must be turrble afraid o you daowntaown  theyve sent me here to get rid o me i guess they spend their time talkin over my campaignsi wanter know  yes sir now all you gentlemen have asked me what i can do  ill just show you see them two fellers lyin down by the buggy  yep one of em owns me tother broke me said rod  get em out here in the open an ill show you something lemme hide back o you peoples so s they wont see what im at  meanin ter kill em rod drawled there was a shudder of horror through the others but the yellow horse never noticed  ill catch em by the back o the neck an piledrive em a piece they can suit emselves about livin when im through with em  shouldnt wonder ef they did said rod the yellow horse had hidden himself very cleverly behind the others as they stood in a group and was swaying his head close to the ground with a curious scythelike motion looking sidewise out of his wicked eyes  you can never mistake a maneater getting ready to knock a man down we had had one to pasture the year before  see that said my companion turning over on the pineneedles nice for a woman walking cross lots wouldnt it be  bring em out said the yellow horse hunching his sharp back theres no chance among them tall trees bring out the  oh ouch  it was a rightandleft kick from muldoon  i had no idea that the old carhorse could lift so quickly both blows caught the yellow horse full and fair in the ribs and knocked the breath out of him  whats that for he said angrily when he recovered himself but i noticed he did not draw any nearer to muldoon than was necessary  muldoon never answered but discoursed to himself in the whining grunt that he uses when he is going downhill in front of a heavy load we call it singing but i think its something much worse really the yellow horse blustered and squealed a little and at last said that if it was a horsefly that had stung muldoon he would accept an apology  youll get it said muldoon in de sweet byandbye  all de apology youve any use for excuse me interruptin you mr rod but im like tweezy  ive a southern drawback in me hind legs  naow i want you all here to take notice an youll learn something rod went on this yallerbacked skate comes to our pastur  not havin paid his board put in tedda  not havin earned his board an talks smooth to

as never done him no harm jest becase they owned horses  an knowed how to manage em said tedda that makes it worse  waal he didnt kill em anyway said marcus hed ha been half killed ef he had tried

a twitch an their hands full o stones to throw at us same s if we wuz hogs er hooky keows moren that leavin out tedda here  an i guess its more her maouth than her manners stands in her light there

fit my temper in stall an harness hitched up an at pasture till the sweat trickled off my hooves an they thought i wuz off condition an drenched me  when my affliction came said tweezy gently i was very near to losin my manners allow me to extend to you my sympathy suh  rick said nothing but he looked at rod curiously rick is a sunnytempered child who never bears malice and i dont think he quite understood he gets his temper from his mother as a horse should  ive been there too rod said tedda open confessions good for the soul an all monroe county knows ive had my experriences  but if you will excuse me suh that pussontweezy looked unspeakable things aat the yellow horse  that pusson who has insulted our intelligences comes from kansas an what a hose of his position an kansas at that says cannot by any stretch of the halter concern gentlemen of our position theres no shadow of equalty suh not even for one kick hes beneath our contempt  let him talk said marcus its always interestin to know what another horse thinks it dont tech us  an he talks so too said tuck ive never heard anythin so  smart for a long time  again rod stuck out his jaws sidewise and went on slowly as though he were slugging on a plain bit at the end of a thirtymile drive  i want all you here ter understand thet ther aint no kansas ner no kentucky ner yet no vermont in our business theres jest two kind o horse in the united statesthem ez can an will do their work after bein properly broke an handled an them as wont im sick an tired o this everlastin tailswitchin an wickerin abaout one state er another a horse kin be proud o his state an swap lies abaout it in stall or when hes hitched to a block ef he keers to put in flytime that way but he haint no right to let that pride o hisn interfere with his work ner to make it an excuse fer claimin hes different thats colts talk an dont you fergit it tweezy an marcusyou remember that hem a philosopher an anxious to save trouble fer you

rod had finished and we climbed into the coupe tedda whinnying as we bumped over the ledges well im dreffle sorry i cant stay fer the sociable but i hope an trust my friendsll take a ticket fer me  bet your natchul said muldoon cheerfully and the horses scattered before us trotting into the ravine  next morning we sent back to the liverystable what was left of the yellow horse  it seemed tired but anxious to go  end of a walking delegate    the ship that found herself  it was her first voyage and though she was but a cargosteamer of twentyfive hundred tons she was the very best of her kind the outcome of forty years of experiments and improvements in framework and machinery and her designers and owner thought as much of her as though she had been the lucania any one can make a floating hotel that will pay expenses if he puts enough money into the saloon and charges for private baths suites of rooms and such like but in these days of competition and low freights every square inch of a cargoboat must be built for cheapness great holdcapacity and a certain steady speed this boat was perhaps two hundred and forty feet long and thirtytwo feet wide with arrangements that enabled her to carry cattle on her main and sheep on her upper deck if she wanted to but her great glory was the amount of cargo that she could store away in her holds her owners they were a very well known scotch firm came round with her from the north where she had been launched and christened and fitted to liverpool where she was to take cargo for new york and the owners daughter miss frazier went to and fro on the clean decks admiring the new paint and the brass work and the patent winches and particularly the strong straight bow over which she had cracked a bottle of champagne when she named the steamer the dimbula  it was a beautiful september afternoon and the boat in all her newness  she was painted leadcolour with a red funnel  looked very fine indeed  her houseflag was flying and her whistle from time to time acknowledged the salutes of friendly boats who saw that she was new to the high and narrow seas and wished to make her welcome  and now said miss frazier delightedly to the captain shes a real ship isnt she  it seems only the other day father gave the order for her and now  and now  isnt she a beauty the girl was proud of the firm and talked as though she were the controlling partner  oh shes no so bad the skipper replied cautiously  but im sayin that it takes more than christenin to mak a ship in the nature o things miss frazier if ye follow me shes just irons and rivets and plates put into the form of a ship she has to find herself yet  i thought father said she was exceptionally well foundso she is said the skipper with a laugh but its this way wi ships miss frazier  shes all here but the parrts of her have not learned to work together yet theyve had no chance  the engines are working beautifully i can hear them  yes indeed but theres more than engines to a ship  every inch of her yell understand has to be livened up and made to work wi its neighbour  sweetenin her we call it technically  and how will you do it the girl asked  we can no more than drive and steer her and so forth but if we have rough weather this trip  its likely  shell learn the rest by heart  for a ship yell obsairve miss frazier is in no sense a reegid body closed at both ends shes a highly complex structure o various an conflictin strains wi tissues that must give an tak accordin to her personal modulus of elasteecity  mr buchanan the chief engineer was coming towards them im sayin to miss frazier here that our little dimbula has to be sweetened yet and nothin but a gale will do it  hows all wi  your engines buck  well enough  true by plumb an rule o course but theres no spontaneeity yet  he turned to the girl take my word miss frazier and maybe yell comprehend later even after a pretty girls christened a ship it does not follow that theres such a thing as a ship under the men  that work her  i was sayin the very same mr buchanan the skipper interrupted  thats more metaphysical than i can follow said miss frazier laughing  why so  yere good scotch an i knew your mothers father he was fra dumfries  yeve a vested right in metapheesics miss frazier just as ye have in the dimbula the engineer said  eh well we must go down to the deep watters an earn miss frazier her deevidends  will you not come to my cabin for tea said the skipper  well be in dock the night and when youre goin back to glasgie ye can think of us loadin her down an drivin her forth  all for your sake  in the next few days they stowed some four thousand tons deadweight into the dimbula and took her out from liverpool  as soon as she met the lift of the open water she naturally began to talk  if you lay your ear to the side of the cabin the next time you are in a steamer you will hear hundreds of little voices in every direction thrilling and buzzing and whispering and popping and gurgling and sobbing and squeaking exactly like a telephone in a thunderstorm  wooden ships shriek and growl and grunt but iron vessels throb and quiver through all their hundreds of ribs and thousands of rivets the dimbula was very strongly built and every piece of her had a letter or a number or both to describe it and every piece had been hammered or forged or rolled or punched by man and had lived in the roar and rattle of the shipyard for months  therefore every piece had its own separate voice in exact proportion to the amount of trouble spent upon it  castiron as a rule says very little but mild steel plates and wroughtiron and ribs and beams that have been much bent and welded and riveted talk continuously  their conversation of course is not half as wise as our human talk because they are all though they do not know it bound down one to the other in a black darkness where they cannot tell what is happening near them nor what will overtake them next  as soon as she had cleared the irish coast a sullen greyheaded old wave of the atlantic climbed leisurely over her straight bows and sat down on the steamcapstan used for hauling up the anchor  now the capstan and the engine that drove it had been newly painted red and green besides which nobody likes being ducked  dont you do that again the capstan sputtered through the teeth of his cogs  hi wheres the fellow gone  the wave had slouched overside with a plop and a chuckle but plenty more where he came from said a brotherwave and went through and over the capstan who was bolted firmly to an iron plate on the iron deckbeams below  cant you keep still up there said the deckbeams  whats the matter with you  one minute you weigh twice as much as you ought to and the next you dont  it isnt my fault said the capstan theres a green brute outside that comes and hits me on the head  tell that to the shipwrights youve been in position for months and youve never wriggled like this before  if you arent careful youll strain us  talking of strain said a low rasping unpleasant voice are any of you fellows  you deckbeams we mean  aware that those exceedingly ugly knees of yours happen to be riveted into our structure  ours  who might you be the deckbeams inquired  oh nobody in particular was the answer were only the port and starboard upperdeck stringers and if you persist in heaving and hiking like this we shall be reluctantly compelled to take steps  now the stringers of the ship are long iron girders so to speak that run lengthways from stern to bow they keep the iron frames what are called ribs in a wooden ship in place and also help to hold the ends of the deckbeams which go from side to side of the ship  stringers always consider themselves most important because they are so long  you will take steps  will you  this was a long echoing rumble  it came from the frames  scores and scores of them each one about eighteen inches  distant from the next and each riveted to the stringers in four places we think you will have a certain amount of trouble in that and thousands and  thousands of the little rivets that held everything together whispered you  will you will stop quivering and be quiet hold on brethren hold on hot punches whats that  rivets have no teeth so they cannot chatter with fright but they did their best as a fluttering jar swept along the ship from stern to bow and she shook like a rat in a terriers mouth  an unusually severe pitch for the sea was rising had lifted the big throbbing screw nearly to the surface and it was spinning round in a kind of sodawater  half sea and half air  going much faster than was proper because there was no deep water for it to work in  as it sank again the engines  and they were triple expansion three cylinders in a row  snorted through all their three pistons was that a joke you fellow outsideits an uncommonly poor one how are we to do our work if you fly off the  handle that way  i didnt fly off the handle said the screw twirling huskily at the end of the screwshaft if i had youd have been scrapiron by this time the sea dropped away from under me and i had nothing to catch on to  thats all  thats all dyou call it said the thrustblock whose business it is to take the push of the screw for if a screw had nothing to hold it back it would crawl right into the engineroom  it is the holding back of the screwing action that gives the drive to a ship  i know i do my work deep down and out of sight but i warn you i expect justice all i ask for is bare justice why cant you push steadily and evenly instead of whizzing like a whirligig and making me hot under all my collars  the thrustblock had six collars each faced with brass and he did not wish to get them heated  all the bearings that supported the fifty feet of screwshaft as it ran to the stern whispered justice  give us justice  i can only give you what i can get the screw answered  look out its coming again  he rose with a roar as the dimbula plunged and whack  flack  whack  whack went the engines furiously for they had little to check them  im the noblest outcome of human ingenuity  mr buchanan says so squealed the highpressure cylinder  this is simply ridiculous the piston went up savagely and choked for half the steam behind it was mixed with dirty water help oiler fitter stoker help im choking it gaspednever in the history of maritime invention has such a calamity overtaken one so young and strong and if i go whos to drive the ship  hush oh hush whispered the steam who of course had been to sea many times before he used to spend his leisure ashore in a cloud or a gutter or a flowerpot or a thunderstorm or anywhere else where water was needed thats only a little priming a little carryingover as they call it  itll happen all night on and off  i dont say its nice but its the best we can do under the circumstances  what difference can circumstances make  im here to do my work  on clean dry steam blow circumstances the cylinder roared  the circumstances will attend to the blowing ive worked on the north atlantic run a good many times  its going to be rough before morning  it isnt distressingly calm now said the extra strong frames  they were called webframes  in the engineroom  theres an upward thrust that we dont understand and theres a twist that is very bad for our brackets and diamond plates and theres a sort of westnorthwesterly pull that follows the twist  which seriously annoys us we mention this because we happened to cost a good  deal of money and we feel sure that the owner would not approve of our being treated in this frivolous way  im afraid the matter is out of owners hands for the present said the steam slipping into the condenser  youre left to your own devices till the weather betters  i wouldnt mind the weather said a flat bass voice below its this confounded cargo thats breaking my heart  im the garboardstrake and im twice as thick as most of the others and i ought to know something  the garboardstrake is the lowest plate in the bottom of a ship and the dimbulas garboardstrake was nearly threequarters of an inch mild steel  the sea pushes me up in a way i should never have expected the strake grunted and the cargo pushes me down and between the two i dont know what im supposed to do  when in doubt hold on rumbled the steam making head in the boilers  yes but theres only dark and cold and hurry down here and how do i know whether the other plates are doing their duty  those bulwarkplates up above ive heard aint more than fivesixteenths of an inch thick scandalous i call it  i agree with you said a huge webframe by the main cargohatch  he was deeper and thicker than all the others and curved halfway across the ship in the shape of half an arch to support the deck where deckbeams would have been in the way of cargo coming up and down i work entirely unsupported and i observe that i am the sole strength of this vessel so far as my vision extends  the responsibility i assure you is enormous  i believe the moneyvalue of the cargo is over one hundred and fifty thousand pounds think of that  and every pound of it is dependent on my personal exertions  here spoke a seavalve that communicated directly with the water outside and was seated not very far from the garboardstrake  i rejoice to think that i am a princehyde valve with best para rubber facings five patents cover me  i mention this without pride  five separate and several patents each one finer than the other  at present i am screwed fast should i open you would immediately be swamped this is incontrovertible  patent things always use the longest words they can  it is a trick that they pick up from their inventors  thats news said a big centrifugal bilgepump  i had an idea that you were employed to clean decks and things with  at least ive used you for that more than once  i forget the precise number in thousands of gallons which i am guaranteed to throw per hour but i assure you my complaining friends that there is not the least danger  i alone am capable of  clearing any water that may find its way here  by my biggest deliveries we pitched then  the sea was getting up in workmanlike style it was a dead westerly gale blown from under a ragged opening of green sky narrowed on all sides by fat grey clouds and the wind bit like pincers as it fretted the spray into lacework on the flanks of the waves  i tell you what it is the foremast telephoned down its wirestays  im up here and i can take a dispassionate view of things  theres an organised conspiracy against us  im sure of it because every single one of these waves is heading directly for our bows the whole sea is concerned in it  and sos the wind  its awful  whats awful said a wave drowning the capstan for the hundredth time  this organised conspiracy on your part the capstan gurgled taking his cue from the mastorganised bubbles and spindrift  there has been a depression in the gulf of mexico excuse me he leaped overside but his friends took up the tale one after another  which has advanced  that wave hove green water over the funnel  as far as cape hatteras  he drenched the bridge  and is now going out to sea  to sea  to sea the third went out in three surges making a clean sweep of a boat which turned bottom up and sank in the darkening troughs alongside while the broken falls whipped the davits  thats all there is to it seethed the white water roaring through the scuppers  theres no animus in our proceedings were only meteorological corollaries  is it going to get any worse said the bowanchor chained down to the deck where he could only breathe once in five minutes  not knowing cant say wind may blow a bit by midnight  thanks awfully goodbye  the wave that spoke so politely had travelled some distance aft and found itself all mixed up on the deck amidships which was a welldeck sunk between high bulwarks one of the bulwarkplates which was hung on hinges to open outward had swung out and passed the bulk of the water back to the sea again with a clean smack  evidently thats what im made for said the plate closing again with a sputter of pride oh no you dont my friend  the top of a wave was trying to get in from the outside but as the plate did not open in that direction the defeated water spurted back  not bad for fivesixteenths of an inch said the bulwarkplate my work i see is laid down for the night and it began opening and shutting as it was designed to do with the motion of the ship  we are not what you might call idle groaned all the frames together as the dimbula climbed a big wave lay on her side at the top and shot into the next hollow twisting in the descent a huge swell pushed up exactly under her middle and her bow and stern hung free with nothing to support them then one joking wave caught her up at the bow and another at the stern while the rest of the water slunk away from under her just to see how she would like it so she was held up at her two ends only and the weight of the cargo and the machinery fell on the groaning iron keels and bilgestringers  ease off ease off there roared the garboardstrake i want oneeighth of an inch fair play d you hear me you rivets  ease off ease off cried the bilgestringers dont hold us so  tight to the frames  ease off grunted the deckbeams as the dimbula rolled fearfully youve cramped our knees into the stringers and we cant move ease off you flatheaded little nuisances  then two converging seas hit the bows one on each side and fell away in torrents of streaming thunder  ease off shouted the forward collisionbulkhead i want to crumple up but im stiffened in every direction ease off you dirty little forgefilings let me breathe  all the hundreds of plates that are riveted to the frames and make the outside skin of every steamer echoed the call for each plate wanted to shift and creep a little and each plate according to its position complained against the rivets  we cant help it we cant help it they murmured in reply were put here to hold you and were going to do it you never pull us twice in the same direction if youd say what you were going to do next wed try to meet your views  as far as i could feel said the upperdeck planking and that was four inches thick every single iron near me was pushing or pulling in opposite directions now whats the sense of that my friends let us all pull together  pull any way you please roared the funnel so long as you dont try your experiments on me i need fourteen wireropes all pulling in different directions to hold me steady  isnt that so  we believe you my boy whistled the funnelstays through their clinched teeth as they twanged in the wind from the top of the funnel to the deck  nonsense  we must all pull together the decks repeated  pull lengthways  very good said the stringers then stop pushing sideways when you get wet  be content to run gracefully fore and aft and curve in at the ends as we do  no  no curves at the end  a very slight workmanlike curve from  side to side with a good grip at each knee and little pieces welded on said the deckbeams  fiddle cried the iron pillars of the deep dark hold  who ever heard of curves  stand up straight be a perfectly round column and carry tons of good solid weight  like that there  a big sea smashed on the deck above and the pillars stiffened themselves to the load  straight up and down is not bad said the frames who ran that way in the sides of the ship but you must also expand yourselves sideways expansion is the law of life children  open out open out  come back said the deckbeams savagely as the upward heave of the sea made the frames try to open come back to your bearings you slackjawed irons  rigidity  rigidity  rigidity thumped the engines absolute unvarying rigidity rigidity  you see whined the rivets in chorus no two of you will ever pull alike and  and you blame it all on us we only know how to go through a plate and bite down on both sides so that it cant and mustnt and shant move  ive got one fraction of an inch play at any rate said the garboardstrake triumphantly so he had and all the bottom of the ship felt the easier for it  then were no good sobbed the bottom rivets we were ordered  we were ordered never to give and weve given and the sea will come in and well all go to the bottom together first were blamed for everything unpleasant and now we havent the consolation of having done our work  dont say i told you whispered the steam consolingly but between  you and me and the last cloud i came from it was bound to happen sooner or later you had to give a fraction and youve given without knowing it now hold on as before  whats the use a few hundred rivets chattered weve given  weve given and the sooner we confess that we cant keep the ship together and go off our little heads the easier it will be no rivet forged can stand this strain  no one rivet was ever meant to share it among you the steam answeredthe others can have my share im going to pull out said a rivet in one of the forward plates  if you go others will follow hissed the steam  theres nothing so contagious in a boat as rivets going why i knew a little chap like you  he was an eighth of an inch fatter though  on a steamer  to be sure she was only twelve hundred tons now i come to think of it in exactly the same place as you are  he pulled out in a bit of a bobble of a sea not half as bad as this and he started all his friends on the same buttstrap and the plates opened like a furnace door and i had to climb into the nearest fogbank while the boat went down  now thats peculiarly disgraceful said the rivet fatter than me was he and in a steamer not half our tonnage reedy little peg i blush for the family sir he settled himself more firmly than ever in his place and the steam chuckled  you see he went on quite gravely  a rivet and especially a rivet in your position is really the one indispensable part of the ship  the steam did not say that be had whispered the very same thing to every single piece of iron aboard there is no sense in telling too much  and all that while the little dimbula pitched and chopped and swung and slewed and lay down as though she were going to die and got up as  though she had been stung and threw her nose round and round in circles half a dozen times as she dipped for the gale was at its worst it was inky black in spite of the tearing white froth on the waves and to top everything the rain began to fall in sheets so that you could not see your hand before your face this did not make much difference to the ironwork below but it troubled the foremast a good deal  now its all finished he said dismally the conspiracy is too strong for us there is nothing left but to   hurraar brrrraaah brrrrrrp roared the steam through the foghorn till the decks quivered dont be frightened below  its only me just throwing out a few words in case any one happens to be rolling round tonight  you dont mean to say theres any one except us on the sea in such weather said the funnel in a husky snuffle  scores of em said the steam clearing its throat rrrrrraaa brraaaaa prrrrp its a trifle windy up here and great boilers how it rains  were drowning said the scuppers they had been doing nothing else all night but this steady thrash of rain above them seemed to be the end of the world  thats all right well be easier in an hour or two first the wind and then the rain soon you may make sail again grrraaaaaah drrrraaaa drrrp i have a notion that the sea is going down already  if it does youll learn something about rolling  weve only pitched till now by the way arent you chaps in the hold a little easier than you were  there was just as much groaning and straining as ever but it was not so loud or squeaky in tone and when the ship quivered she did not jar stiffly like a poker hit on the floor but gave with a supple little waggle like a perfectly balanced golfclub  we have made a most amazing discovery said the stringers one after another a discovery that entirely changes the situation we have found for the first time in the history of shipbuilding that the inward pull of the deckbeams and the outward thrust of the frames locks us as it were more closely in our places and enables us to endure a strain which is entirely without parallel in the records of marine architecture  the steam turned a laugh quickly into a roar up the foghorn what  massive intellects you great stringers have he said softly when he had finished  we also began the deckbeams are discoverers and geniuses we are of opinion that the support of the holdpillars materially helps us  we find that we lock up on them when we are subjected to a heavy and singular weight of sea above  here the dimbula shot down a hollow lying almost on her side righting at the bottom with a wrench and a spasm  in these cases  are you aware of this steam  the plating at the bows and particularly at the stern  we would also mention the floors beneath us  help us to resist any tendency to spring the frames spoke in the solemn awed voice which people use when they have just come across something entirely new for the very first time  im only a poor puffy little flutterer said the steam but i have to stand a good deal of pressure in my business its all tremendously interesting tell us some more you fellows are so strong  watch us and youll see said the bowplates proudly  ready behind there  heres the father and mother of waves coming sit tight rivets all a great sluicing comber thundered by but through the scuffle and confusion the steam could hear the low quick cries of the ironwork as the various strains took them  cries like these easy now  easy now push for all your strength hold out give a fraction hold up pull in shove crossways mind the strain at the ends grip now bite tight let the water get away from under  and there she goes  the wave raced off into the darkness shouting not bad that if its your first run and the drenched and ducked ship throbbed to the beat of the engines inside her all three cylinders were white with the salt spray that had come down through the engineroom hatch there was white fur on the canvasbound steampipes and even the brightwork deep below was speckled and soiled but the cylinders had learned to make the most of steam that was half water and were pounding along cheerfully  hows the noblest outcome of human ingenuity hitting it said the steam as he whirled through the engineroom  nothing for nothing in this world of woe the cylinders answered as though they had been working for centuries and precious little for seventyfive pounds head weve made two knots this last hour and a quarter rather humiliating for eight hundred horsepower isnt it  well its better than drifting astern at any rate you seem rather less  how shall i put it  stiff in the back than you were  if youd been hammered as weve been this night you wouldnt be stiff iff iff either theoreti  retti  retti  cally of course rigidity is the thing purrr  purr  practically there has to be a little give and take we found that out by working on our sides for five minutes at a stretch  chch  chh hows the weather  seas going down fast said the steam  good business said the highpressure cylinder whack her up boys theyve given us five pounds more steam and he began humming the first bars of said the young obadiah to the old obadiah which as you may have noticed is a pet tune among engines not built for high speed racingliners with twinscrews sing the turkish patrol and the overture to the bronze horse and madame angot till something goes wrong and then they render gounods funeral march of a marionette with variations  youll learn a song of your own some fine day said the steam as he flew up the foghorn for one last bellow  next day the sky cleared and the sea dropped a little and the dimbula began to roll from side to side till every inch of iron in her was sick and giddybut luckily they did not all feel ill at the same time otherwise she would have opened out like a wet paper box  the steam whistled warnings as he went about his business it is in this short quick roll and tumble that follows a heavy sea that most of the accidents happen for then everything thinks that the worst is over and goes off guard  so he orated and chattered till the beams and frames and floors and stringers and things had learned how to lock down and lock up on one another and endure this new kind of strain  they found ample time to practise for they were sixteen days at sea and it was foul weather till within a hundred miles of new york  the dimbula picked up her pilot and came in covered with salt and red rust  her funnel was dirtygrey from top to bottom two boats had been carried away three copper ventilators looked like hats after a fight with the police the bridge had a dimple in the middle of it the house that covered the steam steeringgear was split as with hatchets there was a bill for small repairs in the engineroom almost as long as the screwshaft the forward cargohatch fell into bucketstaves when they raised the iron crossbars and the steamcapstan had been badly wrenched on its bed  altogether as the skipper said it was a pretty general average  but shes soupled he said to mr buchanan for all her deadweight she rode like a yacht ye mind that last blow off the banks  i am proud of her buck  its vera good said the chief engineer looking along the dishevelled decks now a man judgin superfeecially would say we were a wreck but we know otherwise  by experience  naturally everything in the dimbula fairly stiffened with pride and the foremast and the forward collisionbulkhead who are pushing creatures begged the steam to warn the port of new york of their arrival tell those big boats all about us they said they seem to take us quite as a matter of course  it was a glorious clear dead calm morning and in single file with less than half a mile between each their bands playing and their tugboats shouting and waving handkerchiefs were the majestic the paris the touraine the servia the kaiser wilhelm ii and the werkendam all statelily going out to sea as the dimbula shifted her helm to give the great boats clear way the steam who knows far too much to mind making an exhibition of himself now and then shoutedoyez oyez oyez princes dukes and barons of the high seas know ye by these presents we are the dimbula fifteen days nine hours from liverpool having crossed the atlantic with four thousand ton of cargo for the first time in our career we have not foundered we are here eer eer we are not disabled but we have had a time wholly unparalieled in the annals of shipbuilding our decks were swept we pitched we rolled we thought we were going to die hi hi but we didnt we wish to give notice that we have come to new york all the way across the atlantic through the worst weather in the world and we are the dimbula we are  arr  ha  ha  harrr  the beautiful line of boats swept by as steadily as the procession of the seasons the dimbula heard the majestic say hmph and the paris grunted how and the touraine said oui with a little coquettish flicker of steam and the servia said haw and the kaiser and the werkendam said hoch dutch fashion  and that was absolutely all  i did my best said the steam gravely but i dont think they were much impressed with us somehow do you  its simply disgusting said the bowplates they might have seen what weve been through there isnt a ship on the sea that has suffered as we have  is there now  well i wouldnt go so far as that said the steam because ive worked on some of those boats and sent them through weather quite as bad as the fortnight that weve had in six days and some of them are a little over ten thousand tons i believe now ive seen the majestic for instance ducked from her bows to her funnel and ive helped the arizona i think she was to back off an iceberg she met with one dark night and i had to run out of the pariss engineroom one day because there was thirty foot of water in it  of course i dont deny  the steam shut off suddenly as a tugboat loaded with a political club and a brass band that had been to see a new york senator off to europe crossed their bows going to hoboken  there was a long silence that reached without a break from the cutwater to the propellerblades of the dimbula  then a new big voice said slowly and thickly as though the owner had just waked up its my conviction that i have made a fool of myself  the steam knew what had happened at once for when a ship finds herself all the talking of the separate pieces ceases and melts into one voice which is the soul of the ship  who are you he said with a laugh  i am the dimbula of course  ive never been anything else except that  and a fool  the tugboat which was doing its very best to be run down got away just in time its band playing clashily and brassily a popular but impolite air   in the days of old rameses  are you onin the days of old rameses  are you onin the days of old ramesesthat story had paresisare you on  are you on  are you on  well im glad youve found yourself said the steam to tell the truth i was a little tired of talking to all those ribs and stringers heres quarantine after that well go to our wharf and clean up a little and  next month well do it all over again  end of the the ship that found herself    the tomb of his ancestors  some people will tell you that if there were but a single loaf of bread in all india it would be divided equally between the plowdens the trevors the beadons and the rivettcarnacs that is only one way of saying that certain families serve india generation after generation as dolphins follow in line across the open sea  let us take a small and obscure case there has been at least one representative of the devonshire chinns in or near central india since the days of lieutenantfireworker humphrey chinn of the bombay european regiment who assisted at the capture of seringapatam in 1799 alfred ellis chinn humphreys younger brother commanded a regiment of bombay grenadiers from 1804 to 1813 when he saw some mixed fighting and in 1834 john chinn of the same family  we will call him john chinn the first  came to light as a levelheaded administrator in time of trouble at a place called mundesur he died young but left his mark on the new country and the honourable the board of directors of the honourable the east india company embodied his virtues in a stately resolution and paid for the expenses of his tomb among the satpura hills  he was succeeded by his son lionel chinn who left the little old devonshire home just in time to be severely wounded in the mutiny he spent his working life within a hundred and fifty miles of john chinns grave and rose to the command of a regiment of small wild hillmen most of whom had known his father his son john was born in the small thatchedroofed mudwalled cantonment which is even today eighty miles from the nearest railway in the heart of a scrubby tigerish country colonel lionel chinn served thirty years and retired in the canal his steamer passed the outwardbound troopship carrying his son eastward to the family duty  the chinns are luckier than most folk because they know exactly what they must do a clever chinn passes for the bombay civil service and gets away to central india where everybody is glad to see him a dull chinn enters the police department or the woods and forest and sooner or later he too appears in central india and that is what gave rise to the saying central india is inhabited by bhils mairs and chinns all very much alike the breed is smallboned dark and silent and the stupidest of them are good shots john chinn the second was rather clever but as the eldest son he entered the army according to chinn tradition his duty was to abide in his fathers regiment for the term of his natural life though the corps was one which most men would have paid heavily to avoid they were irregulars small dark and blackish clothed in riflegreen with blackleather trimmings and friends called them the wuddars which means a race of lowcaste people who dig up rats to eat but the wuddars did not resent it they were the only wuddars and their points of pride were these  firstly they had fewer english officers than any native regiment secondly their subalterns were not mounted on parade as is the general rule but walked at the head of their men a man who can hold his own with the wuddars at their quickstep must be sound in wind and limb thirdly they were the most pukka shikarries outandout hunters in all india fourthlyup to onehundredthly  they were the wuddars chinns irregular bhil levies of the old days but now henceforward and for ever the wuddars  no englishman entered their mess except for love or through family usage the officers talked to their soldiers in a tongue not two hundred white folk in india understood and the men were their children all drawn from the bhils who are perhaps the strangest of the many strange races in india they were and at heart are wild men furtive shy full of untold superstitions the races whom we call natives of the country found the bhil in possession of the land when they first broke into that part of the world thousands of years ago the books call them prearyan aboriginal dravidian and so forth and in other words that is what the bhils call themselves when a rajput chief whose bards can sing his pedigree backwards for twelve hundred years is set on the throne his investiture is not complete till he has been marked on the forehead with blood from the veins of a bhil the rajputs say the ceremony has no meaning but the bhil knows that it is the last last shadow of his old rights as the longago owner of the soil  centuries of oppression and massacre made the bhil a cruel and halfcrazy thief and cattlestealer and when the english came he seemed to be almost as open to civilisation as the tigers of his own jungles  but john chinn the first father of lionel grandfather of our john went into his country lived with him learned his language shot the deer that stole his poor crops and won his confidence so that some bhils learned to plough and sow while others were coaxed into the companys service to police their friends  when they understood that standing in line did not mean instant execution they accepted soldiering as a cumbrous but amusing kind of sport and were zealous to keep the wild bhils under control that was the thin edge of the wedge john chinn the first gave them written promises that if they were good from a certain date the government would overlook previous offences and since john chinn was never known to break his word  he promised once to hang a bhil locally esteemed invulnerable and hanged him in front of his tribe for seven proved murders  the bhils settled down as steadily as they knew how it was slow unseen work of the sort that is being done all over india today and though john chinns only reward came as i have said in the shape of a grave at government expense the little people of the hills never forgot him  colonel lionel chinn knew and loved them too and they were very fairly civilised for bhils before his service ended many of them could hardly be distinguished from lowcaste hindoo farmers but in the south where john chinn the first was buried the wildest still clung to the satpura ranges cherishing a legend that some day jan chinn as they called him would return to his own  in the mean time they mistrusted the white man and his ways the least excitement would stampede them plundering at random and now and then killing but if they were handled discreetly they grieved like children and promised never to do it again  the bhils of the regiment  the uniformed men  were virtuous in many ways but they needed humouring  they felt bored and homesick unless taken after tiger as beaters and their coldblooded daring  all wuddars shoot tigers on foot it is their castemark  made even the officers wonder they would follow up a wounded tiger as unconcernedly as though it were a sparrow with a broken wing and this through a country full of caves and rifts and pits where a wild beast could hold a dozen men at his mercy now and then some little man was brought to barracks with his head smashed in or his ribs torn away but his companions never learned caution they contented themselves with settling the tiger  young john chinn was decanted at the verandah of the wuddars lonely messhouse from the back seat of a twowheeled cart his guncases cascading all round him the slender little hookeynosed boy looked forlorn as a strayed goat when he slapped the white dust off his knees and the cart jolted down the glaring road  but in his heart he was contented  after all this was the place where he had been born and things were not much changed since he had been sent to england a child fifteen years ago  there were a few new buildings but the air and the smell and the sunshine were the same and the little green men who crossed the paradeground looked very familiar  three weeks ago john chinn would have said he did not remember a word of the bhil tongue but at the mess door he found his lips moving in sentences that he did not understand  bits of old nursery rhymes and tailends of such orders as his father used to give the men  the colonel watched him come up the steps and laughed  look he said to the major  no need to ask the young uns breed  hes a pukka chinn might be his father in the fifties over again  hope hell shoot as straight said the major hes brought enough ironmongery with him  wouldnt be a chinn if he didnt  watch him blowin his nose  regular chinn beak flourishes his handkerchief like his father  its the second edition  line for line  fairy tale by jove said the major peering through the slats of the jalousies  if hes the lawful heir hell      now old chinn could no more pass that chick without fiddling with it than      his son said the colonel jumping up  well i be blowed said the major  the boys eye had been caught by a splitreed screen that hung on a slew between the veranda pillars and mechanically he had tweaked the edge to set it level  old chinn had sworn three times a day at that screen for many years he could never get it to his satisfaction  his son entered the anteroom in the middle of a fivefold silence  they made him welcome for his fathers sake and as they took stock of him for his own  he was ridiculously like the portrait of the colonel on the wall and when he had washed a little of the dust from his throat he went to his quarters with the old mans short noiseless junglestep  so much for heredity said the major that comes of four generations among the bhils  and the men know it said a wing officer theyve been waiting for this youth with their tongues hanging out  i am persuaded that unless he absolutely beats em over the head theyll lie down by companies and worship him  nothin like havin a father before you said the major  im a parvenu with my chaps  ive only been twenty years in the regiment and my revered parent he was a simple squire  theres no getting at the bottom of a bhils mind  now why is the superior bearer that young chinn brought with him fleeing across country with his bundle  he stepped into the verandah and shouted after the man  a typical newjoined subalterns servant who speaks english and cheats in proportion  what is it he called  plenty bad man here  i going sar was the reply  have taken sahibs keys and say will shoot  doocid lucid  doocid convincin how those upcountry thieves can leg it  he has been badly frightened by some one the major strolled to his quarters to dress for mess  young chinn walking like a man in a dream had fetched a compass round the entire cantonment before going to his own tiny cottage the captains quarters in which he had been born delayed him for a little then he looked at the well on the paradeground where he had sat of evenings with his nurse and at the tenbyfourteen church where the officers went to service if a chaplain of any official creed happened to come along it seemed very small as compared with the gigantic buildings he used to stare up at but it was the same place  from time to time he passed a knot of silent soldiers who saluted they might have been the very men who had carried him on their backs when he was in his first knickerbockers a faint light burned in his room and as he entered hands clasped his feet and a voice murmured from the floor  who is it said young chinn not knowing he spoke in the bhil tongue  i bore you in my arms sahib when i was a strong man and you were a small one  crying crying crying  i am your servant as i was your fathers before you  we are all your servants  young chinn could not trust himself to reply and the voice went on  i have taken your keys from that fat foreigner and sent him away and the studs are in the shirt for mess  who should know if i do not know and so the baby has become a man and forgets his nurse but my nephew shall make a good servant or i will beat him twice a day  then there rose up with a rattle as straight as a bhil arrow a little whitehaired wizened ape of a man with medals and orders on his tunic stammering saluting and trembling  behind him a young and wiry bhil in uniform was taking the trees out of chinns messboots  chinns eyes were full of tears  the old man held out his keys  foreigners are bad people  he will never come back again  we are all servants of your fathers son  has the sahib forgotten who took him to see the trapped tiger in the village across the river when his mother was so frightened and he was so brave  the scene came back to chinn in great magiclantern flashes bukta he cried and all in a breath you promised nothing should hurt me is it bukta  the man was at his feet a second time he has not forgotten  he remembers his own people as his father remembered  now can i die  but first i will live and show the sahib how to kill tigers  that that yonder is my nephew  if he is not a good servant beat him and send him to me and i will surely kill him for now the sahib is with his own people  ai jan haba  jan haba my jan haba  i will stay here and see that this does his work well  take off his boots fool sit down upon the bed sahib and let me look  it is jan haba  he pushed forward the hilt of his sword as a sign of service which is an honour paid only to viceroys governors generals or to little children whom one loves dearly  chinn touched the hilt mechanically with three fingers muttering he knew not what  it happened to be the old answer of his childhood when bukta in jest called him the little general sahib  the majors quarters were opposite chinns and when he heard his servant gasp with surprise he looked across the room  then the major sat on the bed and whistled for the spectacle of the senior native commissioned officer of the regiment an unmixed bhil a companion of the order of british india with thirtyfive years spotless service in the army and a rank among his own people superior to that of many bengal princelings valeting the lastjoined subaltern was a little too much for his nerves  the throaty bugles blew the messcall that has a long legend behind it  first a few piercing notes like the shrieks of beaters in a faraway cover and next large full and smooth the refrain of the wild song and oh and oh the green pulse of mundore  mundore  all little children were in bed when the sahib heard that call last said bukta passing chinn a clean handkerchief the call brought back memories of his cot under the mosquitonetting his mothers kiss and the sound of footsteps growing fainter as he dropped asleep among his men  so he hooked the dark collar of his new messjacket and went to dinner like a prince who has newly inherited his fathers crown  old bukta swaggered forth curling his whiskers he knew his own value and no money and no rank within the gift of the government would have induced him to put studs in young officers shirts or to hand them clean ties  yet when he took off his uniform that night and squatted among his fellows for a quiet smoke he told them what he had done and they said that he was entirely right  thereat bukta propounded a theory which to a white mind would have seemed raving insanity but the whispering levelheaded little men of war considered it from every point of view and thought that there might be a great deal in it  at mess under the oillamps the talk turned as usual to the unfailing subject of shikar  big gameshooting of every kind and under all sorts of conditions  young chinn opened his eyes when he understood that each one of his companions had shot several tigers in the wuddar style  on foot that is  making no more of the business than if the brute had been a dog  in nine cases out of ten said the major a tiger is almost as dangerous as a porcupine  but the tenth time you come home feet first  that set all talking and long before midnight chinns brain was in a whirl with stories of tigers  maneaters and cattlekillers each pursuing his own business as methodically as clerks in an office new tigers that had lately come into suchandsuch a district and old friendly beasts of great cunning known by nicknames in the messsuch as puggy who was lazy with huge paws and mrs malaprop who turned up when you never expected her and made female noises then they spoke of bhil superstitions a wide and picturesque field till young chinn hinted that they must be pulling his leg  deed we arent said a man on his left we know all about you  youre a chinn and all that and youve a sort of vested right here but if you dont believe what were telling you what will you do when old bukta begins his stories  he knows about ghosttigers and tigers that go to a hell of their own and tigers that walk on their hind feet and your grandpapas ridingtiger as well  odd he hasnt spoken of that yet  you know youve an ancestor buried down satpura way dont you said the major as chinn smiled irresolutely  of course i do said chinn who had the chronicle of the book of chinn by heart  it lies in a worn old ledger on the chinese lacquer table behind the piano in the devonshire home and the children are allowed to look  at it on sundays  well i wasnt sure  your revered ancestor my boy according to the bhils has a tiger of his own  a saddletiger that he rides round the country whenever he feels inclined i dont call it decent in an excollectors ghost but that is what the southern bhils believe  even our men who might be called moderately cool dont care to beat that country if they hear that jan chinn is running about on his tiger  it is supposed to be a clouded animal  not stripy but blotchy like a tortoiseshell tomcat  no end of a brute it is and a sure sign of war or pestilence or  or something  theres a nice family legend for you  whats the origin of it d you suppose said chinn  ask the satpura bhils  old jan chinn was a mighty hunter before the lord perhaps it was the tigers revenge or perhaps hes huntin em still you must go to his tomb one of these days and inquire  bukta will probably attend to that he was asking me before you came whether by any illluck you  had already bagged your tiger if not he is going to enter you under his own wing  of course for you of all men its imperative  youll have a firstclass time with bukta  the major was not wrong  bukta kept an anxious eye on young chinn at drill and it was noticeable that the first time the new officer lifted up his voice in an order the whole line quivered even the colonel was taken aback for it might have been lionel chinn returned from devonshire with a new lease of life  bukta had continued to develop his peculiar theory among his intimates and it was accepted as a matter of faith in the lines since every word and gesture on young chinns part so confirmed it  the old man arranged early that his darling should wipe out the reproach of not having shot a tiger but he was not content to take the first or any beast that happened to arrive  in his own villages he dispensed the high low and middle justice and when his peoplenaked and fluttered  came to him with word  of a beast marked down he bade them send spies to the kills and the wateringplaces that he might be sure the quarry was such an one as suited the dignity of such a man  three or four times the reckless trackers returned most truthfully saying that the beast was mangy undersized  a tigress worn with nursing or a brokentoothed old male  and bukta would curb young chinns impatience  at last a noble animal was marked down  a tenfoot cattlekiller with a huge roll of loose skin along the belly glossyhided fullfrilled about the neck whiskered frisky and young he had slain a man in pure sport they said  let him be fed quoth bukta and the villagers dutifully drove out a cow to amuse him that he might lie up near by  princes and potentates have taken ship to india and spent great moneys for the mere glimpse of beasts onehalf as fine as this of buktas  it is not good said he to the colonel when he asked for shootingleave that my colonels son who may be  that my colonels son should lose his maidenhead on any small jungle beast that may come after  i have waited long for this which is a tiger  he has come in from the mair country in seven days we will return with the skin  the mess gnashed their teeth enviously bukta had he chosen might have invited them all but he went out alone with chinn two days in a shootingcart and a day on foot till they came to a rocky glary valley with a pool of good water in it it was a parching day and the boy very naturally stripped and went in for a bathe leaving bukta by the clothes  a white skin shows far against brown jungle and what bukta beheld on chinns back and right shoulder dragged him forward step by step with staring eyeballs  id forgotten it isnt decent to strip before a man of his position said chinn flouncing in the water how the little devil stares what is it bukta the mark was the whispered answer  it is nothing you know how it is with my people chinn was annoyed the dullred birthmark on his shoulder something like a conventionalised tartar cloud had slipped his memory or he would not have bathed it occurred so they said at home in alternate generations appearing curiously enough eight or nine years after birth and save that it was part of the chinn inheritance would not be considered pretty he hurried ashore dressed again and went on till they met two or three bhils who promptly fell on their faces my people grunted bukta not condescending to notice them and so your people sahib when i was a young man we were fewer but not so weak now we are many but poor stock as may be remembered how will you shoot him sahib from a tree from a shelter which my people shall build by day or by night  on foot and in the daytime said young chinn  that was your custom as i have heard said bukta to himself i will get news of him then you and i will go to him i will carry one gun you have yours there is no need of more what tiger shall stand against thee  he was marked down by a little waterhole at the head of a ravine fullgorged and half asleep in the may sunlight he was walked up like a partridge and he turned to do battle for his life bukta made no motion to raise his rifle but kept his eyes on chinn who met the shattering roar of the charge with a single shot  it seemed to him hours as he sighted  which tore through the throat smashing the backbone below the neck and between the shoulders the brute couched choked and fell and before chinn knew well what had happened bukta bade him stay still while he paced the distance between his feet and the ringing jaws  fifteen said bukta short paces no need for a second shot sahib he bleeds cleanly where he lies and we need not spoil the skin i said there would be no need of these but they came  in case  suddenly the sides of the ravine were crowned with the heads of buktas people  a force that could have blown the ribs out of the beast had chinns shot failed but their guns were hidden and they appeared as interested beaters some five or six waiting the word to skin bukta watched the life fade from the wild eyes lifted one hand and turned on his heel  no need to show that we care said he now after this we can kill what we choose put out your hand sahib  chinn obeyed it was entirely steady and bukta nodded that also was  your custom my men skin quickly they will carry the skin to cantonments will the sahib come to my poor village for the night and perhaps forget  that i am his officer  but those men  the beaters they have worked hard and perhaps   oh if they skin clumsily we will skin them they are my people  in the lines i am one thing here i am another  this was very true when bukta doffed uniform and reverted to the fragmentary dress of his own people he left his civilisation of drill in the next world that night after a little talk with his subjects he devoted to an orgie and a bhil orgie is a thing not to be safely written about chinn flushed with triumph was in the thick of it but the meaning of the mysteries was hidden wild folk came and pressed about his knees with offerings he gave his flask to the elders of the village they grew eloquent and wreathed him about with flowers gifts and loans not all seemly were thrust upon him and infernal music rolled and maddened round red fires while singers sang songs of the ancient times and danced peculiar dances the aboriginal liquors are very potent and chinn was compelled to taste them often but unless the stuff had been drugged how came he to fall asleep suddenly and to waken late the next day  half a march from the village  the sahib was very tired a little before dawn he went to sleep  bukta explained my people carried him here and now it is time we should go back to cantonments  the voice smooth and deferential the step steady and silent made it hard to believe that only a few hours before bukta was yelling and capering with naked fellowdevils of the scrub  my people were very pleased to see the sahib they will never forget when next the sahib goes out recruiting he will go to my people and they will give him as many men as we need  chinn kept his own counsel except as to the shooting of the tiger and bukta embroidered that tale with a shameless tongue the skin was certainly one of the finest ever hung up in the mess and the first of many  when bukta could not accompany his boy on shootingtrips he took care to put him in good hands and chinn learned more of the mind and desire of the wild bhil in his marches and campings by talks at twilight or at wayside pools than an uninstructed man could have come at in a lifetime  presently his men in the regiment grew bold to speak of their relativesmostly in troubleand to lay cases of tribal custom before him they would say squatting in his verandah at twilight after the easy confidential style of the wuddars that suchandsuch a bachelor had run away with suchandsuch a wife at a faroff village now how many cows would chinn sahib consider a just fine or again if written order came from the government that a bhil was to repair to a walled city of the plains to give evidence in a lawcourt would it be wise to disregard that order on the other hand if it were obeyed would the rash voyager return alive  but what have i to do with these things chinn demanded of bukta impatiently i am a soldier i do not know the law  hoo  law is for fools and white men  give them a large and loud order and they will abide by it  thou art their law  but wherefore  every trace of expression left buktas countenance  the idea might have smitten him for the first time  how can i say he replied perhaps it is on account of the name  a bhil does not love strange things  give them orders sahib  two three four words at a time such as they can carry away in their heads  that is enough  chinn gave orders then valiantly not realising that a word spoken in haste before mess became the dread unappealable law of villages beyond the smoky hills  was in truth no less than the law of jan chinn the first who so the whispered legend ran had come back to earth to oversee the third generation in the body and bones of his grandson  there could be no sort of doubt in this matter all the bhils knew that jan chinn reincarnated had honoured buktas village with his presence after slaying his firstin this lifetiger that he had eaten and drunk with the people as he was used and  bukta must have drugged chinns liquor very deeplyupon his back and right shoulder all men had seen the same angry red flying cloud that the high gods had set on the flesh of jan chinn the first when first he came to the bhil as concerned the foolish white world which has no eyes he was a slim and young officer in the wuddars but his own people knew he was jan chinn who had made the bhil a man and believing they hastened to carry his words careful never to alter them on the way  because the savage and the child who plays lonely games have one horror of being laughed at or questioned the little folk kept their convictions to themselves and the colonel who thought he knew his regiment never guessed that each one of the six hundred quickfooted beadyeyed rankandfile to attention beside their rifles believed serenely and unshakenly that the subaltern on the left flank of the line was a demigod twice born tutelary deity of their land and people  the earthgods themselves had stamped the incarnation and who would dare to doubt the handiwork of the earthgods  chinn being practical above all things saw that his family name served him well in the lines and in camp  his men gave no troubleone does not commit regimental offences with a god in the chair of justiceand he was sure of the best beaters in the district when he needed them they believed that the protection of jan chinn the first cloaked them and were bold in that belief beyond the utmost daring of excited bhils  his quarters began to look like an amateur naturalhistory museum in spite of duplicate heads and horns and skulls that he sent home to devonshire  the people very humanly learned the weak side of their god it is true he was unbribable but birdskins butterflies beetles and above all news of big game pleased him  in other respects too he lived up to the chinn tradition he was feverproof a nights sitting out over a tethered goat in a damp valley that would have filled the major with a months malaria had no effect on him  he was as they said salted before he was born  now in the autumn of his second years service an uneasy rumour crept out of the earth and ran about among the bhils  chinn heard nothing of it till a brother officer said across the messtable  your revered ancestors on the rampage in the satpura country  youd better look him up  i dont want to be disrespectful but im a little sick of my revered ancestor  bukta talks of nothing else  whats the old boy supposed to be doing now  riding crosscountry by moonlight on his processional tiger  thats the story  hes been seen by about two thousand bhils skipping along the tops of the satpuras and scaring people to death  they believe it devoutly and all the satpura chaps are worshipping away at his shrine tomb i meanlike good uns you really ought to go down there must be a queer thing to see your grandfather treated as a god  what makes you think theres any truth in the tale said chinn  because all our men deny it they say theyve never heard of chinns tiger now thats a manifest lie because every bhil has  theres only one thing youve overlooked said the colonel thoughtfully when a local god reappears on earth its always an excuse for trouble of some kind and those satpura bhils are about as wild as your grandfather left them young un it means something  meanin they may go on the warpath said chinn  cant say  as yet shouldnt be surprised a little bit  i havent been told a syllable  proves it all the more they are keeping something back  bukta tells me everything too as a rule now why didnt he tell me that  chinn put the question directly to the old man that night and the answer surprised him  why should i tell what is well known yes the clouded tiger is out in the satpura country  what do the wild bhils think that it means  they do not know they wait sahib what is coming say only one little word and we will be content  we what have tales from the south where the jungly bhils live to do with drilled men when jan chinn wakes is no time for any bhil to be quiet  but he has not waked bukta  sahib the old mans eyes were full of tender reproof if he does not wish to be seen why does he go abroad in the moonlight we know he is awake but we do not know what he desires is it a sign for all the bhils or one that concerns the satpura folk alone say one little word sahib that i may carry it to the lines and send on to our villages why does jan chinn ride out who has done wrong is it pestilence is it murrain will our children die is it a sword remember sahib we are thy people and thy servants and in this life i bore thee in my armsnot knowing  bukta has evidently looked on the cup this evening chinn thought  but if i can do anything to soothe the old chap i must its like the mutiny rumours on a small scale  he dropped into a deep wicker chair over which was thrown his first tigerskin and his weight on the cushion flapped the clawed paws over his shoulders he laid hold of them mechanically as he spoke drawing the painted hide cloakfashion about him  now will i tell the truth bukta he said leaning forward the dried muzzle on his shoulder to invent a specious lie  i see that it is the truth was the answer in a shaking voice  jan chinn goes abroad among the satpuras riding on the clouded tiger ye say be it so therefore the sign of the wonder is for the satpura bhils only  and does not touch the bhils who plough in the north and east the bhils  of the khandesh or any others except the satpura bhils who as we know  are wild and foolish  it is then a sign for them good or bad  beyond doubt good for why should jan chinn make evil to those whom he has made men the nights over yonder are hot it is ill to lie in one bed overlong without turning and jan chinn would look again upon his people so he rises whistles his clouded tiger and goes abroad a little to breathe  the cool air if the satpura bhils kept to their villages and did not wander after dark they would not see him  indeed bukta it is no more than  that he would see the light again in his own country send this news south and say that it is my word  bukta bowed to the floor  good heavens thought chinn and this blinking pagan is a firstclass officer and as straight as a die  i may as well round it off neatly  he went on  if the satpura bhils ask the meaning of the sign tell them that jan chinn would see how they kept their old promises of good living perhaps they have plundered perhaps they mean to disobey the orders of the government perhaps there is a dead man in the jungle and so jan chinn has come to see  is he then angry  bah  am i ever angry with my bhils  i say angry words and threaten many things  thou knowest bukta  i have seen thee smile behind the hand  i know and thou knowest  the bhils are my children  i have said it many times  ay  we be thy children said bukta  and no otherwise is it with jan chinn my fathers father  he would see the land he loved and the people once again  it is a good ghost bukta  i say it go and tell them  and i do hope devoutly he added that it will calm em down flinging back the tigerskin he rose with a long unguarded yawn that showed his wellkept teeth  bukta fled to be received in the lines by a knot of panting inquirers  it is true said bukta  he wrapped himself in the skin and spoke from it  he would see his own country again the sign is not for us and indeed he is a young man how should he lie idle of nights he says his bed is too hot and the air is bad  he goes to and fro for the love of nightrunning  he has said it  the greywhiskered assembly shuddered  he says the bhils are his children  ye know he does not lie  he has said it to me  but what of the satpura bhils  what means the sign for them  nothing  it is only nightrunning as i have said  he rides to see if they obey the government as he taught them to do in his first life  and what if they do not  he did not say  the light went out in chinns quarters  look said bukta  now he goes away none the less it is a good ghost as he has said how shall we fear jan chinn who made the bhil a man his protection is on us and ye know jan chinn never broke a protection  spoken or written on paper  when he is older and has found him a wife he will lie in his bed till morning  a commanding officer is generally aware of the regimental state of mind a little before the men and this is why the colonel said a few days later that some one had been putting the fear of god into the wuddars  as he was the only person officially entitled to do this it distressed him to see such unanimous virtue  its too good to last he said  i only wish i could find out what the little chaps mean  the explanation as it seemed to him came at the change of the moon when he received orders to hold himself in readiness to allay any possible excitement among the satpura bhils who were to put it mildly uneasy because a paternal government had sent up against them a mahratta stateeducated vaccinator with lancets lymph and an officially registered calf  in the language of state they had manifested a strong objection to all prophylactic measures had forcibly detained the vaccinator and were on the point of neglecting or evading their tribal obligations  that means they are in a blue funk  same as they were at censustime said the colonel and if we stampede them into the hills well never catch em in the first place and in the second theyll whoop off plundering till further orders  wonder who the godforsaken idiot is who is trying to vaccinate a bhil  i knew trouble was coming  one good thing is that theyll only use local corps and we can knock up something well call a campaign and let them down easy fancy us potting our best beaters because they dont want to be vaccinated  theyre only crazy with fear  dont you think sir said chinn the next day that perhaps you could give me a fortnights shootingleave  desertion in the face of the enemy by jove the colonel laughed i might but id have to antedate it a little because were warned for service as you might say however well assume that you applied for leave three days ago and are now well on your way south  id like to take bukta with me  of course yes  i think that will be the best plan youve some kind of hereditary influence with the little chaps and they may listen to you when a glimpse of our uniforms would drive them wild  youve never been in that part of the world before have you take care they dont send you to your family vault in your youth and innocence i believe youll be all right if you can get em to listen to you  i think so sir but if  if they should accidentally put an  make asses of emselves  they might you know  i hope youll represent that they were only frightened there isnt an ounce of real vice in em and i should never forgive myself if any one of  of my name got them into trouble  the colonel nodded but said nothing  chinn and bukta departed at once bukta did not say that ever since the official vaccinator had been dragged into the hills by indignant bhils runner after runner had skulked up to the lines entreating with forehead in the dust that jan chinn should come and explain this unknown horror that hung over his people  the portent of the clouded tiger was now too clear  let jan chinn comfort his own for vain was the help of mortal man  bukta toned down these beseechings to a simple request for chinns presence  nothing would have pleased the old man better than a roughandtumble campaign against the satpuras whom he as an unmixed bhil despised but he had a duty to all his nation as jan chinns interpreter and he devoutly believed that forty plagues would fall on his village if he tampered with that obligation  besides jan chinn knew all things and he rode the clouded tiger  they covered thirty miles a day on foot and pony raising the blue walllike line of the satpuras as swiftly as might be  bukta was very silent  they began the steep climb a little after noon but it was near sunset ere they reached the stone platform clinging to the side of a rifted junglecovered hill where jan chinn the first was laid as he had desired that he might overlook his people  all india is full of neglected graves that date from the beginning of the eighteenth century  tombs of forgotten colonels of corps long since disbanded mates of east india men who went on shooting expeditions and never came back factors agents writers and ensigns of the honourable the east india company by hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands  english folk forget quickly but natives have long memories and if a man has done good in his life it is remembered after his death  the weathered marble foursquare tomb of jan chinn was hung about with wild flowers and nuts packets of wax and honey bottles of native spirits and infamous cigars with buffalo horns and plumes of dried grass  at one end was a rude clay image of a white man in the oldfashioned tophat riding on a bloated tiger  bukta salamed reverently as they approached chinn bared his head and began to pick out the blurred inscription  so far as he could read it ran thus  word for word and letter for letter  to the memory of john chinn esq late collector ofithout bloodshed orerror of authority employonlycans of

of this dead man of his own blood and of the house in devonshire then nodding to the plains yes its a big work all of it  even my little share  he must have been worth knowing    bukta where are my people  not here sahib  no man comes here except in full sun  they wait above  let us climb and see  but chinn remembering the first law of oriental diplomacy in an even voice answered i have come this far only because the satpura folk are foolish and dared not visit our lines  now bid them wait on me here  i am not a servant but the master of bhils  i go  i go clucked the old man  night was falling and at any moment jan chinn might whistle up his dreaded steed from the darkening scrub  now for the first time in a long life bukta disobeyed a lawful command and deserted his leader for he did not come back but pressed to the flat tabletop of the hill and called softly men stirred all about him  little trembling men with bows and arrows who had watched the two since noon  where is he whispered one  at his own place he bids you come said bukta  now  now  rather let him loose the clouded tiger upon us we do not go  nor i though i bore him in my arms when he was a child in this his life wait here till the day  but surely he will be angry  he will be very angry for he has nothing to eat but he has said to me many times that the bhils are his children by sunlight i believe this but  by moonlight i am not so sure what folly have ye satpura pigs compassed that ye should need him at all  one came to us in the name of the government with little ghostknives and a magic calf meaning to turn us into cattle by the cutting off of our arms we were greatly afraid but we did not kill the man he is here bound  a black man and we think he comes from the west he said it was an order to cut us all with knives  especially the women and the children we did not hear that it was an order so we were afraid and kept to our hills some of our men have taken ponies and bullocks from the plains and others pots and cloths and earrings  are any slain  by our men not yet but the young men are blown to and fro by many rumours like flames upon a hill  i sent runners asking for jan chinn lest worse should come to us  it was this fear that he foretold by the sign of the clouded tiger  he says it is otherwise said bukta and he repeated with amplifications all that young chinn had told him at the conference of the wicker chair  think you said the questioner at last that the government will  lay hands on us  not i bukta rejoined jan chinn will give an order and ye will obey the rest is between the government and jan chinn  i myself know something of the ghostknives and the scratching it is a charm against the smallpox but how it is done i cannot tell nor need that concern you  if he stands by us and before the anger of the government we will most strictly obey jan chinn except  except we do not go down to that place tonight  they could hear young chinn below them shouting for bukta but they cowered and sat still expecting the clouded tiger the tomb had been holy ground for nearly half a century if jan chinn chose to sleep there who had better right but they would not come within eyeshot of the place till broad day  at first chinn was exceedingly angry till it occurred to him that bukta most probably had a reason which indeed he had and his own dignity might suffer if he yelled without answer  he propped himself against the foot of the grave and alternately dozing and smoking came through the warm night proud that he was a lawful legitimate feverproof chinn  he prepared his plan of action much as his grandfather would have done and when bukta appeared in the morning with a most liberal supply of food said nothing of the overnight desertion bukta would have been relieved by an outburst of human anger but chinn finished his victual leisurely and a cheroot ere he made any sign  they are very much afraid said bukta who was not too bold himself it remains only to give orders they said they will obey if thou wilt only stand between them and the government  that i know said chinn strolling slowly to the tableland a few of the elder men stood in an irregular semicircle in an open glade but the ruck of people  women and children  were hidden in the thicket they had no desire to face the first anger of jan chinn the first  seating himself on a fragment of split rock he smoked his cheroot  to the butt hearing men breathe hard all about him then he cried so suddenly that they jumped  bring the man that was bound  a scuffle and a cry were followed by the appearance of a hindoo vaccinator quaking with fear bound hand and foot as the bhils of old were accustomed to bind their human sacrifices he was pushed cautiously before the presence but young chinn did not look at him  i said  the man that was bound is it a jest to bring me one tied like a buffalo since when could the bhil bind folk at his pleasure cut  half a dozen hasty knives cut away the thongs and the man crawled to chinn who pocketed his case of lancets and tubes of lymph then sweeping the semicircle with one comprehensive forefinger and in the voice of compliment he said clearly and distinctly  pigs  ai whispered bukta now he speaks woe to foolish people  i have come on foot from my house the assembly shuddered to make clear a matter which any other satpura bhil would have seen with both eyes from  a distance ye know the smallpox who pits and scars your children so that like waspcombs it is an order of the government that whoso is  scratched on the arm with these little knives which i hold up is charmed against her all sahibs are thus charmed and very many hindoos this is the mark of the charm  look  he rolled back his sleeve to the armpit and showed the white scars of the vaccinationmark on his white skin come all and look  a few daring spirits came up and nodded their heads wisely there was certainly a mark and they knew well what other dread marks were hidden by the shirt merciful was jan chinn that then and there proclaimed his godhead  now all these things the man whom ye bound told you  i did  a hundred times but they answered with blows groaned the operator chafing his wrists and ankles  but being pigs ye did not believe and so came i here to save you first from smallpox next from a great folly of fear and lastly it may befrom the rope and the jail it is no gain to me it is no pleasure to me but for the sake of that one who is yonder who made the bhil a man  he pointed down the hill  i who am of his blood the son of his son come to turn your people and i speak the truth as did jan chinn  the crowd murmured reverently and men stole out of the thicket by twos and threes to join it there was no anger in their gods face  these are my orders  heaven send theyll take em but i seem to have impressed em so far i myself will stay among you while this man scratches your arms with the knives after the order of the government in three or it may be five or seven days your arms will swell and itch and burn that is the power of smallpox fighting in your base blood against the orders of the government i will therefore stay among you till i see that smallpox is conquered and i will not go away till the men and the women and the little children show me upon their arms such marks as i have even now showed you i bring with me two very good guns and a man whose name is known among beasts and men we will hunt together i and he and your young men and the others shall eat and lie still this is my order  there was a long pause while victory hung in the balance a whitehaired old sinner standing on one uneasy leg piped up  there are ponies and some few bullocks and other things for which we need a kowl protection they were not taken in the way of trade  the battle was won and john chinn drew a breath of relief the young bhils had been raiding but if taken swiftly all could be put straight  i will write a kowl so soon as the ponies the bullocks and the other things are counted before me and sent back whence they came but first we will put the government mark on such as have not been visited by smallpox in an undertone to the vaccinator if you show you are afraid youll never see poona again my friend  there is not sufficient ample supply of vaccination for all this population said the man they destroyed the offeecial calf  they wont know the difference scrape em and give me a couple of lancets ill attend to the elders  the aged diplomat who had demanded protection was the first victim he fell to chinns hand and dared not cry out as soon as he was freed he dragged up a companion and held him fast and the crisis became as it were a childs sport for the vaccinated chased the unvaccinated to treatment vowing that all the tribe must suffer equally  the women shrieked and the children ran howling but chinn laughed and waved the pinktipped lancet  it is an honour he cried  tell them bukta how great an honour it is that i myself mark them  nay i cannot mark every one  the hindoo must also do his work  but i will touch all marks that he makes so there will be an equal virtue in them thus do the rajputs stick pigs ho brother with one eye catch that girl and bring her to me she need not run away yet for she is not married and i do not seek her in marriage she will not come  then she shall be shamed by her little brother a fat boy a bold boy he puts out his arm like a soldier look he does not flinch at the blood some day he shall be in my regiment and now mother of many we will lightly touch thee for smallpox has been before us here it is a true thing indeed that this charm breaks the power of mata there will be no more pitted faces among the satpuras and so ye can ask many cows for each maid to be wed  and so on and so on  quickpoured showmans patter sauced in the bhil huntingproverbs and tales of their own brand of coarse humour till the lancets were blunted and both operators worn out  but nature being the same the world over the unvaccinated grew jealous of their marked comrades and came near to blows about it then chinn declared himself a court of justice no longer a medical board and made formal inquiry into the late robberies  we are the thieves of mahadeo said the bhils simply it is our fate and we were frightened when we are frightened we always steal  simply and directly as children they gave in the tale of the plunder all but two bullocks and some spirits that had gone amissing these chinn promised to make good out of his own pocket and ten ringleaders were despatched to the lowlands with a wonderful document written on the leaf of a notebook and addressed to an assistant district superintendent of police  there was warm calamity in that note as jan chinn warned them but anything was better  than loss of liberty  armed with this protection the repentant raiders went downhill they had no desire whatever to meet mr dundas fawne of the police aged twentytwo and of a cheerful countenance nor did they wish to revisit the scene of their robberies steering a middle course they ran into the camp of the one government chaplain allowed to the various irregular corps through a district of some fifteen thousand square miles and stood before him in a cloud of dust he was by way of being a priest they knew and what was more to the point a good sportsman who paid his beaters generously  when he read chinns note he laughed which they deemed a lucky omen till he called up policemen who tethered the ponies and the bullocks by the piled housegear and laid stern hands upon three of that smiling band of the thieves of mahadeo  the chaplain himself addressed them magisterially with a ridingwhip that was painful but jan chinn had prophesied it  they submitted but would not give up the written protection fearing the jail  on their way back they met mr d fawne who had heard about the robberies and was not pleased  certainly said the eldest of the gang when the second interview was at an end certainly jan chinns protection has saved us our liberty but it is as though there were many beatings in one small piece of paper  put it away  one climbed into a tree and stuck the letter into a cleft forty feet from the ground where it could do no harm  warmed sore but happy the ten returned to jan chinn next day where he sat among uneasy bhils all looking at their right arms and all bound under terror of their gods disfavour not to scratch  it was a good kowl said the leader first the chaplain who laughed took away our plunder and beat three of us as was promised next we meet fawne sahib who frowned and asked for the plunder we spoke the truth and so he beat us all one after another and called us chosen names he then gave us these two bundles they set down a bottle of whisky and a box of cheroots and we came away  the kowl is left in a tree because its virtue is that so soon as we show it to a sahib we are beaten  but for that kowl said jan chinn sternly ye would all have been marching to jail with a policeman on either side  ye come now to serve as beaters for me  these people are unhappy and we will go hunting till they are well tonight we will make a feast  it is written in the chronicles of the satpura bhils together with many other matters not fit for print that through five days after the day that he had put his mark upon them jan chinn the first hunted for his people and on the five nights of those days the tribe was gloriously and entirely drunk jan chinn bought country spirits of an awful strength and slew wild pig and deer beyond counting so that if any fell sick they might have two good reasons  between head and stomachaches they found no time to think of their arms but followed jan chinn obediently through the jungles and with each days returning confidence men women and children stole away to their villages as the little army passed by  they carried news that it was good and right to be scratched with ghostknives that jan chinn was indeed reincarnated as a god of free food and drink and that of all nations the satpura bhils stood first in his favour if they would only refrain from scratching  henceforward that kindly demigod would be connected in their minds with great gorgings and the vaccine and lancets of a paternal government  and tomorrow i go back to my home said jan chinn to his faithful few whom neither spirits overeating nor swollen glands could conquer it is hard for children and savages to behave reverently at all times to the idols of their makebelief and they had frolicked excessively with jan chinn but the reference to his home cast a gloom on the people  and the sahib will not come again said he who had been vaccinated first  that is to be seen answered chinn warily  nay but come as a white man  come as a young man whom we know and love for as thou alone knowest we are a weak people if we again saw thy  thy horse  they were picking up their courage  i have no horse i came on foot with bukta yonder  what is thisthou knowest  the thing that thou hast chosen for a nighthorse  the little men squirmed in fear and awe  nighthorses  bukta what is this last tale of children  bukta had been a silent leader in chinns presence since the night of his desertion and was grateful for a chanceflung question  they know sahib he whispered  it is the clouded tiger that that comes from the place where thou didst once sleep it is thy horse  as it has been these three generations  my horse that was a dream of the bhils  it is no dream do dreams leave the tracks of broad pugs on earth why make two faces before thy people they know of the nightridings and they  and they    are afraid and would have them cease  bukta nodded if thou hast no further need of him he is thy horse  the thing leaves a trail then said chinn  we have seen it it is like a village road under the tomb  can ye find and follow it for me  by daylight  if one comes with us and above all stands near by  i will stand close and we will see to it that jan chinn does not ride any more  the bhils shouted the last words again and again  from chinns point of view the stalk was nothing more than an ordinary one  downhill through split and crannied rocks unsafe perhaps if a man did not keep his wits by him but no worse than twenty others he had undertaken yet his men  they refused absolutely to beat and would only trail  dripped sweat at every move they showed the marks of enormous pugs that ran always downhill to a few hundred feet below jan chinns tomb and disappeared in a narrowmouthed cave it was an insolently open road a domestic highway beaten without thought of concealment  the beggar might be paying rent and taxes chinn muttered ere he asked whether his friends taste ran to cattle or man  cattle was the answer two heifers a week we drive them for him at the foot of the hill it is his custom if we did not he might seek us  blackmail and piracy said chinn  i cant say i fancy going into the cave after him whats to be done  the bhils fell back as chinn lodged himself behind a rock with his rifle ready tigers he knew were shy beasts but one who had been long cattlefed in this sumptuous style might prove overbold  he speaks some one whispered from the rear he knows too  well of all the infernal cheek said chinn there was an angry growl from the cave  a direct challenge  come out then chinn shouted come out of that lets have a look at youthe brute knew well enough that there was some connection between brown nude bhils and his weekly allowance but the white helmet in the sunlight annoyed him and he did not approve of the voice that broke his rest lazily as a gorged snake he dragged himself out of the cave and stood yawning and blinking at the entrance the sunlight fell upon his flat right side and  chinn wondered never had he seen a tiger marked after this fashion except for his head which was staringly barred he was dappled  not striped but dappled like a childs rockinghorse in rich shades of smoky black on red gold that portion of his belly and throat which should have been white was orange and his tail and paws were black  he looked leisurely for some ten seconds and then deliberately lowered his head his chin dropped and drawn in staring intently at the man the effect of this was to throw forward the round arch of his skull with two broad bands across it while below the bands glared the unwinking eyes so that head on as he stood he showed something like a diabolically scowling pantomimemask it was a piece of natural mesmerism that he had practised many times on his quarry and though chinn was by no means a terrified heifer he stood for a while held by the extraordinary oddity of the attack the head  the body seemed to have been packed away behind it  the ferocious skulllike head crept nearer to the switching of an angry tailtip in the grass left and right the bhils had scattered to let john chinn subdue his own horsemy word he thought hes trying to frighten me and fired between the saucerlike eyes leaping aside upon the shot  a big coughing mass reeking of carrion bounded past him up the hill and he followed discreetly the tiger made no attempt to turn into the jungle he was hunting for sight and breath  nose up mouth open the tremendous forelegs scattering the gravel in spurts  scuppered said john chinn watching the flight  now if he was a partridge hed tower lungs must be full of blood  the brute had jerked himself over a boulder and fallen out of sight the other side john chinn looked over with a ready barrel but the red trail led straight as an arrow even to his grandfathers tomb and there among the smashed spiritbottles and the fragments of the mud image the life left with  a flurry and a grunt  if my worthy ancestor could see that said john chinn hed have been proud of me eyes lower jaw and lungs a very nice shot he whistled for bukta as he drew the tape over the stiffening bulk  ten  six  eight  by jove  its nearly eleven  call it eleven  forearm twentyfour five  seven and a half a short tail too three feet one but what a skin oh bukta bukta the men with the knives swiftly  is he beyond question dead said an awestricken voice behind a rock  that was not the way i killed my first tiger said chinn i did not think that bukta would run i had no second gun  it  it is the clouded tiger said bukta unheeding the taunt he is dead  whether all the bhils vaccinated and unvaccinated of the satpuras had lain by to see the kill chinn could not say but the whole hills flank rustled with little men shouting singing and stamping and yet till he had made the first cut in the splendid skin not a man would take a knife and when the shadows fell they ran from the redstained tomb and no persuasion would bring them back till dawn so chinn spent a second night in the open guarding the carcass from jackals and thinking about his ancestor  he returned to the lowlands to the triumphal chant of an escorting army three hundred strong the mahratta vaccinator close at his elbow and the rudely dried skin a trophy before him when that army suddenly and noiselessly disappeared as quail in high corn he argued he was near civilisation and a turn in the road brought him upon the camp of a wing of his own corps he left the skin on a carttail for the world to see and sought the colonel  theyre perfectly right he explained earnestly there isnt an ounce of vice in em they were only frightened ive vaccinated the whole boiling and they like it awfully what are  what are we doing here sir  thats what im trying to find out said the colonel i dont know yet whether were a piece of a brigade or a police force however i think well call ourselves a police force how did you manage to get a bhil vaccinated  well sir said chinn  ive been thinking it over and as far as i can make out ive got a sort of hereditary influence over em  so i know or i wouldnt have sent you but what exactly  its rather rummy  it seems from what i can make out that im my own grandfather reincarnated and ive been disturbing the peace of the country by riding a padtiger of nights if i hadnt done that i dont think theyd have objected to the vaccination but the two together were more than they could stand and so sir ive vaccinated em and shot my tigerhorse as a sort o proof of good faith you never saw such a skin in your life  the colonel tugged his moustache thoughtfully now how the deuce said he am i to include that in my report  indeed the official version of the bhils antivaccination stampede said nothing about lieutenant john chinn his godship but bukta knew and the corps knew and every bhil in the satpura hills knew  and now bukta is zealous that john chinn shall swiftly be wedded and impart his powers to a son for if the chinn succession fails and the little bhils are left to their own imaginings there will be fresh trouble in the satpuras  end of the tomb of his ancestors    the devil and the deep sea  all supplies very bad and dear and there are no facilities for even the smallest repairs  sailing directions  her nationality was british but you will not find her houseflag in the list of our mercantile marine she was a ninehundredton iron schoonerrigged screw cargoboat differing externally in no way from any other tramp of the sea but it is with steamers as it is with men there are those who will for a consideration sail extremely close to the wind and in the present state of a fallen world such people and such steamers have their use from the hour that the aglaia first entered the clyde  new shiny and innocent with a quart of cheap champagne trickling down her cutwater  fate and her owner who was also her captain decreed that she should deal with embarrassed crowned heads fleeing presidents financiers of overextended ability women to whom change of air was imperative and the lesser lawbreaking powers her career led her sometimes into the admiralty courts where the sworn statements of her skipper filled his brethren with envy  the mariner cannot tell or act a lie in the face of the sea or mislead a tempest but as lawyers have discovered he makes up for chances withheld when he returns to shore an affidavit in either hand  the aglaia figured with distinction in the great mackinaw salvagecase it was her first slip from virtue and she learned how to change her name but not her heart and to run across the sea as the guiding light  she was very badly wanted in a south american port for the little matter of entering harbour at full speed colliding with a coalhulk and the states only manofwar just as that manofwar was going to coal  she put to sea without explanations though three forts fired at her for half an hour as the julia mgregor she had been concerned in picking up from a raft certain gentlemen who should have stayed in noumea but who preferred making themselves vastly unpleasant to authority in quite another quarter of the world and as the shahinshah she had been overtaken on the high seas indecently full of munitions of war by the cruiser of an agitated power at issue with its neighbour that time she was very nearly sunk and her riddled hull gave eminent lawyers of two countries great profit  after a season she reappeared as the martin hunt painted a dull slatecolour with pure saffron funnel and boats of robinsegg blue engaging in the odessa trade till she was invited and the invitation could not well be disregarded to keep away from black sea ports altogether  she had ridden through many waves of depression freights might drop out of sight seamens unions throw spanners and nuts at certificated masters or stevedores combine till cargo perished on the dockhead but the boat of many names came and went busy alert and inconspicuous always her skipper made no complaint of hard times and port officers observed that her crew signed and signed again with the regularity of atlantic liner boatswains her name she changed as occasion called her wellpaid crew never and a large percentage of the profits of her voyages was spent with an open hand on her engineroom  she never troubled the underwriters and very seldom stopped to talk with a signalstation for her business was urgent and private  but an end came to her tradings and she perished in this manner deep peace brooded over europe asia africa america australasia and polynesia  the powers dealt together more or less honestly banks paid their depositors to the hour diamonds of price came safely to the hands of their owners republics rested content with their dictators diplomats found no one whose presence in the least incommoded them monarchs lived openly with their lawfully wedded wives  it was as though the whole earth had put on its best sunday bib and tucker and business was very bad for the martin hunt the great virtuous calm engulfed her slate sides yellow funnel and all but cast up in another hemisphere the steam whaler haliotis black and rusty with a manurecoloured funnel a litter of dingy white boats and an enormous stove or furnace for boiling blubber on her forward welldeck  there could be no doubt that her trip was successful for she lay at several ports not too well known and the smoke of her tryingout insulted the beaches  anon she departed at the speed of the average london fourwheeler and entered a semiinland sea warm still and blue which is perhaps the most strictly preserved water in the world there she stayed for a certain time and the great stars of those mild skies beheld her playing pussinthecorner among islands where whales are never found  all that while she smelt abominably and the smell though fishy was not whalesome  one evening calamity descended upon her from the island of pygangwatai and she fled while her crew jeered at a fat blackandbrown gunboat puffing far behind they knew to the last revolution the capacity of every boat on those seas that they were anxious to avoid  a british ship with a good conscience does not as a rule flee from the  manofwar of a foreign power and it is also  considered a breach of etiquette to stop and search british ships at sea  these things the skipper of the haliotis did not pause to prove but held on at an inspiriting eleven knots an hour till nightfall one thing only he overlooked  the power that kept an expensive steampatrol moving up and down those waters they had dodged the two regular ships of the station with an ease that bred contempt had newly brought up a third and a fourteenknot boat with a clean bottom to help the work and that was why the haliotis driving hard from the east to the west found herself at daylight in such a position that she could not help seeing an arrangement of four flags a mile and a half behind which read  heave to or take the consequences  she had her choice and she took it  the end came when presuming on her lighter draught she tried to draw away northward over a friendly shoal the shell that arrived by way of the chief engineers cabin was some five inches in diameter with a practice not a bursting charge it had been intended to cross her bows and that was why it knocked the framed portrait of the chief engineers wife  and she was a very pretty girl  on to the floor splintered his washhand stand crossed the alleyway into the engineroom and striking on a grating dropped directly in front of the forward engine where it burst neatly fracturing both the bolts that held the connectingrod to the forward crank  what follows is worth consideration  the forward engine had no more work to do  its released pistonrod therefore drove up fiercely with nothing to check it and started most of the nuts of the cylindercover  it came down again the full weight of the steam behind it and the foot of the disconnected connectingrod useless as the leg of a man with a sprained ankle flung out to the right and struck the starboard or righthand castiron supportingcolumn of the forward engine cracking it clean through about six inches above the base and wedging the upper portion outwards three inches towards the ships side  there the connectingrod jammed  meantime the afterengine being as yet unembarrassed went on with its work and in so doing brought round at its next revolution the crank of the forward engine which smote the already jammed connectingrod bending it and therewith the pistonrod crosshead the big crosspiece that slides up and down so smoothly  the crosshead jammed sideways in the guides and in addition to putting further pressure on the already broken starboard supportingcolumn cracked the port or lefthand supportingcolumn in two or three places  there being nothing more that could be made to move the engines brought up all standing with a hiccup that seemed to lift the haliotis a foot out of the water and the engineroom staff opening every steam outlet that they could find in the confusion arrived on deck somewhat scalded but calm there was a sound below of things happening  a rushing clicking purring grunting rattling noise that did not last for more than a minute it was the machinery adjusting itself on the spur of the moment to a hundred altered conditions mr wardrop one foot on the upper grating inclined his ear sideways and groaned  you cannot stop engines working at twelve knots an hour in three seconds without disorganising them  the haliotis slid forward in a cloud of steam shrieking like a wounded horse there was nothing more to do the fiveinch shell with a reduced charge had settled the situation and when you are full all three holds of strictly preserved pearls when you have cleaned out the tanna bank the seahorse bank and four other banks from one end to the other of the amanala sea when you have ripped out the very heart of a rich government monopoly so that five years will not repair your wrongdoings  you must smile and take what is in store  but the skipper reflected as a launch put out from the manofwar that he had been bombarded on the high seas with the british flag  several of them  picturesquely disposed above him and tried to find comfort from the thought  where said the stolid naval lieutenant hoisting himself aboard where are those dam pearls  they were there beyond evasion  no affidavit could do away with the fearful smell of decayed oysters the divingdresses and the shelllittered hatches  they were there to the value of seventy thousand pounds more or less and every pound poached  the manofwar was annoyed for she had used up many tons of coal she had strained her tubes and worse than all her officers and crew had been hurried  every one on the haliotis was arrested and rearrested several times as each officer came aboard then they were told by what they esteemed to be the equivalent of a midshipman that they were to consider themselves prisoners and finally were put under arrest  its not the least good said the skipper suavely  youd much better send us a tow    be still  you are arrest was the reply  where the devil do you expect we are going to escape to  were helpless  youve got to tow us into somewhere and explain why you fired on us  mr wardrop were helpless arent we  ruined from end to end said the man of machinery  if she rolls the forward cylinder will come down and go through her bottom both columns are clean cut through  theres nothing to hold anything up  the council of war clanked off to see if mr wardrops words were true  he warned them that it was as much as a mans life was worth to enter the engineroom and they contented themselves with a distant inspection through the thinning steam  the haliotis lifted to the long easy swell and the starboard  supportingcolumn ground a trifle as a man grits his teeth under the knife  the forward cylinder was depending on that unknown force men call the pertinacity of materials which now and then balances that other heartbreaking power the perversity of inanimate things  you see said mr wardrop hurrying them away  the engines arent worth their price as old iron  we tow was the answer  afterwards we shall confiscate  the manofwar was shorthanded and did not see the necessity for putting a prizecrew aboard the haliotis  so she sent one sublieutenant whom the skipper kept very drunk for he did not wish to make the tow too easy and moreover he had an inconspicuous little rope hanging from the stem of his ship  then they began to tow at an average speed of four knots an hour the haliotis was very hard to move and the gunnerylieutenant who had fired the fiveinch shell had leisure to think upon consequences mr wardrop was the busy man he borrowed all the crew to shore up the cylinders with spars and blocks from the bottom and sides of the ship it was a days risky work but anything was better than drowning at the end of a towrope and if the forward cylinder had fallenit would have made its way to the seabed and taken the haliotis after  where are we going to and how long will they tow us he asked of the skipper  god knows and this prizelieutenants drunk what do you think you can do  theres just the bare chance mr wardrop whispered though no one was within hearing theres just the bare chance o repairin her if a man knew how theyve twisted the very guts out of her bringing her up with that jerk but im saying that with time and patience theres just the chance o making steam yet we could do it  the skippers eye brightened do you mean he began that she is any good  oh no said mr wardrop shell need three thousand pounds in repairs at the lowest if shes to take the sea again an that apart from any injury to her structure  shes like a man fallen down five pair o stairs we cant tell for months what has happened but we know shell never be good again without a new inside ye should see the condensertubes an the steam connections to the donkey for two things only im not afraid of them repairin her im afraid of them stealin things  theyve fired on us theyll have to explain that  our reputations not good enough to ask for explanations lets take what we have and be thankful ye would not have consuls remembern the guidin light an the shahinshah an the aglaia at this most alarmin crisis weve been no better than pirates these ten years under providence were no worse than thieves now weve much to be thankful for  if we eer get back to her  make it your own way then said the skipper if theres the least chance    ill leave none said mr wardrop  none that theyll dare to take keep her heavy on the tow for we need time  the skipper never interfered with the affairs of the engineroom and mr wardrop  an artist in his profession  turned to and composed a work terrible and forbidding his background was the darkgrained sides of the engineroom his material the metals of power and strength helped out with spars baulks and ropes  the manofwar towed sullenly and viciously the haliotis behind her hummed like a hive before swarming with extra and totally unneeded spars her crew blocked up the space round the forward engine till it resembled a statue in its scaffolding and the butts of the shores interfered with every view that a dispassionate eye might wish to take and that the dispassionate mind might be swiftly shaken out of its calm the wellsunk bolts of the shores were wrapped round untidily with loose ends of ropes giving a studied effect of most dangerous insecurity next mr wardrop took up a collection from the afterengine which as you will remember had not been affected in the general wreck the cylinder escapevalve he abolished with a flogginghammer it is difficult in faroff ports to come by such valves unless like mr wardrop you keep duplicates in store at the same time men took off the nuts of two of the great holdingdown bolts that serve to keep the engines in place on their solid bed an engine violently arrested in midcareer may easily jerk off the nut of a holdingdown bolt and this accident looked very natural  passing along the tunnel he removed several shaft couplingbolts and nuts scattering other and ancient pieces of iron underfoot cylinderbolts he cut off to the number of six from the afterengine cylinder so that it might match its neighbour and stuffed the bilge  and feedpumps with cottonwaste  then he made up a neat bundle of the various odds and ends that he had gathered from the engines  little things like nuts and valvespindles all carefully tallowed  and retired with them under the floor of the engineroom where he sighed being fat as he passed from manhole to manhole of the double bottom and in a fairly dry submarine compartment hid them any engineer particularly in an unfriendly port has a right to keep his spare stores where he chooses and the foot of one of the cylinder shores blocked all entrance into the regular storeroom even if that had not been already closed with steel wedges in conclusion he disconnected the afterengine laid piston and connectingrod carefully tallowed where it would be most inconvenient to the casual visitor took out three of the eight collars of the thrustblock hid them where only he could find them again filled the boilers by hand wedged the sliding doors of the coalbunkers and rested from his labours the engineroom was a cemetery and it did not need the contents of the ashlift through the skylight to make it any worse  he invited the skipper to look at the completed work  saw ye ever such a forsaken wreck as that  said he proudly  it almost frights me to go under those shores now what d you think theyll do to us  wait till we see said the skipper  itll be bad enough when it comes  he was not wrong the pleasant days of towing ended all too soon though the haliotis trailed behind her a heavily weighted jib stayed out into the shape of a pocket and mr wardrop was no longer an artist of imagination but one of sevenandtwenty prisoners in a prison full of insects the manofwar had towed them to the nearest port not to the headquarters of the colony and when mr wardrop saw the dismal little harbour with its ragged line of chinese junks its one crazy tug and the boatbuilding shed that under the charge of a philosophical malay represented a dockyard he sighed and shook his head  i did well he said this is the habitation o wreckers an thieves were at the uttermost ends of the earth think you theyll ever know in england  doesnt look like it said the skipper  they were marched ashore with what they stood up in under a generous escort and were judged according to the customs of the country which though excellent are a little out of date there were the pearls there were the poachers and there sat a small but hot governor he consulted for a while and then things began to move with speed for he did not wish to keep a hungry crew at large on the beach and the manofwar had gone up the coast  with a wave of his hand  a stroke of the pen was not necessary  he consigned them to the black gangtana the backcountry and the hand of the law removed them from his sight and the knowledge of men  they were marched into the palms and the backcountry swallowed them up  all the crew of the haliotis  deep peace continued to brood over europe asia africa america  australasia and polynesia  it was the firing that did it they should have kept their counsel but when a few thousand foreigners are bursting with joy over the fact that a ship under the british flag has been fired at on the high seas news travels quickly and when it came out that the pearlstealing crew had not been allowed access to their consul there was no consul within a few hundred miles of that lonely port even the friendliest of powers has a right to ask questions  the great heart of the british public was beating furiously on account of the performance of a notorious racehorse and had not a throb to waste on distant accidents but somewhere deep in the hull of the ship of state there is machinery which more or less accurately takes charge of foreign affairs that machinery began to revolve and who so shocked and surprised as the power that had captured the haliotis it explained that colonial governors and faraway menofwar were difficult to control and promised that it would most certainly make an example both of the governor and the vessel  as for the crew reported to be pressed into military service in tropical climes it would produce them as soon as possible and it would apologise if necessary  now no apologies were needed  when one nation apologises to another millions of amateurs who have no earthly concern with the difficulty hurl themselves into the strife and embarrass the trained specialist it was requested that the crew be found if they were still alive  they had been eight months beyond knowledge  and it was promised that all would be forgotten  the little governor of the little port was pleased with himself  sevenandtwenty white men made a very compact force to throw away on a war that had neither beginning nor end  a jungle and stockade fight that flickered and smouldered through the wet hot years in the hills a hundred miles away and was the heritage of every wearied official  he had he thought deserved well of his country and if only some one would buy the unhappy haliotis moored in the harbour below his verandah his cup would be full  he looked at the neatly silvered lamps that he had taken from her cabins and thought of much that might be turned to account  but his countrymen in that moist climate had no spirit  they would peep into the silent engineroom and shake their heads  even the menofwar would not tow her further up the coast where the governor believed that she could be repaired  she was a bad bargain but her cabin carpets were undeniably beautiful and his wife approved of her mirrors  three hours later cables were bursting round him like shells for though he knew it not he was being offered as a sacrifice by the nether to the upper millstone and his superiors had no regard for his feelings  he had said the cables grossly exceeded his power and failed to report on events he would therefore  at this he cast himself back in his hammock  produce the crew of the haliotis  he would send for them and if that failed he would put his dignity on a pony and fetch them himself he had no conceivable right to make pearlpoachers serve in any war he would be held responsible  next morning the cables wished to know whether he had found the crew of the haliotis they were to be found freed and fed  he was to feed them  till such time as they could be sent to the nearest english port in a manofwar if you abuse a man long enough in great words flashed over the seabeds things happen the governor sent inland swiftly for his prisoners who were also soldiers and never was a militia regiment more anxious to reduce its strength no power short of death could make these mad men wear the uniform of their service  they would not fight except with their fellows and it was for that reason the regiment had not gone to war but stayed in a stockade reasoning with the new troops  the autumn campaign had been a fiasco but here were the englishmen  all the regiment marched back to guard them and the hairy enemy armed with blowpipes rejoiced in the forest five of the crew had died but there lined up on the governors verandah twoandtwenty men marked about the legs with the scars of leechbites  a few of them wore fringes that had once been trousers the others used loincloths of gay patterns and they existed beautifully but simply in the governors verandah and when he came out they sang at him  when you have lost seventy thousand pounds worth of pearls your pay your ship and all your clothes and have lived in bondage for five months beyond the faintest pretences of civilisation you know what true independence means for you become the happiest of created things  natural man  the governor told the crew that they were evil and they asked for food when he saw how they ate and when he remembered that none of the pearl patrolboats were expected for two months he sighed but the crew of the haliotis lay down in the verandah and said that they were pensioners of the governors bounty  a greybearded man fat and baldheaded his one garment a greenandyellow loincloth saw the haliotis in the harbour and bellowed for joy the men crowded to the verandahrail kicking aside the long cane chairs they pointed  gesticulated and argued freely without shame the militia regiment sat down in the governors garden the governor retired to his hammock  it was as easy to be killed lying as standingand his women squeaked from the shuttered rooms  she sold said the greybearded man pointing to the haliotis he was mr wardrop  no good said the governor shaking his head no one come buy  hes taken my lamps though said the skipper he wore one leg of a pair of trousers and his eye wandered along the verandah the governor quailed there were cuddy campstools and the skippers writingtable in plain sight  theyve cleaned her out o course said mr wardrop they would well go aboard and take an inventory see he waved his hands over the harbour  we  live  there  now sorry  the governor smiled a smile of relief  hes glad of that said one of the crew reflectively  i shouldnt wonder  they flocked down to the harbourfront the militia regiment clattering behind and embarked themselves in what they found  it happened to be the governors boat  then they disappeared over the bulwarks of the haliotis and the governor prayed that they might find occupation inside  mr wardrops first bound took him to the engineroom and when the others were patting the wellremembered decks they heard him giving god thanks that things were as he had left them  the wrecked engines stood over his head untouched no inexpert hand had meddled with his shores the steel wedges of the storeroom were rusted home and best of all the hundred and sixty tons of good australian coal in the bunkers had not diminished  i dont understand it said mr wardrop any malay knows the use o copper  they ought to have cut away the pipes  and with chinese junks coming here too  its a special interposition o providence  you think so said the skipper from above theres only been one thief here and hes cleaned her out of all my things anyhow  here the skipper spoke less than the truth for under the planking of his cabin only to be reached by a chisel lay a little money which never drew any interest  his sheetanchor to windward  it was all in clean sovereigns that pass current the world over and might have amounted to more than a hundred pounds  hes left me alone  lets thank god repeated mr wardrop  hes taken everything else look  the haliotis except as to her engineroom had been systematically and scientifically gutted from one end to the other and there was strong evidence that an unclean guard had camped in the skippers cabin to regulate that plunder  she lacked glass plate crockery cutlery mattresses cuddy carpets and chairs all boats and her copper ventilators  these things had been removed with her sails and as much of the wire rigging as would not imperil the safety of the masts  he must have sold those said the skipper the other things are in  his house i suppose  every fitting that could be pried or screwed out was gone  port starboard and masthead lights teak gratings sliding sashes of the deckhouse the captains chest of drawers with charts and charttable photographs brackets and lookingglasses cabin doors rubber cuddy mats hatchirons half the funnelstays cork fenders carpenters grindstone and toolchest holystones swabs squeegees all cabin and pantry lamps galleyfittings en bloc flags and  flaglocker clocks chronometers the forward compass and the ships bell and belfry were among the missing  there were great scarred marks on the deckplanking over which the cargoderricks had been hauled one must have fallen by the way for the bulwarkrails were smashed and bent and the sideplates bruised  its the governor said the skipper  hes been selling her on the instalment plan  lets go up with spanners and shovels and kill em all shouted the crew lets drown him and keep the woman  then well be shot by that blackandtan regiment  our regiment whats the trouble ashore  theyve camped our regiment on the beach  were cut off thats all go and see what they want said mr wardrop youve the trousers  in his simple way the governor was a strategist he did not desire that the crew of the haliotis should come ashore again either singly or in detachments and he proposed to turn their steamer into a convicthulk they would wait  he explained this from the quay to the skipper in the barge  and they would continue to wait till the manofwar came along exactly where they were if one of them set foot ashore the entire regiment would open fire and he would not scruple to use the two cannon of the town meantime food would be sent  daily in a boat under an armed escort the skipper bare to the waist and rowing could only grind his teeth and the governor improved the occasion and revenged himself for the bitter words in the cables by saying what he thought of the morals and manners of the crew the barge returned to the haliotis in silence and the skipper climbed aboard white on the cheekbones and blue about the nostrils  i knew it said mr wardrop and they wont give us good food either we shall have bananas morning noon and night an a man cant work on  fruit  we know that  then the skipper cursed mr wardrop for importing frivolous sideissues into the conversation and the crew cursed one another and the haliotis the voyage and all that they knew or could bring to mind they sat down in silence on the empty decks and their eyes burned in their heads the green harbour water chuckled at them overside they looked at the palmfringed hills inland at the white houses above the harbour road at the single tier of native craft by the quay at the stolid soldiery sitting round the two cannon and last of all at the blue bar of the horizon mr wardrop was buried in thought and scratched imaginary lines with his untrimmed fingernails on the planking  i make no promise he said at last for i cant say what may or may not have happened to them but heres the ship and heres us  there was a little scornful laughter at this and mr wardrop knitted his brows he recalled that in the days when be wore trousers he had been chief engineer  of the haliotis  harland mackesy noble hay naughton fink ohara trumbull  here sir the instinct of obedience waked to answer the rollcall of the engineroom  below  they rose and went  captain ill trouble you for the rest of the men as i want them well get my stores out and clear away the shores we dont need and then well patch her up my men will remember that theyre in the haliotis  under me  he went into the engineroom and the others stared they were used to the accidents of the sea but this was beyond their experience none who had seen the engineroom believed that anything short of new engines from end to end could stir the haliotis from her moorings  the engineroom stores were unearthed and mr wardrops face red with the filth of the bilges and the exertion of travelling on his stomach lit with joy the spare gear of the haliotis had been unusually complete and twoandtwenty men armed with screwjacks differential blocks tackle vices and a forge or so can look kismet between the eyes without winking  the crew were ordered to replace the holdingdown and shaftbearing bolts and return the collars of the thrustblock when they had finished mr wardrop delivered a lecture on repairing compound engines without the aid of the shops and the men sat about on the cold machinery  the crosshead jammed in the guides leered at them drunkenly but offered no help they ran their fingers hopelessly into the cracks of the starboard supportingcolumn and picked at the ends of the ropes round the shores while mr wardrops voice rose and fell echoing till the quick tropic night closed down over the engineroom skylight  next morning the work of reconstruction began it has been explained that the foot of the connectingrod was forced against the foot of the starboard supportingcolumn which it had cracked through and driven outward towards the ships skin  to all appearance the job was more than hopeless for rod and column seemed to have been welded into one  but herein providence smiled on them for one moment to hearten them through the weary weeks ahead  the second engineer more reckless than resourceful  struck at random with a cold chisel into the castiron of the column and a greasy grey flake of metal flew from under the imprisoned foot of the connectingrod while the rod itself fell away slowly and brought up with a thunderous clang somewhere in the dark of the crankpit the guidesplates above were still jammed fast in the guides but the first blow had been struck they spent the rest of the day grooming the donkeyengine which stood immediately forward of the engineroom hatch  its tarpaulin of course had been stolen and eight warm months had not improved the working parts further the last dying hiccup of the haliotis seemed  or it might have been the malay from the boathouse  to have lifted the thing bodily on its bolts and set it down inaccurately as regarded its steam connections  if we only had one single cargoderrick mr wardrop sighed we can take the cylindercover off by hand if we sweat but to get the rod out o the pistons not possible unless we use steam well therell be steam the morn if theres nothing else shell fizzle  next morning men from the shore saw the haliotis through a cloud for it was as though the deck smoked  her crew were chasing steam through the shaken and leaky pipes to its work in the forward donkeyengine and where oakum failed to plug a crack they stripped off their loincloths for lapping and swore  halfboiled and mothernaked  the donkeyengine worked  at a price  the price of constant attention and furious stoking worked long enough to allow a wirerope it was made up of a funnel and a foremaststay to be led into the engineroom and made fast on the cylindercover of the forward engine that rose easily enough and was hauled through the skylight and on to the deck many hands assisting the doubtful steam then came the tug of war for it was necessary to get to the piston and the jammed pistonrod they removed two of the piston junkring studs screwed in two strong iron eyebolts by way of handles doubled the wirerope and set half a dozen men to smite with an extemporised batteringram at the end of the pistonrod where it peered through the piston while the donkeyengine hauled upwards on the piston itself  after four hours of this furious work the pistonrod suddenly slipped and the piston rose with a jerk knocking one or two men over into the engineroom  but when mr wardrop declared that the piston had not split they cheered and thought nothing of their wounds and the donkeyengine was hastily stopped its boiler was nothing to tamper with  and day by day their supplies reached them by boat the skipper humbled himself once more before the governor and as a concession had leave to get drinkingwater from the malay boatbuilder on the quay it was not good drinkingwater but the malay was anxious to supply anything in his power if he were paid for it  now when the jaws of the forward engine stood as it were stripped and empty they began to wedge up the shores of the cylinder itself that work alone filled the better part of three days  warm and sticky days when the hands slipped and sweat ran into the eyes  when the last wedge was hammered home there was no longer an ounce of weight on the supportingcolumns and mr wardrop rummaged the ship for boilerplate threequarters of an inch thick where he could find it there was not much available but what there was was more than beaten gold to him in one desperate forenoon the entire crew naked and lean haled back more or less into place the starboard supportingcolumn which as you remember was cracked clean through mr wardrop found them asleep where they had finished the work and gave them a days rest smiling upon them as a father while he drew chalkmarks about the cracks they woke to new and more trying labour for over each one of those cracks a plate of threequarterinch boileriron was to be worked hot the rivetholes being drilled by hand all that time they were fed on fruits chiefly bananas with some sago  those were the days when men swooned over the ratchetdrill and the handforge and where they fell they had leave to lie unless their bodies were in the way of their fellows feet  and so patch upon patch and a patch over all the starboard supportingcolumn was clouted but when they thought all was secure mr wardrop decreed that the noble patchwork would never support working engines at the best it could only hold the guidebars approximately true  the deadweight of the cylinders must be borne by vertical struts and therefore a gang would repair to the bows and take out with files the big bowanchor davits each of which was some three inches in diameter  they threw hot coals at wardrop and threatened to kill him those who did not weep they were ready to weep on the least provocation but he hit them with iron bars heated at the end and they limped forward and the davits came with them when they returned they slept sixteen hours on the strength of it and in three days two struts were in place bolted from the foot of the starboard supportingcolumn to the under side of the cylinder  there remained now the port or condensercolumn which though not so badly cracked as its fellow had also been strengthened in four places with boilerplate patches but needed struts  they took away the main stanchions of the bridge for that work and crazy with toil did not see till all was in place that the rounded bars of iron must be flattened from top to bottom to allow the airpump levers to clear them it was wardrops oversight and he wept bitterly before the men as he gave the order to unbolt the struts and flatten them with hammer and the flame now the broken engine was underpinned firmly and they took away the wooden shores from under the cylinders and gave them to the robbed bridge thanking god for even half a days work on gentle kindly wood instead of the iron that had entered into their souls eight months in the backcountry among the leeches at a temperature of 84 degrees moist is very bad for the nerves  they had kept the hardest work to the last as boys save latin prose and worn though they were mr wardrop did not dare to give them rest the pistonrod and connectingrod were to be straightened and this was a job for a regular dockyard with every appliance they fell to it cheered by a little chalk showing of work done and time consumed which mr wardrop wrote up on the engineroom bulkhead  fifteen days had gone fifteen days of killing labour  and there was hope before them  it is curious that no man knows how the rods were straightened the crew of the haliotis remember that week very dimly as a fever patient remembers the delirium of a long night there were fires everywhere they say the whole ship was one consuming furnace and the hammers were never still now there could not have been more than one fire at the most for mr wardrop distinctly recalls that no straightening was done except under his own eye they remember too that for many years voices gave orders which they obeyed with their bodies but their minds were abroad on all the seas  it seems to them that they stood through days and nights slowly sliding a bar backwards and forwards through a white glow that was part of the ship they remember an intolerable noise in their burning heads from the walls of the stokehole and they remember being savagely beaten by men whose eyes seemed asleep when their shift was over they would draw straight lines in the air anxiously and repeatedly and would question one another in their sleep crying is she straight  at last  they do not remember whether this was by day or by night  mr wardrop began to dance clumsily and wept the while and they too danced and wept and went to sleep twitching all over and when they woke men said that the rods were straightened and no one did any work for two days but lay on the decks and ate fruit mr wardrop would go below from time to time and pat the two rods where they lay and they heard him singing hymns  then his trouble of mind went from him and at the end of the third days idleness he made a drawing in chalk upon the deck with letters of the alphabet at the angles he pointed out that though the pistonrod was  more or less straight the pistonrod crosshead  the thing that had been jammed sideways in the guides  had been badly strained and had cracked the lower end of the pistonrod he was going to forge and shrink a wroughtiron collar on the neck of the pistonrod where it joined the crosshead and from the collar he would bolt a yshaped piece of iron whose lower arms should be bolted into the crosshead if anything more were needed they could use up the last of the boilerplate  so the forges were lit again and men burned their bodies but hardly felt the pain the finished connection was not beautiful but it seemed strong enough  at least as strong as the rest of the machinery and with that job their labours came to an end all that remained was to connect up the engines and to get food and water the skipper and four men dealt with the malay boatbuilder by night chiefly it was no time to haggle over the price of sago and dried fish the others stayed aboard and replaced piston pistonrod cylindercover crosshead and bolts with the aid of the faithful donkeyengine the cylindercover was hardly steamproof and the eye of science might have seen in the connectingrod a flexure something like that of a christmastree candle which has melted and been straightened by hand over a stove but as mr wardrop said she didnt hit anything  as soon as the last bolt was in place men tumbled over one another in their anxiety to get to the hand startinggear the wheel and worm by which some engines can be moved when there is no steam aboard they nearly wrenched off the wheel but it was evident to the blindest eye that the engines stirred they did not revolve in their orbits with any enthusiasm as good machines should indeed they groaned not a little but they moved over and came to rest in a way which proved that they still recognised mans hand then mr wardrop sent his slaves into the darker bowels of the engineroom and the stokehole and followed them with a flarelamp the boilers were sound but would take no harm from a little scaling and cleaning mr wardrop would not have any one overzealous for he feared what the next stroke of the tool might show the less we know about her now said he the better for us all im thinkin yell understand me when i say that this is in no sense regular engineerin  as his raiment when he spoke was his grey beard and uncut hair they believed him they did not ask too much of what they met but polished and tallowed and scraped it to a false brilliancy  a lick of paint would make me easier in my mind said mr wardrop plaintively i know half the condensertubes are started and the propellershaftin s god knows how far out of the true and well need a new airpump an the mainsteam leaks like a sieve and theres worse each way i look but  paints like clothes to a man an ours is near all gone  the skipper unearthed some stale ropy paint of the loathsome green that they used for the galleys of sailingships and mr wardrop spread it abroad lavishly to give the engines selfrespect  his own was returning day by day for he wore his loincloth continuously but the crew having worked under orders did not feel as he did the completed work satisfied mr wardrop  he would at the last have made shift to run to singapore and gone home without vengeance taken to show his engines to his brethren in the craft but the others and the captain forbade him they had not yet recovered their selfrespect  it would be safer to make what ye might call a trial trip but beggars mustnt be choosers an if the engines will go over to the handgear the probability  im only saying its a probability the chance is that theyll hold up when we put steam on her  how long will you take to get steam said the skipper  god knows  four hours  a day  half a week if i can raise sixty pound ill not complain  be sure of her first we cant afford to go out half a mile and break down  my soul and body man were one continuous breakdown fore an aft we might fetch singapore though  well break down at pygangwatai where we can do good was the answer in a voice that did not allow argument shes my boat and  ive had eight  months to think in  no man saw the haliotis depart though many heard her she left at two in the morning having cut her moorings and it was none of her crews pleasure that the engines should strike up a thundering halfseasover chanty that echoed among the hills  mr wardrop wiped away a tear as he listened to the new song  shes gibberin   shes just gibberin he whimpered yons the  voice of a maniac  and if engines have any soul as their masters believe he was quite right there were outcries and clamours sobs and bursts of chattering laughter silences where the trained ear yearned for the clear note and torturing reduplications where there should have been one deep voice down the screwshaft ran murmurs and warnings while a heartdiseased flutter without told that the propeller needed rekeying  how does she make it said the skipper  she moves but  but shes breakin my heart the sooner were at pygangwatai the better shes mad and were waking the town  is she at all near safe  what do i care how safe she is  shes mad hear that now  to be sure nothings hittin anything and the bearins are fairly cool but  can ye not hear  if she goes said the skipper i dont care a curse and shes my boat too  she went trailing a fathom of weed behind her from a slow two knots an hour she crawled up to a triumphant four anything beyond that made the struts quiver dangerously and filled the engineroom with steam morning showed her out of sight of land and there was a visible ripple under her bows but she complained bitterly in her bowels and as though the noise had called it there shot along across the purple sea a swift dark proa hawklike and curious which presently ranged alongside and wished to know if the haliotis were helpless ships even the steamers of the white men had been known to break down in those waters and the honest malay and javanese traders would sometimes aid them in their own peculiar way but this ship was not full of lady passengers and welldressed officers men white naked and savage swarmed down her sides  some withredhot iron bars and others with large hammers  threw themselves upon those innocent inquiring strangers and before any man could say what had happened were in full possession of the proa while the lawful owners bobbed in the water overside  half an hour later the proas cargo of sago and trepang as well as a doubtfulminded compass was in the haliotis the two huge triangular mat sails with their seventyfoot yards and booms had followed the cargo and were being fitted to the stripped masts of the steamer  they rose they swelled they filled and the empty steamer visibly laid over as the wind took them they gave her nearly three knots an hour and what better could men ask  but if she had been forlorn before this new purchase made her horrible to see imagine a respectable charwoman in the tights of a balletdancer rolling drunk along the streets and you will come to some faint notion of the appearance of that ninehundredton welldecked once schoonerrigged cargoboat as she staggered under her new help shouting and raving across the deep  with steam and sail that marvellous voyage continued and the brighteyed crew looked over the rail desolate unkempt unshorn shamelessly clothed  beyond the decencies  at the end of the third week she sighted the island of pygangwatai whose harbour is the turningpoint of a pearl seapatrol here the gunboats stay for a week ere they retrace their line there is no village at pygangwatai only a stream of water some palms and a harbour safe to rest in till the first violence of the southeast monsoon has blown itself out they opened up the low coral beach with its mound of whitewashed coal ready for supply the deserted huts for the sailors and the flagless flagstaff  next day there was no haliotis  only a little proa rocking in the warm rain at the mouth of the harbour whose crew watched with hungry eyes the smoke of a gunboat on the horizon  months afterwards there were a few lines in an english newspaper to the effect that some gunboat of some foreign power had broken her back at the mouth of some faraway harbour by running at full speed into a sunken wreck  end of the devil and the deep sea    william the

his feet on the chairrests it was a hot dark breathless evening heavy with the smell of the newly watered mall the flowers in the club gardens were dead and black on their stalks the little lotuspond was a circle of caked mud and the tamarisktrees were white with the dust of weeks most of the men were at the bandstand in the public gardens  from the club verandah you could hear the native police band hammering stale waltzes  or on the pologround or in the highwalled fivescourt hotter than a dutch oven half a dozen grooms squatted at the heads of their ponies waited their masters return from time to time a man would ride at a footpace into the club compound and listlessly loaf over to the whitewashed barracks beside the main building these were supposed to be chambers men lived in them meeting the same white faces night after night at dinner and drawing out their officework till the latest possible hour that they might escape that doleful company  what are you going to do said martyn with a yawn lets have a swim before dinner  waters hot i was at the bath today  play you game o billiards  fifty up  its a hundred and five in the hall now sit still and dont be so abominably energetic  a grunting camel swung up to the porch his badged and belted rider fumbling a leather pouch  kubberkargazkiyektraaa the man whined handing down the newspaper extra  a slip printed on one side only and damp from the press it was pinned up on the greenbaize board between notices of ponies for sale and foxterriers missing  martyn rose lazily read it and whistled its declared he cried one two three  eight districts go under the operations of the famine code ek dum theyve put jimmy hawkins in charge  good business said scott with the first sign of interest he had shown when in doubt hire a punjabi i worked under jimmy when i first came out and he belonged to the punjab he has more bundobust than most men  jimmys a jubilee knight now said martynhes a good chap even though he is a thriceborn civilian and went to the benighted presidency what unholy names these madras districts rejoice in  all ungas or rungas or pillays or polliums  a dogcart drove up in the dusk and a man entered mopping his head he was editor of the one daily paper at the capital of a province of twentyfive million natives and a few hundred white men as his staff was limited to himself and one assistant his officehours ran variously from ten to twenty a day  hi raines youre supposed to know everything said martyn stopping him  hows this madras scarcity going to turn out  no one knows as yet  theres a message as long as your arm coming in on the telephone ive left my cub to fill it out  madras has owned she cant manage it alone and jimmy seems to have a free hand in getting all the men he needs arbuthnots warned to hold himself in readiness  badger arbuthnot  the peshawur chap  yes and the pi wires that ellis and clay have been moved from the northwest already and theyve taken half a dozen bombay men too  its pukka famine by the looks of it  theyre nearer the scene of action than we are but if it comes to indenting on the punjab this early theres more in this than meets the eye said martyn  here today and gone tomorrow  didnt come to stay for ever said scott dropping one of marryats novels and rising to his feet  martyn your sisters waiting for you  a rough grey horse was backing and shifting at the edge of the verandah where the light of a kerosene lamp fell on a browncalico habit and a white face under a greyfelt hat  right o said martyn  im ready  better come and dine with us if youve nothing to do scott  william is there any dinner in the house  ill go home and see was the riders answer you can drive him over  at eight remember  scott moved leisurely to his room and changed into the eveningdress of the season and the country spotless white linen from head to foot with a broad silk cummerbund  dinner at the martyns was a decided improvement on the goatmutton twineytough fowl and tinned entrees of the club but it was a great pity that martyn could not afford to send his sister to the hills for the hot weather as an acting district superintendent of police martyn drew the magnificent pay of six hundred depreciated silver rupees a month and his little fourroomed bungalow said just as much there were the usual blueandwhitestriped jailmade rugs on the uneven floor the usual glassstudded amritsar phulkaris draped on nails driven into the flaking whitewash of the walls the usual halfdozen chairs that did not match picked up at sales of dead mens effects and the usual streaks of black grease where the leather punkathong ran through the wall  it was as though everything had been unpacked the night before to be repacked next morning  not a door in the house was true on its hinges  the little windows fifteen feet up were darkened with waspnests and lizards hunted flies between the beams of the woodceiled roof  but all this was part of scotts life  thus did people live who had such an income and in a land where each mans pay age and position are printed in a book that all may read it is hardly worth while to play at pretence in word or deed  scott counted eight years service in the irrigation department and drew eight hundred rupees a month on the understanding that if he served the state faithfully for another twentytwo years he could retire on a pension of some four hundred rupees a month his workinglife which had been spent chiefly under canvas or in temporary shelters where a man could sleep eat and write letters was bound up with the opening and guarding of irrigation canals the handling of two or three thousand workmen of all castes and creeds and the payment of vast sums of coined silver  he had finished that spring not without credit the last section of the great mosuhl canal and  much against his will for he hated officework  had been sent in to serve during the hot weather on the accounts and supply side of the department with sole charge of the sweltering suboffice at the capital of the province martyn knew this william his sister knew it and everybody knew it  scott knew too as well as the rest of the world that miss martyn had come out to india four years ago to keep house for her brother who as every one knew had borrowed the money to pay for  her passage and that she ought as all the world said to have married at once  in stead of this she had refused some half a dozen subalterns a civilian twenty years her senior one major and a man in the indian medical department  this too was common property  she had stayed down three hot weathers as the saying is because her brother was in debt and could not afford the expense of her keep at even a cheap hillstation  therefore her face was white as bone and in the centre of her forehead was a big silvery scar about the size of a shilling  the mark of a delhi sore which is the same as a bagdad date  this comes from drinking bad water and slowly eats into the flesh till it is ripe enough to be burned out  none the less william had enjoyed herself hugely in her four years  twice she had been nearly drowned while fording a river once she had been run away with on a camel had witnessed a midnight attack of thieves on her brothers camp had seen justice administered with long sticks in the open under trees could speak urdu and even rough punjabi with a fluency that was envied by her seniors had entirely fallen out of the habit of writing to her aunts in england or cutting the pages of the english magazines had been through a very bad cholera year seeing sights unfit to be told and had wound up her experiences by six weeks of typhoid fever during which her head had been shaved  and hoped to keep her twentythird birthday that september  it is conceivable that the aunts would not have approved of a girl who never set foot on the ground if a horse were within hail who rode to dances with a shawl thrown over her skirt who wore her hair cropped and curling all over her head who answered indifferently to the name of william or bill whose speech was heavy with the flowers of the vernacular who could act in amateur theatricals play on the banjo rule eight servants and two horses their accounts and their diseases and look men slowly and deliberately between the eyes  even after they had proposed to her and been rejected  i like men who do things she had confided to a man in the educational department who was teaching the sons of clothmerchants and dyers the beauty of wordsworths excursion in annotated crambooks and when he grew poetical william explained that she didnt understand poetry very much it made her head ache and another broken heart took refuge at the club but it was all williams fault  she delighted in hearing men talk of their own work and that is the most fatal way of bringing a man to your feet  scott had known her for some three years meeting her as a rule under canvass when his camp and her brothers joined for a day on the edge of the indian desert he had danced with her several times at the big christmas gatherings when as many as five hundred white people came in to the station and had always a great respect for her housekeeping and her dinners  she looked more like a boy than ever when the meal ended she sat rolling cigarettes her low forehead puckered beneath the dark curls as she twiddled the papers and stuck out her rounded chin when the tobacco stayed in place or with a gesture as true as a schoolboys throwing a stone tossed the finished article across the room to martyn who caught it with one hand and continued his talk with scott it was all shop  canals and the policing of canals the sins of villagers who stole more water than they had paid for and the grosser sin of native constables who connived at the thefts of the transplanting bodily of villages to newly irrigated ground and of the coming fight with the desert in the south when the provincial funds should warrant the opening of the longsurveyed luni protective canal system and scott spoke openly of his great desire to be put on one particular section of the work where he knew the land and the people and martyn sighed for a billet in the himalayan foothills and said his mind of his superiors and william rolled cigarettes and said nothing but smiled gravely on her brother because he was happy  at ten scotts horse came to the door and the evening was ended  the lights of the two low bungalows in which the daily paper was printed showed bright across the road it was too early to try to find sleep and scott drifted over to the editor raines stripped to the waist like a sailor at a gun lay half asleep in a long chair waiting for night telegrams he had a theory that if a man did not stay by his work all day and most of the night he laid himself open to fever so he ate and slept among his files  can you do it be said drowsily i didnt mean to bring you over  about what  ive been dining at the martyns  the madras famine of course  martyns warned too theyre taking men where they can find em i sent a note to you at the club just now asking if you could do us a letter once a week from the south  between two and three columns say nothing sensational of course but just plain facts about who is doing what and so forth our regular rates  ten rupees a column  sorry but its out of my line scott answered staring absently at the map of india on the wall its rough on martyn  very wonder what helldo with his sister wonder what the deuce theyll do with me ive no famine experience this is the first ive heard of it am i ordered  oh yes heres the wire theyll put you on to reliefworks raines said with a horde of madrassis dying like flies one native apothecary and half a pint of choleramixture among the ten thousand of you it comes of your being idle for the moment every man who isnt doing two mens work seems to have been called upon hawkins evidently believes in punjabis  its going to be quite as bad as anything they have had in the last ten years  its all in the days work worse luck i suppose i shall get my orders officially some time tomorrow im awfully glad i happened to drop in better go and pack my kit now who relieves me here  do you know  raines turned over a sheaf of telegrams mceuan said he from murree  scott chuckled he thought he was going to be cool all summer hell be very sick about this well no good talking night  two hours later scott with a clear conscience laid himself down to rest on a string cot in a bare room two worn bullock trunks a leather waterbottle a tin icebox and his pet saddle sewed up in sacking were piled at the door and the club secretarys receipt for last months bill was under his pillow his orders came next morning and with them an unofficial telegram from sir james hawkins who was not in the habit of forgetting good men when he had once met them bidding him report himself with all speed at some unpronounceable place fifteen hundred miles to the south for the famine was sore in the land and white men were needed  a pink and fattish youth arrived in the redhot noonday whimpering a little at fate and famines which never allowed any one three months peace he was scotts successor  another cog in the machinery moved forward behind his fellow whose services as the official announcement ran were placed at the disposal of the madras government for famine duty until further orders scott handed over the funds in his charge showed him the coolest corner in the office warned him against excess of zeal and as twilight fell departed from the club in a hired carriage with his faithful bodyservant faiz ullah and a mound of disordered baggage atop to catch the southern mail at the loopholed and bastioned railwaystation the heat from the thick brick walls struck him across the face as if it had been a hot towel and he reflected that there were at least five nights and four days of this travel before him faiz ullah used to the chances of service plunged into the crowd on the stone platform while scott a black cheroot between his teeth waited till his compartment should be set away  a dozen native policemen with their rifles and bundles shouldered into the press of punjabi farmers sikh craftsmen and greasylocked afreedee pedlars escorting with all pomp martyns uniformcase waterbottles icebox and beddingroll  they saw faiz ullahs lifted hand and steered for it  my sahib and your sahib said faiz ullah to martyns man will travel together  thou and i o brother will thus secure the servants places close by and because of our masters authority none will dare to disturb us  when faiz ullah reported all things ready scott settled down at full length coatless and bootless on the broad leathercovered bunk the heat under the ironarched roof of the station might have been anything over a hundred degrees  at the last moment martyn entered dripping  dont swear said scott lazily its too late to change your carriage and well divide the ice  what are you doing here said the policeman  im lent to the madras government same as you by jove its a bender of a night are you taking any of your men down  a dozen  i suppose i shall have to superintend relief distributions didnt know you were under orders too  i didnt till after i left you last night raines had the news first my orders came this morning mceuan relieved me at four and i got off at once shouldnt wonder if it wouldnt be a good thing this famine  if we come through it alive  jimmy ought to put you and me to work together said martyn and then after a pause  my sisters here  good business said scott heartily going to get off at umballa i suppose and go up to simla wholl she stay with there  noo thats just the trouble of it shes going down with me  scott sat bolt upright under the oillamps as the train jolted past tarntaran what you dont mean you couldnt afford   taint that id have scraped up the money somehow  you might have come to me to begin with said scott stiffly we arent altogether strangers  well you neednt be stuffy about it i might but  you dont know my sister ive been explaining and exhorting and all the rest of it all day  lost my temper since seven this morning and havent got it back yetbut she wouldnt hear of any compromise a womans entitled to travel with her husband if she wants to and william says shes on the same footing  you see weve been together all our lives more or less since my people died it isnt as if she were an ordinary sister  all the sisters ive ever heard of would have stayed where they were well off  shes as clever as a man confound  martyn went on she broke up the bungalow over my head while i was talking at her settled the whole thing in three hours  servants horses and all i didnt get my orders till nine  jimmy hawkins wont be pleased said scott a famines no place for a woman  mrs jim  i mean lady jims in camp with him at any rate she says she will look after my sister william wired down to her on her own responsibility asking if she could come and knocked the ground from under me by showing me her answer  scott laughed aloud if she can do that she can take care of herself and mrs jim wont let her run into any mischief there arent many women sisters or wives who would walk into a famine with their eyes open  it isnt as if she didnt know what these things mean she was through the jalo cholera last year  the train stopped at amritsar and scott went back to the ladies compartment immediately behind their carriage william with a cloth ridingcap on her curls nodded affably  come in and have some tea she said best thing in the world for heatapoplexy  do i look as if i were going to have heatapoplexy  never can tell said william wisely its always best to be ready  she had arranged her compartment with the knowledge of an old campaigner a feltcovered waterbottle hung in the draught of one of the shuttered windows a teaset of russian china packed in a wadded basket stood on the seat and a travelling spiritlamp was clamped against the woodwork above it  william served them generously in large cups hot tea which saves the veins of the neck from swelling inopportunely on a hot night it was characteristic of the girl that her plan of action once settled she asked for no comments on it life among men who had a great deal of work to do and very little time to do it in had taught her the wisdom of effacing as well as of fending for herself she did not by word or deed suggest that she would be useful comforting or beautiful in their travels but continued about her business serenely put the cups back without clatter when tea was ended and made cigarettes for her guests  this time last night said scott we didnt expect  er  this kind of thing did we  ive learned to expect anything said william you know in our service we live at the end of the telegraph but of course this ought to be a good thing for us all departmentally  if we live  it knocks us out of the running in our own province scott replied with equal gravity i hoped to be put on the luni protective works this cold weather but theres no saying how long the famine may keep us  hardly beyond october i should think said martyn it will be ended one way or the other then  and weve nearly a week of this said william shant we be dusty when its over  for a night and a day they knew their surroundings and for a night and a day skirting the edge of the great indian desert on a narrowgauge railway they remembered how in the days of their apprenticeship they had come by that road from bombay then the languages in which the names of the stations were written changed and they launched south into a foreign land where the very smells were new many long and heavily laden graintrains were in front of them and they could feel the hand of jimmy hawkins from far off they waited in extemporised sidings while processions of empty trucks returned to the north and were coupled on to slow crawling trains and dropped at midnight heaven knew where but it was furiously hot and they walked to and fro among sacks and dogs howled then they came to an india more strange to them than to the untravelled englishman  the flat red india of palmtree palmyrapalm and rice  the india of the picturebooks of little harry and his bearer  all dead and dry in the baking heat they had left the incessant passengertraffic of the north and west far and far behind them here the people crawled to the side of the train holding their little ones in their arms and a loaded truck would be left behind the men and women clustering round it like ants by spilled honey once in the twilight they saw on a dusty plain a regiment of little brown men each bearing a body over his shoulder and when the train stopped to leave yet another truck they perceived that the burdens were not corpses but only foodless folk picked up beside dead oxen by a corps of irregular troops now they met more white men here one and there two whose tents stood close to the line and who came armed with written authorities and angry words to cut off a truck they were too busy to do more than nod at scott and martyn and stare curiously at william who could do nothing except make tea and watch how her men staved off the rush of wailing walking skeletons putting them down three at a time in heaps with their own hands uncoupling the marked trucks or taking receipts from the holloweyed weary white men who spoke another argot than theirs they ran out of ice out of sodawater and out of tea for they were six days and seven nights on the road and it seemed to them like seven times seven years  at last in a dry hot dawn in a land of death lit by long red fires of railwaysleepers where they were burning the dead they came to their destination and were met by jim hawkins the head of the famine unshaven unwashed but cheery and entirely in command of affairs  martyn he decreed then and there was to live on trains till further orders was to go back with empty trucks filling them with starving people as he found them and dropping them at a faminecamp on the edge of the eight districts  he would pick up supplies and return and his constables would guard the loaded graincars also picking up people and would drop them at a camp a hundred miles south scott hawkins was very glad to see scott again  would that same hour take charge of a convoy of bullockcarts and would go south feeding as he went to yet another faminecamp where he would leave his starving there would he no lack of starving on the route  and wait for orders by telegraphgenerally scott was in all small things to act as he thought best  william bit her under lip there was no one in the wide world like her one brother but martyns orders gave him no discretion  she came out on the platform masked with dust from head to foot a horseshoe wrinkle on her forehead put here by much thinking during the past week but as selfpossessed as ever mrs jim  who should have been lady jim but that no one remembered the title  took possession of her with a little gasp  oh im so glad youre here she almost sobbed you oughtnt to of course but there there isnt another woman in the place and we must help each other you know and weve all the wretched people and the little babies they are selling  ive seen some said william  isnt it ghastly ive bought twenty theyre in our camp but wont you have something to eat first  weve more than ten people can do here and ive got a horse for you oh im so glad youve come dear youre a punjabi too you know  steady lizzie said hawkins over his shoulder well look after you miss martyn sorry i cant ask you to breakfast martyn youll have to eat as you go leave two of your men to help scott these poor devils cant stand up to load carts saunders this to the enginedriver who was half asleep in the cab back down and get those empties away youve line clear to anundrapillay theyll give you orders north of that scott load up your carts from that b p p truck and be off as soon as you can  the eurasian in the pink shirt is your interpreter and guide youll find an apothecary of sorts tied to the yoke of the second wagon  hes been trying to bolt youll have to look after him  lizzie drive miss martyn to camp and tell them to send the red horse down here for me  scott with faiz ullah and two policemen was already busied with the carts backing them up to the truck and unbolting the sideboards quietly while the others pitched in the bags of millet and wheat hawkins watched him for as long as it took to fill one cart  thats a good man he said  if all goes well i shall work him hard this was jim hawkinss notion of the highest compliment one human being could pay another  an hour later scott was under way the apothecary threatening him with the penalties of the law for that he a member of the subordinate medical department had been coerced and bound against his will and all laws governing the liberty of the subject the pinkshirted eurasian begging leave to see his mother who happened to be dying some three miles away only verree verree short leave of absence and will presently return sar  the two constablesarmed with staves bringing up the rear and faiz ullah a mohammedans contempt for all hindoos and foreigners in every line of his face explaining to the drivers that though scott sahib was a man to be feared on all fours he faiz ullah was authority itself  the procession creaked past hawkinss camp  three stained tents under a clump of dead trees behind them the famineshed where a crowd of hopeless ones tossed their arms around the cookingkettles  wish to heaven william had kept out of it said scott to himself after a glance well have cholera sure as a gun when the rains break  but william seemed to have taken kindly to the operations of the famine code which when famine is declared supersede the workings of the ordinary law scott saw her the centre of a mob of weeping women in a calico ridinghabit and a bluegrey felt hat with a gold puggaree  i want fifty rupees please  i forgot to ask jack before he went away can you lend it me its for condensedmilk for the babies said she  scott took the money from his belt and handed it over without a word for goodness sake take care of yourself he said  oh i shall be all right we ought to get the milk in two days by the way the orders are i was to tell you that youre to take one of sir jims horsestheres a grey cabuli here that i thought would be just your style so ive said youd take him was that right  thats awfully good of you we cant either of us talk much about style i am afraid  scott was in a weatherstained drill shootingkit very white at the seams and a little frayed at the wrists william regarded him thoughtfully from his pith helmet to his greased ankleboots you look very nice i think are you sure youve everything youll need  quinine chlorodyne and so on  think so said scott patting three or four of his shootingpockets as he mounted and rode alongside his convoy  goodbye he cried  goodbye and good luck said william im awfully obliged for the money she turned on a spurred heel and disappeared into the tent while the carts pushed on past the faminesheds past the roaring lines of the thick fat fires down to the baked gehenna of the south  end of william the conqueror  part i    william the conquerer  part ii  so let us melt and make no noise no tearfloods nor sightempests move twere profanation of our joys to tell the laity our love  a valediction  it was punishing work even though he travelled by night and camped by day but within the limits of his vision there was no man whom scott could call master he was as free as jimmy hawkins  freer in fact for the government held the head of the famine tied neatly to a telegraphwire and if jimmy had ever regarded telegrams seriously the deathrate of that famine would have been much higher than it was  at the end of a few days crawling scott learned something of the size of the india which he served and it astonished him his carts as you know were loaded with wheat millet and barley good foodgrains needing only a little grinding but the people to whom he brought the lifegiving stuffs were riceeaters they could hull rice in their mortars but they knew nothing of the heavy stone querns of the north and less of the material that the white man convoyed so laboriously they clamoured for rice  unhusked paddy such as they were accustomed to  and when they found that there was none broke away weeping from the sides of the cart what was the use of these strange hard grains that choked their throats they would die and then and there very many of them kept their word others took their allowance and bartered enough millet to feed a man through a week for a few handfuls of rotten rice saved by some less unfortunate a few put their share into the ricemortars pounded it and made a paste with foul water but they were very few scott understood dimly that many people in the india of the south ate rice as a rule but he had spent his service in a grain province had seldom seen rice in the blade or ear and least of all would have believed that in time of deadly need men could die at arms length of plenty sooner than touch food they did not know in vain the interpreters interpreted in vain his two policemen showed in vigorous pantomime what should be done the starving crept away to their bark and weeds grubs  leaves and clay and left the open sacks untouched but sometimes the women laid their phantoms of children at scotts feet looking back as they staggered away  faiz ullah opined it was the will of god that these foreigners should die and it remained only to give orders to burn the dead none the less there was no reason why the sahib should lack his comforts and faiz ullah a campaigner of experience had picked up a few lean goats and had added them to the procession that they might give milk for the morning meal he was feeding them on the good grain that these imbeciles rejected yes said faiz ullah if the sahib thought fit a little milk might be given to some of the babies but as the sahib well knew babies were cheap and for his own part faiz ullah held that there was no government order as to babies scott spoke forcefully to faiz ullah and the two policemen and bade them capture goats where they could find them this they most joyfully did for it was a recreation and many ownerless goats were driven in once fed the poor brutes were willing enough to follow the carts and a few days good food  food such as human beings died for lack of  set them in milk again  but i am no goatherd said faiz ullah it is against my izzat my honour  when we cross the bias river again we will talk of izzat scott replied till that day thou and the policemen shall be sweepers to the camp if i give the order  thus then it is done grunted faiz ullah if the sahib will have it so and he showed how a goat should be milked while scott stood over him  now we will feed them said scott twice a day we will feed them and he bowed his back to the milking and took a horrible cramp  when you have to keep connection unbroken between a restless mother of kids and a baby who is at the point of death you suffer in all your system but the babies were fed each morning and evening scott would solemnly lift them out one by one from their nest of gunnybags under the carttilts there were always many who could do no more than breathe and the milk was dropped into their toothless mouths drop by drop with due pauses when they choked each morning too the goats were fed and since they would straggle without a leader and since the natives were hirelings scott was forced to give up riding and pace slowly at the head of his flocks accommodating his step to their weaknesses all this was sufficiently absurd and he felt the absurdity keenly but at least he was saving life and when the women saw that their children did not die they made shift to eat a little of the strange foods and crawled after the carts blessing the master of the goats  give the women something to live for said scott to himself as he sneezed in the dust of a hundred little feet and theyll hang on somehow this beats williams condensedmilk trick all to pieces i shall never live it down though  he reached his destination very slowly found that a riceship had come in from burmah and that stores of paddy were available found also an overworked englishman in charge of the shed and loading the carts set back to cover the ground he had already passed he left some of the children and half his goats at the famineshed for this he was not thanked by the englishman who had already more stray babies than he knew what to do with  scotts back was suppled to stooping now and he went on with his wayside ministrations in addition to distributing the paddy more babies and more goats were added unto him but now some of the babies wore rags and beads round their wrists or necks that said the interpreter as though scott did not know signifies that their mothers hope in eventual contingency to resume them offeecially  the sooner the better said scott but at the same time he marked with the pride of ownership how this or that little ramasawmy was putting on flesh like a bantam  as the paddycarts were emptied he headed for hawkinss camp by the railway timing his arrival to fit in with the dinnerhour for it was long since he had eaten at a cloth he had no desire to make any dramatic entry but an accident of the sunset ordered it that when he had taken off his helmet to get the evening breeze the low light should fall across his forehead and he could not see what was before him while one waiting at the tent door beheld with new eyes a young man beautiful as paris a god in a halo of golden dust walking slowly at the head of his flocks while at his knee ran small naked cupids but she laughed  william in a slatecoloured blouse laughed consumedly till scott putting the best face he could upon the matter halted his armies and bade her admire the kindergarten it was an unseemly sight but the proprieties had been left ages ago with the teaparty at amritsar station fifteen hundred miles to the north  they are coming on nicely said william weve only fiveandtwenty here now  the women are beginning to take them away again  are you in charge of the babies then  yes  mrs jim and i we didnt think of goats though  weve been trying condensedmilk and water  any losses  more than i care to think of said william with a shudder  and you  scott said nothing there had been many little burials along his route  one cannot burn a dead baby  many mothers who had wept when they did not find again the children they had trusted to the care of the government  then hawkins came out carrying a razor at which scott looked hungrily for he had a beard that he did not love  and when they sat down to dinner in the tent he told his tale in few words as it might have been an official report  mrs jim snuffled from time to time and jim bowed his head judicially but williams grey eyes were on the cleanshaven face and it was to her that scott seemed to appeal  good for the pauper province said william her chin on her hand as she leaned forward among the wineglasses her cheeks had fallen in and the scar on her forehead was more prominent than ever but the wellturned neck rose roundly as a column from the ruffle of the blouse which was the accepted eveningdress in camp  it was awfully absurd at times said scott you see i didnt know much about milking or babies theyll chaff my head off if the tale goes up north  let em said william haughtily weve all done cooliework since we came i know jack has this was to hawkinss address and the big man smiled blandly  your brothers a highly efficient officer william said he and ive done him the honour of treating him as he deserves remember i write the confidential reports  then you must say that williams worth her weight in gold said mrs jim i dont know what we should have done without her she has been everything to us she dropped her hand upon williams which was rough with much handling of reins and william patted it softly jim beamed on the company things were going well with his world  three of his more grossly incompetent men had died and their places had been filled by their betters every day brought the rains nearer they had put out the famine in five of the eight districts and after all the deathrate had not been too heavy  things considered he looked scott over carefully as an ogre looks over a man and rejoiced in his thews and ironhard condition  hes just the least bit in the world tucked up said jim to himself but he can do two mens work yet then he was aware that mrs jim was telegraphing to him and according to the domestic code the message ran a clear case look at them  he looked and listened all that william was saying was what can you expect of a country where they call a bhistee a watercarrier a tunnicutch and all that scott answered was  i shall be glad to get back to the club save me a dance at the christmas ball wont you  its a far cry from here to the lawrence hall said jim better turn in early scott  its paddycarts tomorrow youll begin loading at five  arent you going to give mr scott a single days rest  wish i could lizzie but im afraid i cant as long as he can stand up we must use him  well ive had one europe evening at least by jove id nearly forgotten what do i do about those babies of mine  leave them here said william  we are in charge of that  and as many goats as you can spare  i must learn how to milk now  if you care to get up early enough tomorrow ill show you i have to milk you see half of em have beads and things round their necks you must be careful not to take em off in case the mothers turn up  you forget ive had some experience here  i hope to goodness you wont overdo scotts voice was unguarded  ill take care of her said mrs jim telegraphing hundredword messages as she carried william off while jim gave scott his orders for the coming campaign it was very late  nearly nine oclock  jim youre a brute said his wife that night and the head of the famine chuckled  not a bit of it dear  i remember doing the first jandiala settlement for the sake of a girl in a crinoline and she was slender lizzie  ive never done as good a piece of work since hell work like a demon  but you might have given him one day  and let things come to a head now  no dear its their happiest time  i dont believe either of the darlings know whats the matter with them  isnt it beautiful isnt it lovely  getting up at three to learn to milk bless her heart oh ye gods why must we grow old and fat  shes a darling she has done more work under me   under you  the day after she came she was in charge and you were her subordinate  youve stayed there ever since she manages you almost as well as you manage me  she doesnt and thats why i love her  shes as direct as a man  as her brother  her brothers weaker than she is hes always to me for orders but hes honest and a glutton for work  i confess im rather fond of william and if i had a daughter   the talk ended  far away in the derajat was a childs grave more than twenty years old and neither jim nor his wife spoke of it any more  all the same youre responsible jim added a moments silence  bless em said mrs jim sleepily  before the stars paled scott who slept in an empty cart waked and went about his work in silence it seemed at that hour unkind to rouse faiz ullah and the interpreter  his head being close to the ground he did not hear william till she stood over him in the dingy old ridinghabit her eyes still heavy with sleep a cup of tea and a piece of toast in her hands  there was a baby on the ground squirming on a piece of blanket and a sixyearold child peered over scotts shoulder  hai you little rip said scott how the deuce do you expect to get your rations if you arent quiet  a cool white hand steadied the brat who forthwith choked as the milk gurgled into his mouth  mornin said the milker  youve no notion how these little fellows can wriggle  oh yes i have  she whispered because the world was asleep  only i feed them with a spoon or a rag  yours are fatter than mine and youve been doing this day after day the voice was almost lost  yes it was absurd  now you try he said giving place to the girl  look out a goats not a cow  the goat protested against the amateur and there was a scuffle in which scott snatched up the baby then it was all to do over again and william laughed softly and merrily  she managed however to feed two babies and a third  dont the little beggars take it well said scott  i trained em  they were very busy and interested when lo it was broad daylight and before they knew the camp was awake and they kneeled among the goats surprised by the day both flushed to the temples  yet all the round world rolling up out of the darkness might have heard and seen all that had passed between them  oh said william unsteadily snatching up the tea and toast i had this made for you  its stonecold now  i thought you mightnt have anything ready so early better not drink it its  its stonecold  thats awfully kind of you  its just right its awfully good of you really  ill leave my kids and goats with you and mrs jim and of course any one in camp can show you about the milking  of course said william and she grew pinker and pinker and statelier and more stately as she strode back to her tent fanning herself with the saucer  there were shrill lamentations through the camp when the elder children saw their nurse move off without them  faiz ullah unbent so far as to jest with the policemen and scott turned purple with shame because hawkins already in the saddle roared  a child escaped from the care of mrs jim and running like a rabbit clung to scotts boot william pursuing with long easy strides  i will not go  i will not go shrieked the child twining his feet round scotts ankle they will kill me here i do not know these people  i say said scott in broken tamil i say she will do you no harm go with her and be well fed  come said william panting with a wrathful glance at scott who stood helpless and as it were hamstrung  go back said scott quickly to william ill send the little chap over in a minute  the tone of authority had its effect but in a way scott did not exactly intend the boy loosened his grasp and said with gravity i did not know the woman was thine i will go then he cried to his companions a mob of three four and fiveyearolds waiting on the success of his venture ere they stampeded go back and eat it is our mans woman she will obey his orders  jim collapsed where he sat faiz ullah and the two policemen grinned and scotts orders to the cartmen flew like hail  that is the custom of the sahibs when truth is told in their presence said faiz ullah the time comes that i must seek new service young wives especially such as speak our language and have knowledge of the ways of the police make great trouble for honest butlers in the matter of weekly accounts  what william thought of it all she did not say but when her brother ten days later came to camp for orders and heard of scotts performances he said laughing well that settles it hell be bakri scott to the end of his days  bakri in the northern vernacular means a goat what a lark id have given a months pay to have seen him nursing famine babies i fed some with conjee ricewater but that was all right  its perfectly disgusting said his sister with blazing eyes a man does something like like that  and all you other men think of is to give him an absurd nickname and then you laugh and think its funny  ah said mrs jim sympathetically  well you cant talk william you christened little miss demby the buttonquail last cold weather you know you did indias the land of nicknames  thats different william replied she was only a girl and she hadnt done anything except walk like a quail and she does but it isnt fair to make fun of a man  scott wont care said martyn you cant get a rise out of old scotty ive been trying for eight years and youve only known him for three how does he look  he looks very well said william and went away with a flushed cheek bakri scott indeed then she laughed to herself for she knew her country but it will he bakri all the same and she repeated it under her breath several times slowly whispering it into favour  when he returned to his duties on the railway martyn spread the name far and wide among his associates so that scott met it as he led his paddycarts to war the natives believed it to be some english title of honour and the cartdrivers used it in all simplicity till faiz ullah who did not approve of foreign japes broke their heads there was very little time for milking now except at the big camps where jim had extended scotts idea and was feeding large flocks on the useless northern grains sufficient paddy had come now into the eight districts to hold the people safe if it were only distributed quickly and for that purpose no one was better than the big canal officer who never lost his temper never gave an unnecessary order and never questioned an order given scott pressed on saving his cattle washing their galled necks daily so that no time should be lost on the road reported himself with his rice at the minor faminesheds unloaded and went back light by forced nightmarch to the next distributing centre to find hawkinss unvarying telegram  do it again and he did it again and again and yet again while jim hawkins fifty miles away marked off on a big map the tracks of his wheels gridironing the stricken lands others did well  hawkins reported at the end they all did well  but scott was the most excellent for he kept good coined rupees by him settled for his own cartrepairs on the spot and ran to meet all sorts of unconsidered extras trusting to be recouped later on theoretically the government should have paid for every shoe and iinchpin for every hand employed in the loading but government vouchers cash themselves slowly and intelligent and efficient clerks write at great length contesting unauthorised expenditures of eight annas the man who wants to make his work a success must draw on his own bankaccount of money or other things as he goes  i told you hed work said jimmy to his wife at the end of six weeks  hes been in sole charge of a couple of thousand men up north on the mosuhl canal for a year but he gives less trouble than young martyn with his ten constables and im morally certain  only government doesnt recognise moral obligations  hes spent about half his pay to grease his wheels  look at this lizzie for one weeks work forty miles in two days with twelve carts two days halt building a famineshed for young rogers rogers ought to have built it himself the idiot then forty miles back again loading six carts on the way and distributing all sunday then in the evening he pitches in a twentypage demiofficial to me saying the people where he is might be advantageously employed on reliefwork and suggesting that he put em to work on some brokendown old reservoir hes discovered so as to have a good watersupply when the rains break thinks he can cauk the dam in a fortnight  look at his marginal sketches  arent they clear and good  i knew he was pukka but i didnt know he was as pukka as this  i must show these to william said mrs jim the childs wearing herself out among the babies  not more than you are dear well another two months ought to see us out of the wood im sorry its not in my power to recommend you for a v c  william sat late in her tent that night reading through page after page of the square handwriting patting the sketches of proposed repairs to the reservoir and wrinkling her eyebrows over the columns of figures of estimated watersupplyand he finds time to do all this she cried to herself andwell i also was present ive saved one or two babies  she dreamed for the twentieth time of the god in the golden dust and woke refreshed to feed loathsome black children scores of them wastrels picked up by the wayside their bones almost breaking their skin terrible and covered with sores  scott was not allowed to leave his cartwork but his letter was duly forwarded to the government and he had the consolation not rare in india of knowing that another man was reaping where he had sown that also was discipline profitable to the soul  hes much too good to waste on canals said jimmy any one can oversee coolies you neednt be angry william he can  but i need my pearl among bullockdrivers and ive transferred him to the khanda district where hell have it all to do over again he should be marching now  hes not a coolie said william furiously he ought to be doing his regulation work  hes the best man in his service and thats saying a good deal but if you must use razors to cut grindstones why i prefer the best cutlery  isnt it almost time we saw him again said mrs jim im sure the poor boy hasnt had a respectable meal for a month he probably sits on a cart and eats sardines with his fingers  all in good time dear duty before decency  wasnt it mr chucks said that  no it was midshipman easy william laughed i sometimes wonder how it will feel to dance or listen to a band again or sit under a roof i cant believe i ever wore a ballfrock in my life  one minute said mrs jim who was thinking if he goes to khanda he passes within five miles of us of course hell ride in  oh no he wont said william  how do you know dear  it will take him off his work he wont have time  hell make it said mrs jim with a twinkle   it depends on his own judgment theres absolutely no reason why he shouldnt if he thinks fit said jim  he wont see fit william replied without sorrow or emotion it wouldnt be him if he did  one certainly gets to know people rather well in times like these said jim drily but williams face was serene as ever and even as she prophesied scott did not appear  the rains fell at last late but heavily and the dry gashed earth was red mud and servants killed snakes in the camp where every one was weatherbound for a fortnight  all except hawkins who took horse and plashed about in the wet rejoicing now the government decreed that seedgrain should be distributed to the people as well as advances of money for the purchase of new oxen and the white men were doubly worked for this new duty while william skipped from brick to brick laid down on the trampled mud and dosed her charges with warming medicines that made them rub their little round stomachs and the milch goats throve on the rank grass there was never a word from scott in the khanda district away to the southeast except the regular telegraphic report to hawkins the rude country roads had disappeared his drivers were half mutinous one of martyns loaned policemen had died of cholera and scott was taking thirty grains of quinine a day to fight the fever that comes with the rain but those were things scott did not consider necessary to report he was as usual working from a base of supplies on a railway line to cover a circle of fifteen miles radius and since full loads were impossible he took quarterloads and toiled four times as hard by consequence for he did not choose to risk an epidemic which might have grown uncontrollable by assembling villagers in thousands at the reliefsheds it was cheaper to take government bullocks work them to death and leave them to the crows in the wayside sloughs  that was the time when eight years of clean living and hard condition told though a mans head were ringing like a bell from the cinchona and the earth swayed under his feet when he stood and under his bed when he slept if hawkins had seen fit to make him a bullockdriver that he thought was entirely hawkinss own affair  there were men in the north who would know what he had done men of thirty years service in his own department who would say that it was not half bad and above immeasurably above all men of all grades there was william in the thick of the fight who would approve because she understood he had so trained his mind that it would hold fast to the mechanical routine of the day though his own voice sounded strange in his own ears and his hands when he wrote grew large as pillows or small as peas at the end of his wrists that steadfastness bore his body to the telegraphoffice at the railwaystation and dictated a telegram to hawkins saying that the khanda district was in his judgment now safe and he waited further orders  the madrassee telegraphclerk did not approve of a large gaunt man falling over him in a dead faint not so much because of the weight as because of the names and blows that faiz ullah dealt him when he found the body rolled under a bench then faiz ullah took blankets quilts and coverlets where he found them and lay down under them at his masters side and bound his arms with a tentrope and filled him with a horrible stew of herbs and set the policeman to fight him when he wished to escape from the intolerable heat of his coverings and shut the door of the telegraphoffice to keep out the curious for two nights and one day and when a light engine came down the line and hawkins kicked in the door scott hailed him weakly but in a natural voice and faiz ullah stood back and took all the credit  for two nights heavenborn he was pagal said faiz ullah look at my nose and consider the eye of the policeman he beat us with his bound hands but we sat upon him heavenborn and though his words were tez we sweated him heavenborn never has been such a sweat he is weaker now than a child but the fever has gone out of him by the grace of god there remains only my nose and the eye of the constabeel sahib shall i ask for my dismissal because my sahib has beaten me and faiz ullah laid his long thin hand carefully on scotts chest to be sure that the fever was all gone ere he went out to open tinned soups and discourage such as laughed at his swelled nose  the districts all right scott whispered  it doesnt make any difference you got my wire  i shall be fit in a week cant understand how it happened i shall be fit in a few days  youre coming into camp with us said hawkins  but look here  but   its all over except the shouting we shant need you punjabis any more on my honour we shant martyn goes back in a few weeks arbuthnots returned already ellis and clay are putting the last touches to a new feederline the governments built as reliefwork mortens dead  he was a bengal man though you wouldnt know him pon my word you and will  miss martyn  seem to have come through it as well as anybody oh how is she bytheway the voice went up and down as he spoke  going strong when i left her the roman catholic missions are adopting the unclaimed babies to turn them into little priests the basil mission is taking some and the mothers are taking the rest you should hear the little beggars howl when theyre sent away from william shes pulled down a bit but so are we all now when do you suppose youll be able to move  i cant come into camp in this state i wont he replied pettishly  well you are rather a sight but from what i gathered there it seemed to me theyd be glad to see you under any conditions ill look over your work here if you like for a couple of days and you can pull yourself together while faiz ullah feeds you up  scott could walk dizzily by the time hawkinss inspection was ended and he flushed all over when jim said of his work that it was not half bad and volunteered further that he had considered scott his righthand man through the famine and would feel it his duty to say as much officially  so they came back by rail to the old camp but there were no crowds near it the long fires in the trenches were dead and black and the faminesheds were almost empty  you see said jim there isnt much more to do better ride up and see the wife theyve pitched a tent for you dinners at seven ive some work here  riding at a footpace faiz ullah by his stirrup scott came to william in the browncalico ridinghabit sitting at the diningtent door her hands in her lap white as ashes thin and worn with no lustre in her hair there did not seem to be any mrs jim on the horizon and all that william could say was my word how pulled down you look  ive had a touch of fever you dont look very well yourself  oh im fit enough weve stamped it out i suppose you know  scott nodded we shall all be returned in a few weeks hawkins told me  before christmas mrs jim says shant you be glad to go back  i can smell the woodsmoke already william sniffed we shall be in time for all the christmas doings  i dont suppose even the punjab government would be base enough to transfer jack till the new year  it seems hundreds of years ago  the punjab and all that  doesnt it  are you glad you came  now its all over yes it has been ghastly here though you know we had to sit still and do nothing and sir jim was away so much  do nothing how did you get on with the milking  i managed it somehow  after you taught me remember  then the talk stopped with an almost audible jar still no mrs jim  that reminds me i owe you fifty rupees for the condensedmilk i thought perhaps youd be coming here when you were transferred to the khanda district and i could pay you then but you didnt  i passed within five miles of the camp but it was in the middle of a march you see and the carts were breaking down every few minutes and i couldnt get em over the ground till ten oclock that night i wanted to come awfully you knew i did didnt you  i  believe  i  did said william facing him with level eyes she was no longer white  did you understand  why you didnt ride in of course i did  whybecause you couldnt of course i knew that  did you care  if you had come in  but i knew you wouldnt  but if you had i should have cared a great deal you know i should  thank god i didnt oh but i wanted to i couldnt trust myself to ride in front of the carts because i kept edging em over here dont you know  i knew you wouldnt said william contentedly heres your fifty  scott bent forward and kissed the hand that held the greasy notes its fellow patted him awkwardly but very tenderly on the head  and you knew too didnt you said william in a new voice  no on my honour i didnt i hadnt the  the cheek to expect anything of the kind except   i say were you out riding anywhere the day i passed by to khanda  william nodded and smiled after the manner of an angel surprised in a good deed  then it was just a speck i saw of your habit in the   palmgrove on the southern cartroad i saw your helmet when you came up from the mullah by the temple  just enough to be sure that you were all right d you care  this time scott did not kiss her hand for they were in the dusk of the diningtent and because williams knees were trembling under her she had to sit down in the nearest chair where she wept long and happily her head on her arms and when scott imagined that it would be well to comfort her she needing nothing of the kind she ran to her own tent and scott went out into the world and smiled upon it largely and idiotically but when faiz ullah brought him a drink he found it necessary to support one hand with the other or the good whisky and soda would have been spilled abroad there are fevers and fevers  but it was worse  much worse  the strained eyeshirking talk at dinner till the servants had withdrawn and worst of all when mrs jim who had been on the edge of weeping from the soup down kissed scott and william and they drank one whole bottle of champagne hot because there was no ice and scott and william sat outside the tent in the starlight till mrs jim drove them in for fear of more fever  apropos of these things and some others william said being engaged is abominable because you see one has no official position we must be thankful weve lots of things to do  things to do said jim when that was reported to him  theyre neither of them any good any more  i cant get five hours work a day out of scott hes in the clouds half the time  oh but theyre so beautiful to watch jimmy it will break my heart when they go cant you do anything for him  ive given the government the impression  at least i hope i have  that he personally conducted the entire famine but all he wants is to get on to the luni canal works and williams just as bad have you ever heard em talking of barrage and aprons and wastewater  its their style of spooning i suppose  mrs jim smiled tenderly ah thats in the intervals  bless em  and so love ran about the camp unrebuked in broad daylight while men picked up the pieces and put them neatly away of the famine in the eight districts  morning brought the penetrating chill of the northern december the layers of woodsmoke the dusty greyblue of the tamarisks the domes of ruined tombs and all the smell of the white northern plains as the mailtrain ran on to the milelong sutlej bridge  william wrapped in a poshteen  a silkembroidered sheepskin jacket trimmed with rough astrakhan  looked out with moist eyes and nostrils that dilated joyously the south of pagodas and palmtrees the overpopulated hindu south was done with  here was the land she knew and loved and before her lay the good life she understood among folk of her own caste and mind  they were picking them up at almost every station now  men and women coming in for the christmas week with racquets with bundles of polosticks with dear and bruised cricketbats with foxterriers and saddles  the greater part of them wore jackets like williams for the northern cold is as little to be trifled with as the northern heat  and william was among them and of them her hands deep in her pockets her collar turned up over her ears stamping her feet on the platforms as she walked up and down to get warm visiting from carriage to carriage and everywhere being congratulated scott was with the bachelors at the far end of the train where they chaffed him mercilessly about feeding babies and milking goats but from time to time he would stroll up to williams window and murmur good enough isnt it and william would answer with sighs of pure delight good enough indeed the large open names of the home towns were good to listen to umballa ludianah phillour jullundur they rang like the coming marriagebells in her ears and william felt deeply and truly sorry for all strangers and outsiders  visitors tourists and those freshcaught for the service of the country  it was a glorious return and when the bachelors gave the christmas ball william was unofficially you might say the chief and honoured guest among the stewards who could make things very pleasant for their friends she and scott danced nearly all the dances together and sat out the rest in the big dark gallery overlooking the superb teak floor where the uniforms blazed and the spurs clinked and the new frocks and four hundred dancers went round and round till the draped flags on the pillars flapped and bellied to the whirl of it  about midnight half a dozen men who did not care for dancing came over from the club to play waits and that was a surprise the stewards had arranged  before any one knew what had happened the band stopped and hidden voices broke into good king wenceslaus and william in the gallery hummed and beat time with her foot  mark my footsteps well my page tread thou in them boldly thou shalt feel the winters rage freeze thy blood less coldly   oh i hope they are going to give us another isnt it pretty coming out of the dark in that way  look  look down theres mrs gregory wiping her eyes  its like home rather said scott i remember   hsh listen  dear and it began again  when shepherds watched their flocks by night   ahh said william drawing closer to scott  all seated on the ground the angel of the lord came down and glory shone around  fear not said he for mighty dread had seized their troubled mind glad tidings of great joy i bring to you and all mankind  this time it was william that wiped her eyes  end of william the conqueror  part ii    the son of his father  it is a queer name mrs strickland admitted and none of our family have ever borne it but you see he is the first man to us  so he was called adam and to that world about him he was the first of men  a manchild alone heaven sent him no eve for a companion but all earth horse and foot was at his feet as soon as he was old enough to appear in public  he held a levee and stricklands sixty policemen with their sixty  clanking sabres bowed to the dust before him when his fingers closed a little on imam dins swordhilt they rose and roared  till adam roared too and was withdrawn  now that was no cry of fear said imam din afterwards speaking to his companions in the police lines  he was angry  and so young brothers he will make a very strong police officer  does the memsahib give him the breast said a new phillour recruit the dye smell not yet out of his yellow cotton uniform  ho said an upcountry naik scornfully it has not been known for more than ten days that my woman suckles him he curled his moustaches as lordly as ever an inspector could afford to do for he knew that the husband of the  fostermother of the son of the district superintendent of police was a man sure of consideration  i am glad said imam din loosening his belt those who drink our blood become of our own blood and i have seen in these thirty years that the sons of the sahibs once being born here return when they are men yes they return after they have been to belait europe  and what do they do in belait asked the recruit respectfully  get instruction  which thou hast not returned the naik also they drink of belaiteepanee sodawater enough to give them that devils restlessness which endures for all their lives whence we of hind have trouble  my fathers uncle said imam din slowly with importance was ressaldar of the longcoat horse and the empress called him to belait in the year that she had accomplished fifty years of rule he said and there were also other witnesses that the sahibs there drink common water even as do we and that the belaiteepanee does not run in all the rivers  he said also that there was a shish mahal  half a glass palace  half a koss in length and that the railgbarri ran under the roads and that there are boats bigger than a village he is a great talker the naik spoke scornfully he had no wellborn uncles  he is a man of good birth said imam din with the least possible emphasis on the first word and the naik was silent  ho ho imam din reached out to his pipe chuckling until his fat sides shook again strickland sahibs fostermother was the wife of an arain in the ferozepur district i was a young man then ploughing while the english fought this child will also be suckled here and he will have double wisdom and when he is a police officer it will be very bad for the thieves in this illakha  there will be no english in the land then they are asking permission of clerks and lowcaste men to continue their rule even now said the naik  all but foolish men  such as those clerks are  would know that this asking is but an excuse for making trouble and thus holding the country more strictly now in an investigation is it not our custom to permit the villagers to talk loosely and give us abuse for a little time then do we not grow hot and walk them to the thana two by two  as these clerks will be walked thus do i read the new talk  so do not i said the naik who borrowed the native newspapers  because thou art young and wast born in time of peace i saw the year that was to end the english rule men said it was ended indeed and that all could now take their neighbours cattle this i saw ploughing and i was minded to fight too being a young man my father sent me to gurgaon to buy cattle and i saw the tents of van corlin sahib1 in the wheat and i saw that he was going up and down collecting the revenue neither abating nor increasing it though delhi was all afire and the sahibs lay dead about the fields i have seen what i have seen this raj will not be talked down and he who builds on the present madness of the sahiblog which o naik covers great cunning builds for himself a lockup my fathers uncle has seen their country and he says that he is afraid as never he feared before so strickland sahibs boy will come back to this country and his son after him naik have they named him yet  the butler spoke to my household having heard the talk at table and he says that they will call him adam and no jawsplitting english name uddaam  the padre will name him at their church in due time1 van cortland  who can tell the ways of sahibs now strickland sahib knows more of the faith than ever i had time to learnprayers charms names and stories of the blessed ones yet he is not a musalman said imam din thoughtfully  for the reason that he knows as much of the gods of hindustan and so rides with a rein in each hand  remember that he sat under the baba atall a fakir among fakirs for ten days whereby a man came to be hanged for the murder of the dancinggirl on the night of the great earthquake said the naik  true  it is true  and yet    they are one day so wise the sahibs and another so foolish but he has named the child well adam huzrut adam ho ho father adam we must call him  and all who minister to the child said the naik quietly but with meaning will come to great honour  adam throve being prayed over before the gods of at least three creeds in a garden almost as fair as eden there were gigantic clumps of bamboo that talked continually and enormous plantains on whose soft paper skin he could scratch with his nails green domes of mangotrees as huge as the dome of st pauls full of parrots as big as cassowaries and grey squirrels the size of foxes at the end of the garden stood a hedge of flaming poinsettias higher than anything in the world because childlike adams eye could not carry to the tops of the mangotrees  their green went out against the blue sky but the red poinsettias he could just see  a nurse who talked continually about snakes and pulled him back from the mouth of a fascinating dry well and a mother who believed that the sun hurt little heads were the only drawbacks to this loveliness but as his legs grew under him he found that by scaling an enormous rampart three feet of brokendown mud wall at the end of the garden  he could come into a readymade kingdom where every one was his slave  imam din showed him the way one evening and the police troopers cooking their supper received him with rapture and gave him pieces of very indigestible but altogether delightful spiced bread  here he sat or sprawled in the horsefeed where the police horses were picketed in a double line and he named them men and beasts together according to his ideas and experiences as his first father had done before him in those days everything had a name from the mud mangers to the heelropes for things were people to adam exactly as people are things to folk in their second childhood through all the conferences  one hand twisted into imam dins beard and the other on his polished beltbuckle  there were two other people who came and went across the talk  death and sickness  persons stronger than imam din and stronger than the heelroped stallions  there was mata the smallpox a woman in some way connected with pigs and heza the cholera a black man according to adam and booka starvation and kismet who quietly settled all questions from the choking of a pet mungoose in the kitchen drain to the absence of a young policeman who once missed a parade and never came back  it was all very wonderful to adam but not worth much thinking over for a childs mind is bounded by his eyes exactly as a horses view of the road is limited by blinkers between all these objectionable shadowy vagrants stood a ring of kind faces and strong arms and mata and heza would never touch adam the first of men kismet might do so because  and this was a mystery no staring into the lookingglass would solve  kismet who was a man was also written like  police orders for the day in or on adams head  imam din could not explain how this might be and it was from that grey fat muhammadan that adam learned through every inflection the khuda janta god knows that settled everything in his mind  beyond the fact that khuda was a very good man and kept lions adams theology did not run far mrs strickland tried to teach him a few facts but he revolted at the story of genesis as untrue a turtle he said upheld the world and onehalf the adventures of huzrut nu father noah had never been told if mamma wanted to hear them she must ask imam din adam had heard of a saint who had made wooden cakes and pressed them to his stomach when he felt hungry and the feeding of the multitude did not impress him so it came about that a reading of miracle stories generally ended in a monologue by adam on other and much more astonishing miracles  its awful said mrs strickland half crying to think of his growing up like a little heathen mrs strickland miss youghal that was if you remember her had been born and brought up in england and did not quite understand things  let him alone said strickland hell grow out of it all or it will only come back to him in dreamsare you sure said his wife to whom stricklands least word was pure truth  quite  i was sent home when i was seven and they flicked it out of me with a wet towel at harrow  public schools dont encourage anything that isnt quite english  mrs strickland shuddered for she had been trying not to think of the separation that follows motherhood in india and makes life there for all that is written to the contrary not quite the most desirable thing in the world adam trotted out to hear about more miracles and his nurse must have worried him beyond bounds for she came back weeping saying that adam baba was in danger of being eaten alive by wild horses  as a matter of fact he had shaken off juma by bolting between a couple of picketed horses and lying down under their bellies that they were personal friends of his juma did not understand nor strickland either adam was settled at ease when his father arrived breathless and white and the stallions put back their ears and squealed  if you come here said adam they will hit you kicks tell juma i have eaten my rice and wish to be alone  come out at once said strickland for the horses were beginning to  paw violently  why should i obey jumas order she is afraid of horses  it is not jumas order it is mine obey  ho said adam juma did not tell me that and he crawled out on all fours among the shod feet mrs strickland was crying bitterly with fear and excitement and as a sacrifice to the home gods adam had to be whipped he said with perfect justice there was no order that i should not sit with the horses and they are my horses why is there this tamasha  stricklands face showed him that the whipping was coming and the child turned white motherlike mrs strickland left the room but juma the fostermother stayed to see  am i to be whipped here he gasped  of course  before that woman father i am a man i am not afraid it is my izzat   my honour  strickland only laughed to this day i cannot imagine what possessed him and gave adam the little taptap with a ridingcane that was whipping sufficient  for his years  when it was all over adam said quietly i am little and you are big if i stayed among my horse folk i should not have been whipped you are afraid to go there  the merest chance led me to stricklands house that afternoon when i was halfway down the drive adam passed me without recognition at a fast run i caught one glimpse of his face under his big hat and it was the face of his father as i had once seen that in the grey of morning when it bent above a leper i caught the child by the shoulder  let me go he screamed and he and i were the best of friends as a rule  let me go  where to father adam he was quivering like a newhaltered colt  to the well i have been beaten i have been beaten before women let me go he tried to bite my hand  that is a small matter i said men are horn to beatings  thou hast never been beaten he said savagely  indeed i have times past counting  before women  my mother and the ayah saw by women too for that matter what of it  what didst thou do he stared beyond my shoulder up the long drive  it is long ago and i have forgotten i was older than thou art but even then i forgot and now the thing is but a jest to be talked of  adam drew one big breath and broke down utterly in my arms then he raised his head and his eyes were stricklands eyes when strickland gave orders  ho imam din  the fat orderly seemed to spring out of the earth at our feet crashing through the bushes and standing to attention  hast thou ever been beaten said adamassuredly by my father when i was thirty years old he beat me with a ploughbeam before all the women of the villagewherefore  because i had returned to the village on leave from the government service and had said of the village elders that they had not seen the world therefore he beat me to show that no seeing of the world changed father and son  and thou  i stood up he was my father  good said adam and turned on his heel without another word  imam din looked after him an elephant breeds but once in a lifetime but he breeds elephants yet i am glad i am no father of tuskers said he  what is it all i asked  his father beat him with a whip no bigger than a reed but the child could not have done what he desired to do without leaping through me and i am of some few pounds weight look  imam din stepped back through the bushes and the pressed grass showed that he had been lying curled round the mouth of the dry well  when there was talk of beating i knew that one who sat among horses such as ours was not like to kiss his fathers hand so i lay down in this place we both stood still looking at the wellcurb  adam came back along the garden path to us i have spoken to my father he said simply imam din tell thy naik that his woman is dismissed my service  huzoor said imam din stooping low  for no fault of hers  protector of the poor  and today  khodawund  it is an order go  again the salute and imam din departed with that same set of the back which he wore when he had taken an order from strickland i thought that it would be well to go too but strickland beckoned me from the verandah when i came up he was perfectly white and rocking to and fro in his chair repeated good god half a dozen times  do you know that he was going to chuck himself down the well  because i tapped him just now  he said helplessly  i ought to i replied he has just dismissed his nurse  on his own authority i suppose  he told me just now that he wouldnt have her for a nurse any more i never supposed he meant it for an instant i suppose shell have to go  it is written elsewhere that strickland was feared through the length and breadth of the punjab by murderers horsethieves and cattlelifters  adam returned halting outside the verandah very white about the lips  i have sent away juma because she saw that  that which happened until she is gone i do not come in the house he said  but to send away thy fostermother  said strickland with reproach  i do not send her away  it is thy blame and the small forefinger was pointed to strickland i will not obey her i will not eat from her hand and i will not sleep with her send her away  strickland stepped out and lifted the child into the verandah  this folly has lasted long enough he said come now and be wise  i am little and you are big said adam between set teeth you can beat me before this man or cut me to pieces but i will not have juma for my ayah any more i will not eat till she goes i swear it by  my fathers head  strickland sent him indoors to his mother and we could hear sounds of weeping and adams voice saying nothing more than send juma away presently juma came in and wept too and adam repeated it is no fault of thine but go  and the end of it was that juma went with all her belongings and adam fought his own way alone into his little clothes until a new ayah came his address of welcome to her was rather amazing in a few words it ran if i do wrong send me to my father if you strike me i will try to kill you i do not wish my ayah to play with me go and eat rice  from that day adam forswore the society of ayahs and small native girls as much as a small boy can confining himself to imam din and his friends of the police the naik jumas husband had been presuming not a little on his position and when adams favour was withdrawn from his wife he judged it best to apply for a transfer to another post there were too many companions anxious to report his shortcomings to strickland  towards his father adam kept a guarded neutrality there was not a touch of sulkiness in it for the childs temper was as clear as a bell but the difference and the politeness worried strickland  if the other men had loved adam before the affair of the well they  worshipped him now  he knows what honour means said imam din he has justified himself upon a point thereof  he has carried an order through his fathers household as a child of the blood might do  therefore he is not altogether a child any longer  wah he is a tigers cub  the next time that adam made his little unofficial inspection of the line imam din and by consequence all the others stood upon their feet with their hands to their sides instead of calling out from where they lay salaam babajee and other disrespectful things  but strickland took long counsel with his wife and she with the chequebook and their lean bankaccount and they decided that adam must go home to his aunts but england is not home to a child that has been born in india and it never becomes homelike unless he spends all his youth there the bankbook showed that if they economised through the summer by going to a cheap hillstation instead of to simla where mrs stricklands parents lived and where strickland might be noticed by the powers they could send adam home in the next spring it would be hard pinching but it could be done  in india all the money that people in other lands save against a rainy day runs off in loss by exchange which today cuts a mans income down almost exactly to onehalf there is nothing to show for money when all is put by and that is what makes married life there so hard strickland used to say sometimes that he envied the convicts in the jail they had no position to keep up and the ball and chain that the worst of them wore was only a few pounds weight of iron  dalhousie was chosen as being the cheapest of the hillstations dalhousie and a little fiveroomed cottage full of mildew tucked away among the rhododendrons  adam had been to simla three or four times and knew by name the most of the tonga drivers from kalka to tara deva but this new plan disquieted him he came to me for information his hands deep in his knickerbocker pockets walking step for step as his father walked  there will be none of my bhaibund brotherhood up there said he disconsolately and they say that i must lie still in a doolie for a day and a night being carried like a sheep i wish to take some of my mounted men to dalhousie  i told him that there was a small boy called victor at dalhousie who had a calf for a pet and was allowed to play with it on the public roads after that adam could not sufficiently hurry the packing  first said he i shall ask that man victor to let me play with the cows child if he is muggra illconditioned i shall tell my policemen  to take it away  but that is unjust said strickland and there is no order that the police should do injustice  when the government pay is not sufficient and lowcaste men are promoted what can an honest man do he replied in the very touch and accent of imam din and stricklands eyebrows went up  you talk too much to the police my son he said  always about everything  said adam promptly they say that when i am an officer i shall know as much as my father god forbid little one  they say too that you are as clever as shaitan to know things  they say that do they said strickland looking pleased his pay was small but he had his reputation and that was dear to him  they say also  not to me but to one another when they eat rice behind the wall  that in your own heart you esteem yourself as wise as suleiman who was cheated by shaitan  this time strickland did not look so pleased adam in all innocence launched into a long story about suleimanbindaoud who once out of vanity pitted his wits against shaitan and because god was not on his side shaitan sent a little devil of low caste as adam put it who cheated him utterly and put him to shame before all the other rajas  by jove said strickland when the tale was done and went away while adam took me to task for laughing at imam dins story i did not wonder that he was called huzrut adam for he looked old as all time in his grave childhood sitting crosslegged his battered little helmet far at the back of his head his forefinger wagging up and down native fashion and the wisdom of serpents on his unconscious lips  that may he went up to dalhousie with his mother and in those days the journey ended in fifty or sixty miles of uphill travel in a doolie or palanquin along a road winding through the himalayas adam sat in the doolie with his motherand strickland rode and tied with me a spare doolie following the march began after we got out of the train at pathankot in a hot night among the  rice  and poppyfields  it was all new to adam and he had opinions to advance  notably about a fish that jumped on a wayside pond  now i know he shouted how khuda puts them there first he makes them and then he drops them down that was a new one then lifting his head to the stars he cried o god do it again but slowly that i adam may see  but nothing happened and the dooliebearers lit the noisome dripping rag torches and adams eyes shone big in the dancing light and we smelt the dry dust of the plains that we were leaving after eleven months hard work  at stated times the men ceased their drowsy grunting tune and sat down for a smoke between the guttering of their waterpipes we could hear the cries of the beasts of the night and the wind stirring in the folds of the mountain ahead at the changing stations the voice of adam the first of men would be lifted to rouse the sleepers in the huts till the fresh relays of bearers shambled from their cots and the reliefpony with them  then we would reform and go on and by the time the moon rose adam was asleep and there was no sound in the night except the grunting of the men the husky murmur of some river a thousand feet down in the valley and the squeaking of stricklands saddle so we went up from the datepalm to deodar till the dawn wind came round a corner all fresh from the snows and we snuffed it i heard strickland say wife my overcoat please and adam fretfully where is dalhousie and the cows child and then i slept till strickland turned me out of the warm doolie at seven oclock and i stepped into the splendour of a cool hill day the plains sweltering twenty miles back and three thousand feet below  adam waked too and needs must ride in front of me to ask a million questions and shout at the monkeys and clap his hands when the painted pheasants bolted across our road and hail every woodcutter and drover and pilgrim within sight till we halted for breakfast at a staginghouse after breakfast being a child he went out to play with a train of bullockdrivers haltered by the roadside and we had to chase him out of a native liquorshop where he was bargaining with a naked sevenyearold for a mynah in a bamboo cage  said he wriggling on my pommel as we went on again there were four men behosh insensible at the back of that house wherefore do men grow  behosh from drinking  it is the nature of the water l said and calling back strick whats that grogshop doing so close to the road its a temptation to any ones servants  dunno said a sleepy voice in the doolie this is kennedys district twasnt here in my time  truly the water smells bad adam went on i smelt it but i did not get the mynah even for six annas the woman of the house gave me a lovegift that i found playing near the verandah  and what was the gift father adam  a nosering for my ayah ohe ohe  look at that camel with a bag on his nose a string of loaded camels came cruising round the corner as a fleet rounds a cape  ho malik why does not a camel salaam like an elephant his neck is long enough adam cried  the angel jibrail made him a fool from the beginning said the driver as he swayed on the top of the led beast and laughter ran all along the line of redbearded men  that   is true said adam and they laughed again  at last in the late afternoon we came to dalhousie loveliest of the hillstations and separatedadam hardly could be restrained from setting out at once to find victor and the cows child i found them both something to my trouble next morning the two young sinners had a calf on a taut line just at a sharp turn in the mall and were pretending that he was a rajas elephant who had gone mad but it was my horse that nearly went mad and they shouted with delight then we began to talk and adam by way of crushing victors repeated reminders that he and not that other was the owner of the calf said  it is true i have no cows child but a great dacoity has been done on my father  we came up together yesterday there could have been nothing i said  it was my mothers horse  she has been dacoited with beating and blows and now it is so thin  he held his hands an inch apart  my father is at the tarhouse sending tars imam din will cut off all their heads  i desire your saddlecloth for a howdah to my elephant  give it me  this was exciting but not lucid i went to the telegraphoffice and found strickland in a bad temper among many telegraphforms  a dishevelled oneeyed groom stood in a corner whimpering at intervals  he was a man whom adam invariably addressed as beshakl beukl beank  ugly stupid eyeless  it seemed according to strickland that he had sent his wifes horse up to dalhousie by road a fortnights march  this is the custom in upper india among the foothills near dhunnera or dhar horse and man had been violently set upon in the night by four men who had beaten the groom his leg was bandaged from knee to ankle in proof had incidentally beaten the horse and had robbed the groom of the bucket and all his money  eleven rupees nine annas three pie  last they had left him for dead by the wayside where woodcutters had found and nursed him  then the oneeyed howled with anguish thinking over his bruises  they asked me if i was strickland sahibs servant and i thinking the protection of the name would be sufficient spoke the truth  then they  beat me grievously  hm said strickland  i thought they wouldnt dacoit as a business on the dalhousie road  this is meant for me personally  sheer badmashi impudence  all right  in justice to a very hardworking class it must be said that the thieves of upper india have the keenest sense of humour the last compliment that they can pay a police officer is to rob him and if as once they did they can loot a deputy inspectorgeneral of police on the eve of his retirement of everything except the clothes on his back their joy is complete  they cause letters of derision and telegrams of condolence to be sent to the victim for of all men thieves are most compelled to keep up with modern progress  strickland was a man of few words where his business was concerned i had never seen a police officer robbed before and i expected some excitement but strickland held his tongue he took the grooms deposition and retired into himself for a time evolving thieves then he sent kennedy of the pathankot charge an official letter and an unofficial note  kennedys reply was purely unofficial and it ran thus this seems a compliment solely intended for you  my wonder is you didnt get it before  the men are probably back in your district by this time  the dhunnera and foothill people are highly respectable cultivators and seeing my assistant is an unlicked pup and i cant trust my inspector out of my sight i am not going to turn their harvest upside down with a police investigation i am run off my feet with vaccination police work  youd better look at home the shubkudder gang were through here a fortnight back  they laid up at the amritsar serai and then worked down  no cases against them in my charge but remember you lagged their malik for receiving in prub dyals burglary  they owe you one  exactly what i thought said strickland i had a notion it was the  shubkudder gang from the first  we must make it pleasant for them at peshawur and in my district too  they are just the kind that would lie up under imam dins shadow  from this point onward the wires began to he worked heavily strickland had a very fair knowledge of the shubkudder gang gathered at first hand  they were the same syndicate that had once stolen a deputy commissioners cow put horseshoes on her and taken her forty miles into the jungle before they lost interest in the joke they added insult to insult by writing that the deputy commissioners cows and horses were so much alike that it took them two days to find out the difference and they would not lift the like of such  cattle any more  the district superintendent at peshawur replied to strickland that he was expecting the gang and stricklands assistant in his own district being young and full of zeal sent up the most amazing clues  now thats just what i want that young fool not to do said strickland he hasnt passed the lower standard yet and hes an english boy born and bred and his father before him he has about as much tact as a bull and he wont work quietly under my inspector  i wish the government would keep our service for countryborn men those first five or six years give a man a pull that lasts him his life adam if you were only old enough to be my stunt he looked down at the little fellow on the verandah adam was deeply interested in the dacoity and unlike a child did not lose interest after the first week on the contrary he would ask his father every evening what had been done and strickland had drawn him a picture on the white wall of the verandah showing the different towns in which policemen were on the lookout for the thieves  they were amritsar jullundur phillour gurgaon in case the gang were moving south rawal pindi and peshawur with multan adam looked up at the picture  as he answered  there has been great dikh trouble in this case  very great trouble i wish thou wert a young man and my assistant to help me  dost thou need help my father adam asked curiously with his head on one side  very much  leave it all alone it is bad let loose everything  that must not be those beginning a business continue to the end  thou wilt continue to the end dost thou not know who did the dacoity  strickland shook his head  adam turned to me with the same question and i answered it in the same way  what foolish people he said and turned his back on us he showed plainly in all our dealings afterwards how we had fallen in his opinion  strickland told me that he would sit at the door of his workroom and stare at him for half an hour at a time as he went through his papers strickland seemed to work harder over the case than if he had been in office on the plains  and sometimes i look up and i fancy the little chaps laughing at me its an awful thing to have a son you see hes your own and his own and between the two you dont know quite how to handle him said strickland i wonder what in the world he thinks about  i asked adam this on my own account he put his head on one side for a moment and replied in these days i think about great things i do not play with victor and the cows child any more he is only a baba  at the end of the third week of stricklands leave the result of stricklands labours  labours that had made mrs strickland more indignant against dacoits than any one else  came to hand the police at peshawur reported that half the shubkudder gang were held at peshawur to account for the possession of some blankets and a horsebucket stricklands assistant had also four men under suspicion in his charge and imam din must have stirred up stricklands inspector to investigations on his own account for a string of incoherent telegrams came in from the club secretary in which he entreated exhorted and commanded strickland to take his mangy havildars off the club premises your men in servants quarters here examining cook  marker indignant steward threatens resignation members furious  saises stopped on roads shut up or my resignation goes to committee  now i shouldnt in the least wonder said strickland thoughtfully to his wife if the club was not just the place where a man would lie up bill watson isnt at all pleased though  i think i shall have to cut my leave by a week and go down there if theres anything to be told the men will tell me it will never do for the gang to think they can dacoit my belongings  that was in the forenoon and strickland asked me to tiff in to leave me some instructions about his big dog with authority to rebuke those who did not attend to her tietens was growing too old and too fat to live in the plains in summer when i came adam had climbed into his high chair at the table and mrs strickland seemed ready to weep at any moment over the general misery of things  i go down the hill tomorrow little son said strickland  wherefore said adam reaching out for a ripe mango and burying his head in it  imam din has caught the men who did the dacoity and there are also others at peshawur under suspicion i must go to see  bus said adam between the sucks at his mango as mrs strickland tucked the napkin round his neck  it is enough  imam din speaks lies do not go  it is necessary there has been great dikhdari troublegiving  adam came out of the fruit for a minute and laughed  then returning he spoke between slow and deliberate mouthfuls  the dacoits live in beshakls head  they will never be caught all people know that the cook knows and the scullion and rahim baksh here  nay said the butler behind his chair hastily what should i know nothing at all does the servant of the presence know  accha said adam and sucked on only it is known  speak then said strickland what dost thou know  remember the sais was beaten insensible  that was in the badwater shop where i played when we came here the boy who would not sell me the mynah for six annas told me that a oneeyed man had come there and drunk the bad waters and gone mad he broke bedsteads they hit him with a bamboo till he fell senseless and fearing he was dead they nursed him on milk like a little baba when i was playing first with the cows child i asked beshakl if he were that man and he said no but i knew because many woodcutters asked him whether his head were whole now  but why i interrupted did beshakl tell lies  oh he is a lowcaste man and desired consideration now he is a witness in a great lawcase and men will go to the jailkhana on his account it was to give trouble and obtain notice  was it all lies said strickland  ask him said adam cheerily through the mangojuice  strickland passed through the door there was a howl of despair in the servants quarters up the hill and he returned with the oneeyed groom  now said strickland it is known declare beshakl said adam while the man gasped imam din has caught four men and there are some more at peshawur  bus bus bus tell about the mare and how she rolled  thou didst get drunk by the wayside and didst make a false case  to cover it  speak  like many other men strickland in possession of a few facts was irresistible the groom groaned  i  i did not get drunk  till  till  protector of the poor  the mare rolled  all horses roll at dhunnera  the road is too narrow before that and they smell where the other horses have rolled  this the bullockdrivers told me when they came there said adam  she rolled the saddle was cut and the curbchain was lost  see said adam tugging a curbchain from his pocket  that woman in  the shop gave it to me for a lovegift  beshakl said it was not his when i showed it  but i knew  then they in the grogshop knowing that i was the servant of the presence said that unless i drank and spent money they would tell  a lie  a lie said strickland  son of an owl speak truth now at least  then i was afraid because i had lost the curbchain so i cut the saddle  across and about  she did not roll then said strickland bewildered and very angry  it was the curbchain that was lost  that was the beginning of all  i cut the saddle to look as though she had rolled and went to drink in the shop  i drank and there was a fray  the rest i have forgotten till i was recovered  and the mare the while  what of the mare  the man looked at strickland and collapsed i will speak truth  she bore fagots for a woodcutter for a week  oh poor diamond said mrs strickland  and beshaki was paid four annas for her hire three days ago by the  woodcutters brother who is the lefthand man of the jhampanis here said adam in a loud and joyful voice we all knew we all knew i and all the servants  strickland was silent his wife stared helplessly at the child  the soul called out of the nowhere that went its own way alone  did no man help thee with the lies i asked of the groom  none protector of the poor  not one  they grew then  as a tale grows in the telling alas i am a very bad man and he blinked his one eye dolefully  now four men are held at my station on thy account and god knows how many more at peshawur besides the questions at multan and my izzat is lost and the mare has been packpony to a woodcutter son of devils what canst thou do to make amends  there was just a little break in stricklands voice and the man caught it bending low he answered in the abject fawning whine that confounds right and wrong more surely even than most modern creeds protector of the poor is the police service shut to an honest man  out cried strickland and swiftly as the groom departed he must have heard our shout of laughter behind him  if you dismiss that man strick i shall engage him hes a genius i said it will take you months to put this mess right and billy watson wont give you a minutes peace  you arent going to tell him said strickland appealingly  i couldnt keep this to myself if you were my own brother four men  held in your district four or forty at peshawur  and what was that you said about multan  oh nothing  only some camel men there have been   on account of a curbchain oh my aunt  and whose memsahib was thy aunt said adam with the mango stone in his fist we began to laugh again  but here said strickland pulling his face together is a very bad child who has caused his father to lose honour before all the policemen of the punjab  oh they know said adam  it was only for the sake of show that they caught the people assuredly they all knew it was bunao makeup  and since when hast thou known said the first policeman in india to his son  four days after we came here  after the woodcutter had asked beshakl of the health of his head beshaki all but slew a woodcutter at that badwater place  if thou hadst spoken then time and money and trouble to me and to others had all been spared  baba thou hast done a wrong greater than thy knowledge and thou hast put me to shame and set me out upon false words and broken my honour thou hast done very wrong but perhaps thou didst not think  nay but i did think father my honour was lost when that happened that  that happened in jumas presence now it is made whole again  and with the most enchanting smile in the world adam climbed on  to his fathers lap  end of the son of his father    end of the days work  part i
