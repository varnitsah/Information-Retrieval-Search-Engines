philosophysky  a new edition revised by the author  boston phillips sampson and company   entered according to act of congress in the year 1855 by phillips sampson  co in the clerks office of the district court of the district of massachusetts     preface   the main design in view in the discussions which are offered to the juvenile world under the title of the rollo philosophy relates rather to their effect upon the little readers habits of thinking reasoning and observation than to the additions they may make to his stock of knowledge the benefit which the author intends that the reader shall derive from them is an influence on the cast of his intellectual character which is receiving its permanent form during the years to which these writings are adapted  the acquisition of knowledge however though in this case a secondary is by no means an unimportant object and the discussion of the several topics proceeds accordingly with regularity upon a certain system of classification this classification is based upon the more obvious external properties and relations of matter and less upon those which though they are more extensive and general in their nature and therefore more suitable in a strictlyscientific point of view for the foundations of a system are less apparent and require higher powers of generalization and abstraction and are therefore less in accordance with the genius and spirit of the rollo philosophy  as teachers have in some cases done the author the honor to introduce some of the preceding works of this class into their schools as reading books c considerable reference has been had to this in the form and manner of the discussion and questions have been added to facilitate the use of the books in cases where parents or teachers may make the reading of them a regular exercise of instruction     contents       chapter i                      page     lost in the snow                  9      chapter ii     flying

snow   one pleasant morning very early in the spring rollos cousin lucy came to call for rollo to go on an expedition which they had planned the day before it was near the end of march and the snow had become so consolidated by the warm sun in the days and the hard frosts at night that it would bear the children to walk upon it the children called it the crust but it was not strictly speaking a crust for the snow was compact and solid not merely upon the top but nearly throughout the whole mass down to the ground  rollo and lucy were going to have an expedition upon the crust rollo had a sled and they were going to put upon the sled such things as they should need and rollo was to draw it while lucy and nathan rollos little brother were to walk along by his side  rollos sled was ready at the back door when lucy came lucy brought with her some provisions for a luncheon in a basket this was her part of the preparation rollo got his axe and one or two boards a little longer than the sled which he said were to make seats he also had a tinderbox and some matches to enable him to make a fire when all things were ready the three children set out together  rollo drew the sled with the boards the basket and some other things upon it all bound together securely with a cord the load appeared to be considerable in bulk but it was not heavy and rollo drew it along very easily they were not obliged to confine themselves to the roads and paths for the snow was hard in every direction and they could go over the fields wherever they pleased in one place where the snow was very deep on the side of a hill they went right over the top of a stone wall  it was a cloudy day but calm this was favorable the sky being overcast kept the sun from thawing the snow but yet their father told them that probably it would begin to grow soft before they came home and if so they would have to come home in a certain sled road which jonas had made that winter by hauling wood he advised them not to encamp at any great distance from the sled road  they came at last to a pleasant spot on the margin of a wood near where there was a spring the rocks around the spring were all covered with snow and the little stream which in summer flowed from the spring was frozen and buried up entirely out of sight but the spring itself was open which rollo said was very fortunate as they might want some water to drink  here they encamped rollo cut some stakes which he drove down into the snow and contrived to make a rude sort of table with his boards he also cut a large number of hemlock branches which lucy and nathan dragged out and spread around the table for them to sit upon then rollo built a fire of sticks which he gathered in the wood the ground was covered with snow so that it would have been very difficult for him to have found any sticks were it not that some kinds of trees in the woods have a great many small branches near the bottom which are dead and dry these rollo cut off and lucy and nathan dragged them out and put them on the fire when he had kindled it the fire was a little way from the table with the carpet of hemlock boughs between  there was a high hill covered with snow at a little distance and after they had eaten their luncheon rollo said  o lucy we will play go up the mountains there is a hill for us that shall be chimborazo  well said lucy if you will cut us some long staves  accordingly rollo went into the wood and selected some tall and slender young trees about an inch in diameter and cut two for lucy two for nathan and two for himself these he trimmed up smoothly and each of the children took one in each hand they played that rollo was the guide and lucy was the philosopher nathan was the philosophers servant rollo conducted them safely to the summit but just after they got there it began to snow  the snow descended in large flakes and rollo was delighted to see it but lucy seemed a little anxious she said that if there should be much snow it would make it hard for nathan to get home and she thought that they had better go down the mountain immediately and set out for home rollo was rather unwilling to go but he allowed himself to be persuaded and so they all came down the mountain together  they packed up their things as quick as they could leaving the fire to burn itself out only rollo first piled on all the hemlock brancheswhich made a great crackling the snow began to fall faster the air was full of the large flakes which floated slowly down and lodged gently upon the old snow  the children went along very successfully for some time but at length rollo lost his way the air was so full of snowflakes that he could see only a very little way before him and the old snow covered the ground so as to hide all the old marks and to alter the general aspect of the fields so much that rollo was completely lost he however did not say anything about it but wandered on lucy and nathan wondering all the while why they did not get home until at length they came across a track in the snow  o see this track said rollo here is a track where somebody else has been along with a sled  yes said lucy some boys who have gone out to slide perhaps  the track was partly obliterated by the snow which had fallen upon it since the boys that made it had gone along rollo wondered whose track it could be he said that he thought it very probable it was henrys lucy thought that it might be the track of some children that had gone out to find them  at any rate said rollo we will follow the track a little way and see what it leads to perhaps we shall overtake the boys  accordingly rollo turned along in the track but lucy stopped  no rollo said she we must go the other way if we want to find the boysthe track is going the other way but never mind she added i dont want to find the boys i want to go home so we will go this way  rollo went on secretly pleased to find the track for he supposed that by retracing it as he was doing it would lead him back home he had however a great curiosity to know who could have made it and in fact the mystery was soon unraveled  for after following the track a short distance they saw before them a large dark spot upon the snow and on drawing near to it to see what it was they found it was the place of their own encampment and the track which they were following was their own track leading them back to the mouldering remains of their own fire they had gone round in a great circle and come back upon their own course rollo looked exceedingly blank and confused at this unexpected termination of the clew which he had hoped was to have led him out of his difficulty what he was to do now he did not know  the fact however that they were lost was no longer to be concealed and lucy proposed that they should go into the woods where the tops of the trees would act as a sort of umbrella to keep the snow from falling upon them and wait there until it stopped snowing and then the air would be clear and they could find their way out  o said rollo i can easily make a hut of hemlock branches and we can go into that for shelter  but rollo said nathan how do you know but that it will snow all day we cant stay in the woods all day  no said rollo when it snows in great flakes it is not going to snow long jonas told me so  so the children went into the woods and rollo began to make his hut but he was soon interrupted and the attention of all the children was called off by a little bird which they saw there hopping about and appearing benumbed with cold after some effort rollo succeeded in catching her in his cap  well carry her home said nathan well carry her home and show her to mother  yes said rollo ill carry her in my cap  no said lucy you must have your cap on your head or you will take cold let me carry her in my hands  no said rollo you will have to lead nathan ill tell you what we will do we will put her into the basket for a cage  lucy on the whole liked this plan and they accordingly put the bird in the basket and rollo contrived to make a cover of boughs to keep her from getting away  by the time that this was all arranged the children found to their great satisfaction that it had ceased snowing and they immediately set out for home rollo drew the sled with the basket and bird upon it secured as before with the cord and lucy led nathan they now had no difficulty in finding their way and soon reached home in safety  they kept the bird until the next day and then as it was mild and pleasant they let her fly away       questions      by what process had the snow become hardened at this time did     rollos father expect that it would continue hard till noon     why not did it continue hard what prevented its melting how     did rollo get sticks for his fire what name did he give to the     hill which they ascended what occasioned the difficulty in the     way of rollos finding his way home what conversation took     place when he found the track was this track in the new snow     or in the old snow how had it become partly obliterated how     did they carry the bird home     chapter ii  flying   nathan became very much interested in the bird and that evening as his father was sitting by the fire with a book in his hand which he had been reading nathan came up to him and said  father are you busy nowthinking or anything  no said his father  because said nathan if you are not i want to read you something out of my little book  so nathans father took him up into his lap and nathan opened his little book and began to read as follows      with fins for the water and wings for the air     and feet for the ground i could go everywhere  isnt that funny said nathan  rather funny said his father  i wish i had wings said nathan  why said his father  why then i could fly  that is not certain said his father there are two difficulties which prevent boys from flying one is they have no wings and the other is they have not strength to use them  o father said nathan i could use them i am pretty strong i can wheel rollos wheelbarrow  his father smiled very possibly said he but i do not think that you would be strong enough to use wings even if you had them  why at any rate i am stronger than a bird said nathan  yes said his father you have more actual strength than a bird but not more in proportion to your size you are absolutely stronger but not relatively  what do you mean by that said nathan  why you have actually more strength than a birda robin for instance you could hold him so that he could not get away and you could lift more than he could too but then you are a great deal larger and you are not as much stronger than he is as you are larger if you are a hundred times as heavy as he you are not a hundred times as strong thats what i mean by saying that you are absolutely stronger but not relatively that is you are not as many times stronger as you are larger and heavier you are absolutely stronger but not relatively that is in proportion to your size and weight  now i can prove to you continued his father that you would not be strong enough to fly with wings even if you had them suppose there was a pole fastened across the room and another pole just above it could you pull yourself up from one pole to the other by your hands alone without touching your feetor a ladder continued his fatherit will be better to suppose a ladder now if there was a ladder leaning up against a building could you climb up on the under side by your hands drawing yourself up hand over hand without touching your feet  here rollo who was reading in a little chair at the back part of the room when his father first commenced the conversation with nathan but who had been listening for a few minutes past to what his father had been saying jumped up and came across the room to his father and said  yes sir yes sir i can i have done it often in the barn  how high up could you go said his father  o almost up to the loft said rollo only you see father the rounds are too far up i cant reach up very well if they were nearer together i could climb up so very well  well said his father a bird when flying has to climb up in much the same way he has to pull himself up by the air with his wings just as you do with your hands and arms by the rounds of the ladder only the air is not fixed like the ladder but constantly gives way under his wing and so to make the case the same you must suppose that the ladder is not firm but is floating in the air and sinks down with your weight so that you have to climb up faster than you pull the ladder down do you think you would have strength enough in your arms to do that  rollo and nathan looked very much interested in what their father was saying but they both admitted that they could not climb up such ladders as those  the air added their father gives way continually under the birds wing and yet they have to pull themselves up by it and this is very hard they must either have very large wings and prodigious strength to use them so as to pull upon the air with very hard and heavy strokes or else if they have small wings they must have strength to strike very quick and often with them  the wings of sparrows move so quick that you cannot count the strokes and those of hummingbirds which are smaller still so fast that you cannot see them they make a hum  i could make my wings go so fast said nathan and he began to imitate the flapping of the wings of a bird with his arms as rapidly and forcibly as he could  so can i said rollo and he made the same motions that is as fast as crows wings move when they are flying  yes said his father crows move their wings as fast as that whereas you only move hands and arms if you had great wings as long in proportion as the crows you could not move them so fast  how large would they be said rollo  o i dont knowperhaps as big as the top of the diningtable  o father said rollo i dont think they would be as big as that the crows wings are not longer than his body and so mine would not be longer than my body  perhaps you never saw a crows body said his father his feathers and his tail which are very light swell out his body and make it appear much larger than it really is i presume his wings when they are spread are twice or three times as long as his body if you had wings in proportion it would be with the utmost difficulty that you could use them at all you certainly could not strike the air with them fast enough to pull yourself up by them  i did not think that the birds pulled themselves up by the air said nathan i did not know that the air was anything real  o yes it is something real said his father  ive seen birds fly without moving their wings at all said rollo  yes said his father and so have i seen a stone  a stone repeated rollo  what a stone fly said nathan  yes replied his father did you never see a stone fly through the air without any wings at all  why yes said rollo when somebody threw it  very well said his father if you set the stone in motion it will continue in motion for some time without any wings and so will a bird  but father they dont throw birds said nathan and he laughed aloud at such an idea  birds throw themselves said his father that is they strike their wings upon the air hard and quick and thus get into very quick motion and then they can keep their wings still for a time and go on as long as the impulse they have given them lasts this shows what prodigious strength they have in their wings they can not only strike the air hard and frequently enough to raise themselves up and move along but they can do it so easily as to get such a velocity that they can rest their wings for some time and sail away through the air only expending the impulse they had accumulated  rollo and nathan were silent rollo was thinking how he had seen the swallows sailing swiftly round and round in the air with their wings spread out motionless by their side  so you see continued his father the difficulty in the way of a boys flying is not the want of wings but the want of strength to use them it would be very easy to make wings  would it said nathan  yes said his father at least it would not be very difficult ingenious mechanics would soon find out modes of making something to answer the purpose of wings to strike upon the air if there was the necessary power to work them the great difficulty in almost all cases in mechanics is in getting the power there is very little difficulty in applying it to any purpose it is wanted for so you see next time nathan when you want to fly you must wish not that you had wings but that you were strong enough to use them  well father said rollo men are strong enough to paddle themselves along in the water why cant they in the air  because said his father water supports them by its buoyancy and they have nothing to do but to move themselves along upon it but air cannot support them and of course a great part of the effort which they would make would be required to keep them up and then besides the water is generally nearly at rest but the air is generally in a state of rapid motion  why father said rollo im sure water is sometimes in rapid motion the rivers run very swiftly often  yes replied his father but then when they do men cannot paddle or row boats upon them a current that should run at the rate of four or five miles an hour would be very hard to row against but the air is seldom in a state of less motion than that it is very often moving at the rate of fifteen or twenty miles an hour sometimes sixty so you see there is a double reason why men cannot fly in the air as well as paddle on the water  if we were only light enough said rollo to float in the air then we could fly  we could paddle about in it when it was calm replied his father but that would not be flying  is there anything light enough to float in the air said rollo  no said his father i dont think of any visible substance that is  what do you mean by visible substance said nathan  why anything that you can see replied his father there are some other kinds of air which are lighter than common air but there is nothing else so far as i know  why father there are clouds they float and they are visible i am sure  yes said his father there is some mystery about the floating of clouds i dont fully understand it clouds are formed of small globules or little balls of water and water i should think whatever the size of the little drops might be would be heavier than air and yet they seem to float if they are large like rain drops they fall quickly to the ground if they are small like mist they fall slowly that i should expect if they are finer still like vapor or fog i should think that they would fall still more slowly but still i should suppose that they would descend but they do not appear to descend they seem to float nearly at rest though perhaps all the clouds we see may be slowly descending all the time while we do not perceive it  the smoke goes up from the top of the chimney said rollo  yes said his father there is no difficulty about that the vapor from a fire is carried up by the warm air no doubt air swells when it is heated and so becomes lighter and rises and the hot air from the top of the chimney carries the vapor up with it no doubt after it rises a little way and becomes cool it ceases to ascend but floats away horizontally perhaps it begins to descend when it gets cool though very slowly and perhaps all clouds are really descending all the time though too slowly for us to perceive the motion  only said rollo after a little time they would get down to the ground  perhaps not said his father for when they get down nearer the earth where it is warm they may be gradually dissolved and disappear and thus never reach the earth i should think they would descend being composed of globules of water which however small must i should think be heavier than air  a soap bubble will float in the air said rollo  i never saw one that would said his father unless it got into a current which carried it up a soap bubblemake it ever so thinshows a tendency to descend unless you put it out in the open air where there are currents to carry it up it descends very slowly but still it descends it is heavier than the air i am not absolutely certain but i believe there is no visible substance that is lighter than the air and it is very well for us there is not  why father said rollo  because if there were any they would immediately rise from the earth and float upwards till they got up where the air was so light and thin that they could not go up any higher  and so said rollo we should lose them  that would not be all said his father they would float about above us and if there were enough of them they would form a perpetual cloud over our heads to keep out the sun and to make the world dark and gloomy there seems to have been no way to keep all the solid and visible substances of the earth down upon its surface but to make them all heavier than the air  and thus continued his father all solid substances being heavier than the air they sink in it like stones or iron in water only those that are very much expanded in surface sink very slowly and sometimes almost seem to float  what do you mean by expanded father said nathan  spread out said his father an umbrella for example when it is spread out is said to be expanded other things are expanded in a little different way a feather is expanded that is it is spread out in fine filaments which extend in every direction into the air all around the stem of it things that are expanded take a great deal of air with them when they descend and so can only descend slowly  and water is expanded in a soap bubble said rollo  yes replied his father and there is a great deal of air included in it which all has to be brought down when the bubble itself descends and thus you see the bubble must descend slowly water is expanded too in clouds for in that case it is divided into millions of small particles by which it is spread out over a great deal of air and cannot descend without bringing a large portion of the air with it men have contrived on this principle to make an apparatus to prevent being hurt by falling from great heights  what is it said rollo  why it is called a parachute it is a sort of umbrella in fact it is an umbrella only made very large it is folded up and fastened under a balloon just over the car which the man is in then if the balloon bursts or any other accident happens to it and the man begins to fall the parachute opens and spreads and then the man falls very slowly the reason is that the parachute takes hold of a large mass of air and brings it down with it and so it cannot descend very fast                                       a few days after this nathan said to rollo as they were playing in the yard that he wished that he had a parachute  i know where there is one said rollo  a parachute said nathan a real parachute  yes said rollo or what is the same thing a great umbrella  is that just the same said nathan  yes said rollo for father said that a parachute was in fact only a large umbrella and father has got a large umbrella in the closet and i have a great mind to go and get it for a parachute  but you havent got any balloon said nathan  o no matter for that said rollo  then how are you going to get up into the air asked nathan  why i can climb up on the shed and jump off that and hold the umbrella over my head  just at this moment rollos cousin james came into the yard and rollo ran to him to explain to him about the parachute after describing to him the construction of it and its use by men who go up in balloons he said he was going to get his fathers umbrella which would make an excellent parachute  and then continued he i am going to get upon some high place and jump off and hold the parachute over my head and then i shall come down as light as a feather  o rollo said james i dont believe you will  yes i shall said rollo you see the parachute is expanded and so brings down a great deal of air with it and this makes it come very slowly air is a real thing james and it keeps the parachute back a great deal  illustration james and nathan both ran towards him thinking that he must be hurtpage 37  so rollo ran off after the umbrella very much interested in proving to james by actual experiment that the air was a real thing when he came with it he was himself inclined to make the first experiment from the low side of the shed he could climb up by means of a fence at the corner james advised him however to try it first from the end of a woodpile which was pretty high but yet not so high as the shed james was not quite sure that the experiment would succeed and he was afraid that rollo might get hurt  rollo said that he was not afraid to jump off the shed he knew the parachute would bear him up he did not believe but that he could jump off the house with it and at any rate he could jump off the shed he knew he accordingly clambered up and taking his station upon the eaves he spread the umbrella over his head and then jumped off  down he came with great violence his cap flew off in one direction and his umbrella rolled away in another as he had to put out both his hands to save himself when he reached the ground as it was he came down upon all fours and in such a way that james and nathan both ran towards him thinking that he must be hurt  did you hurt yourself rollo said james  no said rollo not much  i dont think the umbrella did you much good  no said rollo as he got up rubbing his elbows it didnt and i dont see what the reason is  you came down just as hard as you would without it  yes said nathan and he almost broke his back i dont believe the air is any real thing at all  the fact was that the umbrella did do some good rollo did not come down quite so hard as he would have done without it it retarded his descent a little but it was not large enough to enable him to descend in safety when his father said that a parachute was in fact only a large umbrella he meant a great deal larger than rollo had supposed a parachute such as is used with balloons is a great deal larger than any umbrella that ever was made       questions      what was nathans wish after he had read his father something     out of his book did he think that he could fly if he had     wings did his father think so what deficiency did his father     think was even more important than that of wings did nathan     think that a boy was stronger than a bird is a boy absolutely     stronger than a bird is he relatively stronger what is the     meaning of relatively stronger would a man be strong enough     to work wings that were sufficiently large to bear him up into     the air would there be any great difficulty in constructing     wings for him if he were strong enough      is any visible substance lighter than air what would be the     consequence if any of the loose substances about the earths     surface were light enough what are clouds composed of what     difficulty did rollos father point out in regard to their     floating in the air what is a parachute describe rollos     experiment with the umbrella     chapter iii  valve making   one morning when rollo awaked he heard a sharp clicking against the window  nathan said he nathan i believe there is a snowstorm  but nathan was too sleepy to hear or understand  rollo looked up but there was a curtain against the window and he could not see very well he listened he heard a low moaning sound made by the wind and a continuance of the sharp clicking which he had heard at first  when he had got up and dressed himself he found that there was a violent snowstorm at first he was glad of it for he liked snowstorms but then pretty soon he was sorry for it had been winter a long time and he was impatient for the spring  after breakfast he and nathan read and studied for two hours under their mothers direction when they were released from these duties rollo proposed to nathan that they should go out into the shed and see how the storm came on there was a large door in the shed opening towards the street where they could stand protected from the wind and see the drifts of snow  they accordingly put on their caps and went they found that the snow was pretty deep it was heaped up upon the fence and against the windows and there was a curiousshaped drift with the top curled over in a singular manner running along from the corner of the shed towards the garden gate  ah says rollo when it clears up i mean to go and wade through it  and i too said nathan  o nathan said rollo it is over your head  hark said nathan who is that pounding in the barn  it is jonas i suppose said rollo i mean to go out and see what he is doing  how are you going to get there said nathan  o i can put on my boots said rollo and go right out through the snow  i wish i could go said nathan  well said rollo i can carry you on my back  nathan clapped his hands at this proposal being doubly pleased at the prospect of both getting into the barn to see what jonas was doing and also of having a ride on the way  so rollo put on his boots while nathan went and got rollo his straps to fasten his pantaloons around them when all was ready rollo sat down upon the step of the door in order that nathan might get on easily  well play that i am a camel said rollo and that im kneeling down for you to get on  do camels kneel down said nathan when the men want to ride  yes said rollo and so saying he rose laboriously with his heavy burden upon his shoulders he staggered along with some difficulty but yet safely until he came to the great drift and after wallowing into the midst of it he lost his balance and both camel and driver rolled over together into the snow the snow got up under nathans sleeve and he began to cry  o nathan said rollo dont cry ill run and get jonas to come and carry you in  so rollo ran into the barn and called to jonas to come quick jonas laid down his hammer upon the bench and followed rollo he found nathan in the snow and took him up in his arms and carried him into the barn  as soon as he got him under cover he brushed the snow off and told him not to cry ive got a fire in the shop said he and you shall see me do my work im mending the bellows  so he led nathan through the barn and thence along under a shed to a sort of shoproom where there was a large fireplace and a fire rollo put on some sticks which made a great blaze and so nathan soon got warm and dry and forgot all his troubles then jonas sat him up upon a high stool near the bench where he could see him work he was just drawing out some of the nails by which the leather of the bellows was nailed to the sides  what is the matter with the bellows said nathan  the valve is out of order replied jonas  the valve repeated nathan what is the valve  the valve is a kind of clapper said jonas i will show it to you in a few minutes  so jonas proceeded to take off the leather from one of the sides of the bellows there was a hole in one of the sides but no hole in the other nathan had often noticed the hole but he did not know what it was for  what is the hole for said nathan  that is to let the air in said jonas  what do they want the air to come in for said nathan  to make wind of said jonas  do they make wind out of air said nathan  yes said jonas they get the bellows full of air and then blow it out through the nose and that makes wind  wind is air put in motion said rollo i read it in a book  by this time jonas had taken off the leather so far that nathan could see into the bellows he saw that there was a little clapper over the hole in one of the sides of the bellows  is that the valve said he to jonas  yes said jonas  what is it for said nathan  it is to keep the wind from coming out of that hole  why dont they want the wind to go out of that hole said nathan  because said jonas they want it to go to the fireto blow the fire  you see said rollo it cant go out of the hole and so it has to go out of the long nose which is pointed towards the fire  what makes it go out at all said nathan  why when we blow the bellows we press the two sides together and that presses the wind out it cant go out of the hole whence it came in because the clapper stops it up and so it goes out the long nose right into the fire and makes the fire burn  by this time jonas had got the leather off so far that he could get at the clapper to mend it he told the boys that it was old and worn out and he must make a new one  how are you going to make it said rollo  youll see said jonas if you watch me closely  so jonas took some leather and cut out a piece of an oblong shape a little wider than the hole and about twice as long then he laid this down over the hole it covered it entirely then he took some small carpet nails and nailed one of the ends of the leather down to the board then jonas put his hand down under the board and run one of his fingers up through the hole and pushed the leather up a little way  there said he to the boys you see i have nailed the leather so that when it lies down in its place it covers the hole completely and yet i can push it up a little with my fingers so that there will be an opening  then jonas cut a small leather strap and nailed one end of it down upon one side of the clapper and the other end upon the other side of the clapper he put one little carpet nail into each end of the strap the strap when it was nailed passed directly across the clapper or valve it was not drawn tight across but it lay upon the clapper loosely the ends were nailed tight but the middle rested loosely upon the clapper  now said jonas i can push the clapper up a little way but i cant push it far the strap keeps it from coming up far  but why said nathan do you want it to go up at all  to let the air in said jonas when i get the leather all nailed on again ill show you the whole operation of it  and you can be telling us about it in the mean time said rollo  well then said jonas when i lift up the upper side of the bellows by the handle to blow the air comes in by the hole the clapper lifts up a little way and lets it in then when i press down the handle again it presses the air out through the nose because it cant go back through the valve hole  why not said nathan  because said jonas the valve falls down over the hole and stops it up it is made so as to lift up easily and then to fall down and cover the hole exactly and prevent the air going out the same way it came in so as it cannot get out by the valve it has all to go out through the nose if the nose were stopped up it could not get out at all  and what then said rollo  why then replied jonas you could not bring the two sides of the bellows together again the air between would keep them apart  i should like to try said rollo  well said jonas and there are some other experiments you may perform with it too  at length jonas said that he had got the leather all nailed on and they might try the experiment he took hold of the nose of the bellows and held his thumb near the end of it ready to stop up the hole  now nathan you may take hold of the handles and pull them apart as if you were going to blow  nathan did so he pulled the handles apart and held them open  now said jonas i will stop up the nose and the valve will close itself and then you will find that you cannot bring the sides together again  so jonas put his thumb over the hole and told nathan to blow  nathan pressed hard and the sides came together again about as easily as usual  what exclaimed jonas with surprise he did not know what to make of the failure of his experiment  there must be a leak somewhere said he and he took the bellows out of nathans hand to look for it  he found there was a corner on the side opposite to the one where he had been working where the leather was open he having forgotten to nail it down  ah said he here is the difficulty when i have nailed this down we will try again  is that a leak said nathan  yes said jonas when you worked the bellows you pressed the air all out through there i did not know that that was open let me nail this down and then we will begin our experiment regularly       questions      what was jonas doing in the shop when rollo and nathan went out     to find him what part of the bellows was out of order how did     he make a new valve how did he fasten it to its place did he     nail down only one edge or both edges why did he want the     other edge to be left at liberty how did he prevent its lifting     up too far what was the first experiment which he performed     with the bellows after he had finished the mending did it     succeed at first why not in working a pair of bellows where     does the air come in where does it go out why cannot the air     escape through the valve where it comes in     chapter iv  experiments   when jonas had finished nailing down the corner he said now there are several experiments which we can perform with the bellows i will be the professor and you two shall be my class in philosophy and i will direct you how to make the experiments  first said jonas you rollo may take hold of the nose of the bellows with your hand in such a way as to put your thumb over the end of it to stop it up and then let nathan try to blow  rollo did so and nathan tried to blow he found that he could open the bellows very easily but when he attempted to press the sides together again he could not he crowded the handle belonging to the upper side down as hard as he could but it would not move  what makes it do so said nathan  the air inside said jonas we have stopped up all the places where it could get out the valve stops itself rollo stops the nose with his thumb and i have nailed the leather down close about all the sides and so the air cant get out and that keeps you from bringing the sides together again  nathan tried again with all his strength the sides came together very slowly  theyre coming said he  yes said jonas they come a little just as fast as the air can leak out through the little leaks all around  i thought you stopped all the leaks said nathan  yes replied jonas i stopped all the real leaks but still i cant make it perfectly tight some air can escape between the leather and the nails all around and just as fast as it can get out so fast you can press the sides together and no faster  here nathan tried again with all his strength but he could only bring the sides together very slowly  now comes the second experiment said jonas while nathan is trying to press the two handles together you rollo may run your finger into the hole and push up the valve a little  rollo did so he pushed up the valve a little with his finger and that allowed the air to escape through the opening the consequence was that the bellows collapsed at once under the pressure which nathan was exerting upon them  there said jonas you see that when the air is kept in you cannot bring the sides together but when i let the air out then they come together easily  yes said nathan do it again rollo  so they performed the experiment again nathan pulled the handles apart wide while rollo kept his thumb over the nose to keep the air from issuing through then nathan tried to press them together but he could not until rollo put his finger under and pushed up the valve a little and then they came together again very easily  the air is a real thing i verily believe said nathan  yes said rollo i know it is and now for the third experiment jonas  the third experiment said jonas is this turn the bellows bottom upwards and try to blow  nathan did so he found that he could work the bellows easilytoo easily in fact but they did not blow  hold your hand opposite the nose and see if any wind comes said jonas  they did so there was no wind or rather scarcely any  the reason is said jonas that when the bellows are bottom upwards the valve hangs down off from the hole all the time and lets the air all out through the hole in the side and it can come out more easily there than through the nose and so it dont blow well  well jonas said rollo thats a pretty good experiment but what is the next let me try the next nathan it is my turn  the next experiment which is the fifth  no the fourth said nathan  the fourth then said jonas is to prove what i said to youthat the air which is blown out at the nose of the bellows really comes in through the valve let me seei want something to make a smoke  will not paper do said rollo  yes said jonas here is some brown paper which will do so jonas rolled it up and told rollo to set it on fire and then when it was well burning to step on it with his foot and put the flame out  rollo did so and the paper lay in a heap making a great smoke upon the hearth just before the fire  now said jonas put the bellows upon its edge by the side of the paper so as to have the valve near the smoke and then hold still a minute until the smoke comes up steadily by the valve  when this was done jonas told nathan to take hold of the nose of the bellows to steady it so that rollo could blow he then directed rollo to lean the bellows over a little towards the smoke so that the moving side should not rub upon the hearth when he began to blow  now he continued if you work the bellows you will see that the smoke will be drawn in through the valve and then will come out through the nose  this experiment succeeded perfectly well only just in the midst of the interest that they felt in seeing the smoke come pouring out through the nose they heard a bell ring at the house they knew at once that this bell was for rollo and nathan and so the two boys jumped up from the hearth and ran out to see what was wanted they went through the shed into the barn and thence on till they came to the great barn door where they had come in there rollo stoppedfor he did not like to go out into the snowand asked dorothy who was ringing the bell what she wanted  wheres nathan said dorothy  hes here with me said rollo nathan was coming along as fast as he could through the barn  do you want us said rollo  no said dorothy only we did not know where you were you may stay half an hour more and then it will be nearly dinner time  dorothy then went in leaving the boys at the great barn door the door opened in such a direction that the wind did not blow in and rollo and nathan looked out for some time watching the falling snow and listening to the wind as it roared through the tops of the trees at last when they began to think of returning to the shop rollo said  o nathan let us go and hide and then jonas will not know where we are  well said nathan we will  the boys accordingly began to look about the barn for a place to hide it was a large barn with stalls for oxen and cows and cribs for horses and one or two calfpens then there was a granary in one corner and a toolroom near it and lofts and scaffolds above the boys found plenty of places to hide in and it took them some time to decide which to choose at last they found a good warm place by some bundles of wheat straw up in the barn chamber and they amused themselves by choosing out large straws and making tubes of them to blow through they called them their bellows  they entirely forgot that they were hid from jonas for nearly half an hour and then rollo proposed that they should creep softly down and see what jonas was about so they went down stairs on tiptoe rollo first and nathan following they crept softly along to the door leading out into the shed through which they had to pass in order to get to the shop and rollo was going to open this softly when to his surprise he found it fastened  why nathan said he this door is fastened  how came it fastened said nathan  i dont know said rollo unless jonas fastened it i think he must have finished his work and gone into the house and so he has fastened this door  and now he wont come and find us said nathan  no said rollo and we must go out the front door and i dont care much he continued for it is pretty near dinner time  the boys then went back to the front door of the barn and to their surprise and alarm found that fastened too  what shall we do said rollo jonas has fastened us in as rollo said this his face assumed an expression of great solicitude and nathan began to cry  dont cry nathan said he we can find some way to get out but i dont see i confess what made jonas lock us in  the truth was that jonas did not know that the boys were in the barn when he fastened it up as they did not come back after they had gone to answer the bell he supposed that they had gone into the house and when he was ready to come in himself he shut and fastened the back doors of the barn as he usually did when he left the shop he then came around to the front barn door and although that was on the sheltered side so that the wind did not blow in he thought it possible that the wind might change and so drive the snow in upon the barn floor and therefore to make all safe he thought that he would shut them too he accordingly shut the great doors and put the fid into the staple the fid is a wooden pin to be passed through the staple when the doors are shut to fasten them the doors cannot be opened again until the fid is taken out  rollo went all around the barn trying to find some place where he could get out but he could not find any place at all  let us go up stairs said he at length to nathan  o it will not do any good to go up stairs said nathan it would kill us to jump out the window  i know we cant jump out the window said rollo but perhaps we can find out some way to get down o there is a ladder i remember now nathan there is a ladder we can get down from the window by the ladder  i shall be afraid to go down the ladder said nathan  o no said rollo i will go first and see if it is safe  by this time they had reached the barn chamber there was a window in it with glass over the great barn door but rollo could not get it open he told nathan that if he could only get it open and could find a long pole he could reach it down and knock the fid out and so open the great doors but with all his efforts he could not raise the window  there was another window which had no glass but was closed by a wooden shutter which opened upon hinges like a door rollo said he meant to open this window now it happened that this window was upon that side of the barn which was exposed to the wind and storm and the moment that rollo had pushed open the shutter a little way the wind forced it instantly from his hand and slammed it back against the side of the barn with great violence it almost pulled rollo himself out of the window  nathan looked frightened rollo himself looked somewhat astonished at such an unexpected effect but presently said  well nathan i rather think that if you had had hold of that shutter you would have thought that air was a real thing  o that was the wind rollo that was the wind said nathan  rollo did not answer but went to the ladder which was standing up against the hayloft it was a pretty long but yet a very light ladder and rollo and nathan succeeded after some difficulty in getting it down and in running the end out of the window when the lower end reached the ground the upper end was two or three feet above the bottom of the window so that rollo could easily get upon it to descend the wind and storm which raged with great violence were somewhat terrifying but he knew that the ladder was secure the upper part being confined in the window and so he resolutely descended when he had fairly reached the ground he looked up with an expression of great satisfaction upon his countenance and said  there now nathan for your turn  but nathan was afraid to venture and rollo himself was half afraid to have him make the attempt while they were standing in this perplexity rollo heard a voice behind him calling out  rollo  rollo turned and saw dorothy standing by the door  what are you doing rollo said dorothy  i am trying to get nathan out of the barn said rollo  how came he in the barn said dorothy  why jonas locked us in and i had to come down the ladder but nathan is afraid and i cant get him out  why dont you go to the door and let him right out  o said rollo laughing i never thought of that go down nathan he continued to the door and i will go round and knock out the fid  so nathan went down and rollo meeting him there knocked out the fid and released him from his imprisonment       questions      what was the first experiment with the bellows described in     this chapter why could not nathan press the two sides of the     bellows together while the nose was stopped what was the     second experiment what was the effect produced by turning the     bellows bottom upwards as in the third experiment what was the     fourth experiment what was the use of the smoke of the paper     how were the experiments interrupted what evidence did rollo     and nathan have that the air was a real substance when in the     barn chamber     chapter v  pressure   one evening just after tea rollo came to his father who was sitting by the side of the fire and said  father i wish we could see the air as we can the water and then perhaps we could try experiments with it  o we can try experiments with the air as it is said his father  can we said rollo i dont see how  we cannot see the air it is true but then we can see its effects and so we can experiment upon it  well at any rate said rollo we cant build a dam and make it spout through a hole like water  no said his father not exactly in your dam for instance when it was full you had water on one side of the board and no water on the other and then by opening a hole in the board the water spouted through but we cannot very well get air on one side of a partition and no air on the other if we could it would spout through very much as the water did  why cant we do that sir said rollo  because replied his father we are all surrounded and enveloped with air it spreads in every direction all around us and rises many miles above us whereas in respect to water you had one little stream before you which you could manage just as you pleased if you were down at the bottom of the sea then the water would be all around you and above you and there even if you could live there you could not have a dam  no sir said rollo the water would be everywhere  yes replied his father and the air is everywhere if however we could get it away from any place as for instance from this room then bore a hole through the wall the weight of the air outside would crowd a portion of it through the hole exactly as the weight of the water above the board in your dam crowded a part through the hole in the board  i wish we could try it said rollo  we can try it in substance said his father in this room orno the china closet will be better  there was a china closet which had two doors in it one door opened into the parlor where rollo and his father were sitting the other door opened into the back part of the entry rollos father explained how he was going to perform the experiment thus  if we could by any means get all the air out of the closet for a moment then the pressure of the air outside would force a jet of it in through the keyholes of the doors and the crevices  and how can we get the air out said rollo  we cant said his father get it all out but we can get a part of it out by shutting the door quick the door will carry with it a part of the air that was in the closet and then the outside air will be spouted in through the keyhole of the other door only we cant see it as we can the water  no said rollo but i can put my hand there and feel it  a better way said his father would be to hold a lamp opposite to the keyhole and see if it blows the flame  rollo tried the experiment in the way his father had described he went into the closet with the lamp he held the lamp opposite to the keyhole and pretty near to it and then he asked nathan to shut the other door suddenly nathan who was standing all ready by the other door which was about half open put his two hands against it and pushed it to with all his strength producing a great concussion  o nathan said his father you need not be quite so violent as that  it succeeded father it succeeded said rollo  im glad it succeeded said his father but nathan need not have shut the door with so much force  i wanted to drive out all the air said nathan  ill show you how to do it said his father  rollos father accordingly arose and came to the closet door he opened the door wide and then explained to the boys that the beginning of the movement of the door when it was wide open did not drive out any air  for said he there is so large a space between the edge of the door and the wall that the air that is put in motion by the movement of the door can pass directly round the edge back into the closet again it is only when the door is almost shut when the edge of it comes close to the casing all around that the movement of the door drives the air out  then he took hold of the latch of the door and put it almost to very gently he turned the latch so as to prevent its snapping against the catch and then pushed it suddenly into its place three or four times opening the door only a very little way every time  now said he hold the lamp at the keyhole and watch the flame while i shut the door two or three times in this way  rollo did so nathan standing all the time by his side they observed that the flame of the lamp was driven into the room every time the door was shut proving that every time a little of the air was driven out by the door a little puff rushed in at the keyhole  let us stop up the keyhole said rollo and then it cant get in  yes said his father there are a great many little crevices all around the closet where the air can come in  couldnt we stop those up too said rollo  no said his father not so as to make the closet airtight for if the crevices could all be stopped exactly the air would come in through the very wood itself  how said rollo  why there are little pores in wood that is little channels that the sap flowed in when the wood was growing and the air can pass through these  here rollos father observed that rollo was looking very intently at the table and he asked him what he was doing he said he was trying to find some of the pores  you cant see them there said his father st domingo mahogany is a very hard and closegrained kind of wood if it was summer and you could dig down and get a small piece of the root of the great elmtree in the yard you could see the pores and channels there  after some more conversation on this subject rollo asked his father if he could not think of some other experiments for them to try his father said that he did not just then think of any experiment but that if rollo and nathan would come and sit down by the fire he would give them some information on the subject rollos mother said that she should like to hear too they accordingly waited until she was ready and then when all were seated mr holiday began thus  air is in many respects much like water  yes interrupted rollo just like water only thinner because you see  you must not interrupt me said his father unless to ask some question which is necessary to understand what i say it is entirely irregular for a pupil instead of listening to his teacher to interrupt in order to tell something that he knows himself  rollos father smiled as he said this but rollo looked rather ashamed then his father proceeded  there is one very remarkable difference between them water is not compressible by force but air is  what is the meaning of compressible said nathan  compressible things said his father are those that can be compressed that is pressed together so as to take up less room than they did before sponge is compressible a pillow is compressible but iron is not compressible and water is not compressible  i should think it was said nathan it is very soft  it is very yielding replied his father when you press it but it is not pressed into any smaller space it only moves away if you have a tumbler half full of water and press a ball down into it you could not crowd the water into any smaller space than it occupied at first but as fast as the ball went down the water would come up around the sides of the ball  but suppose said rollo that the ball was just big enough to fit the tumbler all around then the water could not come up  and then said his father you could not crowd the ball down  could not a very strong man said nathan  no replied his father the water cannot be sensibly compressed but now if the tumbler contained only air and if a ball were to be put in at the top just large enough to fit the tumbler exactly and if a strong man were to crowd it down with all his strength he would perhaps compress the air into half the space which it occupied before  perhaps the tumbler would break said nathan  yes replied his father and the tumbler will answer only for a supposition but for a real experiment it would be best to have a cylinder of iron  what is a cylinder said nathan  an iron vessel shaped like a tumbler only as large at the bottom as it is at the top would be a cylinder now if there was a cylinder of iron with the inside turned perfectly true and a brass piston fitted to it  what is a piston said nathan  a piston said his father is a sort of stopper exactly fitted to the inside of a cylinder so as to slide up and down it is made to fit perfectly and then it is oiled so as to go up and down without much friction that is hard rubbing there is a sort of stem coming up from the middle of the piston called the piston rod which is to draw up the piston and to press it down by  now continued his father if a strong man had a cylinder like this with a piston fitted to it and a strong handle across the top of the piston rod perhaps he might press the air into one half the space which it occupied before that is if the cylinder was full of air when he put the piston in perhaps he could get the piston down half way to the bottom then the air would be twice as dense as it was before that is there would be twice as much of it in the same space as there was before it would be twice as compact and heavy this is called condensing air the philosophers have ingenious instruments for condensing air  if however a man condenses air in this way by crowding down a piston he does not begin the condensation when the piston begins to descend the air is condensed a great deal before he begins all the air around us is condensed  how comes it condensed said rollo  why you recollect that when you bored a hole through the board in the bottom of your dam the water spouted out  no father said rollo we pulled the plug out jonas bored the hole  well said his father the water spouted out  yes said rollo  what made it said his father  why the water above it was heavy and pressed down upon it and crowded it out through the hole  yes said his father and the deeper the water the more heavily it was pressed  yes sir said rollo and the farther it spouted  because it was pressed down by the load of such a high column of water  yes sir said rollo  well replied his father it is just so with the air the air all around us is pressed down by the load of all that is above us we are in fact down at the bottom of a great ocean of air and the air here is loaded down very heavy  how heavy said rollo  o very heavy indeed said his father  why air is pretty light said rollo  yes replied his father but then the column of it is very high  how high said rollo  why between thirty and forty miles but it grows thinner and thinner towards the top so it is not as heavy by any means as a column of air would be thirty miles high and as dense all the way up as it is here  what makes it grow thinner and thinner towards the top said rollo  because said his father that which is near the top has not as much load of air above it to press it down  and that which is at the top said rollo has none above it to press it down  no replied his father  and how thin is it there  nobody knows said his father  what nobody at all said nathan  no i believe not at least i do not and i dont know that any body does  how do they know then how high it is said rollo  the philosophers have calculated in some way or other though i dont exactly know how i believe they have ascertained how great the pressure of the air is here at the surface of the earth and have calculated in some way from that how high the air must be to produce such a pressure  and how high must it be said nathan  why between thirty and forty miles said rollo father told us once  and yet continued his father water thirty or forty feet deep would produce as great a pressure as a column of air of thirty or forty miles that is the air around presses about as heavily and would force a jet of air through a hole with about as much force as water would coming out at the bottom of a dam as high as a common threestory house  these explanations were all very interesting to rollo and to his mother but nathan found it rather hard to understand them all and he began to be somewhat restless and uneasy at length he said  and now father havent you almost done telling about the air  why yes said his father i have told you enough for this time only you must remember it all  i dont think i can remember it quite all said nathan  well then remember the general principle at any rate said his father which is thisthat we live at the bottom of a vast ocean of air and that the lower portions of this air are pressed down by the load of all the air above that being so pressed the lower air is condensedso that we live in the midst of air that is pressed down and condensed by the load of all that is above it and that consequently whenever the air is taken away even in part from any place as you removed some of it from the china closet the pressure upon the air outside forces the air in through every opening it can find  i think that is a little too much for me to remember said nathan  nathans father and mother laughed on hearing this though nathan did not know what they were laughing at his father told him that he could not expect him to remember all and that to pay him for his particular attention he would tell him a story  so he took nathan up in his lap and told him a very curious story of a boy who went about the yard with a little dog upon one of his shoulders a cat upon the other and a squirrel on his head the squirrel was tame       questions      why cannot experiments be performed upon the pressure of air as     conveniently as upon the pressure of water how did rollos     father contrive to remove a part of the air from the china     closet where did they expect that the air would be forced into     the closet how were they to make this effect visible did the     experiment succeed suppose the keyhole had been stopped up     where would the air have been forced in suppose all the     crevices had been closed is water compressible is air     compressible what is the shape of a cylinder what is a piston     how might air be compressed by means of a cylinder and piston     what was the general principle which rollos father stated in     conclusion     chapter vi  ballooning   the next evening rollo and nathan had another conversation with their father respecting air when they were all seated he commenced as follows  i told you yesterday that air may be compressed by force while water cannot be it has another property which is in some respects the reverse of this it springs back into its original bulk when the pressure is removed  how said nathan i dont exactly understand you  why you remember what i said about the experiment with the iron cylinder and a piston to fit it  yes sir said rollo  what was the experiment said his father  why if a man were to press the piston down hard he could crowd the air all into the lower half of the cylinder  yes replied his father now the property i am going to tell you about this evening is thisthat if the man lets go of the piston rod the air that is condensed into the bottom of the cylinder will spring up and force the piston up again this property is called elasticity it is sometimes called the expansive force of the air for it is a force tending to expand the air that is to swell it out into its original dimensions this is another great difference between air and water  now as all the air around us continued rollos father is pressed down very heavily and is condensed a great deal it is all the time endeavoring to expand and it would expand were it not that the great burden of the air above it keeps it condensed but water is not compressed and has no tendency to expand the water of rollos dam for instance had all the weight of the atmosphere resting upon it but it did not compress it at all and so it did not tend to expand  and now said his father i cannot perform any experiment to show you that air tends strongly to expand or swell out into a great space while water does not but i can make a supposition which will illustrate it suppose we had a large but very thin glass bottle filled with water and put down upon the floor in the middle of this room suppose also that we had another bottle of the same size and shape filled with air and we put that down upon the floor by the side of the other both bottles being stopped very tight now if we could by any means suddenly take away all the air from the room so that there should be nothing around the bottles then the bottle of water would remain just as it is for the glass would have nothing to support but the weight of the water and it would be strong enough for that but the bottle of air would fly all to pieces for that would not rest quietly like the water satisfied with the space which it already has and only pressing with its own weight upon the sides of the glass but it would immediately expand with so much force as to break the thin glass all to pieces  would it exclaimed rollo and nathan together and would it make a loud noise  yes replied their father i presume it would make a loud explosion that is if the air in the room around it could by any means be all at once and suddenly removed  and so you must remember he continued that there are two very remarkable differences between air and water air may be condensed by pressure and as it exists all around us is greatly condensed by the pressure of the air above and it may be compressed more and air is expansive while water is not whenever the pressure upon it is removed it suddenly expands or spreads out in all directions  o dear me said nathan with a sigh  what is the matter said his father  why i cant understand it very well  cant you said his father well i must admit that you are rather too young to study pneumatics  pneumatics repeated rollo  yes said his father that is the name of this science  illustration then it sailed slowly awaypage 85  what the science of air said rollo  yes said his father the science which treats of air and of all other compressible and expansive fluids but let me think i must try to tell you something which nathan can understand and be interested in if i had a very light feather i could let him perform an experiment  would a little down do said rollos mother  yes replied his father that would be better than a feather  mrs holiday then went and brought a little down and handed it to rollos father now there was a lamp upon the table of a peculiar kind called a study lamp it had a glass tube called a chimney around the wick and consequently around the flame itself being round like a ring  rollos father told nathan to hold the down over the top of this glass chimney and then to let it go  nathan did so the little tuft of down was wafted up into the air quite high above the lamp and then it sailed slowly away and fell down upon the table  i know what makes it rise said rollo it is the heat the heat makes it rise  do you think so said his father then take the down and lay it gently upon the hearth before the fire as near as you can  rollo did so he had to take his hand away very quick for it was quite hot there the little tuft remained quietly upon the hearth where he placed it  there said his father is not that a hotter place than it was over the lamp  yes sir said rollo  then if it was heat that made it rise why does not it rise now  rollo could not tell  i will tell you how it was said his father heat makes air more expansive when air is heated it swells when it is cool it shrinks again now if it swells it becomes lighter and so it is buoyed up by the heavier air around it just as wood at the bottom of the sea would be buoyed up and would rise to the surface of the water now the heat of the lamp heats the air that is in the glass chimney and swells it this makes it lighter and so the air around it which is heavier buoys it up and it carries up the feather with it  no the down father said nathan  yes the down said his father  then it seems to me after all said rollo that it is the heat which makes it rise  yes said his father it does indirectly it expands the air that makes it lighter then the heavy air around it buoys it up and when it goes up it carries up the down so that it is not strictly correct to say that the heat carries it up the heat sets in operation a train of causes and effects the last of which results in carrying up the feather  now continued his father there is always a stream of air going up wherever there is a lamp or a fire or heat which heats the air in any way the expanded air from a fire goes up chimney the cool and heavy air in the room and out of doors crowds it up  the air out of doors said rollo how can that crowd it up  why it presses in through all the crevices and openings all around the room and crowds the light air up the chimney all the smoke is carried up too with it and it comes pouring out at the top of the chimney all the time  you can see that the air presses in at all these crevices continued rollos father by experiment  what experiment is it said rollo let us try it  i will let nathan try it said his father and you may go with him and see the effect first he continued you see by the smoke that the air really goes up the chimney and i will show you that other air really crowds into the space from other parts of the room  so he took a lamp from the tablenot the study lamp it was a common lampand held it at various places in the opening of the fireplace by the jambs and near the upper part and rollo and nathan saw that the flame in all cases was turned in towards the chimney  yes said rollo i see it is drawn in  no said his father strictly speaking it is not drawn in it is pressed in by the cool and heavy air of the room  i thought said rollos mother that the chimney drew the air from the room into it  that is what is generally said replied mr holiday but it is not strictly true the common idea is that the hot air rises in the chimney and so draws the air from the room to supply its place but this is not so in the first place nothing can rise unless it is forced up the lightest things have some weight and would if left to themselves fall the hottest and lightest air in a chimney would fall to the earth if there was no cooler and heavier air around it to force it to risejust as the lightest cork which would rise very quick from the bottom of the sea would fall back again very quick if the water was not there  remember then nathan and rollo that when a fire is built in a fireplace so as to warm the air in the chimney it makes this air not so heavy and then the cool air all around it in the room and out of doors presses in and crowds under the light air and makes it ascend  but father said nathan you said i might perform an experiment  very well i am ready now take the lamp and carry it around the room and hold it opposite any little opening you can find  i cant find any little openings said nathan  o yes said his father the keyhole of the door is a little opening and there is a narrow crevice all around the door and you will find little crevices around the windows now hold the lamp opposite any of these and you will see that the air presses in  so nathan went with the lamp rollo following him and held the lamp opposite to the keyhole and the crevices around the door and windows only when he came to the window his father told him to be very careful not to set the curtain on fire  rollo wanted nathan to let him try it once and so nathan gave him the lamp he said he meant to make a crevice and so he pushed up the window a very little way and held the lamp opposite to the opening the air pressed the flame in towards the room in all cases  people commonly say that it is drawn in said his father but that is not strictly correct it is really pressed in there is no power of attraction in the air that is in the room to draw in the air that is out of doors through the crevices but the air that is out of doors is so heavy that it presses in and crowds the warm and light air up the chimney  and now said his father i cannot tell you anything more this evening but if you remember this i will give you some further instruction another time  well sir said nathan only i wish you would tell me a little story as you did last evening have not i been still  his father had noticed that he had been very still and attentive but did not think before that it was in expectation of being rewarded with a story  well said his father i will tell you a story or give you a little advice how should you like a little advice  well father a little advice just which you please  i advise you thenlet me seewhat shall i advise youno on the whole i will tell you a story once there was a man and he was a philosopher he understood all that i have been explaining to you about the air being light when it was hot so he got some very thin paper and made a large paper bag he cut the paper very curiously and pasted it together at the edges in such a way that the bag when it was done was round like a ball and it had a round opening at the bottom of it in fact it was a large paper ball  how large was it said nathan  it was so large that when it was swelled out full it would have been higher than your head  o what a large ball said nathan but what was it for  why the man thought as hot air is lighter than cool air and floats up that perhaps if he could fill his paper ball with hot air it would go up too  and did it said nathan  yes said his father he filled it with hot air and the hot air was so light that it rose up and carried the paper ball with it  how did he get the hot air into it said rollo  why he held it over a little fire with the mouth down then the hot air from the fire went up into the ball and swelled it out full  how high did it go said nathan  o it soared away said his father away up into the air very high until at length it got cool and then it came down  i should like to see such a ball as that said nathan  such a ball as that is called a balloon said his father  i wish i could see a balloon said nathan       questions      what is the important difference between air and water which     was explained in the last chapter and mentioned in this does     the air tend to expand again after it is compressed what is     this property of the air called is the air around us already     condensed or is it in its natural state what causes it to be     condensed suppose a thin glass vessel were to be filled with     air and another with water and the air suddenly removed from     the room around them what would be the effects what effect     does heat have upon the expansibility of air how may this     effect be made to appear over a lamp in a chimney what was the     story which rollos father told nathan     chapter vii  philosophical discussion   some time after this rollo and nathan and james were playing in the shed one pleasant morning in the spring they were building with sticks of wood which they piled in various ways so as to make houses they took care not to pile the wood in any case higher than their shoulders for jonas had told them that if they piled the wood higher than that there would be danger of its falling down upon them  after some time rollo went into the house a few minutes and james and nathan went to the open part of the shed and began to look out of doors the sun was shining pleasantly but the ground was wet being covered with streams and pools of water and melting snowbanks  what a pleasant day said james i wish it was dry so that we could go out better  i wish we could fly said nathan for it is very pleasant up in the air  i wish we had a balloon said james if we had a balloon we could go up in the air easier than to fly  o james said nathan you could not get into a balloon if you had one  why not said james  because said nathan it would not be big enough  why nathan said james a balloon is bigger than this house  o james it is not higher than my head  it is said james i know it is i have read about balloons bigger than a house  and my father said nathan putting down his foot in a very positive air my father told me himself that a balloon was about as high as my head  the boys disputed some time longer upon the subject and finally when rollo came out of the house they both appealed to him very eagerly to settle the dispute  isnt a balloon higher than nathans head said james  is it as high as a house said nathan  why i know said rollo that a man made a balloon once about as high as nathans head because my father said so but perhaps it was a little one  yes said james i know it must be a little one for balloons are big enough for men to go up in them  o james said nathan i dont believe it besides the fire would burn em  what fire said james  the fire they burn under the balloons to make the air hot said nathan  i dont believe they have any fire said james  just then nathan happening to look around saw jonas standing behind them he had just come out of the house and was going out to his work hearing the boys engaged in this dispute he stopped to listen the boys both appealed to jonas  jonas heard all that they had to say and then replied  i cannot tell you much about going up in a balloon but i can tell you something about getting along pleasantly down here upon the earth which i think may be of service to you  what is it said james  why that you will neither of you get along very pleasantly until you can bear to have any body else mistaken without contradicting them james you think nathan is mistaken about the size of a balloon do you  yes i know he is said james  well said jonas now why not let him remain mistaken  whyi dont know said james  he isnt willing to be convinced is he that a balloon is as big as a house  no said james he is not  then why dont you let him remain unconvinced why should you insist on setting him right when he dont want to be set right  and you nathan suppose that james is mistaken in thinking that the balloon is so big  yes said nathan and that men can get into it and go up in the air  well now if he wants to believe that balloons are so big why are you not willing that he should why should you insist upon it that he should know that they are smaller  because i know said nathan very positively that they are small and besides the paper would not be strong enough to bear a man  i did not ask you said jonas why you believed that men could not go up in balloons but why you were so anxious to make james believe so why not let him be mistaken  whybecause said nathan  you see nathan continued jonas the world is full of people that are continually mistaken and if you go about trying to set them all right by disputing them youll have a hard row to hoe  a hard what said nathan  a hard row to hoe repeated jonas its never of any service to attempt to convince people that dont want to be convinced especially if they are wrong  especially if they are wrong repeated rollo in astonishment  yes replied jonas the very worst time to argue with a boy is when he is wrong and does not want to be set right it is a great deal harder to get along in argument with one who is right than with one who is wrong for the one who is wrong disputes the one who is right reasons  well jonas said james which of us was disputing  both of you said jonas  both of us said james but you said that only the one who was wrong disputed  well replied jonas you were both wrong  both wrong o jonas said james  yes both wrong replied jonas and so saying he was going away to his work  but stop a minute longer said james and tell us how it is about the balloon we want to know  o no said jonas you dont want to know you want to conquer  what do you mean by that said nathan  why you dont really wish to learn any thing but you want to have me decide the case because each of you hopes that i shall decide in his favor you want the pleasure of a victory not the pleasure of acquiring knowledge  no jonas said nathan we do really want to know  well said jonas i cant stop now to tell you perhaps i will this evening but i advise you always after this not to contradict people and dispute with them when they say things that you dont believe do as the gentleman did when the man said the moon was a fire  what did he do said rollo  why he let him say it as much as he wanted to  tell us all about it said james  well then said jonas once there was a man and he saw the moon coming up behind the trees and thought it was a large house burning up he went along a little way and he met a vulgar fellow riding in a carriage  riding in a carriage repeated rollo astonished  yes said jonas handsomely dressed sir said the man see that great fire  it isnt a fire you fool said the vulgar fellow its nothing but the moon  the moon no it isnt said the man it is a monstrous great fire dont you see how it blazes up  it is not a fire i tell you said the vulgar fellow  i tell you tis said the man  you dont know any thing about it said the vulgar fellow  and you dont know the moon from a house on fire said the man and so passed on  a minute or two after this he met a gentleman driving a team  a gentleman driving a team said james  yes said jonas with a frock on he was tired and weary having driven all day the man asked him if he did not see that house on fire  ah said the gentleman i thought it was the moon  no said the man it is a house on fire  well said the gentleman i am very sorry if it is i hope theyll be able to put it out  so saying he started his team along and bade the man good evening  jonas then having finished his story stepped out of the shed and went along towards the barn nathan called out after him to say  well jonas i dont understand how the gentleman came to be driving a team all day  jonas did not reply to this but only began to laugh heartily and to walk on nathan turned back into the shed saying he did not see what jonas was laughing at  the boys wanted very much to have the question about the balloon settled and after some further conversation on the subject they concluded to go in and ask their mother so they all three went in rollo proposed this plan and he led the way into the house he found his mother sitting in the parlor at her work  well boys said she have you got tired of your play  no mother said rollo but we want to know about balloons how big are they  o some of them said she are very large  aint they as big as this house said james  yes i believe they have been made as big said she  but mother said nathan father told me his very self that they were no higher than my head  o no said his mother he said that a man made one which was about as high as your head but that was only a little one for experiment when they make large ones for use they are as high as this house  for use mother what use said nathan  men go up in them dont they aunt said james  not in them exactly said his aunt they could not live in them but they go up by means of them  how said nathan  why they have a kind of basket which hangs down below the balloon and they get into that  i knew they could not get into the balloon said nathan  then you have had a dispute about it said his mother  whyyes said nathan with hesitation we disputed a little  i am sorry to hear that said his mother for disputing seldom does any good the fact is however that men have often been carried up by balloons but they never get into them they could not live in them they could not breathe the kind of air which balloons are filled with  it is hot air said nathan  no said his mother the kind of balloon which your father told you of was filled with hot air but the balloons which people generally use to go up with are filled with another kind of air which is very light when it is cool they make an enormous bag of silk and fill it with this light air which they make in barrels and then when the bag is filled it floats away above their heads and pulls hard upon the fastening there is a net all over it and the ends of the net are drawn together below and are fastened to the basket or car where the man is to sit when it is all ready the man gets into the car and then they let go the fastenings and away the great bag goes and carries the man with it away up into the air  and then how does he get down said nathan  why he can open a hole in the bag and let some of the light air out and then he begins to come down slowly if he comes down too fast or if he finds that he is coming into the water or down upon any dangerous place there is a way by which he can make his balloon go up again  what way is it aunt said james  why he has some bags of sand in his balloon said his aunt and the balloon is made large enough to carry him and his sandbags too then if he finds that he is coming down too fast he just pours out some of his sand and that makes his car lighter and so the balloon will carry him up again  thats a good plan said rollo  yes said his mother the reason why he takes sand is because that will not hurt any body by falling upon them if he should take stones or any other heavy solid things and should drop them out of his car they might possibly fall upon some body and hurt them so he takes sand in bags and when he wants to lighten his balloon he just pours the sand out  rollos mother then told the boys that there was a large book which had several stories in it of mens going up in balloons and that she would get it for them so she left her work and went out of the room but in a few minutes she returned bringing with her two very large square books with blue covers one of them had pictures in it and among the rest there were pictures of balloons she opened the other book and found the place where there was an account of balloons and she showed the place to rollo  she told the boys that they had better go out in the kitchen or into the shed if it was warm enough and read the account  you and james rollo said she can read by turns and let nathan hear then when the plates are referred to you must look into the other book and find them  yes said rollo we will only mother if you would let us sit down here and read itand then if there is any thing which we cannot understand you can tell us what it means  very well replied his mother you may sit down here upon the sofa  so the boys sat down upon the sofa they put nathan between them so that he might look over rollo and james took turns to read and they continued reading about balloons for more than an hour there was one story of a sheep which a man carried up in his car under a balloon and then let him drop from a great height with a parachute over his head to make him fall gently and he did fall gently he came down to the ground without being hurt at all       questions      how was the subject of balloons introduced into the     conversation what was nathans opinion about the possibility of     being carried up by a balloon what was the dispute about the     size of balloons what was nathans evidence what was jamess     evidence what did jonas say when they appealed to him what was     the story that he related which of the boys did he finally say     was wrong whom did the boys appeal to afterwards what did     rollos mother say about the size of balloons how did she say     that large balloons were filled how can they make the balloon     come down how can they make it go up again if they wish to do     so     chapter viii  tasks   a few days after this there commenced a long storm of rain rollo and nathan were glad to see it on one account for their mother told them it would melt away the snow and bring on the spring the first day they amused themselves pretty well during their play hours in the shed and in the garret but on the second day they began to be tired nathan came two or three times to his mother to ask her what he should do and rollo himself though being older his resources might naturally be expected to be greater seemed to be out of employment  at last their mother proposed that they should come and sit down by her and she would tell them something more about the air how should you like that rollo said she  why pretty well said rollo but he spoke in an indifferent and hesitating manner which showed that he did not feel much interest in his mothers proposal  i cant understand very well about the air said nathan  their mother finding that the boys did not wish much to hear any conversation about the air said nothing more about it just then and rollo and nathan got some books and began to read but somehow or other they did not find the books very interesting and rollo after reading a little while put down his book and went to the window saying that he wished it would stop raining nathan followed him and they both looked out of the window with a weary and disconsolate air  their mother looked at them and then said to herself they have not energy and decision enough to set themselves about something useful and in fact i ought not to expect that they should have i must supply the want by my energy and decision  then she said aloud to rollo and nathan  i want you boys to go up into the garret and under the skylight you will see a large box open this box and you will find it filled with feathers select from these feathers three or four which are the most downy and soft about the stem and bring them down to me  what are they for said rollo  i will tell you replied his mother when you have brought them to me  so rollo and nathan went up into the garret and brought the feathers they carried them to their mother she said that they would answer very well and she laid them gently down upon the table  then she took up her scissors and began to cut off some of the lightest down saying at the same time  now children i am going to give you some writing to do about the air  writing said rollo  yes said his mother i am going to explain to you something about the air and then you must write down what i tell you  but i cant write said nathan  no said his mother but you can tell rollo what you would wish to say and he will write it for you  why mother said rollo i dont think that that will be very good play  no replied his mother i dont give it to you for play it will be quite hard work i hope you will take hold of it energetically and do it well  first said she i am going to perform some experiments for you before i tell you what i want you to write  by this time she had cut off the downy part of several feathers and had laid them together in a little heap then she took a fine thread and tied this little tuft of down to the end of it then she took up the thread by the other end and handed it to rollo  there rollo said she now do you remember what your father told you the other day about the effect of heat upon air  it makes it light said rollo  and why does it make it light asked his mother  why i dont exactly recollect said rollo  because it swells it it makes it expand so that the same quantity of air spreads over a greater space and this makes it lighter but cool or cold air is heavier because it is more condensed  now wherever there is heat continued his mother the air is made lighter and the cool and heavy air around presses in under it and buoys it up this produces currents of air you recollect dont you that your father explained all this to you the other day  yes said rollo i remember it  well said his mother now you and nathan may take this little tuft and carry it about to various places and hold it up by its thread and it will show you the way the air is moving and then you may come to me and i will explain to you why it moves that way  well said rollo come nathan let us go first we will hold it at the keyhole of the door  rollo held the end of the thread up opposite to the door in such a way that the tuft was exactly before the keyhole the tuft was at once blown out into the room  o see nathan how it blows out the air is coming in through the keyhole  yes said his mother when there is a fire in the room and none in the entry then the cold air in the entry runs down through the keyhole into the room  it dont run down mother said rollo it blows right in straight  perhaps i ought to have said it spouts in said his mother just as the water did from the hole in your dam and now she continued come and hold the tuft near the chimney  rollo did so and he found that it was carried in proving as their father had showed them before that the heavy cold air pressing into the room crowded the warm light air up the chimney  now should you think said their mother that the cold air could come in through the keyhole as fast as it goes up the chimney  both rollo and nathan thought that it could not  then go all around the room said she and see if you can find any other place where it comes in for it is plain you see that the light air cannot be driven up chimney any faster than cold and heavy air comes in to drive it up and take its place  so rollo and nathan went around the room holding their tuft at all the places they could find where they supposed there could be openings for the cold air to press in they found currents coming in around the windows and by the hinges of the doors and at length rollo said he meant to open the window a little way and see if the cold air from out of doors would not press in there too he did so and the tuft was blown in very far showing that the cold air from out of doors pressed in very strongly  now if all these openings were to be stopped said their mother then no cold air could crowd into the room and of course the hot air could not be buoyed up into the chimney and a great deal of the hot air and smoke would come into the room this very often happens when houses are first built and the rooms are very tight  but now rollo she continued suppose that the door was opened wide then should not you think that more cold and heavy air would press in than could go up the chimney  yes mother a great deal more said rollo  try it said his mother  so rollo opened the door and held his tuft in the passageway and he found that the air was pressing in very strongly through the open space wherever he held it it was blown into the room a great deal showing that the heavy air pressed in in a torrent  now as much warm air must go out said she as there is cold air coming in but i dont believe that you and rollo can find out where it goes out  rollo looked all around the room but he could not see any opening except the chimney and the door and the little crevices which he had observed about the finishing of the room he said he could not find any place  his mother then told him to hold his tuft down near the bottom of the doorway he did so and found that the current of air was there very strong the tuft swung into the room very far  now hold it up a little higher said his mother  rollo obeyed and he found that it was still pressed in but not so hard  higher said his mother  rollo raised it as high as he could reach the thread was of such a length that the tuft hung about opposite to his shoulder the tuft was still pressed in but not nearly as far as before  so you see said his mother that the air pours in the fastest at the lowest point where the weight and pressure of the air above it are the greatest just as in your dam the water from the lowest holes spouted out the farthest  yes said rollo it is very much like that  now continued his mother you see that a great deal of air comes in and if you look up chimney you will see that there is scarcely room for so much to go up thereand yet just as much must go out as comes in  get the stepladder said his mother and stand up upon it and so hold your tuft in the upper part of the doorway  there was in the china closet a small piece of furniture very convenient about a house called a stepladder it consisted of two wooden steps and was made and kept there to stand upon in order to reach the high shelves rollo brought out the stepladder and placed it in the doorway and then ascended it from the top he could reach nearly to the top of the door but then as his tuft was at the end of the thread it hung down of course some little distance below his head  why mother said rollo it goes out  yes repeated nathan it goes out  in fact rollo found that the tuft instead of swinging into the room was carried out towards the entry  you have found out then said his mother where the hot air of the room goes to to make room for the cold air that comes in from the entry  yes out into the entry said rollo  through the upper part of the door said his mother suppose the entry were full of water and the parlor full of air and the door was shut and the door and the walls were watertight now if you were to open the door you see that the water being heavier would flow in through the lower part of the doorway into the parlor and the air from the parlor would flow out through the upper part of the doorway into the entry the water would settle down in the entry until it was level in both rooms and then the lower parts of both rooms would be filled with water and the upper parts with air  yes mother said rollo  and it is just so with warm and cold air if the parlor is filled with warm air made so by the fire and the entry with cold air and you open the door then the cold air being heavier will sink down and spread over the floor of both rooms and the warm air being light will spread around over the upper parts of both rooms and this will make a current of air in at the bottom of the doorway and out at the top  now continued his mother let me recapitulate what i have taught you  what do you mean by recapitulating it said nathan  why tell you the substance of it so that you can write it down easier  o i can write it now said rollo i remember it all  can you remember it nathan said his mother  perhaps i can remember some of it said nathan  so rollo and nathan went out into another room where rollo kept his desk and they remained there half an hour when they returned they brought their mother two papers  their mother opened the largest paper and read as follows      we took a tuft of down tied to a thread and held it in the     cracks and places that the air came in at to see which way it     went we held it at the window and it blew in very strong at     the bottom of the door it blew in very strong too but at the     top it blew out into the entry so when the entry is full     of cold air and this room full of warm the cold air will press     in and drive out some of the warm air into the entry            rollo  the other paper was also in rollos handwriting and was as follows      if the entry was full of water and the parlor full of air and     the walls were watertight and you were to open the door     between the two rooms the water would flow into the parlor down     below and the air would flow into the entry up above we tried     it with a tuft            nathan       questions      why were rollo and nathan at first glad to see the rain what     did their mother say to herself on the second day when she     observed their weary and listless appearance what did she at     first direct them to do how did she prepare the downy tuft     what experiments did they perform with it where did they find     that the air came in which crowded the warm air up the chimney     what experiments did they perform when the door was opened     which way did they find that the current of air was setting at     the lower part of the doorway which way did the current set at     the upper part of the doorway what did rollo write in his     exercise what was written in nathans exercise     chapter ix  burning   after the snow had all gone off and the ground was dry jonas piled up a heap of stumps roots and decayed logs in a field not far from the brook and one sunny afternoon he and rollo went down to set the heaps on fire  jonas set one on fire and then he told rollo that he might set another on fire after this jonas employed himself in gathering up sticks bushes roots and other such things that lay scattered about the field and putting them upon the fires while rollo amused himself in any way he pleased  after a time rollo found on the margin of the field near the edge of a wood an old stump taller than he was much decayed there was a hole in the top rollo climbed up so that he could put a stick in and run it down to see how far down the hole extended he found that it extended down very near to the bottom  then rollo called out to jonas with a loud voice saying  jonas i have found a hollow stump here it is hollow away down to the bottom may i build a fire in it  yes said jonas if you can  rollo accordingly went to the nearest fire and got a quantity of birch bark which he had collected there to aid him in kindling his fires he lighted one piece and put it upon the end of a stick and carried it to the stump with the rest of the birch bark in the other hand  rollo then spent some time in fruitless attempts to make some lighted birch bark go down into the stump and burn there he succeeded very well in getting pieces completely on fire but after they were dropped into the hole they would not burn rollo could not think what the reason could be  at last he called jonas to come and help him set the stump on fire  jonas said that he did not think that it could be set on fire  illustration jonas i have found a hollow stump here said rollo calling with a loud voicepage 122  why not said rollo  because said jonas it is so wet  yes but jonas replied rollo your brush heaps burn and why should not this stump  because said jonas the stump is more solid and the water soaks into it more in the winter and early in the spring and it takes it much longer to dry than it does brush and small roots which lie open and exposed to the air  well then replied rollo why does not my birch bark burn that is dry but as soon as i drop it down into the stump it goes out  jonas looked into the stump and down around the bottom of it and said  because there is no air  no air repeated rollo  no replied jonas it is all close and solid around the air cannot get in  it can get in at the top said rollo  jonas made no reply to this remark but walked away a few steps to a place where he had put down his axe he took up the axe and brought it to the stump he immediately began to cut into it at the bottom as if it were a tree which he was going to fell  o jonas said rollo dont cut it down  i am not going to cut it down said jonas i am only going to cut a hole into it  what for asked rollo  to let the air in replied jonas  jonas continued to cut into the side of the stump near the ground until he perceived that the edge of his axe went through into the hollow part then he cleared away the chips a little and showed rollo that there was an opening for the air  now said he i presume you will be able to make sticks and birch bark burn in the stump though you cant make the stump itself burn very well  rollo now dropped a blazing piece of birch bark into the stump and to his great joy he found that it continued blazing after it reached the bottom he then dropped in another piece upon it which took fire he then gathered some dry sticks and put in and finding that the flame was increasing he proceeded to gather all the dry and combustible matter which he could find around and put them in so that in a short time he had a fine blaze a foot above the top of the stump and the inside of the stump itself seemed to be in flames  jonas said rollo it does burn  does it said jonas i am glad to hear it  but you said the stump would not burn  you ought to wait until it is all burnt up before you triumph over me  why jonas said rollo i didnt mean to triumph over you but why would not the fire burn before you cut the hole through  because replied jonas there was not air enough  there was air in the stump said rollo  yes replied jonas but all the life of it was consumed by the first piece of birch bark which you put in  the life of it said rollo  yes replied jonas what do you suppose it is that makes anything burn  why it burns itself said rollo  no answered jonas the air makes it burn it must have good air around it or else it wont burn there is something in the air which i call the life of it this makes the fire burn but when this is all gone then that air will not make fire burn any longer it will only burn in good fresh air which has got the life in it  i thought fire would burn in any kind of air said rollo  no replied jonas you can see if you stop up the hole i made here  jonas then took a piece of turf from the field and put it before the hole and crowded it in hard with the heel of his boot rollo observed that the fire was almost immediately deadened  now continued jonas light a small piece of birch bark and put it in  jonas helped rollo fasten a small piece of bark upon the end of a stick and then rollo set it on fire and held it down a little way into the stump it burned very feebly  see said jonas how quick it is stifled  yes replied rollo it goes out almost directly  you see said jonas that the fire already in the stump consumes all the goodness of the air and i stopped up the hole so that no fresh air can come in  why doesnt it go in at the top said rollo  it does a little said jonas but not much because the hollow of the stump is already full of bad air and there is nothing to make a current when there is an opening below then there is a current up through  yes said rollo it is just like a chimney  yes replied jonas the stump is the chimney and the hole is the fireplace  and the air in the stump said rollo gets hot and so the cold air all around is heavier and so it crowds down under it and buoys the hot air up out of the stump my father explained it all to nathan and me  rollo then wanted to open the hole again to see if the effect would be as he had described  then jonas pulled away the turf from the hole at the bottom of the stump and rollo observed that the fire brightened up immediately  he then held a smoking brand near the hole and he saw that the smoke was carried in in a very strong current by the cool air which was pressing into the hole  yes said rollo it operates just like a fireplace  so you see continued jonas that whenever you build a fire you must see to it that there is an opening for air to come up from underneath it and it must be good fresh air too  what is it in the air which makes the fire burn said rollo  i dont know what the name of it is said jonas it is some part of the air which goes into the fire and is all consumed and then the rest of the air is good for nothing  isnt it good for anything at all asked rollo  i dont know said jonas how that is only i know that it isnt good for anything for fires it stifles them  i should like to know what the name of that part of the air is which is good for fires said rollo  i knew once said jonas but it was a hard word and i have forgotten it  i mean to ask my father said rollo  jonas then went on with his work gathering up everything that he could find around the field to put upon the fires rollo amused himself by putting large rolls of birch bark around the end of a stick and then after setting them on fire holding them over the fires which jonas was making to see how soon the flame was extinguished then he would draw them away and see them revive and blaze up again in the open air at last he called out to jonas once more  jonas said he i have found out what makes the blaze go out it is the smoke i dont believe but that it is the smoke  no replied jonas it is not the smoke i can prove that it is not  so jonas came up to the fire where rollo was standing and pointed out to rollo a place over a hot part of it where there was no smoke because the fire under it burned clear being nearly reduced to coals he told rollo to hold his blazing bark there rollo did so and found that it was extinguished at once and as completely as it had been before when he had held it in a dense smoke  yes said rollo it isnt the smoke but perhaps it is because it is so hot  no said jonas it isnt that it is a difference in the air they sometimes collect different kinds of air in glass jars and then let a candle down in and see whether it will go out  and will it go out said rollo  that depends upon what kind of air it is said jonas they all look clear just as if there was nothing in the jars but when you let a candle down in in some it burns just the same as before in some it burns brighter and in some it goes out  in what kinds does it go out asked rollo  i only know of one kind said jonas and that is a kind that comes of itself in mines and wells and other places  what is the name of it asked rollo  why the people in the mines call it choke damp but i believe it has got another name besides  what do they call it choke damp for said rollo  because said jonas if the miners get into it and breathe it it kills them it is not any better to breathe than it is to make fires burn  i wish i could see some choke damp said rollo  o you cant see it at all said jonas if it was right before you any more than you can see common air if a well or a mine is full of it they cannot find it out by looking down  how do they find it out said rollo  why they let a candle down replied jonas  and will the candle go out asked rollo  yes said jonas if there is choke damp in the well sometimes they make a little of it in a tumbler or a jar upon the table and so let a little flame down into it and it goes out immediately  i wish we could make some said rollo do you know how they make it  no said jonas but i believe it is pretty easy to do it if we only knew how  i will ask my father said rollo perhaps he will know  this conversation took place when jonas and rollo were about the fires but now the fires had pretty nearly burnt out and they prepared to go home  that evening just about sunset rollo went out behind the house and found jonas raking off the yard the spring was fast coming on and the grass was beginning to look a little green and jonas said he wanted to get off all the sticks chips and straws so that the yard would present a surface of smooth and uniform green rollo told him that he had found out how to make choke damp  did your father tell you said jonas  no replied rollo  who did tell you then said jonas  guess answered rollo  your mother said jonas  no answered rollo  then i cant tell said jonas  it was miss mary replied rollo i met her in the road today and i asked her  and how is it asked jonas  why we make it with chalk and vinegar said rollo we pound up a little chalk and put it in the bottom of a tumbler then we pour some vinegar over it the vinegar takes the choke damp out of the chalk and miss mary says it will come up in little bubbles she says we can lay a paper over the top looselyshe said loosely but i think it ought to be tight  why asked jonas  so as to keep the choke damp from coming out replied rollo  no said jonas i understand why she said you must put it on loosely thats to let the common air out  what common air said rollo  why the air that was in the tumbler before replied jonas you see that as fast as the choke damp comes up it drives the common air out of the top of the tumbler and so you must put the paper on loosely and let it go out  that evening jonas and rollo tried the experiment first they put about two teaspoonfuls of chalk into the tumbler then they poured in the vinegar it immediately began to foam  ah said rollo thats the effervescence  the what said dorothy for they were making this experiment upon the kitchen table and dorothy was standing by looking on with great interest  the effervescence said rollo miss mary said there would be an effervescence which would be occasioned by the little bubbles of choke damp coming up from the chalk  poh said dorothy its nothing but a little frothing  it isnt frothing said rollo very seriously it isnt frothing it is effervescence dont you think miss mary knows  jonas said rollo again after a short pause how many of these little bubbles will it take do you think to fill the tumbler full of choke damp  i dont know replied jonas we will wait a little while and then try it  there now jonas said rollo we have not got any candle  o i will roll up a piece of paper and set the end on fire and then dip it down into the tumbler and that will do just as well  what are you going to do that for said dorothy  why to see it go out said rollo  it wont go out unless you put it away down into the vinegar said dorothy  yes it will said rollo we are only going to dip it down a little way just into the choke damp and it will go out  it wont go out child said dorothy theres nothing to put it out  well youll see wont it go out jonas  i dont know said jonas  dont know said rollo why you told me that choke damp would put out a blaze  yes said jonas i am sure of that but there are a great many ways of failing in trying experiments  well said rollo that may be but this will not fail i know for i can see the little bubbles of choke damp coming up there are millions of them  by this time jonas thought that the tumbler was filled with the gas which was rising from the chalk and vinegar so he rolled up a piece of paper and set the end on fire and when it was well burning he plunged the end of it into the tumbler to rollos great disappointment and mortification it continued to burn about as much as ever the flame crept rapidly up the paper and jonas had soon to run with it across the floor and throw it into the fire to avoid burning his fingers dorothy laughed aloud jonas smiled and as for rollo he looked disappointed and vexed and appeared to be overwhelmed with chagrin  dorothy continued to laugh at them while jonas went to the pump and washed out the tumbler at length she said  but come rollo dont be so disconsolate you look as if you had swallowed all the choke damp  yes rollo said jonas we must keep goodnatured even if our experiments do fail  well said rollo i mean to ask miss mary again and then we can do it i know                                       rollo accordingly went the next day to ask miss mary about the cause of the failure miss mary said that she could not think of any thing which was likely to be the cause unless it was that they put too large a flame into the tumbler  well replied rollo and what harm would that do wont the choke damp put out a large flame  yes replied miss mary if it only fairly surrounds and covers it but then if you put a large flame into a tumbler it makes the first instant a great current of air and so the choke damp might be blown out and common air get in and so keep the paper burning  how does it make a current of air asked rollo  why the heat of the flame when you first put the paper in replied miss mary makes the air that is above it lighter and the common air all around crowds in under it in buoying it up and by that means if the flame is too large common air is carried into the tumbler you ought to make a very small flame if you leave the top of the tumbler open  how can we make a small flame said rollo  one good way replied miss mary is to roll up some paper into a very small roll i will show you how  so miss mary took a piece of paper and cut it into the proper shape with her scissors and then rolled it up into a long and very slender roll one end of it was not much larger than a large knittingneedle she gave this to rollo and told him that if he tried the experiment again he must light the small end and it would make a flame not so big as a pea  rollo explained to jonas what miss mary had said and they resolved on attempting the experiment again that evening and they did so dorothy stood by watching the process as she had done the evening before but rollo did not assert so confidently and positively what the result would be he had learned moderation by the experience of the night before  when all was ready jonas lighted the end of the slender roll in the lamp and plunged it carefully into the tumbler it went out immediately  there said rollo clapping his hands it goes out  why it is only because the wind blew it out  no dorothy said rollo there isnt any wind in the tumbler  yes replied dorothy when you push it down it makes a little wind just enough to blow it out  get another tumbler said jonas and let us see  so dorothy brought another tumbler and jonas put the burning end of the paper down into it with about as rapid a motion as that with which he had put it before into the tumbler he had at first the paper continued to burn  there said he to dorothy when i put it down into common air it burns on the same as ever so it cant be that the wind puts it out jonas repeated the experiment a number of times the effect was always the same whenever he put it into the tumbler of common air it burned on without any change but whenever he put it into the choke damp it immediately went out even dorothy was satisfied that there was a difference in the kind of air contained in the two tumblers  that evening when rollo gave his mother a full account of their attemptsdescribing particularly their failure at first and their subsequent successeshis mother seemed much interested when he had finished she said  well rollo i dont see but that you have learned two lessons in philosophy  two lessons said rollo  yes replied his mother the first is that fire will not burn in choke damp and the second is that it requires nice attention and care to verify philosophical truths by experiment  yes said rollo we missed the first time just because we had too big a paper       questions      why did jonas suppose that the stump would not burn what was     rollos first mode of setting it on fire how did it succeed     what did jonas do with his axe when he came what was the     object of this what did he say was necessary to make fires     burn what did rollo at first think was the reason why the bark     went out when held over the fire what did he next think was the     reason how did jonas say that different kinds of airs were     prepared in what places did he say that choke damp was     naturally produced how did they attempt to prepare some of this     gas did they succeed in preparing it did they succeed in their     experiment at first what was the cause of the failure     chapter x  gravitation   one evening after tea when rollo was a pretty big boy he came and began to climb up into his fathers lap when he had climbed up he took his place astride of his fathers knee as if he were riding a horse his little brother nathan came up and stood near wanting to get up too only there was not room his cousin james was there that evening on a visit he sat upon a cricket before the fire and his mother was at the table doing some sort of work  o dear me said rollos father imitating the tone in which rollo sometimes uttered that exclamation  what sir said rollo  why i should like very well to hold you in my lap said his father if it was not for the great mighty earth down below us  how said rollo he did not know what his father meant  why when you are upon my knee the earth the ponderous earth pulls you down hard and heavy upon it so saying he put his hands upon rollos shoulders and crowded them down by way of showing him how the earth acted upon him it pulls he continued with a strong and steady pull all the time and so makes you a very heavy weight  is that what makes weight said rollo  yes said his father so if i had a monstrous stone to move and if i thought the earth would listen to me and let go its hold i might make a speech to it thus  o earth thou vast and ponderous ball please to relax thy hold for a few minutes upon this stone and leave it free to move and then rollo can tie a string to it and move it easily along to the place where i want it to lie then thou mayst seize it again with thy mighty attraction and hold it down as firmly as thou wilt  o father exclaimed rollo nathan and james laughed and rollos mother looked up from her work to listen to this strange apostrophe  it would seem continued his father in a pompous tone as if still addressing the earthit would seem most mighty planet a very easy thing for thee to release this single stone for a few minutes from the grasp with which thou holdest all things down upon thy surface and by it i shall gain much while thou wilt lose nothing for if thou wilt not willingly give up the stone i must get three or four yoke of strong oxen and by main force pull it away  is that what makes everything heavy said rollo  yes said his father answering now in his natural tone the attraction of the earth is what makes everything heavy and holds it down  and could we move a monstrous great stone said rollo as light as a feather  no said his father it would not move along quick and light like a feather you could not move it quick suppose for instance you had two boats floating upon the water of the same size one made very light indeed of something very thin like paper and empty and the other made of wood and loaded with iron as heavily as it would bear now they would both be supported upon the water so that their weight would be neutralized and yet they would move very differently you could push the light one about easily anywhere but the heavy one would move very slowly you would not have to push very hard upon it but you would have to push for some time to set it in motion and then it would be hard to stop it this is called its inertia  yes said rollo it would go harder against the bank  the reason is continued his father that the heavy boat contains a great many more particles of matter than the light one and they have all got to be put in motion so it requires greater effort or the same effort must be continued a longer time  for instance if we suppose that the light boat has one million of particles of matter the heavy one would have perhaps twenty millions of course the effect of the pushing has to be divided among twenty times as many particles and of course will only carry them one twentieth part as far so that the bodies that are now large and heavy would only move slowly though they would move easily if the attraction of the earth were to cease  there is another way to illustrate it he continued suppose there was a large mass of lead as big as a load of hay hanging by a chain and also a great puff of feathers or a balloon of the same size hanging in the same way now if they were both suspended freely they would both move easily for their weight would be supported by the chain but the heavy one would move very slowly nathan could move it but he could only move it slowly and a little way  i should not think that he could move it but very little said rollo  no he could not because you see that in that way of suspending anything the moment that it begins to move it begins to swing off and to rise so that it cannot be moved at all without being lifted a little and the more it is moved the higher it is lifted so that it would take a great force to move it far away from the centre where it was hanging but we can hang it in a way to avoid that difficulty  how sir said rollo  rollo seemed to be very much interested in this conversation he had dismounted from his fathers knee and stood by his side listening eagerly his mother too was paying close attention as for nathan he sat still though it is not by any means certain that he understood it very well  let us suppose said his father that the mass of lead as big as a load of hay is fastened to one end of a stick of timber  that would not be strong enough to hold it said rollo  well then to a beam of iron as large as a stick of timber rejoined his father  o said james you could not get such a big bar of iron  no replied his father only an imaginary one and that will be just as good as any now suppose the great mass of lead is fastened to one end of this bar and another one just like it to the other end to balance it now suppose that the lower end of the great chain is secured around the middle of the iron beam and the upper end to be fastened to some strong support up in the air now we can move the mass of lead without having to lift it at all for if we push against it and make it move it will move round and round without rising at all as it did before when it was hung up directly by the chain  rollos father then went on to explain to them that in such a case as this the weight of the two masses of lead would not prevent their moving easily for they would exactly balance each other a little child would be able to move them but still they would move exceedingly slow at first and it would be hard to stop them when they were in motion so he said if the earth should cease to attract and draw down any great heavy body like a large stone for example the smallest child could lift it though it would come up slowly just as a very heavy body would move if it was suspended by a string or was afloat upon the water  and so said rollo if the earth should not attract us could we push ourselves right up off from the ground  yes said his father most undoubtedly  what and go about anywhere in the air  certainly  rollo began to laugh aloud at this idea and looked very much interested and pleased  o then i wish there was no gravitation said rollo i do really  but then continued his father if you should get up into the air you could not get down again  why not said nathan beginning to look a little concerned  unless said his father you had something above you to push against so as to push yourselves down you would be just like a boy in a boat off from the shore and without any paddle or pole he could not get back again  we might tie a rope to something said james before we went up and so pull ourselves down  yes that you might do  and could not we flap our hands like a bird and so fly a little  perhaps you could said his father  here the children all began to flap their hands like young birds trying to fly and rollo said again he wished with all his heart there was no gravitation for then said he we should have strength enough to fly  that would lead to serious consequences said his father  what consequences said james  much more serious than you would suppose  tell us what they would be uncle said james  o i know said rollo you could not stand up straight without gravitation  o we could couldnt we father said nathan  what makes you think rollo said his father without replying to jamess questionwhat makes you think that we could not stand up straight without gravitation  why you see said rollohere he paused and looked confused and did not know what to say he had an indistinct recollection of having read something about it in some book but he could not tell what  i dont see what should prevent any bodys standing up straight if the attraction of the earth should cease in fact if it made any difference it would be rather easier to stand up straight  here rollo looked rather foolish but he did not reply the truth is like almost all other children who take an interest in reading he was sometimes a little vain of his knowledge and in this case instead of listening attentively and endeavoring to learn something new from his fathers explanations he seems to have thought it a good plan for him to help him elucidate the subject to james and nathan he exchanged the character of learner for teacher too soon  well uncle said james what would be the consequence if gravitation should cease  why in the first place said rollos father all the streams in the world would stop running  the streams said rollo astonished  yes said his father every river brook and rill the reason why the streams flow is that the earth attracts the water from the mountains and hills down into the valleys and towards the sea  well sir what else said rollo  why there would never be any more rain  no more rain exclaimed all the children  no he replied the drops of rain fall only because the earth draws them down by its attraction and of course if this attraction should cease they would remain where they are  the children were musing a minute upon these strange effects when rollo asked if anything else would happen  why yes said his father worse disasters than these but i do not know whether you would understand them if i should explain them  o try said rollo i think we shall understand  well let me think said his father you have noticed how a chaise wheel on a muddy road in a wet day holds the mud upon it until when it is going very swiftly down a hill and then the mud flies off in all directions  yes sir said all the children  and if the mud did not stick to the wheel pretty tight it would be thrown off at all times even when the wheel was going slow you understand this  yes sir  well now this whole earth you all know is whirling around through space and moving on also around the sun and all the loose things upon the surface would be thrown off at once if they were not held to it by a strong attraction if this attraction were to cease suddenlywhiskaway we should all go in an instantrocks houses men animals all in confusion  o father exclaimed rollo where should we go tooff into the air  not exactly into the air for the air would all fly off and be dissipated too we should fly off into the sky somewhere some in one direction and some in another youd be a thousand miles off from the earth almost before you would know it  would it kill us father said nathan  yes said his father i dont know that there would be any shock that would hurt us but we should have no air to breathe and it would be dark and dismal  dark said rollo there would be the sun  yes said his father there would be the sun and the sun would look bright enough when you looked directly towards it but there would be no general light about you unless there was air  the children all paused to reflect upon the strange results which their father had told them would ensue from a suspension of the earths attractive force rollo began to think that he had been too hasty in his wish that there was no gravitation  but father said he the houses would not go off certainlyonly the loose things would go  very well houses are loose  o father they are fastened down  how are they fastened down asked his father  o they are nailedand  not nailed to the ground certainly said his father  no said rollo laughing but then they are built with great stones and mortar  yes but there is no mortar under the lowest stones the foundations are simply laid upon the ground  well rejoined rollo i thought they were fastened somehow or other  no said his father they dig the cellar and only just lay the foundations upon the ground without any fastening the earth holds them in place  well father said rollo that is what i meant when i said we could not stand up straight i meant the houses i read in a book that houses would be blown away if the gravitation did not hold them down  here rollos father had a hearty laugh and he told rollo that he thought that was rather wide shooting rollo wanted to know what he was laughing at and nathan asked him what he meant by wide shooting  why said he rollo you undertook to explain to us from your stores of knowledge what the effects of a suspension of gravitation would be and in attempting to tell that houses would be in danger of being blown away you came no nearer than to tell us that boys could not stand up straight and that is what i call pretty wide shooting  so saying he rose from his seat and walked away appearing to be very much amused james laughed too and even rollo could not help smiling at the ridiculous figure which his display of his learning made as for nathan he continued to look grave and said he did not see that it was any shooting at all  after a short pause rollos mother said so you see children the cause of all the pressure both of air and of water and all the effects produced by them are the results of their gravitation towards the earth  yes said rollo i believe i understand it now  after this rollo took james and nathan out into the yard to see if some beans had come up which he had been planting in a sunny corner of the garden the day before       questions      what was mr holidays apostrophe to the earth what is the     cause of weight why did the boys wish that there was no     gravitation what was the first evil consequence which their     father said would ensue if there was no gravitation what was     the second evil consequence what did their mother say after the     conversation with their father was closed     chapter xi  air in motion   rollos dam which he had made when he was studying the philosophy of water and which was at first undermined by the pressure of the water was afterwards carried away by its momentum rollo learned at that time that water moving rapidly had a great momentum and about this time he had an opportunity of learning that air when in motion had a momentum too capable of producing very powerful effects the circumstances of the case were as follows  one morning towards the latter part of march jonas being out in the barn observed some indications that the roof wanted repairs it had been strained and weakened by the heavy snows in the winter he reported the fact to rollos father who said that he might go the next day and get the carpenter to come and repair it the carpenter lived ten miles distant near the shore of a long pond  when rollo heard of this proposed expedition he wanted to go too and his father gave him permission jonas was going in the wagon he told rollo the evening before that he meant to set out at six oclock  but suppose it looks like a storm said rollo  then there will be more need of going said jonas for if the equinoctial storm comes on before the roof is strengthened it may get carried away  what is the equinoctial storm said rollo  o it is a great storm which comes generally about this time of year i shouldnt wonder if it should come on tomorrow but it may not come for a week and so i hope we shall have time to get the roof mended first  does it look like a storm tonight said rollo  no not much replied jonas it is a little hazy in the southwest however if it looks like a storm in the morning you need not go unless you choose though i shall  i wish youd wait till the storm is over said rollo  no said jonas i had rather go in the storm than not  why said rollo  because said jonas i like to be out in storms sometimes it is very grand  the next morning when rollo awoke he found that it was light but not yet sunrise he arose and looked out of the window to see if it was pleasant the sky was somewhat overcast but there was a little blue to be seen and rollo thought that it would be pleasant he heard a noise in the barnyard and looking in that direction he saw jonas just leading the horse out of the stable so he dressed himself soon and went down  when he got ready he went down into the yard and found that jonas had got the horse harnessed and everything prepared there was a little bag of oats in the back part of the wagon and also a tin pail with a cover which contained a luncheon jonas fastened the horse to a post and said  now rollo well go in and get some breakfast  i thought that luncheon was for breakfast said rollo  no said jonas that is for dinner  shall we be gone all the day said rollo  we may be gone till after dinner said jonas and so i thought i would be sure  the two boys went into the house and there they found that dorothy had got some breakfast ready for them upon the kitchen table after eating their breakfast they got into the wagon and set out jonas first put in a large umbrella just as they were driving out of the yard the first beams of the morning sun shone in under the branches of a great tree in the yard and brightened up the tips of the horses ears and the boys faces at the same time a rude gust of wind came around the corners of the house and slammed to the gate of the front yard  its going to be pleasant said rollo the sun is coming out  im not very sure of that said jonas the wind is rising  we start just at sunrise said rollo  yes replied jonas the sun always rises at six oclock at this time of the year  the boys rode along for about three hours before they came to the carpenters they were obliged to travel very slow for the roads were not good it is true that the snow was all gone and the frost was nearly out of the ground but there were many deep ruts and in some places it was muddy the sun went into a cloud soon after they set out and it continued overcast all the morning there was some wind too but as it was behind them and as the road lay through woods and among sheltered hills they did not observe it much jonas said that there was a storm coming on but he thought it was coming slowly  they arrived at length at the pond there was a little village there upon the shore of the pond the reason why there happened to be a village there was this a stream of water which came down from among the mountains emptied into the pond here and very near where it emptied it fell over a ledge of rocks making a waterfall where the people had built some mills now where there are mills there must generally be a blacksmiths shop to mend the iron work when it gets broken and to repair tools there is often a tavern also for the people who come to the mills and then there is generally a store or two for wherever people have to come together for any business there is a good place to open a store to sell them what they want to buy thus there was a little village about these mills which was generally called the mill village  jonas inquired where the carpenter lived and then drove directly to his house he found that he was not at home he had gone across the pond to mend a bridge which had been in part carried away by the floods made when the snow went off rollo sat in the wagon in the yard by the side of the carpenters house while jonas stood at the door making inquiries and getting this information  if you want to see him very much said the carpenters wife i presume you can get a boat down in the village and go across the pond  how far is he from the other side of the pond  o close by the upper landing said she not a quarter of a mile from the shore right up the road  jonas thanked the woman for her information and got into the wagon  let us get a boat and go over jonas said rollo as they were turning the wagon round  i should said jonas if there was not such a threatening of a storm  it does not blow much said rollo  no said jonas not much now but the wind may rise before we get back however well go and see if we can get a boat  after some inquiry they found a boat at a little distance out of the village in a sort of cove where there was a fine sandy beach the boat was of very good size and it had in it two oars and a paddle jonas looked out upon the water and up to the sky and he listened to hear the moaning of the wind upon the tops of the trees he wanted very much to persevere in his effort to find the carpenter but then on the other hand he was not sure that it was quite safe to take rollo out upon the water at such a time he sat upon a log upon the shore a few minutes and seemed lost in thought  illustration and very soon they were gliding smoothly along out of the covepage 167  at last he said  well rollo i believe well go the worst that will happen will be that you may get frightened a little we cant get hurt  why cant we get hurt said rollo  why even if it comes on to blow hard it will probably be a steady gale and i can run before it if i cant do anything else and there cant be much of a sea in this pond  rollo did not know what jonas meant by much of a sea in the pond but as jonas immediately went to work taking the horse out of the wagon rollo did not ask any questions the boys unharnessed the horse for jonas said he would stand easier out of harness and they might be gone more than an hour they fastened him then to a tree and poured the oats down before him upon the ground then jonas helped rollo into the boat and put in the tin pail containing their luncheon and also the umbrella though he said he did not think it would rain before they got back then he shoved off the boat and jumped in himself and very soon they were gliding smoothly along out of the cove  rollo wanted to row and so jonas let him take one oar while he himself sat in the stern with the paddle rollo soon learned the proper motion so that his efforts assisted considerably in propelling the boat they found when they were out at a little distance upon the water that the wind blew much harder than rollo had expected  jonas said he the wind blows more here than it did upon the shore  no said jonas only we feel it more here than when we were under the lee of the land  what do you mean by the lee of the land said rollo  i mean the shelter of it replied jonas whenever a ship at sea is sheltered by anything they say the ship is under its lee  the boys went on rollo rowing and jonas paddling behind until at length rollo got tired jonas then told him to spread the umbrella and hold it up for a sail rollo did so the wind was blowing pretty nearly in the direction in which they were going and by its impulse upon the umbrella it caused it to pull very hard rollo rested the middle of the handle of the umbrella upon his shoulder holding the crook in his hand turning it in such a position as to present the open part of the umbrella fairly to the wind jonas continued to paddle and so they went on very prosperously until they had got two thirds across the pond when jonas ordered rollo to take in sail  why said rollo we have not got across yet  no replied jonas but the wind is taking us out of our course  rollo drew down the umbrella and looked around they were still at a considerable distance from the shore jonas extended his paddle out into the water as far as he could reach and then drew it in towards him with several quick and strong strokes as if he were endeavoring to pull the stern of the boat in which he was sitting round  what are you doing so for said rollo  i am trying to bring her up into the wind replied jonas  what is that for asked rollo  why weve drifted to leeward said jonas and i must bring her up for we want to land around behind that point on the starboard bow  rollo did not understand jonass technical language very well he particularly did not know what jonas meant by bringing her up for it seemed to him that the pond was perfectly level so that there was no up or down either way he did not know that in sea language against the wind was always up and with the wind down  jonas found it hard to bring the boat up into the wind the waves had begun to be pretty large and they beat against the bows of the boat and some of the water dashed over upon rollo the wind blew quite heavily too and now that they had changed their direction so as to bring the wind upon their side it embarrassed if it did not absolutely retard their progress some drops of rain also began to fall  however by hard and persevering exertion jonas at length succeeded in urging the boat forward until he began to draw nigh to the point of land and soon afterwards they came under the shelter of it where the water was smooth and the air comparatively still here rollo put in his oar again and they passed along close under a high shore for some distance until they came to the landing here they fastened the boat and then began to walk along up the road  the road lay through the woods and among hills so that it was sheltered and the only indications of the wind which the boys noticed was a distant roaring sound among the forests they came at length to the bridge where they found several workmen busily engaged in laying abutments of stone but the carpenter himself was not there the men told jonas that he had gone about half a mile away on a byroad to select and cut some timber to be used in the construction of the bridge  how long will he be gone asked jonas  he will be gone two or three hours said a man with a stone hammer in his hand  what shall we do now asked rollo addressing jonas after a short pause  keep on until we find him replied jonas but you may stay here and see them build the bridge while i go after the carpenter  accordingly jonas went on leaving rollo seated upon a bank watching the work in about three quarters of an hour he returned and then he and rollo went back to the boat the wind had all this time continued to increase though they were so much sheltered that they did not notice it much  jonas however observed that some light scudding clouds were flying across the sky very low being apparently far beneath the other clouds when they reached the boat rollo proposed that they should stop and eat some luncheon but jonas said that he should eat his with a better appetite on the other side of the pond so he hastened rollo into the boat and talking his station in the stern he began to ply his paddle with all his force running the boat along under the shelter of the high shore  there isnt much wind jonas said rollo  we can tell better when we come round the point replied jonas  rollo observed that jonas looked a little anxious and he also seemed to be exerting himself so much in the long steady strokes of his paddle that it appeared to be rather an interruption to him to hear and answer questions rollo therefore did not talk he found however as he drew near the point that the waves were running by it with great speed and force down the pond as the boat shot out from the shelter of the point into this place of exposure the storm struck them suddenly with a blast which swept the bows of the boat at once round out of her course and dashed the spray from the waves all over rollos face and shoulders it was with great difficulty that jonas could bring the boat to the wind again  he succeeded however at length and they went on for some time pitching and tossing through the wavesthe wind pressing so hard upon the boat that it was very difficult for jonas to make any headway the wind had changed its direction so that it blew now almost exactly across their course and it required great exertion for jonas to prevent being blown away down the pond out of his track altogether  in the mean time the wind rather increased than diminished and the water dashed in so much over the bows that rollo had to dip it up with the cover of the tin pail and pour it out over the side of the boat into the pond again they were going on in this way both toiling very laboriously when suddenly they began to hear a sound like distant thunder somewhat louder than the ordinary roaring of the wind they both looked towards the shore in the direction from which the sound came on the declivity of a range of hills covered with forests they saw an unusual commotion among the trees the tops were bowed down with great force the branches were broken off and jonas thought that he could see fragments of them flying in the air and presently farther down he observed several tall pines bending over and then sinking down till they disappeared  what is it said rollo  a squall said jonasand coming down directly upon us  what shall we do asked rollo  put the boat before the wind replied jonas and let her run we must go where the squall carries us  jonas immediately began to pull the stern of the boat around with his paddle so as to turn the head of it away from the quarter which the wind was blowing from and then the wind drove the boat along very rapidly over the waves which curled and foamed on each side driving onward with great fury when they looked around behind them they saw that the pond which was of a very dark color though spotted with the white tips of the waves all over its surface was almost black for a large space in the direction from which the squall was coming it advanced with great rapidity and at last struck the boat with a noise like thunder the froth and foam flew over the surface of the water like tufts of cotton and the boat seemed to fly along the water with almost as much speed as they and the roaring of the winds and waves was so loud that rollo had great difficulty in making jonas hear what he had to say after a few minutes the violence of the wind somewhat abated but it still blew a steady and furious gale so that jonas had to keep his boat directly before it thus they were driven on wherever the wind chose to carry them for more than half an hour  then they began to draw near the land far however very far from the place where they had intended to go rollo observed that jonas was looking out very eagerly towards the shore and he asked him what he was looking for  why here we are said jonas on a lee shore and i am looking out for a place to land  rollo looked and saw that the waves were tumbling with great violence upon the rocks and gravelly beaches which lined the shore and he was afraid that the boat would get dashed to pieces upon them jonas however observed a large tree which originally stood upon the bank but which had fallen over and now lay with its top partly submerged he thought that this might afford him some shelter and so he made great exertions to guide the boat so as to bring it in to the shore around behind this tree by means of great efforts he succeeded and so he and rollo both escaped safe to land  the boys did not get home until late that night for they were thrown upon the shore nearly two miles from the mill village and of course they had that distance to walk jonas was detained a little there too in making arrangements to send a boy for the boat after the storm had subsided when they got home rollos father said that he was sorry for their fatigues and exposures but he was very glad that jonas had persevered and found the carpenter for the high wind had blown down the back chimney and broken the roof over the kitchen and it was very necessary to have it repaired immediately       questions      what is momentum has air momentum when it is in motion as     well as water at what time in the spring of the year does the     sun rise at six oclock what did rollo think was the prospect     in respect to the weather what did jonas think what is meant     by being under the lee of a shore what is a squall what     indications did jonas observe of the approach of the squall     what course did he pursue in order to avoid the danger of it     chapter xii  air at rest   a few days after the adventure described in the preceding chapter rollo heard his father proposing to his mother that they should take a walk the next morning before breakfast rollo wanted to go too his father said that they should be very glad to have his company and he promised to wake him in season  rollo felt rather sleepy when his father called him the next morning but he jumped up and dressed himself and was ready first of all it was a cool but a very pleasant morning the sun was just coming up the ground in the path before the door was frozen a little and the air seemed very still  when rollos mother came out to the door she said  well husband which way shall we go  up on the rocks said rollo lets go up on the rocks mother it will be beautiful there this morning  well replied his mother well go up on the rocks  the place which rollo called the rocks was the summit of a rocky hill which had a grassy slope upon one side by which they could ascend and a precipice of ragged rocks upon the other there was a very pleasant prospect from the top of the rocks  as they walked along rollo said that it was very different weather that still morning from what it was the day that he and jonas were out upon the pond  yes said his father you had an opportunity to see the effects of air in motion then  and now air at rest replied rollo  pretty nearly said his father  yes sir entirely said rollo there is no wind at all this morning hold up your hand and you can feel  so rollo stopped a moment upon the grass and held up his hand to see whether there was any wind  i know there is not any wind that you can perceive in that way said his father  how can we perceive it then said rollo  ill tell you replied his father when we get to the top of the hill  they reached the top of the hill soon after this and sat down upon a smooth stone there was a very wide prospect spread out before themfields forests hamlets streamsand here and there scattered over the landscape a little patch of snow the sun was just up and the whole scene was very bright and beautiful  now father said rollo tell me how you know that there is any wind at all  i did not say that there was any wind i said motion of the air  why father replied rollo i thought that wind was motion of the air  so it is said his father but all motion of the air is not wind wind is a current of air that is a progressive motionand in fact there is this morning a slight current from the westward  how can you tell father asked rollo  by the smokes from the chimneys dont you see that they all lean a little from the west towards the east  not but a little fatherand theres one from that red house which goes up exactly straight  yes said his father there is one but in general the columns of smoke lean which is proof that there is a gentle current of air to the eastward  westward you said father rejoined rollo  yes from the westward but to the eastward  that is what is called a progressive motion continued rollos father that is the whole body of air makes progress it advances from west to east but there is another kind of motion called a vibratory motion  what kind of a motion is that father asked rollo  it is a very hard kind to describe at any rate said his father it is a kind of quivering which begins in one place and spreads in every direction dont you hear a kind of a thumping sound  yes said rollo a great way off what is it  look over across the pond there said his father dont you see that man cutting wood  yes said rollo thats what makes the noiseno father he continued after a moments pause thats not it look father and youll see that the thumping sound comes when his axe is lifted up  they all looked and found that it was as rollo had said the strokes of the axe kept time pretty well with the sound of blows which they heard only the sounds did not correspond with the descent of the axe when the axe appeared to strike the wood they did not hear any sound but they did hear one every time the axe was lifted up  so you see said rollo it is not that man that we hear there must be some other man cutting wood  we will wait a minute said his father until he gets the log cut off and then he will stop cutting and we will see whether we cease to hear the sound  so they sat still and watched the man for a minute presently he stopped cuttingand to rollos great surprise the sound stopped too  thats strange said rollo  in a moment more the man had rolled the log over and commenced cutting upon the other side and in an instant after he began to cut rollo began to hear the sound of strokes again  yes said rollo it must be his cutting that we hear but it is very strange that he makes a noise when he lifts up his axe and no noise when it goes down  ill tell you how it is said his father he makes the noise when his axe goes down but then it takes some little time for the sound to get here and by the time the sound gets here his axe is up  o said rollo is that it  yes replied his father that is it  rollo watched the motion of the axe several minutes longer in silence and then his attention was attracted by the singing of a bird upon a tree in his fathers garden at a short distance below him  pretty soon however his mother said that it was time for her to return and they all accordingly arose from their seats and rambled along together a short distance upon the brow of the hill but towards home  then the sound moves along through the air said rollo from the man to us  yes said his father that is there is a vibratory motion of the aira kind of quiveringwhich begins where the man is and spreads all around in every direction until it reaches us but there is no progressive motion that is none of the air itself where the man is at work leaves him and comes to us  but husband said rollos mother i dont see how anything can come from where the man is to us unless it is the air itself  it is rather hard to understand said his father but i can make an experiment with a string when we get home that will show you something about it  they rambled about among the rocks for a short time longer and then they descended by a steep and crooked path in a different place from where they had ascended when they had got nearly home rollo said that he would run forward and get his fathers ball of twine and bring it out and so have it all ready for the experiment  accordingly when rollos father and mother arrived at the front door they found rollo ready there with a small ball of twine in his hand about as large as an apple  now rollo said his father you may take hold of the end of the twine and walk along out into the street while i hold the ball and let the string unwind  rollo did so he drew out a long piece of twine as long as the whole front of the house and then he stopped to ask his father if that was enough  no said his father walk along  so rollo walked on for some distance farther until at last the ball was entirely unwound rollo had one end of it and was standing at some distance down the road while his father with the other end stood at the gate of the front yard the middle of the string hung down pretty near to the ground  draw tight rollo said his father  so rollo pulled a little harder and by that means drew the line straighter  now said his father walk along slowly  so rollo walked along drawing the end of the line with him his father followed with the other end thus they advanced several steps along the side of the road  there said his father stop that you see was a progressive motion  yes sir replied rollo  the whole string advanced along the road added his father it made progress and so it was a progressive motion now fasten your end of the string rollo to that tree directly behind you  rollo looked behind him and saw that he was standing near a small mapletree which had been planted a few years before by the side of the road  tie it right around the stem of the tree said his father about as high as your shoulder  rollo fastened the string as his father had directed then his father fastened his end in the same way to another tree which was growing near where he was standing  now said he there can be no more progressive motion but there can be a vibratory one take hold of the string near where it is fastened to the tree  rollo took hold of it as his father had directed and then his father told him to shut his eyes when his eyes were shut so that he could not see his father said that he was going to strike the string at his end of it with his pencilcase and he asked rollo to observe whether he could feel any motion  rollo held very still while his father struck the string and immediately afterwards he called out yes sir then his father struck the string again several times and every time rollo could feel a distinct vibratory or quivering motion which was transmitted very rapidly through the string from one end to the other although as the string was fastened by both ends to the trees it was evident that there could be no progressive motion  rollos mother had been standing all this time at the step of the door watching the progress of the experiment and when she saw the expression of satisfaction upon rollos countenance while he was standing with his eyes shut holding the end of the string she wanted to come and take hold of it herself so as to see what sort of a sensation the vibratory motion of the string produced  so she came out through the gate and asked mr holiday to wait a moment while she went to where rollo was standing and took hold of the string but he said that it would not be necessary for her to go there as she could take hold of his end of the line just as well and let rollo strike the other end  they accordingly performed the experiment in that way and rollos mother could feel the vibrations very distinctly  one thing you must observe said mr holiday and that is that the vibrations pass along from one end of the line to the other very quick indeed we feel them at one end almost at the same instant that the other end is struck  exactly at the same instant sir said rollo  no replied his father not exactly at the same instant though it is very nearly the same  i did not see any difference said rollo  no replied his father you cannot perceive any difference in so short a string but if we had a string or a wire a mile long i presume that we should find that it would require a sensible period of time to transmit the vibrations from one end to the other  what do you mean by a sensible period of time father asked rollo  why a length of time that you could perceive said his father just as it was with the man cutting wood we could see that some time elapsed between the striking of the blow and our hearing the sound  yes said rollo just as long as it took him to lift up his axe  that is not certain replied his father because the sound that we heard might have belonged to a blow made before that is it might be that when he had struck one blow he had time to raise his axe and strike another and then raise his axe again before the sound of the first blow came to us  yes sir said rollo i understand  mr holiday then told rollo that he might unfasten the string from the trees and wind it up again into a ball and bring it in then he and rollos mother went into the house to see if breakfast was not almost ready  that morning after they were all seated at the breakfast table rollo said to his father that he did not exactly understand what sort of a motion the vibratory motion of the air was after all  no said his father i suppose you do not and in fact i do not understand it very perfectly myself i only know that the philosophers say that when a man strikes a blow with an axe upon a log of wood it produces a little quivering motion of the air which spreads all around darting off in every direction very swiftly if a boy strikes a tin pail with a drumstick it makes another kind of quivering or vibration which is different from that which is made by the axe but i dont know precisely how it differs so when the air is full of sounds on a still morning it is full of these little vibrations like a string which trembles from end to end though its ends are fastened so that it cannot move away  then the air is never at rest said rollos mother  no certainly not when any sound is to be heard and it is never perfectly silent  there is one thing very extraordinary said mrs holiday  what is it asked rollos father  why that when a great many sounds are made at the same time she repliedas for example when we are upon the top of a hill on a still morning and hear a great many separate sounds as a man cutting wood birds singing a bell ringing and perhaps a man shouting to his oxenall those tremblings or vibrations being in the air together do not interfere with one another  yes said mr holiday it is very extraordinary indeed they do not seem to interfere at all when there are too many sounds or if there is a wind with them they do interfere but in a calm morning like this when the air is at rest you can hear a great many distant sounds very distinctly  yes said rollo and i mean to go up to the top of the rocks again after breakfast and listen       questions      what time of the year was it when rollo took this walk how did     rollo satisfy himself that there was no wind at all how did his     father prove that there was a little wind is all motion of the     air wind what two kinds of motion are mentioned what sound did     they hear what made rollo think the sound was not made by the     man whom they saw cutting wood how did his father explain this     phenomenon what experiment did they try with the string were     the vibrations transmitted slowly or rapidly through the string     did rollo think that he understood perfectly the nature of the     vibrations what extraordinary circumstance did rollos mother     mention at the breakfast table
