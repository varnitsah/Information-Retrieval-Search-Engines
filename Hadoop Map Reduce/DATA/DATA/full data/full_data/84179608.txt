in the light from one closeshaded      electric bulb the room is but dimly visible  a dying fire burns      on the left  a curtained window in the centre of the back wall      a door on the right  the furniture is plushcovered and      commonplace with a kind of shabby smartness  a couch without      back or arms stands aslant between window and fire       on this wanda is sitting her knees drawn up under her staring      at the embers  she has on only her nightgown and a wrapper over      it her bare feet are thrust into slippers  her hands are      crossed and pressed over her breast  she starts and looks up      listening  her eyes are candid and startled her face alabaster      pale and its pale brown hair short and squarecut curls      towards her bare neck  the startled dark eyes and the faint      rose of her lips are like colourstaining on a white mask       footsteps as of a policeman very measured pass on the      pavement outside and die away  she gets up and steals to the      window draws one curtain aside so that a chink of the night is      seen  she opens the curtain wider till the shape of a bare      witchlike tree becomes visible in the open space of the little      square on the far side of the road  the footsteps are heard      once more coming nearer  wanda closes the curtains and cranes      back  they pass and die again  she moves away and looking down      at the floor between door and couch as though seeing something      there  shudders covers her eyes goes back to the couch and      down again just as before to stare at the embers  again she is      startled by noise of the outer door being opened  she springs      up runs and turns the light by a switch close to the door  by      the glimmer of the fire she can just be seen standing by the      dark windowcurtains listening  there comes the sound of      subdued knocking on her door  she stands in breathless terror      the knocking is repeated  the sound of a latchkey in the door      is heard  her terror leaves her  the door opens a man enters      in a dark fur overcoat  wanda  in a voice of breathless relief with a rather foreign accent  oh its you larry  why did you knock  i was so frightened  come in  she crosses quickly and flings her arms round his neck  recoilingin a terrorstricken whisper  oh  who is it  keith  in a smothered voice  a friend of larrys  dont be frightened       she has recoiled again to the window and when he finds the      switch and turns the light up she is seen standing there      holding her dark wrapper up to her throat so that her face has      an uncanny look of being detached from the body  gently  you neednt be afraid  i havent come to do you harm quite the contrary  holding up the keys  larry wouldnt have given me these would he if he hadnt trusted me       wanda does not move staring like a spirit startled out of the      flesh  after looking round him  im sorry to have startled you  wanda  in a whisper  who are you please  keith  larrys brother       wanda with a sigh of utter relief steals forward to the couch      and sinks down  keith goes up to her  hed told me  wanda  clasping her hands round her knees  yes  keith  an awful business  wanda  yes oh yes  awfulit is awful  keith  staring round him again  in this room  wanda  just where you are standing  i see him now always falling  keith  moved by the gentle despair in her voice  youlook very young  whats your name  wanda  wanda  keith  are you fond of larry  wanda  i would die for him       a moments silence  keith  iive come to see what you can do to save him  wanda wistfully  you would not deceive me  you are really his brother  keith  i swear it  wanda  clasping her hands  if i can save him  wont you sit down  keith  drawing up a chair and sitting  this man youryour husband before he came here the night before lasthow long since you saw him  wanda  eighteen month  keith  does anyone about here know you are his wife  wanda

many i think like me  keith  did my brother ever see him before  wanda  never  and that man first went for him  keith  yes  i saw the mark  have you a servant  wanda  no  a woman come at nine in the morning for an hour  keith  does she know larry  wanda  no  he is always gone  keith  friendsacquaintances  wanda  no i am verree quiet  since i know your brother i see no one sare  keith  sharply  do

you been doing  wanda  simply  crying  pressing her hands to her breast  he is in danger because of me  i am so afraid for him  keith  checking her emotion  look at me       she looks at him  if the worst comes and this man is traced to you can you trust yourself not to give larry away  wanda  rising and pointing to the fire  look  i have burned all the things he have given meeven his picture  now i have nothing from him  keith  who has risen too  good  one more question  do the police know youbecauseof your life       she looks at him intently and shakes her head  you know where larry lives  wanda  yes  keith  you mustnt go there and he mustnt come to you       she bows her head then suddenly comes close to him  wanda  please do not take him from me altogether  i will be so careful  i will not do anything to hurt him  but if i cannot see him sometimes i shall die  please do not take him from me       she catches his hand and presses it desperately between her      own  keith  leave that to me  im going to do all i can  wanda  looking up into his face  but you will be kind       suddenly she bends and kisses his hand  keith draws his hand      away and she recoils a little humbly looking up at him again      suddenly she stands rigid listening  in a whisper  listen  someoneout there       she darts past him and turns out the light  there is a knock on      the door  they are now close together between door and window   whispering  oh  who is it  keith  under his breath  you said no one comes but larry  wanda  yes and you have his keys  oh if it is larry i must open       keith shrinks back against the wall  wanda goes to the door  opening the door an inch  yes  please  who       a thin streak of light from a bullseye lantern outside plays      over the wall  a policemans voice says all right miss      your outer doors open  you ought to keep it shut after dark      you know  wanda  thank you air       the sound of retreating footsteps of the outer door closing      wanda shuts the door  a policeman  keith  moving from the wall  curse  i must have left that door suddenlyturning up the light  you told me they didnt know you  wanda  sighing  i did not think they did sir  it is so long i was not out in the town not since i had larry       keith gives her an intent look then crosses to the fire  he      stands there a moment looking down then turns to the girl who      has crept back to the couch  keith  half to himself  after your life who can believe  look here  you drifted together and youll drift apart you know  better for him to get away and make a clean cut of it  wanda  uttering a little moaning sound  oh sir  may i not love because i have been bad  i was only sixteen when that man spoiled me  if you knew  keith  im thinking of larry  with you his danger is much greater theres a good chance as things are going  you may wreck it  and for what  just a few months more ofwellyou know  wanda  standing at the head of the couch and touching her eyes with her hands  oh sir  look  it is true  he is my life  dont take him away from me  keith  moved and restless  you must know what larry is  hell never stick to you  wanda  simply

no more the moon is dead and all the people in it       he sits on the couch with a piece of paper on his knees adding      a few words with a stylo pen to what is already written       the girl in a

to the table and sit down       the curtain falls for a few seconds to indicate the passage of      three hours  when it rises again the lovers are lying on the      couch in each others arms the lilies stream about them  the      girls bare arm is round larrys neck  her eyes are closed his      are open and sightless  there is no light but firelight       a knocking on the door and the sound of a key turned in the      lock  keith enters  he stands a moment bewildered by the      halflight then calls sharply larry and turns up the light      seeing the forms on the couch he recoils a moment  then      glancing at the table and empty decanters goes up to the couch  keith  muttering  asleep  drunk  ugh       suddenly he bends touches larry and springs back  what  he bends again shakes him and calls  larry larry       then motionless he stares down at his brothers open      sightless eyes  suddenly he wets his finger and holds it to the      girls lips then to larrys       he bends and listens at their hearts catches sight of the      little box lying between them and takes it up  my god       then raising himself he closes his brothers eyes and as he      does so catches sight of a paper pinned to the couch detaches      it and reads  i lawrence darrant about to die by my own hand confess that i       he reads on silently in horror finishes letting the paper      drop and recoils from the couch on to a chair at the      dishevelled supper table  aghast he sits there  suddenly he      mutters  if i leave that theremy namemy whole future       he springs up takes up the paper again and again reads  my god  its ruin       he makes as if to tear it across stops and looks down at      those two covers his eyes with his hand drops the paper and      rushes to the door  but he stops there and comes back      magnetised as it were by that paper  he takes it up once more      and thrusts it into his pocket       the footsteps of a policeman pass slow and regular outside      his face crisps and quivers he stands listening till they die      away  then he snatches the paper from his pocket and goes past      the foot of the couch to the fore  all myno  let him hang       he thrusts the paper into the fire stamps it down with his      foot watches it writhe and blacken  then suddenly clutching      his head he turns to the bodies on the couch  panting and like      a man demented he recoils past the head of the couch and      rushing to the window draws the curtains and throws the window      up for air  out in the darkness rises the witchlike skeleton      tree where a dark shape seems hanging  keith starts back  whats that  what       he shuts the window and draws the dark curtains across it      again  fool  nothing       clenching his fists he draws himself up steadying himself      with all his might  then slowly he moves to the door stands a      second like a carved figure his face hard as stone       deliberately he turns out the light opens the door and goes       the still bodies lie there before the fire which is licking at      the last blackened wafer   curtain       the little man  a farcical morality in three scenes

afternoon on the departure platform of an austrian railway      station  at several little tables outside the buffet persons      are taking refreshment served by a pale young waiter  on a      seat

democraticbut thats quite a proposition  englishman  handling coffeepot to his wife  more  englishwoman  no thanks  german  abruptly  these fellowsif you treat them in this manner at once they take liberties  you see you will not get your beer       as he speaks the waiter returns bringing the little mans      beer then retires  american  that pears to be one up to democracy  to the little man  i judge you go in for brotherhood  little man  startled  oh no  american  i take considerable stock in leo tolstoi myself  grand mangrandsouled apparatus  but i guess youve got to pinch those waiters some to make em skip  to the english who have carelessly looked his way for a moment  youll appreciate that the way he acted about my eggs       the english make faint motions with their chins and avert their      eyes       to the waiter who is standing at the door of the buffet  waiter  flash of beerjump now  waiter  komm gleich  german  cigarren  waiter  schon       he disappears  american  affablyto the little man  now if i dont get that flash of beer quickern you got yours i shall admire  german  abruptly  tolstoi is nothing nichts  no good  ha  american  relishing the approach of argument  well that is a matter of temperament  now im all for equality  see that poor woman therevery humble womanthere she sits among us with her baby  perhaps youd like to locate her somewhere else  german  shrugging  tolstoi is sentimentalisch  nietzsche is the true philosopher the only one  american  well thats quite in the prospectusvery stimulating partyold nietchvirgin mind  but give me leo  he turns to the redcheeked youth  what do you opine sir  i guess by your labels youll be dutch  do they read tolstoi in your country       the dutch youth laughs  american  that is a very luminous answer  german  tolstoi is nothing  man should himself express  he must pushhe must be strong  american  that is so  in america we believe in virility we like a man to expand  but we believe in brotherhood too  we draw the line at niggers but we aspire  social barriers and distinctions weve not much use for  englishman  do you feel a draught  englishwoman  with a shiver of her shoulder toward the american  i dorather  german  wait  you are a young people  american  that is so there are no flies on us  to the little man who has been gazing eagerly from face to face  say  id like to have you give us your sentiments in relation to the duty of man       the little man fidgets and is about to opens his mouth  american  for exampleis it your opinion that we should kill off the weak and diseased and all that cant jump around  german  nodding ja ja  that is coming  little man  looking from face to face  they might be me       the dutch youth laughs  american  reproving him with a look  thats true humility tisnt grammar  now heres a proposition that brings it nearer the bone  would you step out of your way to help them when it was liable to bring you trouble  german  nein nein  that is stupid  little man  eager but wistful  im afraid not  of course one wants tothere was st francis dassisi and st julien lhospitalier and  american  very lofty dispositions  guess they died of them  he rises  shake hands sirmy name ishe hands a card  i am an icemachine maker  he shakes the little mans hand i like your sentimentsi feel kind of brotherly  catching sight of the waiter appearing in the doorway  waiter where to hll is that glass of beer  german  cigarren  waiter  komm gleich  englishman  consulting watch  trains late  englishwoman  really  nuisance       a station policeman very square and uniformed passes and      repasses  american  resuming his seatto the german  now we dont have so much of that in america  guess we feel more to trust in human nature  german  ah  ha  you will bresently find there is nothing in him but self  little man  wistfully  dont you believe in human nature  american  very stimulating question       he looks round for opinions  the dutch youth laughs  englishman holding out his half of the paper to his wife  swap       his wife swaps  german  in human nature i believe so far as i can see himno more  american  now that pears to me kind o blasphemy  i believe in heroism  i opine theres not one of us settin around here thats not a herogive him the occasion  little man  oh  do you believe that  american  well  i judge a hero is just a person thatll help another at the expense of himself  take that poor woman there well now shes a heroine i guess  she would die for her baby any old time  german  animals will die for their babies  that is nothing  american  i carry it further  i postulate we would all die for that baby if a locomotive was to trundle up right here and try to handle it  to the german  i guess you dont know how good you are  as the german is twisting up the ends of his moustacheto the englishwoman  i should like to have you express an opinion maam  englishwoman  i beg your pardon  american  the english are very humanitarian they have a very high sense of duty  so have the germans so have the americans  to the dutch youth  i judge even in your little country they have that this is an epoch of equality and hightoned ideals  to the little man  what is your nationality sir  little man  im afraid im nothing particular  my father was halfenglish and halfamerican and my mother halfgerman and halfdutch  american  my  thats a bit streaky any old way  the policeman passes again  now i dont believe weve much use any more for those gentlemen in buttons  weve grown kind of mildwe dont think of self as we used to do       the waiter has appeared in the doorway  german  in a voice of thunder cigarren  donnerwetter  american  shaking his fist at the vanishing waiter  that flash of beer  waiter  komm gleich  american  a little more and he will join george washington  i was about to remark when he intruded in this year of grace 1913 the kingdom of christ is quite a going concern  we are mighty near universal brotherhood  the colonel here he indicates the german is a man of blood and iron but give him an opportunity to be magnanimous and hell be right there  oh sir  yep       the german with a profound mixture of pleasure and cynicism      brushes up the ends of his moustache  little man  i wonder  one wants to but somehowhe shakes his head  american you seem kind of skeery about that  youve had experience maybe  im an optimisti think were bound to make the devil hum in the near future  i opine we shall occasion a good deal of trouble to that old party  theres about to be a holocaust of selfish interests  the colonel there with oldman nietch he wont know himself  theres going to be a very sacred opportunity       as he speaks the voice of a railway official is heard an the      distance calling out in german  it approaches and the words      become audible  german  startled der teufel  he gets up and seizes the bag beside him       the station official has appeared he stands for a moment      casting his commands at the seated group  the dutch youth also      rises and takes his coat and hat  the official turns on his      heel and retires still issuing directions  englishman  what does he say  german  our drain has come in de oder platform only one minute we haf       all have risen in a fluster  american  now thats very provoking  i wont get that flash of beer       there is a general scurry to gather coats and hats and wraps      during which the lowly woman is seen making desperate attempts      to deal with her baby and the two large bundles  quite      defeated she suddenly puts all down wrings her hands and      cries out herr jesu  hilfe  the flying procession turn      their heads at that strange cry  american  whats that  help       he continues to run  the little man spins round rushes back      picks up baby and bundle on which it was seated  little man  come along good woman come along       the woman picks up the other bundle and they run       the waiter appearing in the doorway with the bottle of beer      watches with his tired smile                                 curtain     scene ii       a secondclass compartment of a corridor carriage in motion      in it are seated the englishman and his wife opposite each      other at the corridor end she with her face to the engine he      with his back  both are somewhat protected from the rest of the      travellers by newspapers  next to her sits the german and      opposite him sits the american next the american in one window      corner is seated the dutch youth the other window corner is      taken by the germans bag  the silence is only broken by the      slight rushing noise of the trains progression and the      crackling of the english newspapers  american  turning to the dutch youth  guess id like that window raised its kind of chilly after that old run they gave us       the dutch youth laughs and goes through the motions of raising      the window  the english regard the operation with uneasy      irritation  the german opens his bag which reposes on the      corner seat next him and takes out a book  american  the germans are great readers  very stimulating practice i read most anything myself       the german holds up the book so that the title may be read  don quixotefine book  we americans take considerable stock in old man quixote  bit of a wildcatbut we dont laugh at him  german  he is dead  dead as a sheep  a good thing too  american  in america we have still quite an amount of chivalry  german  chivalry is nothing sentimentalisch  in modern daysno good  a man must push he must pull  american  so you say  but i judge your form of chivalry is sacrifice to the state  we allow more freedom to the individual soul  where theres something little and weak we feel it kind of noble to give up to it  that way we feel elevated       as he speaks there is seen in the corridor doorway the little      man with the womans baby still on his arm and the bundle held      in the other hand  he peers in anxiously  the english acutely      conscious try to dissociate themselves from his presence with      their papers  the dutch youth laughs  german  ach  so  american  dear me  little man  is there room  i cant find a seat  american  why yes  theres a seat for one  little man  depositing bundle outside and heaving baby  may i  american  come right in       the german sulkily moves his bag  the little man comes in and      seats himself gingerly  american  wheres the mother  little man  ruefully  afraid she got left behind       the dutch youth laughs  the english unconsciously emerge from      their newspapers  american  my  that would appear to be quite a domestic incident       the englishman suddenly utters a profound ha ha and      disappears behind his paper  and that paper and the one      opposite are seen to shake and little sguirls and squeaks      emerge  german  and you haf got her bundle and her baby  ha  he cackles drily  american  gravely  i smile  i guess providence has played it pretty low down on you  its sure acted real mean       the baby wails and the little man jigs it with a sort of      gentle desperation looking apologetically from face to face      his wistful glance renews the fore of merriment wherever it      alights  the american alone preserves a gravity which seems      incapable of being broken  american  maybe youd better get off right smart and restore that baby  theres nothing can act madder than a mother  little man  poor thing yes  what she must be suffering       a gale of laughter shakes the carriage  the english for a      moment drop their papers the better to indulge  the little man      smiles a wintry smile  american  in a lull  how did it eventuate  little man  we got there just as the train was going to start and i jumped thinking i could help her up  but it moved too quickly andand left her       the gale of laughter blows up again  american  guess id have thrown the baby out to her  little man  i was afraid the poor little thing might break       the baby wails the little man heaves it the gale of laughter      blows  american  gravely  its highly entertainingnot for the baby what kind of an old baby is it anyway  he sniffs  i judge its a bitniffy  little man  afraid ive hardly looked at it yet  american  which end up is it  little mam  oh  i think the right end  yes yes it is  american  well thats something  maybe you should hold it out of window a bit  very excitable things babies  englishwoman  galvanized  no no  englishman  touching her knee  my dear  american  you are right maam  i opine theres a draught out there  this baby is precious  weve all of us got stock in this baby in a manner of speaking  this is a little bit of universal brotherhood  is it a woman baby  little man  ii can only see the top of its head  american  you cant always tell from that  it looks kind of overwrapped up  maybe it had better be unbound  german  nein nein nein  american  i think you are very likely right colonel  it might be a pity to unbind that baby  i guess the lady should be consulted in this matter  englishwoman  yes yes of course  englishman  touching her  let it be  little beggar seems all right  american  that would seem only known to providence at this moment i judge it might be due to humanity to look at its face  little man  gladly  its sucking my finger  there therenice little thingthere  american  i would surmise in your leisure moments you have created babies sir  little man  oh noindeed no  american  dear methat is a loss  addressing himself to the carriage at large  i think we may esteem ourselves fortunate to have this little stranger right here with us  demonstrates what a hold the little and weak have upon us nowadays  the colonel herea man of blood and ironthere he sits quite calm next door to it  he sniffs  now this baby is rather chasteningthat is a sign of grace in the colonelthat is true heroism  little man  faintly  ii can see its face a little now       all bend forward  american  what sort of a physiognomy has it anyway  little man  still faintly  i dont see anything butbut spots  german  oh  ha  pfui       the dutch youth laughs  american  i am told that is not uncommon amongst babies  perhaps we could have you inform us maam  englishwoman  yes of courseonly what sort of  little man  they seem all over itsat the slight recoil of everyone i feel sure itsits quite a good baby underneath  american  that will be rather difficult to come at  im just a bit sensitive  ive very little use for affections of the epidermis  german  pfui  he has edged away as far as he can get and is lighting a big cigar       the dutch youth draws his legs back  american  also taking out a cigar  i guess it would be well to fumigate this carriage  does it suffer do you think  little man  peering  really i dontim not surei know so little about babies  i think it would have a nice expressionifif it showed  american  is it kind of boiled looking  little man  yesyes it is  american  looking gravely round  i judge this baby has the measles       the german screws himself spasmodically against the arm of the      englishwomans seat  englishwoman  poor little thing  shall i       she half rises  englishman  touching her  no nodash it  american  i honour your emotion maam  it does credit to us all but i sympathize with your husband too  the measles is a very important pestilence in connection with a grown woman  little man  it likes my finger awfully  really its rather a sweet baby  american  sniffing  well that would appear to be quite a question  about them spots now  are they rosy  little man  noo theyre dark almost black  german  gott  typhus  he bounds up on to the arm of the englishwomans seat  american  typhus  thats quite an indisposition       the dutch youth rises suddenly and bolts out into the      corridor  he is followed by the german puffing clouds of      smoke  the english and american sit a moment longer without      speaking  the englishwomans face is turned with a curious      expressionhalf pity half feartowards the little man  then      the englishman gets up  englishman  bit stuffy for you here dear isnt it       he puts his arm through hers raises her and almost pushes her      through the doorway  she goes still looking back  american  gravely  theres nothing i admire moren courage  guess ill go and smoke in the corridor       as he goes out the little man looks very wistfully after him      screwing up his mouth and nose he holds the baby away from him      and wavers then rising he puts it on the seat opposite and      goes through the motions of letting down the window  having      done so he looks at the baby who has begun to wail  suddenly      he raises his hands and clasps them like a child praying      since however the baby does not stop wailing he hovers over      it in indecision then picking it up sits down again to dandle      it with his face turned toward the open window  finding that      it still wails he begins to sing to it in a cracked little      voice  it is charmed at once  while he is singing the      american appears in the corridor  letting down the passage      window he stands there in the doorway with the draught blowing      his hair and the smoke of his cigar all about him  the little      man stops singing and shifts the shawl higher to protect the      babys head from the draught  american  gravely  this is the most sublime spectacle i have ever envisaged  there ought to be a record of this       the little man looks at him wondering  you are typical sir      of the sentiments of modern christianity  you illustrate the      deepest feelings in the heart of every man       the little man rises with the baby and a movement of approach  guess im wanted in the diningcar       he vanishes  the little man sits down again but back to the      engine away from the draught and looks out of the window      patiently jogging the baby on his knee                                 curtain

stopped crying      gazes at the little man who sits dazedly looking up  suddenly      she drops on her knees and with her free hand lifts his booted      foot and kisses it  american  waving his hat  ra  ra  he descends swiftly goes up to the little man whose arm the policeman has dropped and takes his hand  brother i am proud to know you  this is one of the greatest moments i have ever experienced  displaying the little man to the assembled company  i think i sense the situation when i say that we all esteem it an honour to breathe the rather inferior atmosphere of this station here along with our little friend  i guess we shall all go home and treasure the memory of his face as the whitest thing in our museum of recollections  and perhaps this good woman will also go home and wash the face of our little brother here  i am inspired with a new faith in mankind  ladies and gentlemen i wish to present to you a sureenough saintonly wants a halo to be transfigured to the little

draws himself up      very straight and bows quickly twice  the englishman and his      wife approach at least two steps then thinking better of it      turn to each other and recede  the mother kisses his hand  the      porter returning with the sanitatsmachine turns it on from      behind and its pinkish shower goldened by a ray of sunlight      falls around the little mans head transfiguring it as he      stands with eyes upraised to see whence the portent comes  american  rushing forward and dropping on his knees  hold on just a minute  guess ill take a snapshot of the

intense soft bitterness in her voice he gets up      feeling stifled and stands at the window  a newspaper boy some      way off is calling his wares  the girls fingers slip between      his own and stay unmoving  he looks round into her face  in      spite of makeup it has a queer unholy touching beauty  young off  with an outburst  no we dont only love ourselves there is more  i cant explain but theres something great theres kindnessandand       the shouting of newspaper boys grows louder and their cries      passionately vehement clash into each other and obscure each      word  his head goes up to listen her hand tightens within his      armshe too is listening  the cries come nearer hoarser more      shrill and clamorous the empty moonlight outside seems suddenly      crowded with figures footsteps voices and a fierce distant      cheering  great victorygreat victory  official  british      eavy defeat of the uns  many thousand prisoners  eavy      defeat it speeds by intoxicating filling him with a fearful      joy he leans far out waving his cap and cheering like a      madman the night seems to flutter and vibrate and answer  he      turns to rush down into the street strikes against something      soft and recoils  the girl stands with hands clenched and      face convulsed panting  all confused with the desire to do      something he stoops to kiss her hand  she snatches away her      fingers sweeps up the notes he has put down and holds them out      to him  girl  take themi will not haf your english moneytake them       suddenly she tears them across twice thrice lets the bits      flutter to the floor and turns her back on him  he stands      looking at her leaning against the plushcovered table her head      down a dark figure in a dark room with the moonlight      sharpening her outline  hardly a moment he stays then makes      for the door  when he is gone she still stands there her chin      on her breast with the sound in her ears of cheering of      hurrying feet and voices crying eavy defeat stands in the      centre of a pattern made by the fragments of the tornup notes      staring out unto the moonlight seeing not this hated room and      the hated square outside but a german orchard and herself a      little girl plucking apples a big dog beside her and a      hundred other pictures such as the drowning see  then she      sinks down on the floor lays her forehead on the dusty carpet      and presses her body to it  mechanically she sweeps together      the scattered fragments of notes assembling them with the dust      into a little pile as of fallen leaves and dabbling in it with      her fingers while the tears run down her cheeks  girl  defeat  der vaterland  defeat     one shillin       then

windows  vane  is that boulder firm  props  going to where in front of the backcloth and apparently among its apple trees lies the counterfeitment of a mossy boulder he puts his foot on it  if you dont put too much weight on it sir  vane  it wont creak  props  nao  he mounts on it and a dolorous creaking arises  vane  make that right  let me see that lute       props produces a property lute  while they scrutinize it a      broad man with broad leathery cleanshaven face and small mouth      occupied by the butt end of a cigar has come on to the stage      from stage left and stands waiting to be noticed  props  attracted by the scent of the cigar  the boss sir  vane  turning to props  thatll do then       props goes out through the french windows  vane  to frust  now sir were all ready for rehearsal of orpheus with his lute  frust  in a cosmopolitan voice  orphoos with his loot  that his loot mr vane  why didnt he pinch something more precious  has this highbrow curtainraiser of

if its got punch and go thatll be enough for me lets get to it       he extinguishes his cigar and descends the steps and sits in      the centre of the front row of the stalls  vane  mr foreson  foreson  appearing through curtain right  sir  vane  beginners  take your curtain down       he descends the steps and seats himself next to frust  the      curtain goes down       a womans voice is heard singing very beautifully sullivans      song orpheus with his lute with his lute made trees and the      mountain tops that freeze etc  frust  some voice       the curtain rises in the armchair the professor is yawning      tall thin abstracted and slightly grizzled in the hair  he      has a pad of paper over his knee ink on the stool to his right      and the encyclopedia volume on the stand to his leftbarricaded      in fact by the article he is writing  he is reading a page over      to himself but the words are drowned in the sound of the song      his wife is singing in the next room partly screened off by the      curtain  she finishes and stops  his voice can then be heard      conning the words of his article  prof  orpheus symbolized the voice of beauty the call of life luring us mortals with his song back from the graves we dig for ourselves  probably the ancients realized this neither more nor less than we moderns  mankind has not changed  the civilized being still hides the faun and the dryad within its broadcloth and its silk  and yethe stops with a driedup airrather impatiently  go on my dear  it helps the atmosphere       the voice of his wife begins again gets as far as made them      sing and stops dead just as the professors pen is beginning      to scratch  and suddenly drawing the curtain further aside       she appears  much younger than the professor pale very      pretty of a botticellian type in face figure and in her      clinging creamcoloured frock  she gazes at her abstracted      husband then swiftly moves to the lintel of the open window      and stands looking out  the wife  god  what beauty  prof  looking up  umm  the wife  i said god  what beauty  prof  aha  the wife  looking at him  do you know that i have to repeat everything to you nowadays  prof  what  the wife  that i have to repeat  prof  yes i heard  im sorry  i get absorbed  the wife  in all but me  prof  startled  my dear your song was helping me like anything to get the mood  this paper is the very deuceto balance between the historical and the natural  the wife  who wants the natural  prof  grumbling  umm  wish i thought that  modern taste history may go hang theyre all for tuppencecoloured sentiment nowadays  the wife  as if to herself  is the spring sentiment  prof  i beg your pardon my dear i didnt catch  wife  as if against her willurged by some pentup force  beauty beauty  prof  thats what im trying to say here  the orpheus legend symbolizes to this day the call of beauty  he takes up his pen while she continues to stare out at the moonlight  yawning  dash it  i get so sleepy i wish youd tell them to make the afterdinner coffee twice as strong  wife  i will  prof  how does this strike you  conning  many renaissance pictures especially those of botticelli francesca and piero di cosimo were inspired by such legends as that of orpheus and we owe a tiny gemlike raphael apollo and marsyas to the same pagan inspiration  wife  we owe it more than thatrebellion against the dryasdust  prof  quite  i might develop that we owe it our revolt against the academic or our disgust at big business and all the grossness of commercial success  we owe  his voice peters out  wife  itlove  prof  abstracted  eh  wife  i said we owe it love  prof  rather startled  possibly  buter  with a dry smile i mustnt say that herehardly  wife  to herself and the moonlight  orpheus with his lute  prof  most people think a lute is a sort of flute  yawning heavily  my dear if youre not going to sing again dyou mind sitting down  i want to concentrate  wife  im going out  prof  mind the dew  wife  the christian virtues and the dew  prof  with a little dry laugh  not bad  not bad  the christian virtues and the dew  his hand takes up his pen his face droops over his paper while his wife looks at him with a very strange face how far we can trace the modern resurgence against the christian virtues to the symbolic figures of orpheus pan apollo and bacchus might be difficult to estimate but       during those words his wife has passed through the window into      the moonlight and her voice rises singing as she goes      orpheus with his lute with his lute made trees     prof  suddenly aware of something  shell get her throat bad he is silent as the voice swells in the distance  sounds queer at nighthm  he is silentyawning  the voice dies away  suddenly his head nods he fights his drowsiness writes a word or two nods again and in twenty seconds is asleep       the stage is darkened by a blackout  frusts voice is heard      speaking  frust  whats that girls name  vane  vanessa hellgrove  frust  aha       the stage is lighted up again  moonlight bright on the      orchard the room in darkness where the professors figure is      just visible sleeping in the chair and screwed a little more      round towards the window  from behind the mossy boulder a      faunlike figure uncurls itself and peeps over with ears      standing up and elbows leaning on the stone playing a rustic      pipe and there are seen two rabbits and a fox sitting up and      listening  a shiver of wind passes blowing petals from the      appletrees       the faun darts his head towards where from right comes slowly      the figure of a greek youth holding a lute or lyre which his      fingers strike lifting out little wandering strains as of wind      whinnying in funnels and odd corners  the faun darts down      behind the stone and the youth stands by the boulder playing      his lute  slowly while he plays the whitened trunk of an      appletree is seen to dissolve into the body of a girl with      bare arms and feet her dark hair unbound and the face of the      professors wife  hypnotized she slowly sways towards him      their eyes fixed on each other till she is quite close  her      arms go out to him cling round his neck and their lips meet      but as they meet there comes a gasp and the professor with      rumpled hair is seen starting from his chair his hands thrown      up and at his horrified oh the stage is darkened with a      blackout       the voice of frust is heard speaking  frust  gee       the stage is lighted up again as in the opening scene  the      professor is seen in his chair with spilt sheets of paper round      him waking from a dream  he shakes himself pinches his leg      stares heavily round into the moonlight rises  prof  phew  beastly dream  boof  hm  he moves to the window and calls  blanche  blanche  to himself  made treesmade trees calling  blanche  wifes voice  yes  prof  where are you  wife  appearing by the stone with her hair down  here  prof  i sayiive been asleephad a dream  come in  ill tell you       she comes and they stand in the window  prof  i dreamed i saw afaun on that boulder blowing on a pipe  he looks nervously at the stone  with two damned little rabbits and a fox sitting up and listening  and then from out there came our friend orpheus playing on his confounded lute till he actually turned that tree there into you  and gradually hehe drew you like a snake till youerput your arms round his neck anderkissed him boof  i woke up  most unpleasant  why  your hairs down  wife  yes  prof  why  wife  it was no dream  he was bringing me to life  prof  what on earth  wife  do you suppose i am alive  im as dead as euridice  prof  good heavens blanche whats the matter with you tonight  wife  pointing to the litter of papers  why dont we live instead of writing of it  she points out unto the moonlight  what do we get out of life  money fame fashion talk learning  yes  and what good are they  i want to live  prof  helplessly  my dear i really dont know what you mean  wife  pointing out into the moonlight  look  orpheus with his lute and nobody can see him  beauty beauty beautywe let it go with sudden passion  beauty love the spring  they should be in us and theyre all outside  prof  my dear this isthis isawful  he tries to embrace her  wife  avoiding himan a stilly voice  oh  go on with your writing  prof  imim upset  ive never known you soso  wife  hysterical  well  its over  ill go and sing  prof  soothingly  there there  im sorry darling i really am youre kippedyoure kipped  he gives and she accepts a kiss better       he gravitates towards his papers  all right now  wife  standing still and looking at him  quite  prof  well ill try and finish this tonight then tomorrow we might have a jaunt  how about a theatre  theres a thingthey say called chinese chops thats been running years  wife  softly to herself as he settles down into his chair  oh god       while he takes up a sheet of paper and adjusts himself she      stands at the window staring with all her might at the boulder      till from behind it the fauns head and shoulders emerge once      more  prof  very queer the power suggestion has over the mind  very queer  theres nothing really in animism you know except the curious shapes rocks trees and things take in certain lightseffect they have on our imagination  he looks up  whats the matter now  wife  startled  nothing  nothing       her eyes waver to him again and the faun vanishes  she turns      again to look at the boulder there is nothing there a little      shiver of wind blows some petals off the trees  she catches one      of them and turning quickly goes out through the curtain  prof  coming to himself and writing  the orpheus legend is the erapotheosis of animism  can we accept his voice is lost in the sound of his wifes voice beginning again orpheus with his lutewith his lute made trees it dies in a sob  the professor looks up startled as the curtain falls  frust  fine  fine  vane  take up the curtain  mr foreson       the curtain goes up
