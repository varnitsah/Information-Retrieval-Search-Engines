87799616	oxford  by andrew lang   preface    these papers do not profess even to sketch the outlines of a history of oxford  they are merely records of the impressions made by this or that aspect of the life of the university as it has been in different ages  oxford is not an easy place to design in black and white with the pen or the etchers needle  on a wild winter or late autumn day such as father faber has made permanent in a beautiful poem the sunshine fleets along the plain revealing towers and floods and trees in a gleam of watery light and leaving them once more in shadow  the melancholy mist creeps over the city the damp soaks into the heart of everything and such suicidal weather ensues as has been described once for all by the author of johnadreams how different oxford looks when the road to cowley marsh is dumb with dust when the heat seems almost tropical and by the drowsy banks of the cherwell you might almost expect some shy southern waterbeast to come crashing through the reeds  and such a day again is unlike the bright weather of late september when all the gold and scarlet of bagley wood are concentrated in the leaves that cover the walls of magdalen with an imperial vesture  our memories of oxford if we have long made her a castle of indolence vary no less than do the shifting aspects of her scenery days of spring and of mere pleasure in existence have alternated with days of gloom and loneliness of melancholy of resignation  our mental pictures of the place are tinged by many moods as the landscape is beheld in shower and sunshine in frost and in the colourless drizzling weather  oxford that once seemed a pleasant porch and entrance into life may become a dingy anteroom where we kick our heels with other weary waiting people  at last if men linger there too late oxford grows a prison and it is the final condition of the loiterer to take this for a hermitage  it is well to leave the enchantress betimes and to carry away few but kind recollections  if there be any who think and speak ungently of their alma mater it is because they have outstayed their natural welcome while or because they have resisted her genial influence in youth    chapter ithe town before the university    most old towns are like palimpsests parchments which have been scrawled over again and again by their successive owners  oxford though not one of the most ancient of english cities shows more legibly than the rest the handwriting as it were of many generations  the convenient site among the interlacing waters of the isis and the cherwell has commended itself to men in one age after another  each generation has used it for its own purpose  for war for trade for learning for religion and war trade religion and learning have left on oxford their peculiar marks  no set of its occupants before the last two centuries began was very eager to deface or destroy the buildings of its predecessors  old things were turned to new uses or altered to suit new tastes they were not overthrown and carted away  thus in walking through oxford you see everywhere in colleges chapels and churches doors and windows which have been builded up or again openings which have been cut where none originally existed  the upper part of the round norman arches in the cathedral has been preserved and converted into the circular bullseye lights which the last century liked  it is the same everywhere except where modern restorers have had their way thus the life of england for some eight centuries may be traced in the buildings of oxford  nay if we are convinced by some antiquaries the eastern end of the high street contains even earlier scratches on this palimpsest of oxford the rude marks of savages who scooped out their damp nests and raised their low walls in the gravel on the spot where the new schools are to stand  here half naked men may have trapped the beaver in the cherwell and hither they may have brought home the boars which they slew in the trackless woods of headington and bagley  it is with the life of historical oxford however and not with these fancies that we are concerned though these papers have no pretension to be a history of oxford  a series of pictures of mens life here is all they try to sketch  it is hard though not impossible to form a picture in the mind of oxford as she was when she is first spoken of by history  what she may have been when legend only knows her when st frideswyde built a home for religious maidens when she fled from king algar and hid among the swine and after a whole fairy tale of adventures died in great sanctity we cannot even guess  this legend of st frideswyde and of her foundation the germ of the cathedral and of christ church is not indeed without its value and significance for those who care for oxford  this home of religion and of learning was a home of religion from the beginning and her later life is but a return after centuries of war and trade to her earliest purpose what manner of village of wooden houses may have surrounded the earliest rude chapels and places of prayer we cannot readily guess but imagination may look back on oxford as she was when the english chronicle first mentions her  even then it is not unnatural to think oxford might well have been a city of peace  she lies in the very centre of england and the northmen as they marched inland burning church and cloister must have wandered long before they came to oxford  on the other hand the military importance of the site must have made it a town that would be eagerly contended for  any places of strength in oxford would command the roads leading to the north and west and the secure raised paths that ran through the flooded fens to the ford or bridge if bridge there then was between godstowe and the later norman grand pont where folly bridge now spans the isis  somewhere near oxford the roads that ran towards banbury and the north or towards bristol and the west would be obliged to cross the river  the waterway too and the paths by the thames side were commanded by oxford  the danes as they followed up the course of the thames from london would be drawn thither sooner or later and would covet a place which is surrounded by half a dozen deep natural moats  lastly oxford lay in the centre of england indeed but on the very marches of mercia and wessex  a border town of natural strength and of commanding situation she can have been no mean or poor collection of villages in the days when she is first spoken of when eadward the elder incorporated with his own kingdom the whole mercian lands on both sides of watling street freemans norman conquest vol i p 57 and took possession of london and of oxford as the two most important parts of a scientific frontier  if any man had stood in the days of eadward on the hill that was not yet shotover and had looked along the plain to the place where the grey spires of oxford are clustered now as it were in a purple cup of the low hills he would have seen little but the smoke floating up through the oakwood and the coppice   greek text which cannot be reproduced   the low hills were not yet cleared nor the fens and the wolds trimmed and enclosed  centuries later when the early students came they had to ride through the thick forest and across the moor to the east gate of the city munimenta academica oxon vol i p 60  in the midst of a country still wild oxford was already no mean city but the place where the hostile races of the land met to settle their differences to feast together and forget their wrongs over the mead and ale or to devise treacherous murder and close the banquet with fire and sword  again and again after eadward the elder took mercia the danes went about burning and wasting england  the wooden towns were flaming through the night and sending up a thick smoke through the day from thamesmouth to cambridge  and next was there no headman that force would gather and each fled as swift as he might and soon was there no shire that would help another  when the first fury of the plundering invaders was over when the northmen had begun to wish to settle and till the land and have some measure of peace the early meetings between them and the english rulers were held in the border town in oxford  thus sigeferth and morkere sons of earngrim came to see eadric in oxford and there were slain at a banquet while their followers perished in the attempt to avenge them  into the tower of st frideswyde they were driven and as men could not drive them thence the tower was fired and they perished in the burning so says william of malmesbury who so many years later read the story as he says in the records of the church of st frideswyde there is another version of the story in the codex diplomaticus dccix  aethelred is made to say in a deed of grant of lands to st frideswydes church mine own minster that the danes were slain in the massacre of st brice  on that day aethelred by the advice of his satraps determined to destroy the tares among the wheat the danes in england  certain of these fled into the minster as into a fortress and therefore it was burned and the books and monuments destroyed  for this cause aethelred gives lands to the minster fro charwell brigge andlong the streame fro merewell to rugslawe fro the lawe to the foule putte and so forth it is pleasant to see how old are the familiar names cherwell hedington couelee or cowley where the college cricketgrounds are  three years passed and the headmen of the english and of the danes met at oxford again and more peacefully and agreed to live together obedient to the laws of eadgar to the law that is as it was administered in older days that seem happier and better ruled to men looking back on them from an age of confusion and bloodshed  at oxford too met the peaceful gathering of 1035 when danish and english claims were in some sort reconciled and at oxford harold harefoot the son of cnut died in march 1040  the place indeed was fatal to kings for st frideswyde in her anger against king algar left her curse on it  just as the old irish kings were forbidden by their customs to do this or that to cross a certain moor on may morning or to listen to the winnowing of the nightfowls wings in the dusk above the lake of tara so the kings of england shunned to enter oxford and to come within the walls of frideswyde the maiden harold died there as we have seen but there he was not buried  his body was laid at westminster where it could not rest for his enemies dug it up and cast it forth upon the fens or threw it into the river  many years later when henry iii entered oxford not without fear the curse of frideswyde lighted also upon him  he came in 1263 with edward the prince and misfortune fell upon him so that his barons defeated and took him prisoner at the battle of lewes  the chronicler of oseney abbey mentions his contempt of superstitions and how he alone of english kings entered the city quod nullus rex attemptavit a tempore regis algari an error for harold attemptavit and died  when edward i was king he was less audacious than his father and in 1275 he rode up to the east gate and turned his horses head about and sought a lodging outside the town reflexis habenis equitans extra moenia aulam regiain in suburbio positam introivit  in 1280 however he seems to have plucked up courage and attended a chapter of dominicans in oxford  the last of the meetings between north and south was held at oxford in october 1065  in urle quae famoso nomine oxnaford nuncupatur to quote a document of cnuts  cod dipl dccxlvi in 1042  there the northumbrian rebels met harold in the last days of edward the confessor  with this meeting we leave that oxford before the conquest of which possibly not one stone or one rafter remains we look back through eight hundred years on a city rich enough it seems and powerful and we see the narrow streets full of armed bands of menmen that wear the cognisance of the horse or of the raven that carry short swords and are quick to draw them men that dress in short kirtles of a bright colour scarlet or blue that wear axes slung on their backs and adorn their bare necks and arms with collars and bracelets of gold  we see them meeting to discuss laws and frontiers and feasting late when business is done and chaffering for knives with ivory handles for arrows and saddles and wadmal in the booths of the citizens  through the mist of time this picture of ancient oxford may be distinguished  we are tempted to think of a low grey twilight above that wet land suddenly lit up with fire of the tall towers of st frideswydes minster flaring like a torch athwart the night of poplars waving in the same wind that drives the vapour and smoke of the holy place down on the danes who have taken refuge there and there stand at bay against the english and the people of the town  the material oxford of our times is not more unlike the oxford of low wooden booths and houses and of wooden spires and towers than the life led in its streets was unlike the academic life of today  the conquest brought no more quiet times but the whole city was wrecked stormed and devastated before the second period of its history began before it was the seat of a norman stronghold and one of the links of the chain by which england was bound  four hundred and seventyeight houses were so ruined as to be unable to pay taxes while within the town or without the wall there were but two hundred and fortythree houses which did yield tribute  with the buildings of robert doily a follower of the conquerors and the husband of an english wife the heiress of wigod of wallingford the new oxford begins  roberts work may be divided roughly into two classes  first there are the strong places he erected to secure his possessions and second the sacred places he erected to secure the pardon of heaven for his robberies  of the castle and its shining coronal of towers only one tower remains from the vast strength of this picturesque edifice with the natural moat flowing at its feet we may guess what the castle must have been in the early days of the conquest and during the wars of stephen and matilda  we may guess too that the burghers of oxford and the rustics of the neighbourhood had no easy life in those days when as we have seen the town was ruined and when as the extraordinary thickness of the walls of its remaining tower demonstrates the castle was built by new lords who did not spare the forced labour of the vanquished  the strength of the position of the castle is best estimated after viewing the surrounding country from the top of the tower  through the more modern embrasures or over the low wall round the summit you look up and down the valley of the thames and gaze deep into the folds of the hills  the prospect is pleasant enough on an autumn morning with the domes and spires of modern oxford breaking like islands through the sea of mist that sweeps above the roofs of the good town  in the old times no movement of the people who had their fastnesses in the fens no approach of an army from any direction could have evaded the watchman  the towers guarded the fords and the bridge and were themselves almost impregnable except when a hard winter made the thames the cherwell and the many deep and treacherous streams passable as happened when matilda was beleaguered in oxford  this natural strength of the site is demonstrated by the vast mound within the castle walls which tradition calls the jews mound but which is probably earlier than the norman buildings  some other race had chosen the castle site for its fortress in times of which we know nothing  meanwhile some of the practical citizens of oxford wish to level the jews mound and to utilise the gravel of which it is largely composed  there is nothing to be said against this economic project which could interest or affect the persons who entertain it  m brunetdebaines illustration shows the mill on a site which must be as old as the tower  did the citizens bring their corn to be tolled and ground at the lords mill  though robert was bent on works of war he had a nature inclined to piety and his piety beginning at home he founded the church of st george within the castle  the crypt of the church still remains and is not without interest for persons who like to trace the changing fortunes of old buildings  the site of roberts castle is at present occupied by the county gaol  when you have inspected the tower which does not do service as a dungeon you are taken by the courtesy of the governor to the crypt and satisfy your archaeological curiosity  the place is much lower and worse lighted than the contemporary crypt of st petersintheeast but not perhaps less interesting  the squareheaded capitals have not been touched like some of those in st peters by a later chisel the place is dank and earthy but otherwise much as robert doily left it  there is an oddlooking arrangement of planks on the floor it is the new drop which is found to work very well and gives satisfaction to the persons who have to employ it  sinister the norman castle was in its beginning it was from the castle that men did wrong to the poor around them it was from the castle that they bade defiance to the king who stranger and tyrant as he might be was still a protector against smaller tyrants  sinister the castle remains you enter it through ironed and bolted doors you note the prisoners at their dreary exercises and when you have seen the engines of the law lying in the old crypt you pass out into the place of execution  here in a corner made by roberts tower and by the wall of the prison is a dank little quadrangle  the ground is of the yellow clay and gravel which floors most oxford quadrangles  a few letters are scratched on the soft stone of the wallthe letters h r are the freshest  these are the initials of the last man who suffered death in this cornera young rustic who had murdered his sweetheart  h r on the prison wall is all his record and his body lies under your feet and the feet of the men who are to die here in after days pass over his tomb  it is thus that malefactors are buried within the walls of the gaol  one is glad enough to leave the remains of roberts place of armsas glad as matilda may have been when they let her down at night from the tower with ropes and she stole out and went on foot to wallingford  robert seems at first to have made the natural use of his strength  rich he was and spared not rich or poor to take their livelihood away and to lay up treasures for himself  he stole the lands of the monks of abingdon but of what service were moats and walls and dungeons and instruments of torture against the powers that side with monks  the chronicle of abingdon has a very diverting account of roberts punishment and conversion  he filched a certain field without the walls of oxford that of right belonged to the monastery and gave it over to the soldiers in the castle  for which loss the brethren were greatly grievedthe brethren of abingdon  therefore they gathered in a body before the altar of st michaelthe very altar that st dunstan the archbishop dedicatedand cast themselves weeping on the ground accusing robert doily and praying that his robbery of the monastery might be avenged or that he might be led to make atonement  so in a dream robert saw himself taken before our lady by two brethren of abingdon and thence carried into the very meadow he had coveted where most nasty little boys turpissimi pueri worked their will on him  thereon robert was terrified and cried out and wakened his wife who took advantage of his fears and compelled him to make restitution to the brethren  after this vision robert gave himself up to pampering the monastery and performing other good works  he it was who built a bridge over the isis and he restored the many ruined parish churches in oxford churches which perhaps he and his men had helped to ruin  the tower of st michaels in the corn is said to be of his building perhaps he only restored it for it is in the true primitive style gaunt unadorned with roundheaded windows good for shooting from with the bow  st michaels was not only a church but a watchtower of the city wall and here the old northgate called bocardo spanned the street  the rooms above the gate were used till within quite recent times and the poor inmates used to let down a greasy old hat from the window in front of the passersby and cry pity the bocardo birds   pigons qui sont en 1essoine enserrez soubz trappe voliere   as a famous paris student francois villon would have called them of bocardo no trace remains but st michaels is likely to last as long as any edifice in oxford  our illustrations represent it as it was in the last century  the houses huddle up to the church and hide the lines of the tower  now it stands out clear less picturesque than it was in the time of bocardo prison  within the last two years the windows have been cleared and the curious and most archaic pillars shaped like balustrades may be examined  it is worth while to climb the tower and remember the times when arrows were sent like hail from the narrow windows on the foes who approached oxford from the north while prayers for their confusion were read in the church below  that old oxford of war was also a trading town  nothing more than the fact that it was a favourite seat of the jews is needed to prove its commercial prosperity  the jews however demand a longer notice in connection with the still unborn university  meanwhile it may be remarked that oxford trade made good use of the river  the abingdon chronicle ii 129 tells us that from each barque of oxford city which makes the passage by the river thames past abingdon a hundred herrings must yearly be paid to the cellarer  the citizens had much litigation about land and houses with the abbey and one roger maledoctus perhaps a very early sample of the passman gave abingdon tenements within the city  thus we leave the preacademic oxford a flourishing town with merchants and moneylenders  as for the religious the brethren of st frideswyde had lived but loosely pro libito viverunt says william of malmesbury and were to be superseded by regular canons under the headship of one guimond and the patronage of the bishop of salisbury  whoever goes into christ church new buildings from the riverside will see in the old edifice facing him a certain bulging in the wall  that is the mark of the pulpit whence a brother used to read aloud to the brethren in the refectory of st frideswyde  the new leaven of learning was soon to ferment in an easy oxford where men lived pro libito under good lords the doilys who loved the english and built not churches and bridges only but the great and famous oseney abbey beyond the church of st thomas and not very far from the modern station of the great western railway  yet even after public teaching in oxford certainly began after master robert puleyn lectured in divinity there 1133 cf oseney chronicle the tower was burned down by stephens soldiery in 1141 oseney chronicle p 24    chapter iithe early studentsa day with a medieval undergraduate    oxford some one says is bitterly historical  it is difficult to escape the fanaticism of antony wood and of our antiquary bryan twyne when one deals with the obscure past of the university indeed it is impossible to understand the strange blending of new and old at oxfordthe old names with the new meaningsif we avert our eyes from what is bitterly historical  for example there is in most perhaps in all colleges a custom called collections  on the last days of term undergraduates are called into the hall where the master and the dean of the chapel sit in solemn state examination papers are set but no one heeds them very much  the real ordeal is the awful interview with the master and the dean  the former regards you with the eyes of a judge while the dean says master i am pleased to say that mr browns papers are very fair very fair  but in the matters of chapels and of catechetics mr brown setsfor a scholara very bad example to the other undergraduates  he has only once attended divine service on sunday morning and on that occasion master his dress consisted exclusively of a long greatcoat and a pair of boots  after this accusation the master will turn to the culprit and observe with emphasis ill represented by italics mr brown the college cannot hear with pleasure of such behaviour on the part of a scholar  you are gated mr brown for the first fortnight of next term  now why should this tribunal of the master and the dean and this dread examination be called collections  because munimenta academica oxon i 129 in 1331 a statute was passed to the effect that every scholar shall pay at least twelve pence ayear for lectures in logic and for physics eighteenpence ayear and that all masters of arts except persons of royal or noble family shall be obliged to collect their salary from the scholars  this collection would be made at the end of term and the name survives attached to the solemn day of doom we have described though the college dues are now collected by the bursar at the beginning of each term  by this trivial example the perversions of old customs at oxford are illustrated  to appreciate the life of the place then we must glance for a moment at the growth of the university  as to its origin we know absolutely nothing  that master puleyn began to lecture there in 1133 we have seen and it is not likely that he would have chosen oxford if oxford had possessed no schools  about these schools however we have no information  they may have grown up out of the seminary which perhaps was connected with st frideswydes just as paris university may have had some connection with the school of the palace  certainly to paris university the academic corporation of oxford the universitas owed many of her regulations while again the founder of the college system walter de merton who visited paris in company with henry iii may have compared ideas with robert de sorbonne the founder of the college of that name  in the early oxford however of the twelfth and most of the thirteenth centuries colleges with their statutes were unknown the university was the only corporation of the learned and she struggled into existence after hard fights with the town the jews the friars the papal courts  the history of the university begins with the thirteenth century  she may be said to have come into being as soon as she possessed common funds and rents as soon as fines were assigned or benefactions contributed to the maintenance of scholars  now the first recorded fine is the payment of fiftytwo shillings by the townsmen of oxford as part of the compensation for the hanging of certain clerks  in the year 1214 the papal legate in a letter to his beloved sons in christ the burgesses of oxford bade them excuse the scholars studying in oxford half the rent of their halls or hospitia for the space of ten years  the burghers were also to do penance and to feast the poorer students once a year but the important point is that they had to pay that large yearly fine propter suspendium clericorumall for the hanging of the clerks  twentysix years after this decision of the legate robert grossteste the great bishop of lincoln organised the payment and distribution of the fine and founded the first of the chests the chest of st frideswyde  these chests were a kind of mont de piete and to found them was at first the favourite form of benefaction  money was left in this or that chest from which students and masters would borrow on the security of pledges which were generally books cups daggers and so forth  now in this affair of 1214 we have a strange passage of history which happily illustrates the growth of the university  the beginning of the whole affair was the quarrel with the town which in 1209 had hanged two clerks in contempt of clerical liberty the matter was taken up by the legatein those bad years of king john the popes viceroy in englandand out of the humiliation of the town the university gained money privileges and halls at low rental  these were precisely the things that the university wanted about these matters there was a constant strife in which the kings as a rule took part with the university  the university possessed the legal knowledge which the monarchs liked to have on their side and was therefore favoured by them  thus in 1231 wood annals i 205 the king sent out his breve to the mayor and burghers commanding them not to overrate their houses and thus gradually the university got the command of the police obtained privileges which enslaved the city and became masters where they had once been despised starveling scholars  the process was always the same  on the feast of st scholastica for example in 1354 walter de springheuse roger de chesterfield and other clerks swaggered into the swyndlestock tavern in carfax began to speak ill of john de croydons wine and ended by pitching the tankard at the head of that vintner  in ten minutes the town bell at st martins was rung and the most terrible of all townandgown rows began  the chancellor could do no less than bid st marys bell reply to st martins and shooting commenced  the gown held their own very well at first and defended themselves till vespertide when the citizens called in their neighbours the rustics of cowley headington and hincksey the results have been precisely described in anticipation by homer  greek text which cannot be reproduced  which is as much as to say the townsfolk call for help to their neighbours the yokels that were more numerous than they and better men in battle    so when the sun turned to the time of the loosing of oxen the town drave in the ranks of the gown and won the victory  they were strong the townsmen but not merciful  the crowns of some chaplains viz all the skin so far as the tonsure went these diabolical imps flayed off in scorn of their clergy and some poor innocents these confounded sons of satan knocked down beat and most cruelly wounded  the result in the long run was that the university received from edward iii a most large charter containing many liberties some that they had before and others that he had taken away from the town  thus edward granted to the university the custody of the assize of bread wine and ale the supervising of measures and weights the sole power of clearing the streets of the town and suburbs  moreover the mayor and the chief burghers were condemned yearly to a sort of public penance and humiliation on st scholasticas day  thus by the middle of the fourteenth century the strife of town and gown had ended in the complete victory of the latter  though the university owed its success to its clerkly character and though the legate backed it with all the power of rome yet the scholars were englishmen and liberals first catholics next  thus they had all english sympathy with them when they quarrelled with the legate in 1238 and shot his cook who indeed had thrown hot broth at them and thus in later days the undergraduates were with simon de montfort against king henry and aided the barons with a useful body of archers  the university too constantly withstood the friars who had settled in oxford on pretence of wishing to convert the jews and had attempted to get education into their hands  the preaching friars who had lately obtained from the pope divers privileges particularly an exemption as they pretended from being subject to the jurisdiction of the university began to behave themselves very insolent against the chancellors and masters wood annals i 399  the conduct of the friars caused endless appeals to rome and in this matter too oxford was stoutly national and resisted the pope as it had on occasions defied the king  the kings jews too the university kept in pretty good order and when in 1268 a certain hebrew snatched the crucifix from the hand of the chancellor and trod it under foot his tribesmen were compelled to raise a fair and stately cross of marble very curiously wrought on the scene of the sacrilege  the growth in power and importance of academic corporations having now been sketched let us try to see what the outer aspect of the town was like in these rude times and what manner of life the undergraduates led  for this purpose we may be allowed to draw a rude but not unfaithful picture of a day in a students life  no incident will be introduced for which there is not authority in wood or in mr ansteys invaluable documents the munimenta academica published in the collection of the master of the rolls some latitude as to dates must be allowed it is true and we are not of course to suppose that any one day of life was ever so gloriously crowded as that of our undergraduate  the time is the end of the fourteenth century  the forest and the moor stretch to the east gate of the city  magdalen bridge is not yet built nor of course the tower of magdalen which m brunet debaines has sketched from christ church walks  not till about 1473 was the tower built and years would pass after that before choristers saluted with their fresh voices from its battlements the dawn of the first of may or sermons were preached from the beautiful stone pulpit in the open air  when our undergraduate walter de stoke or more briefly stoke was at oxford the spires of the city were few  where magdalen stands now the old hospital of st john then stooda foundation of henry iiibut the jews were no longer allowed to bury their dead in the close which is now the physic garden  in 1289 as wood says the jews were banished from england for various enormities and crimes committed by them  the great and little jewriesthose dim populous streets behind the modern post officehad been sacked and gutted  no clerk would ever again risk his soul for a fair jewesss sake nor lose his life for his love at the hands of that eminent theologian fulke de breaute the beautiful tower of merton was still almost fresh and the spires of st marys of old all saints of st frideswyde and the strong tower of new college on the city wall were the most prominent features in a birdseye view of the town  but though part of merton certainly the chapel tower as we have seen the odd muniment room with the steep stone roof and perhaps the library existed though new was built and though balliol and university owned some halls on or near the site of the present colleges oxford was still an university of poor scholars who lived in townspeoples dwellings  thus in the great quarrel with the legate in 1238 john currey of scotland boarded with will maynard while hugh le verner abode in the house of osmund the miller with raynold the irishman and seven of his fellows  john mortimer and rob norensis lodged with augustine gosse and adam de wolton lodged in cat street where you can still see the curious arched doorway of cattes or st catherines hall by the time of my hero walter stoke the king had not yet decreed that all scholars of years of discretion should live in the house of some sufficient principal 1421 so let him lodge at catte hall at the corner of the street that leads to new college out of the modern broad street which was then the city ditch  it is six oclock on a summer morning and the bells waken stoke who is sleeping on a flock bed in his little camera  his room though he is not one of the luxurious clerks whom the university scolds in various statutes is pretty well furnished  his bed alone is worth not less than fifteenpence he has a cofer valued at twopence we have plenty of those old valuations and in his cofer are his black coat which no one would think dear at fourpence his tunic cheap at tenpence a roll of the seven psalms and twelve books only at his beddes heed  stoke has not   twenty bookes clothed in blak and reed of aristotil and of his philosophie   like chaucers undergraduate who must have been a bibliophile there are not many records of as many as twenty bookes in the old valuations  the great ornament of the room is a neat trophy of buckler bow arrows and two daggers all hanging conveniently on the wall  stoke opens his eyes yawns looks round for his clothes and sees with no surprise that his laundress has not sent home his clean linen  no christina of the parish of st martin who used to be stokes lotrix has been detected at last  under pretence of washing for scholars multa mala perpetrata fuerunt she has committed all manner of crimes and is now in the spinning house carcerata fuit  stoke wastes a malediction on the laundress and dressing as well as he may runs down to parsons pleasure i hope and has a swim for i find no tub in his room or indeed in the camera of any other scholar  it is now time to go not to chapel for cattes has no chapelbut to parish church and stoke goes very devoutly to st peters where we shall find him again later in the day in another mood  about eight oclock he commonises with a paris man henricus de bourges who has an admirable mode of cooking omelettes which makes his company much sought after at breakfast time  the university in old times was full of french students as paris was thronged by englishmen  lectures begin at nine and first there is lecture in the hall by the principal of cattes  that scholar receives his pupils in a bare room where it is very doubtful whether the students are allowed to sit down  from the curious old seal of the university of st andrews however it appears that the luxury of forms was permitted in scotland to all but the servitors who held the lecturers candles  the principal of cattes is in academic dress and wears a black cape boots and a hood  the undergraduates have no distinguishing costume  after an hour or two of viva voce exercises in the grammar of priscian preparatory lecture is over and a reading man will hurry off to the schools a set of lowroofed buildings between st marys and brasenose  there he will find the divinity school or lectureroom in the place of honour with medicine on one hand and law on the other the lecture rooms for grammar rhetoric logic arithmetic music geometry and astronomy for metaphysics ethics and the tongues stretching down school street on either side  here the praelectors are holding forth and all newly made masters of arts are bound to teach their subject regere scholas whether they like it or not  our friend master stoke however is on pleasure bent and means to pay his fine of twopence for omitting lecture and go off to the festival of his nation he is of the southern nation and hates scotch welsh and irish in the parish church  he stops in the flower market and at a barbers shop on his way to st peters and comes forth a wonderful pagan figure with a bacchic mask covering his honest countenance with horns protruding through a wig of tow with vineleaves twisted in and out of the horns and roses stuck wherever there is room for roses  henricus de bourges and half a dozen picardy men with some merry souls from the southern side of the thames are jigging down the high playing bagpipes and guitars  to these stoke joins himself and they waltz joyously into the church and in and out of the gateways of the different halls singing    mihi est propositum in taberna mori vinum sit appositum morientis ori ut dicant quum venerint angelorum chori deus sit propitius huic potatori   the students of the northern nations mock of course at these revellers thumbs are bitten threats exchanged and we shall see what comes of the quarrel  but the hall bells chime halfpast noon it is dinnertime in oxford and stoke as he throws off his mask larva and vineleaves mutters to himself the equivalent for there will be a row about this  there will indeed for the penalty is not crossing at the buttery nor gating butexcommunication munim academ i 18  dinner is not a very quiet affair for the cattes men have had to fight for their beer in the public streets with some canterbury college fellows who were set on by their warden of all people to commit this violence ut vi et violentia raperent cerevisiam aliorum scholarum in vico  however cattes has had the best of it and there is beer in plenty  it is possible however that fish is scarce for certain forestallers regratarii have been buying up salmon and soles and refusing to sell them at less than double the proper price  on the whole however there a rude abundance of meat and bread indeed stoke may have fared better in cattes than the modern undergraduate does in the hall of the college protected by st catherine  after dinner there would be lecture in lent but we are not in lent  a young mans fancy lightly turns to the beaumont north of the modern beaumont street where there are wide playingfields and space for archery football stoolball and other sports  stoke rushes out of hall and runs upstairs into the camera of roger de freshfield a reading man but a good fellow he knocks and enters and finds freshfield over his favourite work the posterior analytics and a pottle of strawberries  come down to the beaumont old man he says and play pyked staffe  roger is disinclined to move he must finish the posterior analytics  stoke lounges about in the eternal fashion of undergraduates after luncheon and picking up the philobiblon of richard de bury then quite a new book clinches his argument in favour of pyke and staffe with a quotation  you will perhaps see a stiffnecked youth lounging sluggishly in his study    he is not ashamed to eat fruit and cheese over an open book and to transfer his cup from side to side upon it  thus addressed roger lays aside his analytics and the pair walk down by balliol to the beaumont where pyked staffe or sword and buckler is played  at the beaumont they find two men who say that sword and buckler can be played sofft and ffayre that is without hard hitting and with one of these stoke begins to fence  alas a dispute arose about a stroke the bystanders interfered and stokes opponent drew his hanger extraxit cultellum vocatum hangere and hit one john felerd over the sconce  on this the proctors come up and the assailant is put in bocardo while stoke goes off to a passsupper given by an inceptor who has just taken his degree  these suppers were not voluntary entertainments but enforced by law  at supper the talk ranges over university gossip they tell of the scholar who lately tried to raise the devil in grope lane and was pleased by the gentlemanly manner of the foul fiend  they speak of the queens man who has just been plucked for maintaining that ego currit or ego est currens is as good latin as ego curro  then the party breaks up and stoke goes towards merton with some undergraduates of that college bridlington alderberk and lymby  at the corner of grope lane out come many men of the northern nations armed with shields and bows and arrows  stoke and his friends run into merton for weapons and standing in a window of that hall shot divers arrows and one that bridlington shot hit henry de lisle and david kirkby unmercifully perished for after john de benton had given him a dangerous wound in the head with his faulchion came will de la hyde and wounded him in the knee with his sword  these were rough times and it is not improbable that stoke had a brush with the town before he got safely back to cattes hall  the old rudeness gave way gradually as the colleges swallowed up the irregular halls and as the scholars unattached infando nomine chamberdekyns ceased to exist  learning however dwindled as colleges increased under the clerical and reactionary rule of the house of lancaster    chapter iiithe renaissance and the reformation    we have now arrived at a period in the history of oxford which is confused and unhappy but for us full of interest and perhaps of instruction  the hundred years that passed by between the age of chaucer and the age of erasmus were in southern europe years of the most eager life  we hear very oftentoo often perhapsof what is called the renaissance  the energy of delight with which italy welcomed the new birth of art of literature of human freedom has been made familiar to every reader  it is not with italy but with england and with oxford that we are concerned  how did the university and the colleges prosper in that strenuous time when the world ran after loveliness of form and colour as in other ages it has run after warlike renown or the faroff rewards of the saintly life  what was oxford doing when florence venice and rome were striving towards no meaner goal than perfection  it must be said that the spring came slowly up this way  the university merely reflected the very practical character of the people  in contemplating the events of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in their influence on english civilisation we are reminded once more of the futility of certain modern aspirations  no amount of university commissions nor of wellmeant reforms will change the nature of englishmen  it is impossible by distributions of university prizes and professorships to attract into the career of letters that proportion of industry and ingenuity which in germany for example is devoted to the scholastic life  politics trade law sport religion will claim their own in england just as they did at the revival of letters  the illustrious century which italy employed in unburying appropriating and enjoying the treasures of greek literature and art our fathers gave in england to dynastic and constitutional squabbles and to religious broils the renaissance in england and chiefly in oxford was like a bitter and changeful spring  there was an hour of genial warmth there breathed a wind from the south in the lifetime of chaucer then came frosts and storms again the brief sunshine of court favour shone on literature for a while when henry viii encouraged study and wolsey and fox founded christ church and corpus christi college once more the bad days of religious strife returned and the promise of learning was destroyed  thus the chief result of the awakening thought of the fourteenth century in england was not a lively delight in literature but the appearance of the lollards  the intensely practical genius of our race turned not to letters but to questions about the soul and its future about property and its distribution the lollards were put down in oxford the tares were weeded out by the house of lancaster and in the process the germs of free thought of originality and of a rational education were destroyed wyclevism did domineer among us says wood and in fact the intellect of the university was absorbed like the intellect of france during the heat of the jansenist controversy in defending or assailing 267 damned conclusions drawn from the books of wyclif the university lost many of her children through the profession of wyclevism  those who remained were often beneficed clerks  the friars lifted up their heads again and oxford was becoming a large ecclesiastical school  as the university declared to archbishop chichele 1438 our noble mother that was blessed in so goodly an offspring is all but utterly destroyed and desolate  presently the foreign wars and the wars of the roses drained the university of the youth of england  the country was overrun with hostile forces or infested by disbanded soldiers  plague and war war and plague and confusion alternate in the annals  sickly as oxford is today by climate and situation she is a city of health compared to what she was in the middle ages  in 1448 a pestilence broke out occasioned by the overflowing of waters    also by the lying of many scholars in one room or dormitory in almost every hall which occasioned nasty air and smells and consequently diseases  in the general dulness and squalor two things were remarkable  one the last splendour of the feudal time the other the first dawn of the new learning from italy  in 1452 george neville of balliol brother of the kingmaker gave the most prodigious passsupper that was ever served in oxford  on the first day there were 600 messes of meat divided into three courses  the second course is worthy of the attention of the epicure   second course  vian in brase   carcell crane in sawce  partrych young pocock    venson baked coney           fryed meat in paste pigeons         lesh lumbert byttor          a frutor curlew          a sutteltee   against this prodigious gormandising we must set that noble gift the library presented to oxford by duke humfrey of gloucester  in the catalogue drawn up in 1439 we mark many books of the utmost value to the impoverished students  here are the works of plato and the ethics and politics of aristotle translated by leonard the aretine here among the numerous writings of the fathers are tully and seneca averroes and avicenna bellum trojae cum secretis secretorum apuleius aulus gellius livy boccaccio petrarch  here with ovids verses is the commentary on dante and his divine comedy here rarest of all is a greek dictionary the silent father of liddels and scotts to be  the most hopeful fact in the university annals after the gift of those manuscripts to which the very beauty of their illuminations proved ruinous in puritan times was the establishment of a printingpress at oxford and the arrival of certain italians to propagate and settle the studies of true and genuine humanity among us  the exact date of the introduction of printing let us leave to be determined by the learned writer who is now at work on the history of oxford  the advent of the italians is dated by wood in 1488 polydore virgil had lectured in new college  he first of all taught literature in oxford  cyprianus and nicholaus italici also arrived and dined with the vicepresident of magdalen on christmas day  lily and colet too one of them the founder the other the first head master of st pauls school were about this time studying in italy under the great politian and hermolaus barbarus  oxford which had so long been in hostile communication with italy as represented by the papal courts at last touched and was thrilled by the electric current of italian civilisation  at this conjuncture of affairs who but is reminded of the youth and the education of gargantua  till the very end of the fifteenth century oxford had been that huge barbarian pupil and had revelled in vast rabelaisian suppers  of fat beeves he had killed three hundred sixty seven thousand and fourteen that in the entering in of spring he might have plenty of powdered beef  the bill of fare of george nevilles feast is like one of the catalogues dear to the cure of meudon  for oxford as for gargantua they appointed a great sophisterdoctor that read him donatus theodoletus and alanus in parabolis  oxford spent far more than gargantuas eighteen years and eleven months over the book de modis significandis with the commentaries of berlinguandus and a rabble of others  now under colet and erasmus 1497 oxford was put like gargantua under new masters and learned that the old scholarship had been but brutishness and the old wisdom but blunt foppish toys serving only to bastardise noble spirits and to corrupt all the flower of youth  the prospects of classical learning at oxford and whatever may be the case today on classical learning depended in the fifteenth century the fortunes of european literature now seemed fair enough people from the very source of knowledge were lecturing in oxford wolsey was bursar of magdalen  the colleges to which b n c was added in 1509 and c c c in 1516 were competing with each other for success in the new learning  fox the founder of c c c established in his college two chairs of greek and latin to extirpate barbarism  meanwhile cambridge had to hire an italian to write public speeches at twenty pence each  henry viii in his youth was like francis i the patron of literature as literature was understood in italy  he saw in learning a new splendour to adorn his court a new source of intellectual luxury though even henry had an eye on the theological aspect of letters  between 1500 and 1530 oxford was noisy with the clink of masons hammers and chisels brasenose corpus and the magnificent kitchen of christ church were being erected  the beautiful staircase which m brunetdebaines has sketched was not finished till 1640  the world owes it to dr fell  the oriel niches designed in the illustration are of rather later date  the streets were crowded with carts dragging in from all the neighbouring quarries stones for the future homes of the fair humanities  erasmus found in oxford a kind of substitute for the platonic society of florence  he would hardly care much about going to italy at all except for the sake of having been there  when i listen to colet it seems to me like listening to plato himself and he praises the judgment and learning of those englishmen grocyn and linacre who had been taught in italy  in spite of all this promise the renaissance in england was rotten at the root  theology killed it or at the least breathed on it a deadly blight  our academic forefathers drove at practice and saw everything with the eyes of party men and of men who recognised no interest save that of religion  it is mr seebohm oxford reformers 1867 i think who detects in colets concern with the religious side of literature the influence of savonarola  when in italy he gave himself entirely to the study of the holy scriptures  he brought to england from italy not the early spirit of pico of mirandola the delightful freedom of his youth but his later austerity his later concern with the harmony of scripture and philosophy  the book which the dying petrarch held wistfully in his hands revering its very material shape though he could not spell its contents was the iliad of homer  the book which the young renaissance held in its hands in england with reverence and eagerness as strong and tender contained the epistles of st paul it was on the epistles that colet lectured in 149697 when doctors and abbots flocked to hear him with their notebooks in their hands thus oxford differed from florence england from italy  the former all intent on what it believed to be the very truth the latter all absorbed on what it knew to be no other than beauty herself  we cannot afford to regret the choice that england and oxford made the search for truth was as certain to bring not peace but a sword as the search for beauty was to bring the decadence of italy the corruption of manners the slavery of two hundred years  still our practical earnestness did rob oxford of the better side of the renaissance  it is not possible here to tell the story of religious and social changes which followed so hard upon each other in the reigns of henry viii edward vi mary and elizabeth  a few moments in these stormy years are still memorable for some terrible or ludicrous event  that oxford was rather trojan than greek that men were more concerned about their dinners and their souls than their prosody and philosophy in 1531 is proved by the success of grynaeus  he visited the university and carried off quantities of mss chiefly neoplatonic on which no man set any value  yet in 1535 layton a commissioner wrote to cromwell that he and his companions had established the new learning in the university  a lecture in greek was founded in magdalen two chairs of greek and latin in new two in all souls and two already existed as we have seen in c c c this layton is he that took a rabelaisian and unquotable revenge on that old tyrant of the schools duns scotus  we have set dunce in bocardo and utterly banished him from oxford for ever with all his blind glosses    and the second time we came to new college we found all the great quadrant full of the leaves of dunce the wind blowing them into every corner  and there we found a certain mr greenfield a gentleman of buckinghamshire gathering up part of the same books leaves as he said therewith to make him sewers or blanshers to keep the deer within his wood thereby to have the better cry with his hounds  ah if the university commissioners would only set aristotle and messrs ritter and preller in bocardo many a young gentleman out of buckinghamshire and other counties would joyously help in the good work and use the pages if not for blanshers for other sportive purposes  habent sua fata libelli as terentianus maurus says in a frequently quoted verse  if cromwells commissioners were hard on duns the visitors of edward vi were ruthless in their condemnation of everything that smacked of popery or of magic  evangelical religion in england has never been very favourable to learning thus in 1550 the ancient libraries were by their appointment rifled  many manuscripts guilty of no other superstition than red letters in the front or titles were condemned to the fire    such books wherein appeared angles were thought sufficient to be destroyed because accounted papish or diabolical or both  a cart load of mss lucubrations of the fellows of merton chiefly in controversial divinity was taken away but by the good services of one herks a dutchman many books were preserved and later entered the bodleian library  the world can spare the controversial manuscripts of the fellows of merton but who knows what invaluable scrolls may have perished in the puritan bonfire  persons the librarian of balliol sold old books to buy protestant ones  two noble libraries were sold for forty shillings for waste paper  thus the reign of edward vi gave free play to that ascetic and intolerable hatred of letters which had now and again made its voice heard under henry viii  oxford was almost empty  the schools were used by laundresses as a place wherein clothes might conveniently be dried  the citizens encroached on academic property  some schools were quite destroyed and the sites converted into gardens  few men took degrees  the college plate and the jewels left by pious benefactors were stolen and went to the meltingpot  thus flourished oxford under edward vi  the reign of mary was scarcely more favourable to letters  no one knew what to be at in religion  in magdalen no one could be found to say mass the fellows were turned out the undergraduates were whippedboyish martyrsand crossed at the buttery  what most pleases in this tragic reign is the anecdote of edward anne of corpus  anne with the conceit of youth had written a latin satire on the mass  he was therefore sentenced to be publicly flogged in the hall of his college and to receive one lash for each line in his satire  never surely was a poet so sharply taught the merit of brevity  how edward anne must have regretted that he had not knocked off an epigram a biting couplet or a smart quatrain with the sting of the wit in the tail  oxford still retains a memory of the hideous crime of this reign  in broad street under the windows of balliol there is a small stone cross in the pavement  this marks the place where some years ago a great heap of wooden ashes was found  these ashes were the remains of the fire of october 16th 1555the day when ridley and latimer were burned  they were brought says wood to a place over against balliol college where now stands a row of poor cottages a little before which under the town wall ran so clear a stream that it gave the name of canditch candida fossa to the way leading by it  to recover the memory of that event let the reader fancy himself on the top of the tower of st michaels that is immediately above the city wall  no houses interfere between him and the open country in which balliol stands not with its present frontage but much farther back  a clear stream runs through the place where is now broad street and the road above is dark with a swaying crowd out of which rises the vapour of smoke from the martyrs pile  at your feet on the top of bocardo prison which spanned the street at the north gate cranmer stands manacled watching the fiery death which is soon to purge away the memory of his own faults and crimes  he too joined that noble army of martyrs who fought all though they knew it not for one causethe freedom of the human spirit  it was in a nightbattle that they fell and confused was the cry of the paean but they won the victory and we have entered into the land for which they contended  when we think of these martyrdoms can we wonder that the fellows of lincoln did not spare to ring a merry peal on their gaudyday the day of st hugh even though mary the queen had just left her bitter and weary life  it would be pleasant to have to say that learning returned to oxford on the rising of that bright occidental star queen elizabeth  on the other hand the university recovered slowly after being much troubled as wood says and hurried up and down by the changes of religion  we get a glimpse from wood of the fellows of merton singing the psalms of sternhold and hopkins round a fire in the college hall  we see the subwarden snatching the book out of the hands of a junior fellow and declaring that he would never dance after that pipe  we find oxford so illiterate that she could not even provide an university preacher  a country gentleman richard taverner of woodeaton would stroll into st marys with his sword and damask gown and give the academicians destitute of academical advice a sermon beginning with these words   arriving at the mount of st marys i have brought you some fine bisketts baked in the oven of charitie carefully conserved for the chickens of the church the sparrows of the spirit and the sweet swallows of salvation   in spite of these evil symptoms a greek oration and plenty of latin plays were ready for queen elizabeth when she visited oxford in 1566 the religious refugees who had eaten mice at zurich in marys time had returned and their influence was hostile to learning  a man who had lived on mice for his faith was above greek  the court which contained sydney and which welcomed bruno was strong enough to make the classics popular  that famed polish count alasco was received with latin orations and disputes 1583 in the best manner and only a scoffing italian like bruno ventured to call the heads of houses the drowsy headsdormitantes  bruno was a man whom nothing could teach to speak well of people in authority oxford enjoyed the religious peace not extended to seminarists of elizabeths and jamess reigns and did not foresee that she was about to become the home of the court and a place of arms    chapter ivjacobean oxford    the gardens of wadham college on a bright morning in early spring are a scene in which the memory of old oxford pleasantly lingers and is easily revived  the great cedars throw their secular shadow on the ancient turf the chapel forms a beautiful background the whole place is exactly what it was two hundred and sixty years ago  the stones of oxford walls when they do not turn black and drop off in flakes assume tender tints of the palest gold red and orange along a wall which looks so old that it may well have formed a defence of the ancient augustinian priory the stars of the yellow jasmine flower abundantly  the industrious hosts of the bees have left their cells to labour in this first morning of spring the doves coo the thrushes are noisy in the trees  all breathes of the year renewal and of the coming april and all that gladdens us may have gladdened some indolent scholar in the time of king james  in the reign of the first stuart king of england oxford became the town that we know  even in elizabeths days could we ascend the stream of centuries we should find ourselves much at home in oxford the earliest trustworthy map that of agas 1578 is worth studying if we wish to understand the oxford that elizabeth left and that the architects of james embellished giving us the most interesting examples of collegiate buildings which are both stately and comfortable  let us enter oxford by the iffley road in the year 1578  we behold as agas enthusiastically writes   a citie seated rich in everything girt with wood and water meadow corn and hill   the way is not bordered of course by the long straggling streets of rickety cottages which now stretch from the bridge halfway to cowley and iffley  the church called by ribalds the boiled rabbit from its peculiar shape lies on the right there is a gate in the city wall on the place where the road now turns to holywell at this time the walls still existed and ran from magdalen past st marys college called newe through exeter through the site of mr parkers shop and all along the south side of broad street to st michaels and bocardo gate  there the wall cut across to the castle  on the southern side of the city it skirted corpus and merton gardens and was interrupted by christ church  probably if it were possible for us to visit elizabethan oxford the walls and the five castle towers would seem the most curious features in the place entering the east gate magdalen and magdalen grammar school would be familiar objects  st edmunds hall would be in its present place and queens would present its ancient gothic front  it is easy to imagine the change in the high street which would be produced by a queens not unlike oriel in the room of the highly classical edifice of wren  all souls would be less remarkable at st marys we should note the absence of the scandalous image of our lady over the door at merton the fellows quadrangle did not yet exist and a great woodyard bordered on corpus  in front of oriel was an open space with trees and there were a few scattered buildings such as peckwaters inn on the site of peck and canterbury college  tom quad was stately but incomplete  turning from st marys past b n c we miss the attics in brasenose front we miss the imposing radcliffe we miss all the quadrangle of the schools except the divinity school and we miss the theatre  if we go down south street past ch ch we find an open space where pembroke stands where wadham is now the most uniform complete and unchanged of all the colleges there are only the open pleasances and perhaps a few ruins of the augustinian priory  st johns lacks its inner quadrangle and balliol in place of its new buildings has its old delightful grove  as to the houses of the town they are not unlike the tottering and picturesque old roofs and gables of king street  to the oxford of elizabeths reign then the founders and architects of her successor added chiefly the schools quadrangle with the great gate of the five orders a building beautiful as it were in its own despite  they added a smaller curiosity of the same sort at merton they added wadham perhaps their most successful achievement their taste was a medley of new and old  they made a not uninteresting effort to combine the exquisiteness of gothic decoration with the proportions of greek architecture  the tower of the five orders reminds the spectator in a manner of the style of milton  it is rich and overloaded yet its natural beauty is not abated by the relics out of the great treasures of greece and rome which are built into the mass  the ionic and corinthian pillars are like the latinisms of milton the doublegilding which once covered the figures and emblems of the upper part of the tower gave them the splendour of miltonic ornament  when king james came from woodstock to see this quadrangular pile he commanded the gilt figures to be whitened over because they were so dazzling or as wood expresses it so glorious and splendid that none especially when the sun shone could behold them  how characteristic of james is this anecdote  he was by no means le roi soleil as courtiers called louis xiv as divines called the pedantic stuart  it is easy to fancy the king issuing from the library of bodley where he has been turning over books of theology prosing and displaying his learning for hours  the rheumy blinking eyes are dazzled in the sunlight and he peevishly commands the gold work to be whitened over certainly the translators of the bible were but illadvised when they compared his majesty to the rising sun in all his glory  james was rather fond of visiting oxford and the royal residence at woodstock  we shall see that his court the most dissolute perhaps that england ever tolerated corrupted the manners of the students on one of his majestys earliest visits he had a chance of displaying the penetration of which he was so proud  james was always finding out something or somebody till it almost seemed as if people had discovered that the best way to flatter him was to try to deceive him  in 1604 there was in oxford a certain richard haydock a bachelor of physic  this haydock practised his profession during the day like other mortals but varied from the kindly race of men by a pestilent habit of preaching all night  it was haydocks contention that he preached unconsciously in his sleep when he would give out a text with the greatest gravity and declare such sacred matters as were revealed to him in slumber his preaching coming by revelation  though people went to hear haydock they were chiefly influenced by curiosity  his auditory were willing to silence him by pulling haling and pinching him yet would he pertinaciously persist to the end and sleep still  the king was introduced into haydocks bedroom heard him declaim and next day crossexamined him in private  awed by the royal acuteness haydock confessed that he was a humbug and that he had taken to preaching all night by way of getting a little notoriety and because he felt himself to be a buried man in the university  that a man should hope to get reputation by preaching all night is itself a proof that the university under james was too theologically minded  when has it been otherwise  the religious strife of the reigns of henry viii edward vi and mary was not asleep the troubles of charless time were beginning to stir oxford was as usual an epitome of english opinion  we see the struggle of the wildest puritanism of arminianism of pelagianism of a dozen isms which are dead enough but have left their pestilent progeny to disturb a place of religion learning and amusement  by whatever names the different sects were called mens ideas and tendencies were divided into two easily recognisable classes  calvinism and puritanism on one side with the puritanic haters of letters and art were opposed to catholicism in germ to literature and mundane studies  how difficult it is to take a side in this battle where both parties had one foot on firm ground the other in chaos where freedom or what was to become freedom of thought was allied with narrow bigotry where learning was chained to superstition  as early as 1606 mr william laud bd of st johns college began to disturb the university  the young man preached a sermon which was thought to look romewards  laud became suspect it was thought a scandalous thing to give him the usual courteous greetings in the street or in the college quadrangle  from this time the history of oxford for forty years is mixed up with the history of laud  the divisions of roundhead and of cavalier have begun  the majority of the undergraduates are on the side of laud and the court the citizens and many of the elder members of the university are with the puritans  the court and the king we have said were fond of being entertained in the college halls  james went from libraries to academic disputations thence to dinner and from dinner to look on at comedies played by the students  the cambridge men did not care to see so much royal favour bestowed on oxford  when james visited the university in 1641 a cambridge wit produced a remarkable epigram for some mysterious reason the playful fancies of the sister university have never been greatly admired at oxford where the brisk air men flatter themselves breeds nimbler humours  here is part of the cantabs epigram   to oxenford the king has gone with all his mighty peers that hath in peace maintained us these five or six long years   the poem maunders on for half a dozen lines and loses itself in the sands like the river rhine without coming to any particular point or conclusion  how much more lively is the oxford couplet on the king who being bored by some amateur theatricals twice or thrice made as if he would leave the hall where men failed dismally to entertain him   the king himself did offerwhat i pray he offered twice or thriceto go away   as a result of the example of the court the students began to wear lovelocks  in elizabeths time when men wore their hair no longer than their ears long locks had been a mark says wood of swaggerers  drinking and gambling were now very fashionable undergraduates were whipped for wearing boots while puritans were many and troublesome and laud publicly declared 1614 that presbyterians were as bad as papists  did laud after all think papists so very bad  in 1617 he was president of his college st johns on which he set his mark  it is to laud and to inigo jones that oxford owes the beautiful gardenfront perhaps the most lovely thing in oxford  from the gardenswhere for so many summers the beauty of england has rested in the shadow of the chestnuttrees amid the music of the chimes and in air heavy with the scent of the acacia flowersfrom the gardens lauds building looks rather like a countryhouse than a college  if st johns men have lived in the university too much as if it were a large countryhouse if they have imitated rather the toryism than the learning of their great archbishop the blame is partly lauds how much harm to study he and waynflete have unwittingly done and how much they have added to the romance of oxford  it is easy to understand that men find it a weary task to read in sight of the beauty of the groves of magdalen and of st johns  when kubla khan a stately pleasuredome decreed he did not mean to settle students there and to ask them for metaphysical essays and for greek and latin prose compositions  kubla khan would have found a palace to his desire in the gardens of laud or where cherwell meandering with a mazy motion stirs the green weeds and flashes from the millwheel and flows to the isis through meadows white and purple with fritillaries   and here are gardens bright with sinuous rills where blossoms many an incensebearing tree   but here is scarcely the proper trainingground of firstclass men  oxford returned to her ancient uses in 1625  soon after the accession of charles i the plague broke out in london and oxford entertained the parliament as six hundred years before she had received the witan  there seemed something ominous in all that charles did in his earlier yearsthe air or mens minds was full of the presage of fate  it was observed that the house of commons met in the divinity school and that the place seemed to have infected them with theological passion  after 1625 there was never a parliament but had its committee to discuss religion and to stray into the devious places of divinity  the plague pursued charles to oxford  in those days and long afterwards it was a common complaint that the citizens built rows of poor cottages within the walls and that these cottages were crowded by dirty and indigent people  plague was bred almost yearly at oxford and charles really seems to have improved the sanitary arrangements of the city  laud the president of st johns became by some intrigue chancellor of the university  he made oxford many presents of greek chinese hebrew latin and arabic mss  there may have beenlet us hope there werequiet bookworms who enjoyed these gifts while the town and university were bubbling over with religious feuds  people grumbled that popish darts were whet afresh on a dutch grindstone a series of antiromish and antiroyal sermons and pamphlets followed as a rule by a series of recantations kept mens minds in a ferment  the good that laud did by his giftsand he was a munificent patron of learninghe destroyed by his dogmatism scholars could not decipher greek texts while they were torturing biblical ones into arguments for and against the opinions of the chancellor  what is the true story about the gorgeous vestments which were found in a box in the house of the president of st johns and which are now preserved in the library of that college did they belong to the last of the old catholic presidents of what was chicheles college of st bernard before the reformation  were they on the other hand the property of laud himself  it has been said that laud would not have known how to wear them  fancy sees him treasuring that bright ecclesiastical raiment greek text which cannot be reproduced in some place of security  at night perhaps when candles were lit and curtains drawn and he was alone he may have arrayed himself in the gorgeous chasuble before the mirror as hetty wore her surreptitious finery  there is a great deal of human nature in man  if laud really strutted in solitude draped rather at random in these vestments the ecclesiastical gear is even more interesting than the thin ivoryheaded staff which supported him on his way to the scaffold more curious than the diary in which he recorded the events of night and day of dreaming hours and waking in the library at st johns they show his busta tarnished gilded work of art  he has a neat little cockedup moustache not like a prelates the face is that of a bismarck without strength of character  in speaking of oxford before the civil war let us not forget that true students and peaceable men found a welcome retreat beyond the din of theological fictions  lord falklands house was within ten miles of the town  in this time says clarendon in his immortal panegyric in this time he contracted familiarity and friendship with the most polished men of the university who found such an immenseness of wit and such a solidity of judgment in him so infinite a fancy bound in by a most logical ratiocination such a vast knowledge that he was not ignorant in anything yet such an excessive humility as if he had known nothing that they frequently resorted and dwelt with him as in a college situated in a purer air so that his house was a university in a less volume whither they came not so much for repose as study and to examine and refine those grosser propositions which laziness and consent made current in vulgar conversation  the signs of the times grew darker  in 1636 the king and queen visited oxford with no applause  in 1640 laud sent the university his last present of manuscripts  he was charged with many offences he had repaired crucifixes he had allowed the scandalous image to be set up in the porch of st marys and alderman nixon the puritan grocer had seen a man bowing to the scandalous imageso he declared  in 1642 charles asked for money from the colleges for the prosecution of the war with the parliament  the beautiful old college plate began its journey to the meltingpot  on august 9th the scholars armed themselves  there were two bands of musqueteers one of pikemen one of halberdiers  in the reign of henry iii the men had been on the other side  magdalen bridge was blocked up with heaps of wood  stones for the primitive warfare of the time were transported to the top of magdalen tower  the stones were never thrown at any foemen  royalists and roundheads in turn occupied the place and while grocer nixon fled before the cavaliers he came back and interceded for all souls college which dealt with him for figs and sugar when the puritans wished to batter the graven images on the gate  on october 29th the king came after edgehill fight the court assembled and oxford was fortified  the place was made impregnable in those days of feeble artillery  the author of the gesta stephani had pointed out many centuries before that oxford if properly defended could never be taken thanks to the network of streams that surrounds her  though the citizens worked grudgingly and slowly the trenches were at last completed  the earthworksa double lineran in and out of the interlacing streams  a parliamentary force on headington hill seems to have been unable to play on the city with artillery  barbed arrows were served out to the scholars who formed a regiment of more than six hundred men the queen held her little court in merton in the wardens lodgings clarendon gives rather a humorous account of the discontent of the fine ladies the town was full of lords besides those of the council and of persons of the best quality with very many ladies who when not pleased themselves kept others from being so  oxford never was so busy and so crowded letters society war were all confused there were excursions against brown at abingdon and alarms from fairfax on headington hill  the siege from may 22nd to june 5th was almost a farce  the parliamentary generals fought with perspective glasses  neither cromwell at wytham nor brown at wolvercot pushed matters too hard  when two puritan regiments advanced on hinksey mr smyth blazed away at them from his house as in zululand any building made a respectable fort when cannon balls had so little penetrative power or when artillery was not at the front  oxford was surrendered with other places of arms after naseby andpresbyterians became heads of colleges    chapter vsome scholars of the restoration    in merton chapel a little mural tablet bears the crest the name and the dates of the birth and death of antony wood  he has been our guide in these sketches of oxford life as he must be the guide of the gravest and most exact historians  no one who cares for the past of the university should think without pity and friendliness of this lonely scholar who in his lifetime was unpitied and unbefriended we have reached the period in which he lived and died in the midst of changes of church and state and surrounded by more worldly scholars whose letters remain to testify that in the reign of the second charles oxford was modern oxford  in the epistles of humphrey prideaux student of christ church we recognise the foibles of the modern university the love of gossip the internecine criticism the greatness of little men whom rien ne peut plaire  antony wood was a scholar of a different sort of a sort that has never been very common in oxford  he was a perfect dungeon of books but he wrote as well as read which has never been a usual practice in his university  wood was born in 1632 in one of the old houses opposite merton perhaps in the curious ancient hall which has been called beham bream and bohemiae aula by various corruptions of the original spelling  as a boy wood must have seen the siege of oxford which he describes not without humour  as a young man he watched the religious revolution which introduced presbyterian heads of houses and sent puritanical captains of horse like captain james wadsworth to hunt for papistical reliques and massing stuffs among the property of the president of c c c and the dean of ch ch 16461648  in 1650 he saw the chancellorship of oliver cromwell in 1659 he welcomed the restoration and rejoiced that the king had come to his own again  the tastes of an antiquary combined with the natural reaction against puritanism to make antony wood a high churchman and not averse to rome while he had sufficient breadth of mind to admire thomas hobbes the patriarch of english learning  but wood had little room in his heart or mind for any learning save that connected with the university  oxford the city and the colleges the remains of the old religious art the customs the dressesthese things he adored with a loverlike devotion which was utterly unrewarded  he owed no office to the university and he was even expelled 1693 for having written sharply against clarendon  this did not abate his zeal nor prevent him from passing all his days and much of his nights in the study and compilation of university history  the author of woods biography has left a picture of his sombre and laborious old age  he rose at four oclock every morning  he scarcely tasted food till suppertime  at the hour of the college dinner he visited the booksellers shops where he was sure not to be disturbed by the gossip of dons young and old  after supper he would smoke his pipe and drink his pot of ale in a tavern  it was while he took this modest refreshment before old age came upon him that antony once fell in and fell out with dick peers  this dick was one of the men employed by dr fell the dean of ch ch to translate woods history and antiquities of the university of oxford into latin  the translation gave rise to a number of literary quarrels  as dean of ch ch dr fell yielded to the besetting sin of deans and fancied himself the absolute master of the university if not something superior to mortal kind  an autocrat of this sort had no scruples about changing woods copy whenever he differed from wood in political or religious opinion  now antony as we said had eyes to discern the greatness of hobbes whom the dean considered no better than a deist or an atheist  the dean therefore calmly altered all that wood had written of the philosopher of malmesbury and so maligned hobbes that the old man meeting the king in pall mall begged leave to reply in his own defence  charles allowed the dispute to go on and hobbes hit fell rather hard  the dean retorted with the famous expression about irritabile illud et vanissimum malmesburiense animal  this controversy amused oxford but bred bad feeling between antony wood and dick peers the translator of his work and the tool of the dean of ch ch  prideaux letters to john ellis camden society 1875 describes the battles in city taverns between author and translator   i suppose that you have heard of the continuall feuds and often battles between the author and the translator they had a skirmish at sol hardeing keeper of a tavern in all saints parish another at the printeing house the sheldonian theatre and several other places   from the record of these combats we learn that the recluse antony was a man of his hands   as peers always cometh off with a bloody nose or a black eye he was a long time afraid to goe annywhere where he might chance to meet his too powerful adversary for fear of another drubbing till he was proproctor and now woods sic is as much afraid to meet him least he should exercise his authority upon him  and although he be a good bowzeing blad yet it hath been observed that never since his adversary hath been in office hath he dared to be out after nine least he should meet him and exact the rigor of the statute upon him   the statute required all scholars to be in their rooms before tom had ceased ringing  it was perhaps too rash to say that the oxford of the restoration was already modern oxford  the manners of the students were so to speak more accentuated  however much the lecturer in idolology may dislike the method and person of the reader in the mandingo language these two learned men do not box in taverns nor take off their coats if they meet each other at the clarendon press  people are careful not to pitch into each other in that way though the temper which confounds opponents for their theory of irregular verbs is not at all abated  as wood grew in years he did not increase in honours  he was a mere scholar and consequently might expect from the greater number of men disrespect when he was but sixtyfour he looked eighty at least  his dress was not elegant cleanliness being his chief object  he rarely left his rooms that were papered with mss and where every table and chair had its load of books and yellow parchments from the college muniment rooms  when strangers came to oxford with letters of recommendation the recluse would leave his study and gladly lead them about the town through logic lane to queens which had not then the sublimely classical front built by hawksmoor but suggested by sir christopher wren  it is worthy of his genius wood died in 1695 forgiving every one  he could well afford to do so  in his athenae oxonienses he had written the lives of all his enemies  wood being a mere scholar could of course expect nothing but disrespect in a place like oxford  his younger contemporary humphrey prideaux was in the oxford manner a man of the world  he was the son of a cornish squire was educated at westminster under busby that awful pedagogue whose birch seems so near a memory got a studentship at christ church in 1668 and took his ba degree in 1672  here it may be observed that men went up quite as late in life then as they do now for prideaux was twentyfour years old when he took his degree  fell was dean of christ church and was showing laudable zeal in working the university press  what a pity it is that the university press of today has become a trading concern a shop for twopenny manuals and penny primers  it is scarcely proper that the university should at once organise examinations and sell the manuals which contain the answers to the questions most likely to be set  to return to fell he made prideaux edit lucius florus and publish the marmora oxoniensia which came out 1676  we must not suppose however that prideaux was an enthusiastic archaeologist he did the marmora because the dean commanded it and because educated people were at that period not uninterested in greek art at the present hour one may live a lifetime in oxford and only learn by the accident of examining passmen in the arundel room that the university possesses any marbles  in the walls of the arundel room on the groundfloor in the schools quadrangle these touching remains of hellas are interred  there are the funereal stelae with their quiet expression of sorrow of hope of resignation  the young man on his tombstone is represented in the act of rising and taking the hand of a friend  he is bound on his latest journey   he goeth forth unto the unknown land where wife nor child may follow thus far tell the lingering clasp of hand in faithful hand and that brief carven legend friend farewell  o pregnant sign profound simplicity all passionate pain and fierce remonstrating being wholly purged leave this mere memory deep but not harsh a sad and sacred thing 1   the lady chooses from a coffer a trinket or a ribbon  it is her last toilette she is making with no fear and no regret  again the longsevered souls are meeting with delight in the home of the just made perfect  even in the schools these scraps of greek lapidarys work seem beautiful to us in their sober and cheerful acceptance of life and death  we hope in oxford that the study of ancient art as well as of ancient literature may soon be made possible  these tangible relics of the past bring us very near to the heart and the life of greece and waken a kindly enthusiasm in every one who approaches them  in humphrey prideauxs letters there is not a trace of any such feeling  he does his business but it is hackwork  in this he differs from the modern student but in his caustic description of the rude and witless society of the place he is modern enough  in his letters to his friend john ellis of the state paper office it is plain that prideaux wants to get preferment  his taste and his ambition alike made him detest the heavy beerdrinking doctors the fast all souls gentlemen and the fossils of stupidity who are always plentifully imbedded in the soil of university life fellowships were then sold at magdalen and new when they were not given by favour  prideaux grumbles july 28th 1674 at the laxness of the commissioners who should have exposed this abuse  in town one of their inquirys is whether any of the scholars weare pantaloons or periwigues or keep dogs  the great dispute about dogs which raged at a later date in university college had already begun to disturb dons and undergraduates  the choice language of oxford contempt was even then extant and prideaux like grandison in daniel deronda spoke curtly of the people whom he did not like as brutes pembrokethe fittest colledge in the town for brutes  the university did not encourage certain players who had paid the place a visit and the players in revenge had gone about the town at night and broken the windows  when the journey from london to oxford is so easily performed it is amusing to read of prideauxs miserable adventures in the diligence between a lady of easy manners a pitiful rogue and two undergraduates who sordidly affected debauchery   this ill company made me very miserable all the way  only once i could not but heartily laugh to see fincher be sturdyly belaboured by five or six carmen with whips and prong staves for provoking them with some of his extravagant frolics   the violent affection to vice in the university or in the country was of course the reaction against the godliness of puritan captains of horse  another form of the reaction is discernible in the revived high church sentiments of prideaux wood and most of the students of the time  the manners of the undergraduates were not much better than those of the pothousehaunting seniors  dr good the master of balliol a good old toast had much trouble with his students   there is over against balliol college a dingy horrid scandalous alehouse fit for none but draymen and tinkers and such as by going there have made themselves equally scandalous  here the balliol men continually and by perpetuall bubbing add art to their natural stupidity to make themselves perfect sots   the envy and jealousy of the inferior colleges alas have put about many things in these latter days to the discredit of the balliol men but not even humphrey prideaux would out of all his stock of epithets choose sottish and stupid  in these old times however dr good had to call the men together and    inform them of the mischiefs of that hellish liquor called ale but one of them not so tamely to be preached out of his beloved liquor made answer that the vicechancelours men drank ale at the split crow and why should not they too   on this old dr good posted off to the vicechancellor who being a lover of old ale himself returned a short answer to the head of balliol  the old man went back to his college and informed his fellows that he was assured there were no hurt in ale so that now they may be sots by authority  christ church men were not more sober  david whitford who had been the tutor of shirley the poet was found lying dead in his bed  he had been going to take a dram for refreshment but death came between the cup and the lips and this is the end of davy  prideaux records in the same feeling style that smallpox carried off many of the undergraduates besides my brother a student at corpus  the university press supplied prideaux with gossip  they printed a book against hobs written by clarendon  hobbes was the heresiarch of the time and when an unhappy fellow of merton hanged himself the doctrines of hobbes were said to have prompted him to the deed  to return to the press  our christmas book will be cornelius nepos    our marbles are now printing  prideaux as has been said took no interest in his own work   i coat quote a multitude of authors if people think the better of me for that i will think the worse of them for their judgement  it beeing soe easyly a thinge to make this specious show he must be a fool that cannot gain whatsoever repute is to be gotten by it  if people will admire him for this they may i shall admire such for nothing else but their good indexs  as long as books have these on what subject may we not coat as many others as we please and never have read one of them   it is not easy to gather from this confession whether prideaux had or had not read the books he coated  it is certain that dean aldrich and here again we recognise the eternal criticism of modern oxford held a poor opinion of humphrey prideaux  aldrich said prideaux was incorrect muddyheaded he would do little or nothing besides heaping up notes as for mss he would not trouble himself about any but rest wholly upon what had been done to his hands by former editors  this habit of carping this trick of collecting notes this inability to put a work through this dawdling erudition this horror of manuscripts every oxford man knows them and feels those temptations which seem to be in the air  oxford is a discouraging place  college drudgery absorbs the hours of students in proportion to their conscientiousness  they have only the waste oddsandends of time for their own labours  they live in an atmosphere of criticism  they collect notes they wait they dream their youth goes by and the night comes when no man can work  the more praise to the tutors and lecturers who decipher the records of assyria or patiently collate the manuscripts of the iliad who not only teach what is already known but add to the stock of knowledge and advance the boundaries of scholarship and science  one lesson may be learned from prideauxs cynical letters which is still worth the attention of every young oxford student who is conscious of ambition of power and of real interest in letters  he can best serve his university by coming out of her by declining college work and by devoting himself to original study in some less exhausted air in some less critical society  among the aversions of humphrey prideaux were the gentlemen of all souls  they certainly showed extraordinary impudence when they secretly employed the university press to print off copies of marc antonios engravings after giulio romanos drawings  it chanced that fell visited the press rather late one evening and found his press working at such an imployment  the prints and plates he hath seased and threatened the owners of them with expulsion  all souls adds prideaux is a scandalous place  yet all souls was the college of young mr guise an arabic scholar the greatest miracle in the knowledge of that i ever heard of  guise died of smallpox while still very young  thus prideaux prattles on about admiral van tromp a drunken greazy dutchman whom speed of st johns conquered in boozing of the disputes about races in port meadow of the breaking into the mermaid tavern  we christ church men bear the blame of it our ticks as the noise of the town will have it amounting to 1500 pounds  thus christ church had little cause to throw the first stone at balliol prideaux shows little interest in letters little in the press though he lived in palmy days of printing in the time of the elzevirs none at all in the educational work of the place  he sneers at the puritans and at the controversy on the foundations of hell torments shaken and removed  he admits that locke is a man of very good converse but is chiefly concerned to spy out the movements of the philosopher suspected of sedition and to report them to ellis in town  about the new buildings as of the beautiful western gateway where great tom is hung the work of wren prideaux says little st marys was suffering restoration and the old men including wood we may believe exceedingly exclaim against it that is the way of oxford a college is constantly rebuilding amid the protests of the rest of the university  there is no question more common or less agreeable than this what are you doing to your tower or what are you doing to your hall library or chapel  no one ever knows but we are always doing something and working men for ever sit and drink beer on the venerable roofs  long intercourse with prideauxs letters and mournful memories of oxford new buildings tempt a writer to imitate prideauxs spirit let us shut up his book where he leaves oxford in 1686 to become rector of sahamtoney in norfolk and marry a wife though says he i little thought i should ever come to this    chapter vihigh tory oxford    the name of her late majesty queen anne has for some little time been a kind of party watchword  many harmless people have an innocent loyalty to this lady make themselves her knights as mary antoinette has still her sworn champions in france and mary stuart in scotland buy the plate of her serene period and imitate the dress  to many moral critics in the press however queen anne is a kind of abomination  i know not how it is but the terms queen anne furniture and blue china have become words of almost slanderous railing  any didactic journalist who uses them is certain at once to fall heavily on the artistic reputation of mr burne jones to rebuke the philosophy of mr pater and to hint that the entrancehall of the grosvenor gallery is that byway with which bunyan has made us familiar  in the changes of things our admiration of the augustan age of our literature the age of addison and steele of marlborough and aldrich has become a sort of reproach  it may be that our modern preachers know but little of that which they traduce  at all events the oxford of queen annes time was not what they call un english but highly conservative and as dull and beerbemused as the most manly taste could wish it to be  the spectator of the ingenious sir richard steele gives us many a glimpse of nonjuring oxford  the old fashion of sanctity mr addison says in the spectator no 494 had passed away nor were appearances of mirth and pleasure looked upon as the marks of a carnal mind  yet the puritan rule was not so far forgotten but that mr anthony henley a gentleman of property could remember how he had stood for a fellowship in a certain college whereof a great independent minister was governor  as oxford at this moment is much vexed in her mind about examinations wherein indeed her whole force is presently expended i make no scruple to repeat the account of mr henleys adventure   the youth according to custom waited on the governor of his college to be examined  he was received at the door by a servant who was one of that gloomy generation that were then in fashion  he conducted him with great silence and seriousness to a long gallery which was darkened at noonday and had only a single candle burning in it  after a short stay in this melancholy apartment he was led into a chamber hung with black where he entertained himself for some time by the glimmering of a taper till at length the head of the college came out to him from an inner room with half a dozen night caps upon his head and a religious horror in his countenance  the young man trembled but his fears increased when instead of being asked what progress he had made in learning he was askd how he abounded in grace  his latin and greek stood him in little stead he was to give an account only of the state of his soulwhether he was of the number of the elect what was the occasion of his conversion upon what day of the month and hour of the day it happened how it was carried on and when completed  the whole examination was summed up in one short question namely whether he was prepared for death  the boy who had been bred up by honest parents was frighted out of his wits by the solemnity of the proceeding and by the last dreadful interrogatory so that upon making his escape out of this house of mourning he could never be brought a second time to the examination as not being able to go through the terrors of it   by the year 1705 when tom hearne of st edmunds hall began to keep his diary the honest folkthat is the high churchmenhad the better of the independent ministers  the dissenters had some favour at court but in the university they were looked upon as utterly reprobate  from the reliquiae of hearne an antiquarian successor of antony wood a bibliophile an archaeologist and as honest a man as jacobitism could make him let us quote an example of heavens wrath against dissenters   aug 6 1706  we have an account from whitchurch in shropshire that the dissenters there having prepared a great quantity of bricks to erect a spacious conventicle a destroying angel came by night and spoiled them all and confounded their babel in the beginning to their great mortification   hearnes commonplace books are an amusing source of information about oxford society in the years of queen anne and of the hanoverian usurper  tom hearne was a master of arts of st edmunds hall and at one time deputylibrarian of the bodleian  he lost this post because he would not take the wicked oaths required of him but he did not therefore leave oxford  his working hours were passed in preparing editions of antiquarian books to be printed in very limited number on ordinary and large paper  it was the joy of toms existence to see his editions become first scarce then very scarce while the price augmented in proportion to the rarity  when he was not reading in his rooms he was taking long walks in the country tracing roman walls and roads and exploring woodstock park for the remains of the labyrinth as he calls the maze of fair rosamund in these strolls he was sometimes accompanied by undergraduates even gentlemen of noble family which gave cause to some to envy our happiness  hearne was a social creature and had a heart as he shows by the entry about the death of his very dear friend mr thomas cherry am to the great grief of all that knew him being a gentleman of great beauty singular modesty of wonderful good nature and most excellent principles  the friends of hearne were chiefly perhaps solely what he calls honest men supporters of the stuart family and always ready to drink his majestys king james health  they would meet in antiquity hall an old house near wadham and smoke their honest pipes  they held certain of the opinions of the hebdomadal meeting satirised by steele in the spectator no 43  we are much offended at the act for importing french wines  a bottle or two of good solid edifying port at honest georges made a night cheerful and threw off reserve  but this plaguy french claret will not only cost us more money but do us less good  hearne had a poor opinion of captain steele and of one tickle  this tickle is a pretender to poetry  he admits that though queens people are angry at the spectator and the commonroom say tis silly dull stuff men that are indifferent commend it highly as it deserves some other satirist had a plate etched representing antiquity hall a caricature of toms antiquarian engravings  it may be seen in skeltons book  thanks to hearne it is easy to reproduce the commonroom gossip and the more treasonable talk of honest men at antiquity hall  the learned were much interested as they usually are at oxford in theological discussion  some one proved by an ingenious syllogism that all men are to be saved but hearne had the better of this latitudinarian easily demonstrating that the comfortable argument does not meet the case of madmen and of deafmutes whom tom did not expect to meet in a future state  the ingenious though depressing speculations of mr dodwell were also discussed  he makes the air the receptacle of all souls good and bad and that they are under the power of the dl he being prince of the air  the less perfectly good hang out if we may say so in the space between earth and the clouds all which is subtle and creditable to mr dodwells invention but not susceptible of exact demonstration  the whole controversy is an interesting specimen of queen anne philosophy which with all respect for the taste of the period we need not wish to see revived  the bishop of worcester for example expects the end of the world about nine years hence  while the theology of oxford is being mentioned the zeal of dr miller regius professor of greek must not be forgotten  the learned professor endeavoured to convert and even writ a letter to mrs bracegirdle giving her great encomiums as having himself been often to see plays acted whilst they continued here upon account of her excellent qualifications and persuading her to give over this loose way of living and betake herself to such a kind of life as was more innocent and would gain her more credit  the professors advice was wasted on bracegirdle the brown  politics were naturally much discussed in these doubtful years when the stuarts it was thought had still a chance to win their own again  in 1706 tom says the great health now is the cube of three which is the number 27 ie the number of the protesting lords  the university was most devoted as far as drinking toasts constitutes loyalty  in hearnes commonplace book is carefully copied out this scotch health to k j   hes oer the seas and far awa hes oer the seas and far awa altho his back be at the wa well drink his health thats far awa   the words live and ring strangely out of that dusty past  the song survives the throne and sounds pathetically somehow as one has heard it chanted in days as dead as the year 1711 at suppers that seem as ancient almost as the festivities of thomas hearne  it is not unpleasant to remember that the people who sang could also fight and spilt their blood as well as their edifying port  if the southern honest men had possessed hearts for anything but tippling the history of england would have been different  when the allyes and the french fought a bloudy battle near mons 1709 malplaquet the oxford honest men like colonel henry esmond thought there was not any the least reason of bragging the young king of england under the character of the chevalier st george shewed abundance of undaunted courage and resolution led up his troups with unspeakable bravery appeared in the utmost dangers and at last was wounded  marlboroughs victories were sneered at his new palace of blenheim was said to be not only illbuilt but haunted by signs of evil omen  it was not always safe to say what one thought about politics at oxford  one mr a going to one mr tonson a barber put the barber and his wife in a ferment they being rascally whigs by maintaining that the hereditary right was in the p of w  tonson laid information against the gentleman which may be a warning to honest men not to enter into topicks of this nature with barbers  one would not willingly even now discuss the foreign policy of her majestys ministers with the person who shaves one  there are opportunities and temptations to which no decent person should be wantonly exposed  the bad effect of whiggery on the temper was evident in this that the mohocks are all of the whiggish gang and indeed all whigs are looked upon as such mohocks their principles and doctrines leading thus to all manner of barbarity and inhumanity  so true is it that conservatives are all lovers of peace and quiet that may 29th 1715 last night a good part of the presbyterian meetinghouse in oxford was pulled down  the people ran up and down the streets crying king james the third  the true king  no usurper  in the evening they pulled a good part of the quakers and anabaptists meetinghouses down  the heads of houses have represented that it was begun by the whiggs  probably the heads of houses reasoned on a priori principles when they arrived at this remarkable conclusion  in consequence of the honesty frankness and consistency of his opinions mr hearne ran his head in danger when king george came to the throne which has ever since been happily settled in the possession of the hanoverian line  a mr urry a nonjuror had to warn him saying do you not know that they have a mind to hang you if they can and that you have many enemies who are very ready to do it  in spite of this hearne in his diaries still calls george i the duke of brunswick and the whigs that fanatical crew  john duke of marlborough he styles that villain the duke  we have had enough perhaps of oxford politics which were not much more prejudiced in the days of the duke than in those of mr gladstone hearnes allusions to the contemporary state of buildings and of college manners are often rather instructive  in all souls the whigs had a feast on the day of king charless martyrdom  they had a dinner dressed of woodcock whose heads they cut off in contempt of the memory of the blessed martyr  these men were low churchmen more shame to them  the all souls men had already given up the custom of wandering about the college on the night of january 14th with sticks and poles in quest of the mallard  that swopping bird still justly respected was thought for many ages to linger in the college of which he is the protector  but now all hope of recovering him alive is lost and it is reserved for the excavator of the future to marvel over the fossil bones of the swopping swopping mallard  as an example of the paganism of queen annes reignquite a different thing from the neopaganism which now causes so much anxiety to the moral pressmanlet us note the affecting instance of geffery ammon  he was a merry companion and his conversation was much courted  geffery had but little sense of religion  he is now buried on the west side of binsey churchyard near st margarets well  geffery selected binsey for the place of his sepulchre because he was partial to the spot having often shot snipe there in order to moisten his clay he desired his friend will gardner a boatman of oxford who was accustomed to row him down the river to put now and then a bottle of ale by his grave when he came that way an injunction which was punctually complied with  oxford lost in hearnes time many of her old buildings  it is said with a dreadful appearance of truth that oxford is now to lose some of the few that are left  corpus and merton if they are not belied mean to pull down the old houses opposite merton halls and houses consecrated to the memory of antony wood and to build lecturerooms and houses for married dons on the site  the topic for one who is especially bound to pray for merton and who now does so with unusual fervour is most painful  a view of the proposed new buildings in the exhibition of the royal academy 1879 depresses the soul in the same spirit hearne says march 28th 1671 it always grieves me when i go through queens college to see the ruins of the old chapell next to high street the area of which now lies open the building being most of it pulled down and trampled upon by dogs etc as if the ground had never been consecrated  nor do the queens coll people take any care but rather laught at it when tis mentioned  in 1722 the famous posterngate called the turl gate a corruption for thorold gate was pulled down by one dr walker who lived by it and pretended that it was a detriment to his house as long ago as 1705 they had pulled down the building of peckwater quadrangle in ch ch  queens also pulled down the old refectory which was on the west side of the old quadrangle and was a fine old structure that i used to admire much  it appears that the college was also anxious to pull down the chamber of king henry v  this is a strange craze for destruction that some time ago endangered the beautiful library of merton a place where one can fancy that chaucer or wyclif may have studied  oxford will soon have little left of the beauty and antiquity of pateys quad in merton as represented in our illustration  what the next generation will think of the multitudinous new buildings it is not hard to conjecture  imitative experiments without style or fancy in structure or decoration and often more than medievally uncomfortable they will seem but evidences of oxfords love of destruction  people of hearnes way of thinking people who respect antiquity protest in vain and like hearne must be content sadly to enjoy what is left of grace and dignity  he died before oxford had quite become the oxford of gibbons autobiography    chapter viigeorgian oxford    oxford has usually been described either by her lovers or her malcontents  she has suffered the extremes of filial ingratitude and affection  there is something in the place that makes all her children either adore or detest her and it is difficult indeed to pick out the truth concerning her past social condition from the satires and the encomiums  nor is it easy to say what qualities in oxford and what answering characteristics in any of her sons will beget the favourable or the unfavourable verdict  gibbon one might have thought saw the sunny and johnson the shady side of the university  with youth and wealth and liberty with a set of three beautiful rooms in that stately pile the new building of magdalen college gibbon found nothing in oxford to please himnothing to admire nothing to love  from his poor and lofty rooms in pembroke gatetower the hypochondriac johnsonrugged anxious and conscious of his great unemployed powerlooked down on a much more pleasant oxford on a city and on schools that he never ceased to regard with affection  this contrast is found in the opinions of our contemporaries  one man will pass his time in sneering at his tutors and his companions in turning listlessly from study to study in following false tendencies and picking up scraps of knowledge which he despises and in later life he will detest his university  there are wiser and more successful students who yet bear away a grudge against the stately mother of us all that so easily can disregard our petty spleens and ungrateful rancour  mr lowes most bitter congratulatory addresses to the happy civil engineers and his unkindest cuts at ancient history and at the old philosophies which on argive heights divinely sung move her not at all  meanwhile the majority of men are more kindly compact and have more natural affections and on them the memory of their earliest friendships and of that beautiful environment which oxford gave to their years of youth is not wholly wasted  there are more johnsons happily in this matter than gibbons there is little need to repeat the familiar story of johnsons life at pembroke  he went up in the october term of 1728 being then nineteen years of age and already full of that wide and miscellaneous classical reading which the oxford course then as now somewhat discouraged  his figure and manner appeared strange to the company in which he found himself and when he broke silence it was with a quotation from macrobius  to his tutors lectures as a later poet says with freshman zeal he went but his zeal did not last out the discovery that the tutor was a heavy man and the fact that there was sliding on christ church meadow  have any of the artists who repeat with perseverance the most famous scenes in the doctors lifedrawn him sliding on christ church meadows sliding in these worn and clouted shoes of his and with that figure which even the exercise of skating could not have made swanlike to quote the young lady in pickwick  johnson was sconced in the sum of twopence for cutting lecture and it is rather curious that the amount of the fine was the same four hundred years earlier when master stoke of catte hall whose career we touched on in the second of these sketches deserted his lessons  it was when he was thus sconced that johnson made that reply which boswell preserves as a specimen of the antithetical character of his witsir you have sconced me twopence for nonattendance on a lecture not worth a penny  sconcing seems to have been the penalty for offences very various in degree  a young fellow of balliol college having upon some discontent cut his throat very dangerously the master of his college sent his servitor to the butterybook to sconce him five shillings and says the doctor tell him that the next time he cuts his throat ill sconce him ten  this prosaic punishment might perhaps deter some werthers from playing with edged tools  from boswells meagre account of johnsons oxford career we gather some facts which supplement the description of gibbon  the future historian went into residence twentythree years after johnson departed without taking his degree  gibbon was a gentleman commoner and was permitted by the easy discipline of magdalen to behave just as he pleased  he eloped as he says from oxford as often as he chose and went up to town where he was by no means the ideal of the manly oxonian in london  the fellows of magdalen possessing a revenue which private avarice might easily have raised to 30000 pounds took no interest in their pupils  gibbons tutor read a few latin plays with his pupil in a style of dry and literal translation  the other fellows less conscientious passed their lives in tippling and tattling discussing the oxford toasts and drinking other toasts to the king over the water  some duties says gibbon may possibly have been imposed on the poor scholars but the velvet cap was the cap of liberty and the gentleman commoner consulted only his own pleasure  johnson was a poor scholar and on him duties were imposed  he was requested to write an ode on the gunpowder plot and boswell thinks his vivacity and imagination must have produced something fine  he neglected however with his usual indolence this opportunity of producing something fine  another exercise imposed on the poor was the translation of mr popes messiah in which the young pembroke man succeeded so well that by mr popes own generous confession future ages would doubt whether the english or the latin piece was the original  johnson complained that no man could be properly inspired by the pembroke coll or college beer which was then commonly drunk by undergraduates still guiltless of rhine wines and of collecting chinese monsters   carmina vis nostri scribant meliora poetae ingenium jubeas purior baustus alat   in spite of the muddy beer the poverty and the bitterness mistaken for frolic with which johnson entertained the other undergraduates round pembroke gate he never ceased to respect his college  his love and regard for pembroke he entertained to the last while of his old tutor he said a man who becomes jordens pupil becomes his son  gibbons sneer is a foil to johnsons kindliness  i applaud the filial piety which it is impossible for me to imitate    to the university of oxford i acknowledge no obligations and she will as cheerfully renounce me for a son as i am willing to disclaim her for a mother  johnson was a man who could take the rough with the smooth and to judge by all accounts the oxford of the earlier half of the eighteenth century was excessively rough  manners were rather primitive  a big fire burned in the centre of balliol hall and round this fire one night in every year it is said that all the world was welcome to a feast of ale and bread and cheese  every guest paid his shot by singing a song or telling a story and one can fancy johnson sharing in this barbaric hospitality  what learning can they have who are destitute of all principles of civil behaviour says a writer from whose journal printed in 1746 southey has made some extracts  the diarist was a puritan of the old leaven who visited oxford shortly before johnsons period and who speaks of a power of gross darkness that may be felt constantly prevailing in that place of wisdom and of subtlety but not of god    in this wicked place the scholars are the rudest most giddy and unruly rabble and most mischievous  but this strange and unfriendly critic was a nonconformist in times when good churchmen showed their piety by wrecking chapels and rabbling ministers  in our days only the davenport brothers and similar professors of strange creeds suffer from the manly piety of the undergraduates  of all the carping crossgrained scandalloving whiggish assailants of alma mater the author of terrae filius was the most persistent  the first little volume which contains the numbers of this biweekly periodical printed for r franklin under toms coffeehouse in russell street covent garden mdccxxvi is not at all rare and is well worth a desultory reading  what strikes one most in terrae filius is the religious discontent of the bilious author  one thinks foolishly of course of even georgian whigs as orthodox men at least in their undergraduate days  the mere aspect of mr leslie stephens work on the philosophers of the eighteenth century is enough to banish this pleasing delusion  the deists and freethinkers had their followers in johnsons day among the undergraduates though scepticism like whiggery was unpopular and might be punished  johnson says that when he was a boy he was a lax talker rather than a lax thinker against religion but lax talking against religion at oxford would not be suffered  the author of terrae filius however never omits a chance of sneering at our faith and at the church of england as by law established  in his description of the exercises of the club of wits only one respectably clever epigram is quoted beginning    since in religion all men disagree and some one god believe some thirty and some three   this production was voted heretical and burned by the hands of the smallbeer drawer while the author was expelled  in the authors advice to freshmen he gives a not uninteresting sketch of these rudimentary creatures  the chrysalis as described by the preacher of a university sermon never in his wildest moments dreamed of being a butterfly but the public schoolboy of the last century sometimes came up in what he conceived to be gorgeous attire  i observe in the first place that you no sooner shake off the authority of the birch but you affect to distinguish yourselves from your dirty schoolfellows by a new drugget a pair of prim ruffles a new bobwig and a brazenhilted sword  as soon as they arrived in oxford these youths were hospitably received amongst a parcel of honest merry fellows who think themselves obliged in honour and common civility to make you damnable drunk and carry you as they call it a corpse to bed  when this period of jollity is ended the freshman must declare his views  he must see that he is in the fashion and let your declarations be that you are churchmen and that you believe as the church believes  for instance you have subscribed the thirtynine articles but never venture to explain the sense in which you subscribed them because there are various senses so many indeed that scarce two men understand them in the same and no true churchman in that which the words bear and in that which they were written  this is pretty plain speaking and terrae filius enforces by an historical example the dangers of even political freethought  in 1714 the constitution club kept king georges birthday  the constitutional party was then the name which the whigs took to themselves though thanks to the advance of civilisation the tories have fallen back upon the same  the conservative undergraduates attacked the club sallying forth from their jacobite stronghold in brasenose as seen in our illustration where the silly statue as hearne calls it was about that time erected  the whigs took refuge in oriel the tories assaulted the gates and an oriel man firing out of his window wounded a gownsman of brasenose  the tories under terror of this dangerous and unexpected resistance retreated from oriel  yet such was the academic strength of the jacobites and the churchmen that a freethinker or a constitutioner could scarcely take his degree  terrae filius who lashes the dons for covetousness greed dissipation rudeness and stupidity often corroborates the puritans report about the bad manners of the undergraduates  yet oxford then as now did not lack her exquisites and her admirers of the fair  terrae filius thus describes a smart as these dandies were calledmr frippery   he is one of those who come in their academical undress every morning between ten and eleven to lynes coffeehouse after which he takes a turn or two upon the park or under merton wall whilst the dull regulars are at dinner in their hall according to statute about one he dines alone in his chamber upon a boiled chicken or some pettitoes after which he allows himself an hour at least to dress in to make his afternoons appearance at lynes from whence he adjourns to hamiltons about five from whence after strutting about the room for a while and drinking a dram of citron he goes to chapel to show how genteelly he dresses and how well he can chaunt after prayers he drinks tea with some celebrated toast and then waits upon her to magdalen grove or paradise garden and back again he seldom eats any supper and never reads anything but novels and romances   the dress of this hero and his friends must have made the streets more gay than do the brightcoloured flannel coats of our boating men   he is easily distinguished by a stiff silk gown which rustles in the wind as he struts along a flax tiewig or sometimes a long natural one which reaches down below his well say below his waist a broad bullycockd hat or a square cap of about twice the usual size white stockings thin spanish leather shoes  his clothes lined with tawdry silk and his shirt ruffled down the bosom as well as at the wrists   these smarts cut no such gallant figure when they first arrived in oxford with their fathers rusty old country farmers in linsey woolsey coats greasy sunburnt heads of hair clouted shoes yarn stockings flapping hats with silver hatbands and long muslin neck cloths run with red at the bottom  after this satire of the undergraduates we may look at the contemporary accountbook of a proctor  in 1752 gilbert white of selborne was proctor and may have fined young gibbon of magdalen who little thought that oxford boasted an official who was to become an english classic  white paid some attention to dress and got a feathertoppd grizzled wig from london cost him 2 pounds 5s  he bought mountain wine very old and good and had his crest engraved on his teaspoons that everything might be handsome about him  when he treated the masters of arts in oriel hall they ate a hundred pounds weight of biscuitsnot we trust without marmalade  a bowl of rumpunch from horsmans cost half a crown  fancy a jolly proctor sending out for bowls of rumpunch and that in april  eggs cost a penny each and three oranges and a mousetrap ninepence  white a generous man gave the vicechancellor seven pounds of doublerefined white sugar  i like to fancy my learned friend the proctor going to the present vicechancellors with a donation of white sugar  manners have certainly changed in the direction of severity  share of the expense for mr butchers release came to ten and sixpence  what had mr butcher been doing  the proctor went to blenheim with nan and it cost him fifteen and sixpence perhaps she was one of the oxford toasts of a contemporary satire strawberries were fourpence a basket on the ninth of june and on november 6 white lost one shilling at cards in common room  he went from selborne to oxford in a postchaise with jenny croke and he gave jenny a round chinaturene  tea cost eight shillings a pound in 1752 while rumpunch was but half a crown a bowl  whites highest terminal battels were but 12 pounds though he was a hospitable man and would readily treat the other proctor to a bowl of punch  it is well to remember white and johnson when the gibbon of that or any other day bewails the intellectual poverty of oxford    chapter viiipoets at oxford  shelley and landor    at any given time a large number of poets may be found among the undergraduates at oxford and the younger dons  it is not easy to say what becomes of all these pious bards who are a marked and peculiar people while they remain in residence  the undergraduate poet is a not uninteresting study  he wears his hair long and divides it down the middle  his eye is wild and wandering and his manner absent especially when he is called on to translate a piece of an ancient author in lecture  he does not read much in the technical sense of the term but consumes all the novels that come in his way and all the minor poetry  his own verses the poet may be heard declaiming aloud at unholy midnight hours so that his neighbours have been known to break his windows with bottles and then to throw in all that remained of the cold meats of a supper party without interfering with the divine afflatus  when the college poet has composed a sonnet ode or what not he sends it to the editor of the nineteenth century and it returns to him after many days  at last it appears in print in college rhymes a collection of mild verse which is or was printed at regular or irregular intervals and was never seen except in the rooms of contributors  the poet also speaks at the union where his sentiments are either revolutionary or so wildly conservative that he looks on magna charta as the first step on the path that leads to englands ruin  as a politician the undergraduate poet knows no mean between mr peter taylor and king john  he has been known to found a tory club and shortly afterwards to swallow the formulae of mr bradlaugh  the life of the poet is not unnaturally one long warfare with his dons  he cannot conform himself to pedantic rules which demand his return to college before midnight  though often the possessor of a sweet vein of clerical and kebleian verse the poet does not willingly attend chapel for indeed as he sits up all night it is cruel to expect him to arise before noon  about the poets late habits a story is told which seems authentic  a remarkable and famous contemporary singer was known to his fellowundergraduates only by this circumstance that his melodious voice was heard declaiming anapaests all through the ambrosial night  when the voice of the singer was lulled three sharp taps were heard in the silence this noise was produced by the bards scotch friend and critic in knocking the ashes out of his pipe  these feasts of reason are almost incompatible with the early devotion which strangely enough shelley found time and inclination to attend  now it is or was the belief of undergraduates that you might break the decalogue and the laws of man in every direction with safety and the approval of the dons if you only went regularly to chapel  as the poet cannot do this unless he is a sleepless man his existence is a long struggle with the fellows and tutors of his college  the manners of poets vary of course with the tastes of succeeding generations  i have heard of two thyrsis and corydon who lived in oxford as if it were a large countryhouse  of other singers the latest of the heavenly quire it is invidiously said that they build shrines to blue china and other ceramic abominations of the philistine and worship the same in their rooms of this sort it is not the moment to speak  time has not proved them  but the old poets of ten years ago lived a militant life they rarely took good classes though they competed industriously for the newdigate writing in the metre of dolores and it not uncommonly happened that they left oxford without degrees  they were often very agreeable fellows as long as one was in no way responsible for them but it was almost impossiblehuman nature being what it isthat they should be much appreciated by tutors proctors and heads of houses  how could these worthy learned and often kind and courteous persons know when they were dealing with a lad of genius and when they had to do with an affected and pretentious donkey  these remarks are almost the necessary preface to a consideration of the existence of shelley and landor at oxfordthe oxford of 1793 1810  whatever the effects may be on shelleyan commentators it must be said that to the donnish eye percy bysshe shelley was nothing more or less than the ordinary oxford poet of the quieter type  in walter savage landor authority recognised a noisier and rowdier specimen of the same class  people who have to do with hundreds of young men at a time are unavoidably compelled to generalise  no don that was a don could have seen shelley or landor as they are described to us without hastily classing them in the category of poets who would come to no good and do little credit to the college landor went up to trinity college in 1793  it was the dreadful year of the terror when good englishmen hated the cruel murderers of kings and queens  landor was a good englishman of course and he never forgave the french the public assassination of marie antoinette  but he must needs be a jacobin and wear his own unpowdered hairthe poet thus declaring himself at once in the regular recognised fashion  for a portion of the time he certainly read hard but the results he kept to himself for here as at rugby he declined everything in the shape of competition  now competition is the essence of modern university study  though i wrote better latin verses than any undergraduate or graduate in the university says landor i could never be persuaded by my tutor or friends to contend for any prize whatever  the pleasantest and most profitable hours that landor could remember at oxford were passed with walter birch in the magdalen walk by the halfhidden cherwell hours like these are indeed the pleasantest and most profitable that any of us pass at oxford  the one duty which that university by virtue of its very nature has never neglected is the assembling of young men together from all over england and giving them three years of liberty of life of leisure and of discussion in scenes which are classical and peaceful  for these hours the most fruitful of our lives we are grateful to oxford as long as friendship lives that is as long as life and memory remain with us  and if anything endure if hope there be our conscious existence in the afterworld would ask for no better companions than those who walked with us by the isis and the cherwell  landor called himself a jacobin though his own letters show that he was as far as the most insolent young tuft from relishing doctrines of human equality  he had the reputation however of being not only a jacobin but a mad jacobin too mad for southey who was then young and a liberal  landor was obliged to leave the university for shooting at one of the fellows through a window is the account which southey gave of landors rustication  now fellows often put up with a great deal of horseplay  there is scarcely a more touching story than that of the don who for the first time found himself screwed up and fastened within his own oak  what am i to do the victim asked his sympathising scout who was on the other the free side of the oak  well sir mr muff sir when es screwed up e sends for the blacksmith replied the servant  what a position for a man having authority to be in the constant habit of sending for the blacksmith  fellows have not very unfrequently been fired at with roman candles or bombarded with sodawater bottles full of gunpowder  one has also known sparrows shot from balliol windows on the martyrs memorial of our illustration  in this case too the sportsman was a poet  but deliberately to pot at a fellow to go for him with a shot gun as the repentant american said he would do in future after his derringer missed fire is certainly a strong measure  no college which pretended to maintain discipline could allow even a poet to shoot thus wildly  in truth landors offence has been exaggerated by southey  it was nothing out of the common  the poet was giving an afterdinner party in his rooms the men were mostly from christ church for landor was intimate he says with only one undergraduate of his own college trinity  on the opposite side of the quadrangle a tory and a butt named leeds was entertaining persons whom the jacobin landor calls servitors and other raff of every description  the guests at the rival wine parties began to row each other landor says adding all the time i was only a spectator for i should have blushed to have had any conversation with them particularly out of a window  but my gun was lying on a table in the room and i had in a back closet some little shot  i proposed as they had closed the casements and as the shutters were on the outside to fire a volley  it was thought a good trick and accordingly i went into my bedroom and fired  mr leeds very superfluously complained to the president  landor adopted the worst possible line of defence and so the university and this poet parted company  it seems to have been generally understood that landors affair was a boyish escapade  a copious literature is engaged with the subject of shelleys expulsion  as the story is told by mr hogg in his delightful book the life of shelley that poets career at oxford was a typical one  there are in every generation youths like him in unworldliness wildness and dreaminess though unlike him of course in genius  the divine spark has not touched them but they like shelley are still of the band whom the world has not tamed  as mr hoggs book is out of print and rare it would be worth while did space permit to reproduce some of his wonderfully lifelike and truthful accounts of oxford as she was in 1810  the university has changed in many ways and in most ways for the better  perhaps that old indolent and careless oxford was better adapted to the life of such an almost unexampled genius as shelley  when his eton friends asked him whether he still meant to be the atheist that is the rebel he had been at school he said no the college authorities were civil and left him alone  let us remember this when the learned professor of poetry at oxford mr shairp calls shelley an atheist  mr hogg sometimes complains that undergraduates were left too much alone  but who could have safely advised or securely guided shelley  undergraduates are now more closely looked after as far as reading goes than perhaps they likecertainly much more than shelley would have liked  but when we turn from study to the conduct of life is it not plain that no official interference can be of real value friendship and confidence may and often does exist between tutors and pupils  there are tutors so happily gifted with sympathy and with a kind of eternal youth of heart and intellect that they become the friends of generation after generation of freshmen  this is fortunate but who can wonder that middleaged men seeing the generations succeed and resemble each other lose their powers of understanding of directing of aiding the young who are thus cast at once on their own resources  one has occasionally heard clever men complain that they were neglected by their seniors that their hearts and brains were full of perilous stuff which no one helped them to unpack  and it is true that modern education when it meets the impatience of youth often produces an unhappy ferment in the minds of men  to put it shortly clever students have to go through their age of sturm und drang and they are sometimes disappointed when older people their tutors for example do not help them to weather the storm  it is a tempest in which every one must steer for himself after all and shelley was borne darkly fearfully afar into unplumbed seas of thought and experience  when mr hogg complains that his friend was too much left to himself to study and think as he pleased let us remember that no one could have helped shelley  he was better at oxford without his old dr lind with whom he used to curse george iii after tea  there are few chapters in literary history more fascinating than those which tell the story of shelley at oxford  we see him entering the hall of university collegea tall shy stripling bronzed with the september sun with long elflocks  he takes his seat by a stranger and in a moment holds him spellbound while he talks of plato and goethe and alfieri of italian poetry and greek philosophy  mr hogg draws a curious sketch of shelley at work in his rooms where sevenshilling pieces were being dissolved in acid in the teacups where there was a great hole in the floor that the poet had burned with his chemicals  the oneeyed scout the arimaspian must have had a time of tribulation being a conscientious and fatherly man with this odd master  how characteristic of shelley it was to lend the glow of his fancy to science to declare that things not thoughts mineralogy not literature must occupy human minds for the future and then to leave a lecture on mineralogy in the middle and admit that stones are dull things after all  not less shelleyan was the adventure on magdalen bridge the beautiful bridge of our illustration from which oxford with the sunset behind it looks like a fairy city of the arabian nightsa town of palaces and princesses rather than of proctors   one sunday we had been reading plato together so diligently that the usual hour of exercise passed away unperceived  we sallied forth hastily to take the air for halfanhour before dinner  in the middle of magdalen bridge we met a woman with a child in her arms shelley was more attentive at that instant to our conduct in a life that was past or to come than to a decorous regulation of the present according to the established usages of society in that fleeting moment of eternal duration styled the nineteenth century with abrupt dexterity he caught hold of the child  the mother who might well fear that it was about to be thrown over the parapet of the bridge into the sedgy waters below held it fast by its long train  will your baby tell us anything about preexistence madam he asked in a piercing voice and with a wistful look   shelley and hogg seem almost to have lived in reality the life of the scholar gipsy  in mr arnolds poem which has made permanent for all time the charm the sentiment of oxfordshire scenery the poet seems to be following the track of shelley  in mr hoggs memoirs we hear little of summer it seems always to have been in winter that the friends took their long rambles in which shelley set free in talk his inspiration  one thinks of him   in winter on the causeway chill where home through flooded fields foot travellers go   returning to the supper in hoggs rooms to the curious desultory meals the talk and the deep slumber by the roaring fire the small head lying perilously near the flames  one would not linger here over the absurd injustice of his expulsion from the university  it is pleasant to know on mr hoggs testimony that residence at oxford was exceedingly delightful to shelley and on all accounts most beneficial  at oxford at least he seems to have been happy he who so rarely knew happiness and who if he made another suffer himself suffered so much for others  the memory of shelley has deeply entered into the sentiment of oxford  thinking of him in his glorious youth and of his residence here may we not say with the shepherd in theocritus of the divine singer  greek verse which cannot be reproduced  ah would that in my days thou hadst been numbered with the living how gladly on the hills would i have herded thy pretty shegoats and listened to thy voice whilst thou under oaks and pinetrees lying didst sweetly sing divine comatas    chapter ixa general view    we have looked at oxford life in so many different periods that now perhaps we may regard it like our artist as a whole and take a birdseye view of its present condition  we may ask st bernards question whither hast thou come a question to which there are so many answers readily given from within and without the university it is not probable that the place will vary in essential character from that which has all along been its own  we shall have considered oxford to very little purpose if it is not plain that the university has been less a home of learning on the whole than a microcosm of english intellectual life  at oxford the men have been thinking what england was to think a few months later and they have been thinking with the passion and the energy of youth  the impulse to thought has not perhaps very often been given by any mind or minds within the college walls it has come from withoutfrom italy from france from london from a country vicarage perhaps from the voice of a wandering preacher  whencesoever the leaven came oxford being so small and in a way so homogeneous has always fermented readily and promptly distributed the new forces religious or intellectual throughout england  it is characteristic of england that the exciting topics the questions that move the people most have always been religious or deeply tinctured with religion  conservative as oxford is the home of impossible causes she has always given asylum to new doctrines to all the thoughts which comfortable people call dangerous  we have seen her agitated by lollardism which never quite died perhaps till its eager protest against the sacerdotal ideal was fused into the fire of the reformation  oxford was literally devastated by that movement and by the catholic reaction and then was disturbed for a century and a half by the war of puritanism and of tory anglicanism  the latter had scarcely had time to win the victory and to fall into a doze by her pipe of port when evangelical religion came to vex all that was moderate mature and fond of repose  the revolutionary enthusiasm of shelleys time was comparatively feeble because it had no connection with religion or at least no connection with the religion to which our countrymen were accustomed  between the era of the revolution and our own day two religious tempests and one secular storm of thought have swept over oxford and the university is at present if one may say so like a ship in a heavy swell the sea looking much more tranquil than it really is  the tractarian movement was of course the first of the religious disturbances to which we refer and much the most powerful  it is curious to read about that movement in the apologia for example of cardinal newman  on what singular topics mens minds were bent what queer survivals of the speculations of the schools agitated them as they walked round christ church meadows  they enlightened each other on things transcendental yet material on matters unthinkable and properly speaking unspeakable  it is as if they spoke with tongues which had a meaning then and for them but which to us some forty years later seem as meaningless as the inscriptions of easter island  this was the shape the tractarian movement was the shape in which the great romantic reaction laid hold on england and oxford  the father of all the revival of old doctrines and old rituals in our church the originator of that wistful return to things beautiful and long dead waswalter scott  without him and his wonderful wand which made the dry bones of history live england and france would not have known this picturesque reaction  the stir in these two countries was curiously characteristic of their genius  in france it put on in the first place the shape of art of poetry painting sculpture  romanticism blossomed in 1830 and bore fruit for ten years  the religious reaction was a punier thing the great abbe who was the newman of france was himself unable to remain within the fantastic church that he built out of medieval ruins  in england and especially in oxford the aesthetic admiration of the past was promptly transmuted into religion  doctrines which men thought dead were resuscitated and from oxford came not poetry or painting but the sermons of newman the tracts the whole religious force which has transformed and revivified the church of england  that force is still working it need hardly be said in the university of today under conditions much changed but not without thrills of the old volcanic energy  probably the anglican ideas ceased to be the most powerfully agitating of intellectual forces in oxford about 1845  a new current came in from rugby and the influence of dr arnold and the natural tide of reaction began to run very strong  if we had the apologiae of the men who thought most about the time when clough was an undergraduate we should see that the influence of the anglican divines had become a thing of sentiment and curiosity  the life had not died out of it but the people whom it could permanently affect were now limited in number and easily recognisable  this form of religion might tempt and attract the strongest men for a while but it certainly would not retain them  it is by this time a matter of history though we are speaking of our contemporaries that the abyss between the lives of the english saints and the nemesis of faith was narrow and easily crossed  there was in oxford that enthusiasm for certain german ideas which had previously been felt for medieval ideas  liberalism in history philosophy and religion was the ruling power and people believed in liberalism  what is or used to be called the broad church was the birth of some ten or fifteen years of liberalism in religion at oxford  the essays and reviews were what the tracts had been and homeric battles were fought over the income of the regius professor of greek  when that affair was settled liberalism had had her innings there was no longer a single dominant intellectual force but the old storms slowly subsiding left the ship of the university lurching and rolling in a heavy swell  people believed in liberalism  their faith worked miracles and the great university commission performed many wonderful works bidding close fellowships be open and giving all power into the hands of examiners  their dispensation still survives the large examining machine works night and day in term time and vacation and yet we are not happy  the age in oxford as in the world at large is the age of collapsed opinions  never men believed more fervidly in any revelation than the men of twenty years ago believed in political economy free trade open competition and the reign of commonsense and of mr cobden  where is that faith now  many of the middleaged disciples of the church of commonsense are still in our midst  they say the old sayings they intone the old responses but somehow it seems that scepticism is abroad it seems that the world is wider than their system  not even open examinations for fellowships and scholarships not half a dozen new schools and science and the museum and the slade professorship of art have made oxford that ideal university which was expected to come down from heaven like the new jerusalem  we have glanced at the history of oxford to little purpose if we have not learned that it is an eminently discontented place  there is room in colleges and common rooms for both sorts of discontentthe ignoble which is the child of vanity and weakness and the noble which is the unassuaged thirst for perfection  the present result of the last forty years in oxford is a discontent which is constantly trying to improve the working and to widen the intellectual influence of the university  there are more ways than one in which this feeling gets vent  the simplest and perhaps the most honest and worthy impulse is that which makes the best of the present arrangements  great religious excitement and religious discussion being in abeyance for once the energy of the place goes out in teaching  the last reforms have made oxford a huge collection of schools in which physical science history philosophy philology scholarship theology and almost everything in the world but archaeology are being taught and learned with very great vigour the hardest worked of men is a conscientious college tutor and almost all tutors are conscientious  the professors being an ornamental but with few exceptions merely ornamental order of beings the tutors have to do the work of a university which for the moment is a teachingmachine  they deliver i know not how many sets of lectures a year and each lecture demands a fresh and full acquaintance with the latest ideas of french german and italian scholars  no one can afford or is willing to lag behind every one is gladly learning like chaucers clerk as well as earnestly teaching  the knowledge and the industry of these gentlemen is a perpetual marvel to the bellelettristic trifler  new studies like that of celtic and of the obscurer oriental tongues have sprung up during recent years have grown into strength and completeness  it is unnecessary to say perhaps that these facts dispose of the popular idea about the luxury of the long vacation  during the more part of the long vacation the conscientious teacher must be toiling after the great mundane movement in learning  he must be acquiring the very freshest ideas about sanscrit and greek about the ogham characters and the cyprian syllabary about early greek inscriptions and the origins of roman history in addition to reading the familiar classics by the light of the latest commentaries  what is the tangible result and what the gain of all these labours the answer is the secret of university discontent  all this accumulated knowledge goes out in teaching is scattered abroad in lectures is caught up in notebooks and is poured out with a difference in examinations  there is not an amount of original literary work produced by the university which bears any due proportion to the solid materials accumulated  it is just the reverse of falstaffs casebut one halfpennyworth of sack to an intolerable deal of bread but a drop of the spirit of learning to cartloads of painfully acquired knowledge  the time and energy of men is occupied in amassing facts in lecturing and then in eternal examinations  even if the results are satisfactory on the whole even if a hundred wellequipped young men are turned out of the examiningmachine every year these arrangements certainly curb individual ambition  if a resident in oxford is to make an income that seems adequate he must lecture examine and write manuals and primers till he is grey and till the energy that might have added something new and valuable to the acquisitions of the world has departed  this state of things has produced the demand for the endowment of research  it is not necessary to go into that controversy englishmen as a rule believe that endowed cats catch no mice  they would rather endow a theatre than a gelehrter if endow something they must  they have a british sympathy with these beautiful if useless beings the heads of houses whom it would be necessary to abolish if researchers were to get the few tens of thousands they require  finally it is asked whether the learned might not find great endowment in economy for it is a fact that a frenchman a german or an italian will research for life on no larger income than a simple fellowship bestows  the great obstacle to this plain living is perhaps to be found in the traditional hospitality of oxford  all her doors are open and every stranger is kindly entreated by her and she is like the discreet housewife in homer    greek text which cannot be reproduced   in some languages the same word serves for stranger and enemy but in the oxford dialect stranger and guest are synonymous such is the custom of the place and it does not make plain living very easy  some critics will be anxious here to attack the aesthetic movement  one will be expected to say that after the ideas of newman after the ideas of arnold and of jowett came those of the wicked the extravagant the effeminate the immoral blue china school  perhaps there is something in this but sermons on the subject are rather luxuries than necessaries in the present didactic mood of the press  they were friends of ours moreover as aristotle says who brought these ideas in so the subject may be left with this brief notice  as a piece of practical advice one may warn the young and ardent advocate of the endowment of research that he will find it rather easier to curtail his expenses than to get a subsidy from the commission  the last important result of the modern spirit at oxford the last stroke of the sanguine liberal genius was the removal of the celibate condition from certain fellowships  one can hardly take a birdseye view of oxford without criticising the consequences of this innovation  the topic however is for a dozen reasons very difficult to handle  one reason is that the experiment has not been completely tried  it is easy enough to marry on a fellowship a tutorship and a few small miscellaneous offices  but how will it be when you come to forty years or even fifty  no materials exist which can be used by the social philosopher who wants an answer to this question  in the meantime the common rooms are perhaps more dreary than of old in many a college for lack of the presence of men now translated to another place  as to the society of oxford that is no doubt very much more charming and vivacious than it used to be in the days when tony wood was the surly champion of celibacy  looking round the university then one finds in it an activity that would once have seemed almost feverish a highly conscientious industry doing that which its hand finds to do but not absolutely certain that it is not neglecting nobler tasks  perhaps oxford has never been more busy with its own work never less distracted by religious politics  if we are to look for a less happy sign we shall find it in the tendency to run up new buildings  the colleges are landowners  they must suffer with other owners of real property in the present depression they will soon need all their savings  that is one reason why they should be chary of building another is that the fellows of a college at any given moment are not necessarily endowed with architectural knowledge and taste  they should think twice or even thrice before leaving on oxford for many centuries the uncomely mark of an unfortunate judgment    chapter xundergraduate lifeconclusion    a hundred pictures have been drawn of undergraduate life at oxford and a hundred caricatures  novels innumerable introduce some oxford scenes  an author generally writes his first romance soon after taking his degree he writes about his own experience and his own memories he mixes his ingredients at will and tints according to fancy  this is one of the two reasons why pictures of oxford from the undergraduate side are generally false  they are either drawn by an aspirant who is his own hero and who idealises himself and his friends or they are designed by ladies who have read verdant green and who at some period have paid a flying visit to cambridge  an exhaustive knowledge of verdant green and a hasty view of the fitzwilliam museum and the backs of the colleges which are to cambridge what the docks are to liverpool do not afford sufficient materials for an accurate sketch of oxford  the picture daubed by the emancipated undergraduate who dabbles in fiction is as unrecognisable  he makes himself and his friends too large too noisy too bibulous too learned too extravagant too pugnacious they seem to stride down the high prodigious disproportionate figures like the kings of egypt on the monuments overshadowing the crowd of dons tradesmen bargees and cricketfield or riverside cads  often one dimly recognises the scenes and the acquaintances of years ago in university novels  the mildest of men suddenly pose as heroes of the guy livingstone type fellows who screw up timid dons box with colossal watermen and read all night with wet towels bound round their fevered brows  these sketches are all nonsense men who do these things do not write about them and men who write about them never did them  there is yet another cause which increases the difficulty of describing undergraduate life with truth  there are very many varieties of undergraduates who have very various ways of occupying and amusing themselves  a steady man that reads his five or six hours a day and takes his pastime chiefly on the river finds that his path scarcely ever crosses that of him who belongs to the bullingdon club hunts thrice a week and rarely dines in hall  then the pale student who is hard at work in his rooms or in the bodleian all day and who has only two friends outcollege men with whom he takes walks and teahe sees existence in a very different aspect  the union politician who is for ever hanging about his club dividing the house on questions of blottingpaper and quill pens discussing its affairs at breakfast intriguing for the place of librarian writing rubbish in the suggestionbook to him oxford is only a soil carefully prepared for the growth of that fine flower the union  he never encounters the undergraduate who haunts billiardrooms and shy taverns who buys jewelry for barmaids and who is admired for the audacity with which he smuggled a foxterrier into college in a brownpaper parcel  there are many other species of undergraduate scarcely more closely resembling each other in manners and modes of thought than the little japanese student resembles the metaphysical scotch exhibitioner or than the hereditary war minister of siam whose career though brief was vivacious resembled the exeter sioux a halfreclaimed savage who disappeared on the warpath after failing to scalp the junior proctor when the wet blanket returned to his lodge in the land of sitting bull he doubtless described oxford life in his own way to the other braves while the squaws hung upon his words and the papooses played around  his account would vary in many ways from that of   whiskered tomkins from the hail of seedy magdalene   and he again would not see oxford life steadily and see it whole as a more cultivated and polished undergraduate might  thus there are countless pictures of the works and ways of undergraduates at the university  the scene is ever the sameboatraces and football matches scouts schools and proctors are common to allbut in other respects the sketches must always vary must generally be one sided and must often seem inaccurate  it appears that a certain romance is attached to the three years that are passed between the estate of the freshman and that of the bachelor of arts  these years are spent in a kind of fairyland neither quite within nor quite outside of the world  college life is somewhat as has so often been said like the old greek city life for three years men are in the possession of what the world does not enjoyleisure and they are supposed to be using that leisure for the purposes of perfection  they are making themselves and their characters  we are all doing that all the days of our lives but at the universities there is or is expected to be more deliberate and conscious effort  men are in a position to try all things before committing themselves to any  their newfound freedom does not merely consist in the right to poke their own fires order their own breakfasts and use their own chequebooks  these things which make so much impression on the mind at first are only the outward signs of freedom  the boy who has just left school and the thoughtless life of routine in work and play finds himself in the midst of books of thought and discussion  he has time to look at all the common problems of the hour and yet he need not make up his mind hurriedly nor pledge himself to anything  he can flirt with young opinions which come to him with candid faces fresh as queen entelechy in rabelais though like her they are as old as human thought  here first he meets metaphysics and perhaps falls in love with that enchantress who sifts time with a fine large blue silk sieve  there is hardly a clever lad but fancies himself a metaphysician and has designs on the absolute  most fall away very early from this their first love and they follow science down one of her many paths or concern themselves with politics and take a side which as a rule is the opposite of that to which they afterwards adhere  thus your christian socialist becomes a court preacher and puts his trust in princes the young tory of the old type will lapse into membership of a school board  it is the time of liberty and of intellectual attachments too fierce to last long  unluckily there are subjects more engrossing and problems more attractive than politics and science art and pure metaphysics the years of undergraduate life are those in which to many men the enigmas of religion present themselves  they bring their boyish faith into a place if one may quote pantagruels voyage once more like the isle of the macraeones  on that mournful island were confusedly heaped the ruins of altars fanes temples shrines sacred obelisks barrows of the dead pyramids and tombs  through the ruins wandered now and again the halfarticulate words of the oracle telling how pan was dead  oxford like the isle of the macraeones is a lumberroom of ruinous philosophies decrepit religions forlorn beliefs  the modern system of study takes the pupil through all the philosophic and many of the religious systems of belief which in the distant and the nearer past have been fashioned by men and have sheltered men for a day  you are taught to mark each system crumbling to watch the rise of the new temple of thought on its ruins and to see that also perish breached by assaults from without or sapped by the slow approaches of time  this is not the place in which we can well discuss the merits of modern university education  but no man can think of his own university days or look with sympathetic eyes at those who fill the old halls and rooms and not remember with a twinge of the old pain how religious doubt insists on thrusting itself into the colleges  and it is fair to say that for this no set of teachers or tutors is responsible  it is the modern historical spirit that must be blamed that too clearsighted vision which we are all condemned to share of the past of the race  we are compelled to look back on old philosophies on india athens alexandria and on the schools of men who thought so hard within our own ancient walls  we are compelled to see that their systems were only plausible that their truths were but halftruths  it is the long vista of failure thus revealed which suggests these doubts that weary and torture and embitter the naturally happy life of discussion amusement friendship sport and study  these doubts after all dwell on the threshold of modern existence and on the thresholdnamely at the universitiesmen subdue them or evade them  the amusements of the university have been so often described that little need be said of them here  unhealthy as the site of oxford is the place is rather fortunately disposed for athletic purposes the river is the chief feature in the scenery and in the life of amusement  from the first day of term in october it is crowded with every sort of craft  the freshman admires the golden colouring of the woods and magdalen tower rising silvery through the blue autumnal haze  as soon as he appears on the river his weight strength and form are estimated  he soon finds himself pulling in a college challenge four under the severe eye of a senior cox and by the middle of december he has rowed his first race and is regularly entered for a serious vocation  the thoroughgoing boatingman is the creature of habit  every day at the same hour after a judicious luncheon he is seen in flannels making for the barge  he goes out in a skiff or a pair or a fouroar or to a steeplechase through the hedges when oxford as in our illustration is under water  the illustration represents merton and the writer recognises his old rooms with the venetian blinds which mr ruskin denounced  chief of all the boatingman goes out in an eight and rows down to iffley with the beautiful old mill and norman church or accomplishes the long course  he rows up again lounges in the barge rows down again if he has only pulled over the short course and goes back to dinner in hall  the table where men sit who are in training is a noisy table and the athletes verge on bearfighting even in hall  a statistician might compute how many steaks chops pots of beer and of marmalade an orthodox man will consume in the course of three years  he will perhaps pretend to suffer from the monotony of boating shop boating society and broadblown boating jokes  but this appears to be a harmless affectation  the old breakfasts wines and suppers the honest boating slang will always have an attraction for him  the summer term will lose its delight when the may races are over  boatingmen are the salt of the university so steady so well disciplined so goodtempered are they  the sport has nothing selfish or personal in it men row for their college or their university not like runningmen who run as it were each for his own hand  whatever may be his work in life a boatingman will stick to it  his favourite sport is not expensive and nothing can possibly be less luxurious  he is often a reading man though it may be doubted whether he who runs may read as a rule  running is perhaps a little overdone and strangers cups are or lately were given with injudicious generosity  to the artists eye however few sights in modern life are more graceful than the university quarterofamile race  nowhere else perhaps do you see figures so full of a hellenic grace and swiftness  the cream of university life is the first summer term  debts as yet are not the schools are too far off to cast their shadow over the unlimited enjoyment which begins when lecture is over at one oclock  there are so many things to do    when wickets are bowled and defended when isis is glad with the eights when music and sunset are blended when youth and the summer are mates when freshmen are heedless of greats when notebooks are scribbled with rhyme ah these are the hours that one rates sweet hours and the fleetest of time   there are drags at every college gate to take college teams down to cowley  there is the beautiful scenery of the stripling thames to explore the haunts of the immortal scholar gipsy and of shelley and of cloughs piper who    went in his youth and the sunshine rejoicing to nuneham and godstowe   further afield men seldom go in summer there is so much to delight and amuse in oxford 2  what day can be happier than that of which the morning is given after a lively college breakfast or a commonising with a friend to study while cricket occupies the afternoon till music and sunset fill the grassy stretches above iffley and the college eights flash past among cheering and splashing  then there is supper in the cool halls darkling and halflit up and after supper talk till the birds twitter in the elms and the roofs and the chapel spire look unfamiliar in the blue of dawn  how long the days were then almost like the days of childhood how distinct is the impression all experience used to make  in later seasons care is apt to mount the college staircase and the oak which shelley blessed cannot keep out this visitor she comes in many a shapeas debt and doubt and melancholy and often she comes as bereavement  life and her claims wax importunate to many men the schools mean a cruel and wearing anxiety out of all proportion to the real importance of academic success  we cannot see things as they are and estimate their value in youth and if pleasures are more keen then grief is more hopeless doubt more desolate uncertainty more gnawing than in later years when we have known and survived a good deal of the worst of mortal experience often on men still in their pupilage the weight of the first misfortunes falls heavily the first touch of dame fortunes whip is the most poignant  we cannot recover the first summer term but it has passed into ourselves and our memories into which oxford with her beauty and her romance must also quickly pass  he is not to be envied who has known and does not love her  where her children have quarrelled with her the fault is theirs not hers  they have chosen the accidental evils to brood on in place of acquiescing in her grace and charm  these are crowded and hustled out of modern life the fever and the noise of our struggles fill all the land leaving still at the universities peace beauty and leisure  if any word in these papers has been unkindly said it has only been spoken i hope of the busybodies who would make oxford cease to be herself who would rob her of her loveliness and her repose    footnotes  1  poems by ernest myers  london 1877  2  a
