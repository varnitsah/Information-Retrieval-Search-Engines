33662470	the parasite  a story   by  a conan doyle   author of the refugees micah clarke etc     1894     the parasite  i  march 24  the spring is fairly with us now  outside my laboratory window the great chestnuttree is all covered with the big glutinous gummy buds some of which have already begun to break into little green shuttlecocks  as you walk down the lanes you are conscious of the rich silent forces of nature working all around you  the wet earth smells fruitful and luscious  green shoots are peeping out everywhere the twigs are stiff with their sap and the moist heavy english air is laden with a faintly resinous perfume  buds in the hedges lambs beneath themeverywhere the work of reproduction going forward  i can see it without and i can feel it within  we also have our spring when the little arterioles dilate the lymph flows in a brisker stream the glands work harder winnowing and straining  every year nature readjusts the whole machine  i can feel the ferment in my blood at this very moment and as the cool sunshine pours through my window i could dance about in it like a gnat  so i should only that charles sadler would rush upstairs to know what was the matter  besides i must remember that i am professor gilroy  an old professor may afford to be natural but when fortune has given one of the first chairs in the university to a man of fourandthirty he must try and act the part consistently  what a fellow wilson is  if i could only throw the same enthusiasm into physiology that he does into psychology i should become a claude bernard at the least  his whole life and soul and energy work to one end  he drops to sleep collating his results of the past day and he wakes to plan his researches for the coming one  and yet outside the narrow circle who follow his proceedings he gets so little credit for it  physiology is a recognized science  if i add even a brick to the edifice every one sees and applauds it  but wilson is trying to dig the foundations for a science of the future  his work is underground and does not show  yet he goes on uncomplainingly corresponding with a hundred semimaniacs in the hope of finding one reliable witness sifting a hundred lies on the chance of gaining one little speck of truth collating old books devouring new ones experimenting lecturing trying to light up in others the fiery interest which is consuming him  i am filled with wonder and admiration when i think of him and yet when he asks me to associate myself with his researches i am compelled to tell him that in their present state they offer little attraction to a man who is devoted to exact science  if he could show me something positive and objective i might then be tempted to approach the question from its physiological side  so long as half his subjects are tainted with charlatanerie and the other half with hysteria we physiologists must content ourselves with the body and leave the mind to our descendants  no doubt i am a materialist  agatha says that i am a rank one  i tell her that is an excellent reason for shortening our engagement since i am in such urgent need of her spirituality  and yet i may claim to be a curious example of the effect of education upon temperament for by nature i am unless i deceive myself a highly psychic man  i was a nervous sensitive boy a dreamer a somnambulist full of impressions and intuitions  my black hair my dark eyes my thin olive face my tapering fingers are all characteristic of my real temperament and cause experts like wilson to claim me as their own  but my brain is soaked with exact knowledge  i have trained myself to deal only with fact and with proof  surmise and fancy have no place in my scheme of thought  show me what i can see with my microscope cut with my scalpel weigh in my balance and i will devote a lifetime to its investigation  but when you ask me to study feelings impressions suggestions you ask me to do what is distasteful and even demoralizing  a departure from pure reason affects me like an evil smell or a musical discord  which is a very sufficient reason why i am a little loath to go to professor wilsons tonight  still i feel that i could hardly get out of the invitation without positive rudeness and now that mrs marden and agatha are going of course i would not if i could  but i had rather meet them anywhere else  i know that wilson would draw me into this nebulous semiscience of his if he could  in his enthusiasm he is perfectly impervious to hints or remonstrances  nothing short of a positive quarrel will make him realize my aversion to the whole business  i have no doubt that he has some new mesmerist or clairvoyant or medium or trickster of some sort whom he is going to exhibit to us for even his entertainments bear upon his hobby  well it will be a treat for agatha at any rate  she is interested in it as woman usually is in whatever is vague and mystical and indefinite  1050 p m  this diarykeeping of mine is i fancy the outcome of that scientific habit of mind about which i wrote this morning  i like to register impressions while they are fresh  once a day at least i endeavor to define my own mental position  it is a useful piece of selfanalysis and has i fancy a steadying effect upon the character frankly i must confess that my own needs what stiffening i can give it  i fear that after all much of my neurotic temperament survives and that i am far from that cool calm precision which characterizes murdoch or pratthaldane  otherwise why should the tomfoolery which i have witnessed this evening have set my nerves thrilling so that even now i am all unstrung  my only comfort is that neither wilson nor miss penclosa nor even agatha could have possibly known my weakness  and what in the world was there to excite me nothing or so little that it will seem ludicrous when i set it down  the mardens got to wilsons before me  in fact i was one of the last to arrive and found the room crowded  i had hardly time to say a word to mrs marden and to agatha who was looking charming in white and pink with glittering wheatears in her hair when wilson came twitching at my sleeve  you want something positive gilroy said he drawing me apart into a corner  my dear fellow i have a phenomenona phenomenon  i should have been more impressed had i not heard the same before  his sanguine spirit turns every firefly into a star  no possible question about the bona fides this time said he in answer perhaps to some little gleam of amusement in my eyes  my wife has known her for many years  they both come from trinidad you know  miss penclosa has only been in england a month or two and knows no one outside the university circle but i assure you that the things she has told us suffice in themselves to establish clairvoyance upon an absolutely scientific basis  there is nothing like her amateur or professional  come and be introduced  i like none of these mysterymongers but the amateur least of all with the paid performer you may pounce upon him and expose him the instant that you have seen through his trick  he is there to deceive you and you are there to find him out  but what are you to do with the friend of your hosts wife  are you to turn on a light suddenly and expose her slapping a surreptitious banjo  or are you to hurl cochineal over her evening frock when she steals round with her phosphorus bottle and her supernatural platitude  there would be a scene and you would be looked upon as a brute  so you have your choice of being that or a dupe  i was in no very good humor as i followed wilson to the lady  any one less like my idea of a west indian could not be imagined  she was a small frail creature well over forty i should say with a pale peaky face and hair of a very light shade of chestnut  her presence was insignificant and her manner retiring  in any group of ten women she would have been the last whom one would have picked out her eyes were perhaps her most remarkable and also i am compelled to say her least pleasant feature  they were gray in colorgray with a shade of greenand their expression struck me as being decidedly furtive  i wonder if furtive is the word or should i have said fierce  on second thoughts feline would have expressed it better  a crutch leaning against the wall told me what was painfully evident when she rose that one of her legs was crippled  so i was introduced to miss penclosa and it did not escape me that as my name was mentioned she glanced across at agatha  wilson had evidently been talking  and presently no doubt thought i she will inform me by occult means that i am engaged to a young lady with wheatears in her hair  i wondered how much more wilson had been telling her about me  professor gilroy is a terrible sceptic said he i hope miss penclosa that you will be able to convert him  she looked keenly up at me  professor gilroy is quite right to be sceptical if he has not seen any thing convincing said she  i should have thought she added that you would yourself have been an excellent subject  for what may i ask said i  well for mesmerism for example  my experience has been that mesmerists go for their subjects to those who are mentally unsound  all their results are vitiated as it seems to me by the fact that they are dealing with abnormal organisms  which of these ladies would you say possessed a normal organism she asked  i should like you to select the one who seems to you to have the best balanced mind  should we say the girl in pink and whitemiss agatha marden i think the name is  yes i should attach weight to any results from her  i have never tried how far she is impressionable  of course some people respond much more rapidly than others  may i ask how far your scepticism extends  i suppose that you admit the mesmeric sleep and the power of suggestion  i admit nothing miss penclosa  dear me i thought science had got further than that  of course i know nothing about the scientific side of it  i only know what i can do  you see the girl in red for example over near the japanese jar i shall will that she come across to us  she bent forward as she spoke and dropped her fan upon the floor  the girl whisked round and came straight toward us with an enquiring look upon her face as if some one had called her  what do you think of that gilroy cried wilson in a kind of ecstasy  i did not dare to tell him what i thought of it  to me it was the most barefaced shameless piece of imposture that i had ever witnessed  the collusion and the signal had really been too obvious  professor gilroy is not satisfied said she glancing up at me with her strange little eyes  my poor fan is to get the credit of that experiment  well we must try something else  miss marden would you have any objection to my putting you off  oh i should love it cried agatha  by this time all the company had gathered round us in a circle the shirtfronted men and the whitethroated women some awed some critical as though it were something between a religious ceremony and a conjurers entertainment  a red velvet armchair had been pushed into the centre and agatha lay back in it a little flushed and trembling slightly from excitement  i could see it from the vibration of the wheatears  miss penclosa rose from her seat and stood over her leaning upon her crutch  and there was a change in the woman  she no longer seemed small or insignificant  twenty years were gone from her age  her eyes were shining a tinge of color had come into her sallow cheeks her whole figure had expanded  so i have seen a dulleyed listless lad change in an instant into briskness and life when given a task of which he felt himself master  she looked down at agatha with an expression which i resented from the bottom of my soulthe expression with which a roman empress might have looked at her kneeling slave  then with a quick commanding gesture she tossed up her arms and swept them slowly down in front of her  i was watching agatha narrowly  during three passes she seemed to be simply amused  at the fourth i observed a slight glazing of her eyes accompanied by some dilation of her pupils  at the sixth there was a momentary rigor  at the seventh her lids began to droop  at the tenth her eyes were closed and her breathing was slower and fuller than usual  i tried as i watched to preserve my scientific calm but a foolish causeless agitation convulsed me  i trust that i hid it but i felt as a child feels in the dark  i could not have believed that i was still open to such weakness  she is in the trance said miss penclosa  she is sleeping i cried  wake her then  i pulled her by the arm and shouted in her ear  she might have been dead for all the impression that i could make  her body was there on the velvet chair  her organs were actingher heart her lungs  but her soul  it had slipped from beyond our ken  whither had it gone what power had dispossessed it  i was puzzled and disconcerted  so much for the mesmeric sleep said miss penclosa  as regards suggestion whatever i may suggest miss marden will infallibly do whether it be now or after she has awakened from her trance  do you demand proof of it  certainly said i  you shall have it  i saw a smile pass over her face as though an amusing thought had struck her  she stooped and whispered earnestly into her subjects ear  agatha who had been so deaf to me nodded her head as she listened  awake cried miss penclosa with a sharp tap of her crutch upon the floor  the eyes opened the glazing cleared slowly away and the soul looked out once more after its strange eclipse  we went away early  agatha was none the worse for her strange excursion but i was nervous and unstrung unable to listen to or answer the stream of comments which wilson was pouring out for my benefit  as i bade her goodnight miss penclosa slipped a piece of paper into my hand  pray forgive me said she if i take means to overcome your scepticism  open this note at ten oclock tomorrow morning  it is a little private test  i cant imagine what she means but there is the note and it shall be opened as she directs  my head is aching and i have written enough for tonight  tomorrow i dare say that what seems so inexplicable will take quite another complexion  i shall not surrender my convictions without a struggle  march 25  i am amazed confounded  it is clear that i must reconsider my opinion upon this matter  but first let me place on record what has occurred  i had finished breakfast and was looking over some diagrams with which my lecture is to be illustrated when my housekeeper entered to tell me that agatha was in my study and wished to see me immediately  i glanced at the clock and saw with sun rise that it was only halfpast nine  when i entered the room she was standing on the hearthrug facing me something in her pose chilled me and checked the words which were rising to my lips  her veil was half down but i could see that she was pale and that her expression was constrained  austin she said i have come to tell you that our engagement is at an end  i staggered  i believe that i literally did stagger  i know that i found myself leaning against the bookcase for support  butbut i stammered  this is very sudden agatha  yes austin i have come here to tell you that our engagement is at an end  but surely i cried you will give me some reason  this is unlike you agatha  tell me how i have been unfortunate enough to offend you  it is all over austin  but why  you must be under some delusion agatha  perhaps you have been told some falsehood about me  or you may have misunderstood something that i have said to you  only let me know what it is and a word may set it all right  we must consider it all at an end  but you left me last night without a hint at any disagreement  what could have occurred in the interval to change you so  it must have been something that happened last night  you have been thinking it over and you have disapproved of my conduct  was it the mesmerism did you blame me for letting that woman exercise her power over you you know that at the least sign i should have interfered  it is useless austin  all is over  her voice was cold and measured her manner strangely formal and hard it seemed to me that she was absolutely resolved not to be drawn into any argument or explanation  as for me i was shaking with agitation and i turned my face aside so ashamed was i that she should see my want of control  you must know what this means to me i cried  it is the blasting of all my hopes and the ruin of my life  you surely will not inflict such a punishment upon me unheard  you will let me know what is the matter consider how impossible it would be for me under any circumstances to treat you so  for gods sake agatha let me know what i have done  she walked past me without a word and opened the door  it is quite useless austin said she  you must consider our engagement at an end  an instant later she was gone and before i could recover myself sufficiently to follow her i heard the halldoor close behind her  i rushed into my room to change my coat with the idea of hurrying round to mrs mardens to learn from her what the cause of my misfortune might be  so shaken was i that i could hardly lace my boots  never shall i forget those horrible ten minutes  i had just pulled on my overcoat when the clock upon the mantelpiece struck ten  ten  i associated the idea with miss penclosas note  it was lying before me on the table and i tore it open  it was scribbled in pencil in a peculiarly angular handwriting  my dear professor gilroy it said  pray excuse the personal nature of the test which i am giving you  professor wilson happened to mention the relations between you and my subject of this evening and it struck me that nothing could be more convincing to you than if i were to suggest to miss marden that she should call upon you at halfpast nine tomorrow morning and suspend your engagement for half an hour or so  science is so exacting that it is difficult to give a satisfying test but i am convinced that this at least will be an action which she would be most unlikely to do of her own free will forget any thing that she may have said as she has really nothing whatever to do with it and will certainly not recollect any thing about it  i write this note to shorten your anxiety and to beg you to forgive me for the momentary unhappiness which my suggestion must have caused you                 yours faithfully                                 helen penclosa   really when i had read the note i was too relieved to be angry  it was a liberty  certainly it was a very great liberty indeed on the part of a lady whom i had only met once  but after all i had challenged her by my scepticism  it may have been as she said a little difficult to devise a test which would satisfy me  and she had done that  there could be no question at all upon the point  for me hypnotic suggestion was finally established  it took its place from now onward as one of the facts of life  that agatha who of all women of my acquaintance has the best balanced mind had been reduced to a condition of automatism appeared to be certain  a person at a distance had worked her as an engineer on the shore might guide a brennan torpedo  a second soul had stepped in as it were had pushed her own aside and had seized her nervous mechanism saying  i will work this for half an hour  and agatha must have been unconscious as she came and as she returned  could she make her way in safety through the streets in such a state  i put on my hat and hurried round to see if all was well with her  yes  she was at home  i was shown into the drawingroom and found her sitting with a book upon her lap  you are an early visitor austin said she smiling  and you have been an even earlier one i answered  she looked puzzled  what do you mean she asked  you have not been out today  no certainly not  agatha said i seriously would you mind telling me exactly what you have done this morning  she laughed at my earnestness  youve got on your professional look austin  see what comes of being engaged to a man of science  however i will tell you though i cant imagine what you want to know for  i got up at eight  i breakfasted at halfpast  i came into this room at ten minutes past nine and began to read the memoirs of mme de remusat  in a few minutes i did the french lady the bad compliment of dropping to sleep over her pages and i did you sir the very flattering one of dreaming about you  it is only a few minutes since i woke up  and found yourself where you had been before  why where else should i find myself  would you mind telling me agatha what it was that you dreamed about me  it really is not mere curiosity on my part  i merely had a vague impression that you came into it  i cannot recall any thing definite  if you have not been out today agatha how is it that your shoes are dusty  a pained look came over her face  really austin i do not know what is the matter with you this morning  one would almost think that you doubted my word  if my boots are dusty it must be of course that i have put on a pair which the maid had not cleaned  it was perfectly evident that she knew nothing whatever about the matter and i reflected that after all perhaps it was better that i should not enlighten her  it might frighten her and could serve no good purpose that i could see  i said no more about it therefore and left shortly afterward to give my lecture  but i am immensely impressed  my horizon of scientific possibilities has suddenly been enormously extended  i no longer wonder at wilsons demonic energy and enthusiasm  who would not work hard who had a vast virgin field ready to his hand  why i have known the novel shape of a nucleolus or a trifling peculiarity of striped muscular fibre seen under a 300diameter lens fill me with exultation  how petty do such researches seem when compared with this one which strikes at the very roots of life and the nature of the soul  i had always looked upon spirit as a product of matter  the brain i thought secreted the mind as the liver does the bile  but how can this be when i see mind working from a distance and playing upon matter as a musician might upon a violin  the body does not give rise to the soul then but is rather the rough instrument by which the spirit manifests itself  the windmill does not give rise to the wind but only indicates it  it was opposed to my whole habit of thought and yet it was undeniably possible and worthy of investigation  and why should i not investigate it  i see that under yesterdays date i said  if i could see something positive and objective i might be tempted to approach it from the physiological aspect  well i have got my test  i shall be as good as my word  the investigation would i am sure be of immense interest  some of my colleagues might look askance at it for science is full of unreasoning prejudices but if wilson has the courage of his convictions i can afford to have it also  i shall go to him tomorrow morningto him and to miss penclosa  if she can show us so much it is probable that she can show us more     ii  march 26  wilson was as i had anticipated very exultant over my conversion and miss penclosa was also demurely pleased at the result of her experiment  strange what a silent colorless creature she is save only when she exercises her power  even talking about it gives her color and life  she seems to take a singular interest in me  i cannot help observing how her eyes follow me about the room  we had the most interesting conversation about her own powers  it is just as well to put her views on record though they cannot of course claim any scientific weight  you are on the very fringe of the subject said she when i had expressed wonder at the remarkable instance of suggestion which she had shown me  i had no direct influence upon miss marden when she came round to you  i was not even thinking of her that morning  what i did was to set her mind as i might set the alarum of a clock so that at the hour named it would go off of its own accord  if six months instead of twelve hours had been suggested it would have been the same  and if the suggestion had been to assassinate me  she would most inevitably have done so  but this is a terrible power i cried  it is as you say a terrible power she answered gravely and the more you know of it the more terrible will it seem to you  may i ask said i what you meant when you said that this matter of suggestion is only at the fringe of it  what do you consider the essential  i had rather not tell you  i was surprised at the decision of her answer  you understand said i that it is not out of curiosity i ask but in the hope that i may find some scientific explanation for the facts with which you furnish me  frankly professor gilroy said she i am not at all interested in science nor do i care whether it can or cannot classify these powers  but i was hoping  ah that is quite another thing  if you make it a personal matter said she with the pleasantest of smiles i shall be only too happy to tell you any thing you wish to know  let me see what was it you asked me  oh about the further powers  professor wilson wont believe in them but they are quite true all the same  for example it is possible for an operator to gain complete command over his subject presuming that the latter is a good one  without any previous suggestion he may make him do whatever he likes  without the subjects knowledge  that depends  if the force were strongly exerted he would know no more about it than miss marden did when she came round and frightened you so  or if the influence was less powerful he might be conscious of what he was doing but be quite unable to prevent himself from doing it  would he have lost his own will power then  it would be overridden by another stronger one  have you ever exercised this power yourself  several times  is your own will so strong then  well it does not entirely depend upon that  many have strong wills which are not detachable from themselves  the thing is to have the gift of projecting it into another person and superseding his own  i find that the power varies with my own strength and health  practically you send your soul into another persons body  well you might put it that way  and what does your own body do  it merely feels lethargic  well but is there no danger to your own health i asked  there might be a little  you have to be careful never to let your own consciousness absolutely go otherwise you might experience some difficulty in finding your way back again  you must always preserve the connection as it were  i am afraid i express myself very badly professor gilroy but of course i dont know how to put these things in a scientific way  i am just giving you my own experiences and my own explanations  well i read this over now at my leisure and i marvel at myself  is this austin gilroy the man who has won his way to the front by his hard reasoning power and by his devotion to fact  here i am gravely retailing the gossip of a woman who tells me how her soul may be projected from her body and how while she lies in a lethargy she can control the actions of people at a distance  do i accept it certainly not  she must prove and reprove before i yield a point but if i am still a sceptic i have at least ceased to be a scoffer we are to have a sitting this evening and she is to try if she can produce any mesmeric effect upon me  if she can it will make an excellent startingpoint for our investigation  no one can accuse me at any rate of complicity  if she cannot we must try and find some subject who will be like caesars wife  wilson is perfectly impervious  10 p m  i believe that i am on the threshold of an epochmaking investigation  to have the power of examining these phenomena from insideto have an organism which will respond and at the same time a brain which will appreciate and criticisethat is surely a unique advantage  i am quite sure that wilson would give five years of his life to be as susceptible as i have proved myself to be  there was no one present except wilson and his wife  i was seated with my head leaning back and miss penclosa standing in front and a little to the left used the same long sweeping strokes as with agatha  at each of them a warm current of air seemed to strike me and to suffuse a thrill and glow all through me from head to foot  my eyes were fixed upon miss penclosas face but as i gazed the features seemed to blur and to fade away  i was conscious only of her own eyes looking down at me gray deep inscrutable  larger they grew and larger until they changed suddenly into two mountain lakes toward which i seemed to be falling with horrible rapidity  i shuddered and as i did so some deeper stratum of thought told me that the shudder represented the rigor which i had observed in agatha  an instant later i struck the surface of the lakes now joined into one and down i went beneath the water with a fulness in my head and a buzzing in my ears  down i went down down and then with a swoop up again until i could see the light streaming brightly through the green water  i was almost at the surface when the word awake rang through my head and with a start i found myself back in the armchair with miss penclosa leaning on her crutch and wilson his note book in his hand peeping over her shoulder  no heaviness or weariness was left behind  on the contrary though it is only an hour or so since the experiment i feel so wakeful that i am more inclined for my study than my bedroom  i see quite a vista of interesting experiments extending before us and am all impatience to begin upon them  march 27  a blank day as miss penclosa goes with wilson and his wife to the suttons  have begun binet and ferres animal magnetism what strange deep waters these are  results results resultsand the cause an absolute mystery  it is stimulating to the imagination but i must be on my guard against that  let us have no inferences nor deductions and nothing but solid facts  i know that the mesmeric trance is true i know that mesmeric suggestion is true i know that i am myself sensitive to this force  that is my present position  i have a large new notebook which shall be devoted entirely to scientific detail  long talk with agatha and mrs marden in the evening about our marriage  we think that the summer vac the beginning of it would be the best time for the wedding  why should we delay  i grudge even those few months  still as mrs marden says there are a good many things to be arranged  march 28  mesmerized again by miss penclosa  experience much the same as before save that insensibility came on more quickly  see notebook a for temperature of room barometric pressure pulse and respiration as taken by professor wilson  march 29  mesmerized again  details in notebook a  march 30  sunday and a blank day  i grudge any interruption of our experiments  at present they merely embrace the physical signs which go with slight with complete and with extreme insensibility afterward we hope to pass on to the phenomena of suggestion and of lucidity  professors have demonstrated these things upon women at nancy and at the salpetriere  it will be more convincing when a woman demonstrates it upon a professor with a second professor as a witness and that i should be the subjecti the sceptic the materialist  at least i have shown that my devotion to science is greater than to my own personal consistency  the eating of our own words is the greatest sacrifice which truth ever requires of us  my neighbor charles sadler the handsome young demonstrator of anatomy came in this evening to return a volume of virchows archives which i had lent him  i call him young but as a matter of fact he is a year older than i am  i understand gilroy said he that you are being experimented upon by miss penclosa  well he went on when i had acknowledged it if i were you i should not let it go any further  you will think me very impertinent no doubt but none the less i feel it to be my duty to advise you to have no more to do with her  of course i asked him why  i am so placed that i cannot enter into particulars as freely as i could wish said he  miss penclosa is the friend of my friend and my position is a delicate one  i can only say this that i have myself been the subject of some of the womans experiments and that they have left a most unpleasant impression upon my mind  he could hardly expect me to be satisfied with that and i tried hard to get something more definite out of him but without success  is it conceivable that he could be jealous at my having superseded him  or is he one of those men of science who feel personally injured when facts run counter to their preconceived opinions  he cannot seriously suppose that because he has some vague grievance i am therefore to abandon a series of experiments which promise to be so fruitful of results  he appeared to be annoyed at the light way in which i treated his shadowy warnings and we parted with some little coldness on both sides  march 31  mesmerized by miss p  april 1  mesmerized by miss p  notebook a  april 2  mesmerized by miss p  sphygmographic chart taken by professor wilson  april 3  it is possible that this course of mesmerism may be a little trying to the general constitution  agatha says that i am thinner and darker under the eyes  i am conscious of a nervous irritability which i had not observed in myself before  the least noise for example makes me start and the stupidity of a student causes me exasperation instead of amusement  agatha wishes me to stop but i tell her that every course of study is trying and that one can never attain a result with out paying some price for it  when she sees the sensation which my forthcoming paper on the relation between mind and matter may make she will understand that it is worth a little nervous wear and tear  i should not be surprised if i got my f r  s over it  mesmerized again in the evening  the effect is produced more rapidly now and the subjective visions are less marked  i keep full notes of each sitting  wilson is leaving for town for a week or ten days but we shall not interrupt the experiments which depend for their value as much upon my sensations as on his observations  april 4  i must be carefully on my guard  a complication has crept into our experiments which i had not reckoned upon  in my eagerness for scientific facts i have been foolishly blind to the human relations between miss penclosa and myself  i can write here what i would not breathe to a living soul  the unhappy woman appears to have formed an attachment for me  i should not say such a thing even in the privacy of my own intimate journal if it had not come to such a pass that it is impossible to ignore it  for some timethat is for the last weekthere have been signs which i have brushed aside and refused to think of  her brightness when i come her dejection when i go her eagerness that i should come often the expression of her eyes the tone of her voicei tried to think that they meant nothing and were perhaps only her ardent west indian manner  but last night as i awoke from the mesmeric sleep i put out my hand unconsciously involuntarily and clasped hers  when i came fully to myself we were sitting with them locked she looking up at me with an expectant smile  and the horrible thing was that i felt impelled to say what she expected me to say what a false wretch i should have been  how i should have loathed myself today had i yielded to the temptation of that moment  but thank god i was strong enough to spring up and hurry from the room  i was rude i fear but i could not no i could not trust myself another moment  i a gentleman a man of honor engaged to one of the sweetest girls in englandand yet in a moment of reasonless passion i nearly professed love for this woman whom i hardly know  she is far older than myself and a cripple  it is monstrous odious and yet the impulse was so strong that had i stayed another minute in her presence i should have committed myself  what was it  i have to teach others the workings of our organism and what do i know of it myself  was it the sudden upcropping of some lower stratum in my naturea brutal primitive instinct suddenly asserting itself  i could almost believe the tales of obsession by evil spirits so overmastering was the feeling  well the incident places me in a most unfortunate position  on the one hand i am very loath to abandon a series of experiments which have already gone so far and which promise such brilliant results  on the other if this unhappy woman has conceived a passion for me  but surely even now i must have made some hideous mistake  she with her age and her deformity  it is impossible  and then she knew about agatha  she understood how i was placed  she only smiled out of amusement perhaps when in my dazed state i seized her hand  it was my halfmesmerized brain which gave it a meaning and sprang with such bestial swiftness to meet it  i wish i could persuade myself that it was indeed so  on the whole perhaps my wisest plan would be to postpone our other experiments until wilsons return  i have written a note to miss penclosa therefore making no allusion to last night but saying that a press of work would cause me to interrupt our sittings for a few days  she has answered formally enough to say that if i should change my mind i should find her at home at the usual hour  10 p m  well well what a thing of straw i am  i am coming to know myself better of late and the more i know the lower i fall in my own estimation  surely i was not always so weak as this  at four oclock i should have smiled had any one told me that i should go to miss penclosas tonight and yet at eight i was at wilsons door as usual  i dont know how it occurred  the influence of habit i suppose  perhaps there is a mesmeric craze as there is an opium craze and i am a victim to it  i only know that as i worked in my study i became more and more uneasy  i fidgeted  i worried  i could not concentrate my mind upon the papers in front of me  and then at last almost before i knew what i was doing i seized my hat and hurried round to keep my usual appointment  we had an interesting evening  mrs wilson was present during most of the time which prevented the embarrassment which one at least of us must have felt  miss penclosas manner was quite the same as usual and she expressed no surprise at my having come in spite of my note there was nothing in her bearing to show that yesterdays incident had made any impression upon her and so i am inclined to hope that i overrated it  april 6 evening  no no no i did not overrate it  i can no longer attempt to conceal from myself that this woman has conceived a passion for me  it is monstrous but it is true  again tonight i awoke from the mesmeric trance to find my hand in hers and to suffer that odious feeling which urges me to throw away my honor my career every thing for the sake of this creature who as i can plainly see when i am away from her influence possesses no single charm upon earth  but when i am near her i do not feel this  she rouses something in me something evil something i had rather not think of  she paralyzes my better nature too at the moment when she stimulates my worse  decidedly it is not good for me to be near her  last night was worse than before  instead of flying i actually sat for some time with my hand in hers talking over the most intimate subjects with her  we spoke of agatha among other things  what could i have been dreaming of  miss penclosa said that she was conventional and i agreed with her  she spoke once or twice in a disparaging way of her and i did not protest  what a creature i have been  weak as i have proved myself to be i am still strong enough to bring this sort of thing to an end  it shall not happen again  i have sense enough to fly when i cannot fight  from this sunday night onward i shall never sit with miss penclosa again  never  let the experiments go let the research come to an end any thing is better than facing this monstrous temptation which drags me so low  i have said nothing to miss penclosa but i shall simply stay away  she can tell the reason without any words of mine  april 7  have stayed away as i said  it is a pity to ruin such an interesting investigation but it would be a greater pity still to ruin my life and i know that i cannot trust myself with that woman  11 p m  god help me  what is the matter with me  am i going mad let me try and be calm and reason with myself  first of all i shall set down exactly what occurred  it was nearly eight when i wrote the lines with which this day begins feeling strangely restless and uneasy i left my rooms and walked round to spend the evening with agatha and her mother  they both remarked that i was pale and haggard  about nine professor pratthaldane came in and we played a game of whist  i tried hard to concentrate my attention upon the cards but the feeling of restlessness grew and grew until i found it impossible to struggle against it  i simply could not sit still at the table  at last in the very middle of a hand i threw my cards down and with some sort of an incoherent apology about having an appointment i rushed from the room  as if in a dream i have a vague recollection of tearing through the hall snatching my hat from the stand and slamming the door behind me  as in a dream too i have the impression of the double line of gaslamps and my bespattered boots tell me that i must have run down the middle of the road  it was all misty and strange and unnatural  i came to wilsons house i saw mrs wilson and i saw miss penclosa  i hardly recall what we talked about but i do remember that miss p  shook the head of her crutch at me in a playful way and accused me of being late and of losing interest in our experiments  there was no mesmerism but i stayed some time and have only just returned  my brain is quite clear again now and i can think over what has occurred  it is absurd to suppose that it is merely weakness and force of habit  i tried to explain it in that way the other night but it will no longer suffice  it is something much deeper and more terrible than that  why when i was at the mardens whisttable i was dragged away as if the noose of a rope had been cast round me  i can no longer disguise it from myself  the woman has her grip upon me  i am in her clutch  but i must keep my head and reason it out and see what is best to be done  but what a blind fool i have been  in my enthusiasm over my research i have walked straight into the pit although it lay gaping before me did she not herself warn me  did she not tell me as i can read in my own journal that when she has acquired power over a subject she can make him do her will  and she has acquired that power over me  i am for the moment at the beck and call of this creature with the crutch i must come when she wills it  i must do as she wills  worst of all i must feel as she wills  i loathe her and fear her yet while i am under the spell she can doubtless make me love her  there is some consolation in the thought then that those odious impulses for which i have blamed myself do not really come from me at all  they are all transferred from her little as i could have guessed it at the time  i feel cleaner and lighter for the thought  april 8  yes now in broad daylight writing coolly and with time for reflection i am compelled to confirm every thing which i wrote in my journal last night  i am in a horrible position but above all i must not lose my head  i must pit my intellect against her powers after all i am no silly puppet to dance at the end of a string  i have energy brains courage  for all her devils tricks i may beat her yet  may  i must or what is to become of me  let me try to reason it out  this woman by her own explanation can dominate my nervous organism  she can project herself into my body and take command of it  she has a parasite soul yes she is a parasite a monstrous parasite  she creeps into my frame as the hermit crab does into the whelks shell  i am powerless what can i do  i am dealing with forces of which i know nothing  and i can tell no one of my trouble  they would set me down as a madman  certainly if it got noised abroad the university would say that they had no need of a devilridden professor  and agatha  no no i must face it alone     iii  i read over my notes of what the woman said when she spoke about her powers  there is one point which fills me with dismay  she implies that when the influence is slight the subject knows what he is doing but cannot control himself whereas when it is strongly exerted he is absolutely unconscious  now i have always known what i did though less so last night than on the previous occasions  that seems to mean that she has never yet exerted her full powers upon me  was ever a man so placed before  yes perhaps there was and very near me too  charles sadler must know something of this  his vague words of warning take a meaning now oh if i had only listened to him then before i helped by these repeated sittings to forge the links of the chain which binds me  but i will see him today  i will apologize to him for having treated his warning so lightly  i will see if he can advise me  4 p m  no he cannot  i have talked with him and he showed such surprise at the first words in which i tried to express my unspeakable secret that i went no further  as far as i can gather by hints and inferences rather than by any statement his own experience was limited to some words or looks such as i have myself endured  his abandonment of miss penclosa is in itself a sign that he was never really in her toils  oh if he only knew his escape  he has to thank his phlegmatic saxon temperament for it  i am black and celtic and this hags clutch is deep in my nerves  shall i ever get it out shall i ever be the same man that i was just one short fortnight ago  let me consider what i had better do  i cannot leave the university in the middle of the term  if i were free my course would be obvious  i should start at once and travel in persia  but would she allow me to start  and could her influence not reach me in persia and bring me back to within touch of her crutch  i can only find out the limits of this hellish power by my own bitter experience  i will fight and fight and fightand what can i do more  i know very well that about eight oclock tonight that craving for her society that irresistible restlessness will come upon me  how shall i overcome it  what shall i do  i must make it impossible for me to leave the room  i shall lock the door and throw the key out of the window  but then what am i to do in the morning  never mind about the morning  i must at all costs break this chain which holds me  april 9  victory  i have done splendidly  at seven oclock last night i took a hasty dinner and then locked myself up in my bedroom and dropped the key into the garden  i chose a cheery novel and lay in bed for three hours trying to read it but really in a horrible state of trepidation expecting every instant that i should become conscious of the impulse  nothing of the sort occurred however and i awoke this morning with the feeling that a black nightmare had been lifted off me  perhaps the creature realized what i had done and understood that it was useless to try to influence me  at any rate i have beaten her once and if i can do it once i can do it again  it was most awkward about the key in the morning  luckily there was an undergardener below and i asked him to throw it up  no doubt he thought i had just dropped it  i will have doors and windows screwed up and six stout men to hold me down in my bed before i will surrender myself to be hagridden in this way  i had a note from mrs marden this afternoon asking me to go round and see her  i intended to do so in any case but had not excepted to find bad news waiting for me  it seems that the armstrongs from whom agatha has expectations are due home from adelaide in the aurora and that they have written to mrs marden and her to meet them in town they will probably be away for a month or six weeks and as the aurora is due on wednesday they must go at oncetomorrow if they are ready in time  my consolation is that when we meet again there will be no more parting between agatha and me  i want you to do one thing agatha said i when we were alone together  if you should happen to meet miss penclosa either in town or here you must promise me never again to allow her to mesmerize you  agatha opened her eyes  why it was only the other day that you were saying how interesting it all was and how determined you were to finish your experiments  i know but i have changed my mind since then  and you wont have it any more  no  i am so glad austin  you cant think how pale and worn you have been lately  it was really our principal objection to going to london now that we did not wish to leave you when you were so pulled down  and your manner has been so strange occasionallyespecially that night when you left poor professor pratthaldane to play dummy  i am convinced that these experiments are very bad for your nerves  i think so too dear  and for miss penclosas nerves as well  you have heard that she is ill  no  mrs wilson told us so last night  she described it as a nervous fever professor wilson is coming back this week and of course mrs wilson is very anxious that miss penclosa should be well again then for he has quite a programme of experiments which he is anxious to carry out  i was glad to have agathas promise for it was enough that this woman should have one of us in her clutch  on the other hand i was disturbed to hear about miss penclosas illness  it rather discounts the victory which i appeared to win last night  i remember that she said that loss of health interfered with her power  that may be why i was able to hold my own so easily  well well i must take the same precautions tonight and see what comes of it  i am childishly frightened when i think of her  april 10  all went very well last night  i was amused at the gardeners face when i had again to hail him this morning and to ask him to throw up my key  i shall get a name among the servants if this sort of thing goes on  but the great point is that i stayed in my room without the slightest inclination to leave it  i do believe that i am shaking myself clear of this incredible bondor is it only that the womans power is in abeyance until she recovers her strength  i can but pray for the best  the mardens left this morning and the brightness seems to have gone out of the spring sunshine  and yet it is very beautiful also as it gleams on the green chestnuts opposite my windows and gives a touch of gayety to the heavy lichenmottled walls of the old colleges  how sweet and gentle and soothing is nature  who would think that there lurked in her also such vile forces such odious possibilities  for of course i understand that this dreadful thing which has sprung out at me is neither supernatural nor even preternatural  no it is a natural force which this woman can use and society is ignorant of  the mere fact that it ebbs with her strength shows how entirely it is subject to physical laws  if i had time i might probe it to the bottom and lay my hands upon its antidote  but you cannot tame the tiger when you are beneath his claws  you can but try to writhe away from him  ah when i look in the glass and see my own dark eyes and clearcut spanish face i long for a vitriol splash or a bout of the smallpox  one or the other might have saved me from this calamity  i am inclined to think that i may have trouble tonight  there are two things which make me fear so  one is that i met mrs wilson in the street and that she tells me that miss penclosa is better though still weak  i find myself wishing in my heart that the illness had been her last  the other is that professor wilson comes back in a day or two and his presence would act as a constraint upon her  i should not fear our interviews if a third person were present  for both these reasons i have a presentiment of trouble tonight and i shall take the same precautions as before  april 10  no thank god all went well last night  i really could not face the gardener again  i locked my door and thrust the key underneath it so that i had to ask the maid to let me out in the morning  but the precaution was really not needed for i never had any inclination to go out at all  three evenings in succession at home  i am surely near the end of my troubles for wilson will be home again either today or tomorrow  shall i tell him of what i have gone through or not  i am convinced that i should not have the slightest sympathy from him  he would look upon me as an interesting case and read a paper about me at the next meeting of the psychical society in which he would gravely discuss the possibility of my being a deliberate liar and weigh it against the chances of my being in an early stage of lunacy  no i shall get no comfort out of wilson  i am feeling wonderfully fit and well  i dont think i ever lectured with greater spirit  oh if i could only get this shadow off my life how happy i should be  young fairly wealthy in the front rank of my profession engaged to a beautiful and charming girlhave i not every thing which a man could ask for  only one thing to trouble me but what a thing it is  midnight  i shall go mad  yes that will be the end of it  i shall go mad  i am not far from it now  my head throbs as i rest it on my hot hand  i am quivering all over like a scared horse  oh what a night i have had  and yet i have some cause to be satisfied also  at the risk of becoming the laughingstock of my own servant i again slipped my key under the door imprisoning myself for the night  then finding it too early to go to bed i lay down with my clothes on and began to read one of dumass novels  suddenly i was grippedgripped and dragged from the couch  it is only thus that i can describe the overpowering nature of the force which pounced upon me  i clawed at the coverlet  i clung to the woodwork  i believe that i screamed out in my frenzy  it was all useless hopeless  i must go  there was no way out of it  it was only at the outset that i resisted  the force soon became too overmastering for that  i thank goodness that there were no watchers there to interfere with me  i could not have answered for myself if there had been  and besides the determination to get out there came to me also the keenest and coolest judgment in choosing my means  i lit a candle and endeavored kneeling in front of the door to pull the key through with the featherend of a quill pen it was just too short and pushed it further away  then with quiet persistence i got a paperknife out of one of the drawers and with that i managed to draw the key back  i opened the door stepped into my study took a photograph of myself from the bureau wrote something across it placed it in the inside pocket of my coat and then started off for wilsons  it was all wonderfully clear and yet disassociated from the rest of my life as the incidents of even the most vivid dream might be  a peculiar double consciousness possessed me  there was the predominant alien will which was bent upon drawing me to the side of its owner and there was the feebler protesting personality which i recognized as being myself tugging feebly at the overmastering impulse as a led terrier might at its chain  i can remember recognizing these two conflicting forces but i recall nothing of my walk nor of how i was admitted to the house  very vivid however is my recollection of how i met miss penclosa she was reclining on the sofa in the little boudoir in which our experiments had usually been carried out  her head was rested on her hand and a tigerskin rug had been partly drawn over her  she looked up expectantly as i entered and as the lamplight fell upon her face i could see that she was very pale and thin with dark hollows under her eyes  she smiled at me and pointed to a stool beside her  it was with her left hand that she pointed and i running eagerly forward seized iti loathe myself as i think of itand pressed it passionately to my lips  then seating myself upon the stool and still retaining her hand i gave her the photograph which i had brought with me and talked and talked and talkedof my love for her of my grief over her illness of my joy at her recovery of the misery it was to me to be absent a single evening from her side  she lay quietly looking down at me with imperious eyes and her provocative smile  once i remember that she passed her hand over my hair as one caresses a dog and it gave me pleasurethe caress  i thrilled under it  i was her slave body and soul and for the moment i rejoiced in my slavery  and then came the blessed change  never tell me that there is not a providence  i was on the brink of perdition  my feet were on the edge  was it a coincidence that at that very instant help should come no no no there is a providence and its hand has drawn me back there is something in the universe stronger than this devil woman with her tricks  ah what a balm to my heart it is to think so  as i looked up at her i was conscious of a change in her  her face which had been pale before was now ghastly  her eyes were dull and the lids drooped heavily over them  above all the look of serene confidence had gone from her features  her mouth had weakened  her forehead had puckered  she was frightened and undecided  and as i watched the change my own spirit fluttered and struggled trying hard to tear itself from the grip which held ita grip which from moment to moment grew less secure  austin she whispered i have tried to do too much  i was not strong enough  i have not recovered yet from my illness  but i could not live longer without seeing you  you wont leave me austin  this is only a passing weakness  if you will only give me five minutes i shall be myself again  give me the small decanter from the table in the window  but i had regained my soul  with her waning strength the influence had cleared away from me and left me free  and i was aggressivebitterly fiercely aggressive  for once at least i could make this woman understand what my real feelings toward her were  my soul was filled with a hatred as bestial as the love against which it was a reaction it was the savage murderous passion of the revolted serf  i could have taken the crutch from her side and beaten her face in with it she threw her hands up as if to avoid a blow and cowered away from me into the corner of the settee  the brandy she gasped  the brandy  i took the decanter and poured it over the roots of a palm in the window  then i snatched the photograph from her hand and tore it into a hundred pieces  you vile woman i said if i did my duty to society you would never leave this room alive  i love you austin i love you she wailed  yes i cried and charles sadler before  and how many others before that  charles sadler she gasped  he has spoken to you  so charles sadler charles sadler  her voice came through her white lips like a snakes hiss  yes i know you and others shall know you too  you shameless creature  you knew how i stood  and yet you used your vile power to bring me to your side  you may perhaps do so again but at least you will remember that you have heard me say that i love miss marden from the bottom of my soul and that i loathe you abhor you  the very sight of you and the sound of your voice fill me with horror and disgust  the thought of you is repulsive  that is how i feel toward you and if it pleases you by your tricks to draw me again to your side as you have done tonight you will at least i should think have little satisfaction in trying to make a lover out of a man who has told you his real opinion of you  you may put what words you will into my mouth but you cannot help remembering  i stopped for the womans head had fallen back and she had fainted she could not bear to hear what i had to say to her  what a glow of satisfaction it gives me to think that come what may in the future she can never misunderstand my true feelings toward her  but what will occur in the future  what will she do next  i dare not think of it oh if only i could hope that she will leave me alone  but when i think of what i said to her  never mind i have been stronger than she for once  april 11  i hardly slept last night and found myself in the morning so unstrung and feverish that i was compelled to ask pratthaldane to do my lecture for me  it is the first that i have ever missed  i rose at midday but my head is aching my hands quivering and my nerves in a pitiable state  who should come round this evening but wilson  he has just come back from london where he has lectured read papers convened meetings exposed a medium conducted a series of experiments on thought transference entertained professor richet of paris spent hours gazing into a crystal and obtained some evidence as to the passage of matter through matter  all this he poured into my ears in a single gust  but you he cried at last  you are not looking well  and miss penclosa is quite prostrated today  how about the experiments  i have abandoned them  tut tut  why  the subject seems to me to be a dangerous one  out came his big brown notebook  this is of great interest said he  what are your grounds for saying that it is a dangerous one  please give your facts in chronological order with approximate dates and names of reliable witnesses with their permanent addresses  first of all i asked would you tell me whether you have collected any cases where the mesmerist has gained a command over the subject and has used it for evil purposes  dozens he cried exultantly  crime by suggestion  i dont mean suggestion  i mean where a sudden impulse comes from a person at a distancean uncontrollable impulse  obsession he shrieked in an ecstasy of delight  it is the rarest condition  we have eight cases five well attested  you dont mean to say  his exultation made him hardly articulate  no i dont said i  goodevening  you will excuse me but i am not very well tonight  and so at last i got rid of him still brandishing his pencil and his notebook  my troubles may be bad to hear but at least it is better to hug them to myself than to have myself exhibited by wilson like a freak at a fair  he has lost sight of human beings  every thing to him is a case and a phenomenon  i will die before i speak to him again upon the matter  april 12  yesterday was a blessed day of quiet and i enjoyed an uneventful night  wilsons presence is a great consolation  what can the woman do now  surely when she has heard me say what i have said she will conceive the same disgust for me which i have for her  she could not no she could not desire to have a lover who had insulted her so  no i believe i am free from her lovebut how about her hate might she not use these powers of hers for revenge  tut why should i frighten myself over shadows  she will forget about me and i shall forget about her and all will be well  april 13  my nerves have quite recovered their tone  i really believe that i have conquered the creature  but i must confess to living in some suspense  she is well again for i hear that she was driving with mrs wilson in the high street in the afternoon  april 14  i do wish i could get away from the place altogether  i shall fly to agathas side the very day that the term closes  i suppose it is pitiably weak of me but this woman gets upon my nerves most terribly  i have seen her again and i have spoken with her  it was just after lunch and i was smoking a cigarette in my study when i heard the step of my servant murray in the passage  i was languidly conscious that a second step was audible behind and had hardly troubled myself to speculate who it might be when suddenly a slight noise brought me out of my chair with my skin creeping with apprehension  i had never particularly observed before what sort of sound the tapping of a crutch was but my quivering nerves told me that i heard it now in the sharp wooden clack which alternated with the muffled thud of the foot fall  another instant and my servant had shown her in  i did not attempt the usual conventions of society nor did she  i simply stood with the smouldering cigarette in my hand and gazed at her  she in her turn looked silently at me and at her look i remembered how in these very pages i had tried to define the expression of her eyes whether they were furtive or fierce  today they were fiercecoldly and inexorably so  well said she at last are you still of the same mind as when i saw you last  i have always been of the same mind  let us understand each other professor gilroy said she slowly  i am not a very safe person to trifle with as you should realize by now it was you who asked me to enter into a series of experiments with you it was you who won my affections it was you who professed your love for me it was you who brought me your own photograph with words of affection upon it and finally it was you who on the very same evening thought fit to insult me most outrageously addressing me as no man has ever dared to speak to me yet  tell me that those words came from you in a moment of passion and i am prepared to forget and to forgive them  you did not mean what you said austin  you do not really hate me  i might have pitied this deformed womansuch a longing for love broke suddenly through the menace of her eyes  but then i thought of what i had gone through and my heart set like flint  if ever you heard me speak of love said i you know very well that it was your voice which spoke and not mine  the only words of truth which i have ever been able to say to you are those which you heard when last we met  i know  some one has set you against me  it was he she tapped with her crutch upon the floor  well you know very well that i could bring you this instant crouching like a spaniel to my feet  you will not find me again in my hour of weakness when you can insult me with impunity  have a care what you are doing professor gilroy  you stand in a terrible position  you have not yet realized the hold which i have upon you  i shrugged my shoulders and turned away  well said she after a pause if you despise my love i must see what can be done with fear  you smile but the day will come when you will come screaming to me for pardon  yes you will grovel on the ground before me proud as you are and you will curse the day that ever you turned me from your best friend into your most bitter enemy have a care professor gilroy i saw a white hand shaking in the air and a face which was scarcely human so convulsed was it with passion an instant later she was gone and i heard the quick hobble and tap receding down the passage  but she has left a weight upon my heart  vague presentiments of coming misfortune lie heavy upon me  i try in vain to persuade myself that these are only words of empty anger  i can remember those relentless eyes too clearly to think so  what shall i doah what shall i do  i am no longer master of my own soul  at any moment this loathsome parasite may creep into me and then  i must tell some one my hideous secreti must tell it or go mad  if i had some one to sympathize and advise  wilson is out of the question  charles sadler would understand me only so far as his own experience carries him pratthaldane  he is a wellbalanced man a man of great commonsense and resource  i will go to him  i will tell him every thing  god grant that he may be able to advise me     iv  645 p m  no it is useless  there is no human help for me i must fight this out singlehanded  two courses lie before me  i might become this womans lover  or i must endure such persecutions as she can inflict upon me  even if none come i shall live in a hell of apprehension  but she may torture me she may drive me mad she may kill me i will never never never give in  what can she inflict which would be worse than the loss of agatha and the knowledge that i am a perjured liar and have forfeited the name of gentleman  pratthaldane was most amiable and listened with all politeness to my story  but when i looked at his heavy set features his slow eyes and the ponderous study furniture which surrounded him i could hardly tell him what i had come to say  it was all so substantial so material and besides what would i myself have said a short month ago if one of my colleagues had come to me with a story of demonic possession perhaps  i should have been less patient than he was  as it was he took notes of my statement asked me how much tea i drank how many hours i slept whether i had been overworking much had i had sudden pains in the head evil dreams singing in the ears flashes before the eyesall questions which pointed to his belief that brain congestion was at the bottom of my trouble  finally he dismissed me with a great many platitudes about openair exercise and avoidance of nervous excitement  his prescription which was for chloral and bromide i rolled up and threw into the gutter  no i can look for no help from any human being  if i consult any more they may put their heads together and i may find myself in an asylum  i can but grip my courage with both hands and pray that an honest man may not be abandoned  april 10  it is the sweetest spring within the memory of man  so green so mild so beautiful ah what a contrast between nature without and my own soul so torn with doubt and terror  it has been an uneventful day but i know that i am on the edge of an abyss  i know it and yet i go on with the routine of my life  the one bright spot is that agatha is happy and well and out of all danger  if this creature had a hand on each of us what might she not do  april 16  the woman is ingenious in her torments  she knows how fond i am of my work and how highly my lectures are thought of  so it is from that point that she now attacks me  it will end i can see in my losing my professorship but i will fight to the finish  she shall not drive me out of it without a struggle  i was not conscious of any change during my lecture this morning save that for a minute or two i had a dizziness and swimminess which rapidly passed away  on the contrary i congratulated myself upon having made my subject the functions of the red corpuscles both interesting and clear  i was surprised therefore when a student came into my laboratory immediately after the lecture and complained of being puzzled by the discrepancy between my statements and those in the text books  he showed me his notebook in which i was reported as having in one portion of the lecture championed the most outrageous and unscientific heresies  of course i denied it and declared that he had misunderstood me but on comparing his notes with those of his companions it became clear that he was right and that i really had made some most preposterous statements  of course i shall explain it away as being the result of a moment of aberration but i feel only too sure that it will be the first of a series  it is but a month now to the end of the session and i pray that i may be able to hold out until then  april 26  ten days have elapsed since i have had the heart to make any entry in my journal  why should i record my own humiliation and degradation  i had vowed never to open it again  and yet the force of habit is strong and here i find myself taking up once more the record of my own dreadful experiencesin much the same spirit in which a suicide has been known to take notes of the effects of the poison which killed him  well the crash which i had foreseen has comeand that no further back than yesterday  the university authorities have taken my lectureship from me  it has been done in the most delicate way purporting to be a temporary measure to relieve me from the effects of overwork and to give me the opportunity of recovering my health  none the less it has been done and i am no longer professor gilroy  the laboratory is still in my charge but i have little doubt that that also will soon go  the fact is that my lectures had become the laughingstock of the university  my class was crowded with students who came to see and hear what the eccentric professor would do or say next  i cannot go into the detail of my humiliation  oh that devilish woman  there is no depth of buffoonery and imbecility to which she has not forced me i would begin my lecture clearly and well but always with the sense of a coming eclipse  then as i felt the influence i would struggle against it striving with clenched hands and beads of sweat upon my brow to get the better of it while the students hearing my incoherent words and watching my contortions would roar with laughter at the antics of their professor  and then when she had once fairly mastered me out would come the most outrageous thingssilly jokes sentiments as though i were proposing a toast snatches of ballads personal abuse even against some member of my class  and then in a moment my brain would clear again and my lecture would proceed decorously to the end no wonder that my conduct has been the talk of the colleges  no wonder that the university senate has been compelled to take official notice of such a scandal  oh that devilish woman  and the most dreadful part of it all is my own loneliness  here i sit in a commonplace english bowwindow looking out upon a commonplace english street with its garish buses and its lounging policeman and behind me there hangs a shadow which is out of all keeping with the age and place  in the home of knowledge i am weighed down and tortured by a power of which science knows nothing  no magistrate would listen to me  no paper would discuss my case  no doctor would believe my symptoms  my own most intimate friends would only look upon it as a sign of brain derangement  i am out of all touch with my kind  oh that devilish woman  let her have a care  she may push me too far when the law cannot help a man he may make a law for himself  she met me in the high street yesterday evening and spoke to me  it was as well for her perhaps that it was not between the hedges of a lonely country road  she asked me with her cold smile whether i had been chastened yet  i did not deign to answer her  we must try another turn of the screw said she  have a care my lady have a care  i had her at my mercy once  perhaps another chance may come  april 28  the suspension of my lectureship has had the effect also of taking away her means of annoying me and so i have enjoyed two blessed days of peace  after all there is no reason to despair  sympathy pours in to me from all sides and every one agrees that it is my devotion to science and the arduous nature of my researches which have shaken my nervous system  i have had the kindest message from the council advising me to travel abroad and expressing the confident hope that i may be able to resume all my duties by the beginning of the summer term  nothing could be more flattering than their allusions to my career and to my services to the university  it is only in misfortune that one can test ones own popularity  this creature may weary of tormenting me and then all may yet be well  may god grant it  april 29  our sleepy little town has had a small sensation  the only knowledge of crime which we ever have is when a rowdy undergraduate breaks a few lamps or comes to blows with a policeman  last night however there was an attempt made to breakinto the branch of the bank of england and we are all in a flutter in consequence  parkenson the manager is an intimate friend of mine and i found him very much excited when i walked round there after breakfast  had the thieves broken into the countinghouse they would still have had the safes to reckon with so that the defence was considerably stronger than the attack  indeed the latter does not appear to have ever been very formidable  two of the lower windows have marks as if a chisel or some such instrument had been pushed under them to force them open the police should have a good clue for the woodwork had been done with green paint only the day before and from the smears it is evident that some of it has found its way on to the criminals hands or clothes  430 p m  ah that accursed woman  that thrice accursed woman never mind  she shall not beat me  no she shall not  but oh the shedevil  she has taken my professorship  now she would take my honor  is there nothing i can do against her nothing save ah but hard pushed as i am i cannot bring myself to think of that  it was about an hour ago that i went into my bedroom and was brushing my hair before the glass when suddenly my eyes lit upon something which left me so sick and cold that i sat down upon the edge of the bed and began to cry  it is many a long year since i shed tears but all my nerve was gone and i could but sob and sob in impotent grief and anger  there was my house jacket the coat i usually wear after dinner hanging on its peg by the wardrobe with the right sleeve thickly crusted from wrist to elbow with daubs of green paint  so this was what she meant by another turn of the screw  she had made a public imbecile of me  now she would brand me as a criminal  this time she has failed  but how about the next  i dare not think of itand of agatha and my poor old mother  i wish that i were dead  yes this is the other turn of the screw  and this is also what she meant no doubt when she said that i had not realized yet the power she has over me  i look back at my account of my conversation with her and i see how she declared that with a slight exertion of her will her subject would be conscious and with a stronger one unconscious last night i was unconscious  i could have sworn that i slept soundly in my bed without so much as a dream  and yet those stains tell me that i dressed made my way out attempted to open the bank windows and returned  was i observed  is it possible that some one saw me do it and followed me home  ah what a hell my life has become  i have no peace no rest  but my patience is nearing its end  10 p m  i have cleaned my coat with turpentine  i do not think that any one could have seen me  it was with my screwdriver that i made the marks  i found it all crusted with paint and i have cleaned it my head aches as if it would burst and i have taken five grains of antipyrine  if it were not for agatha i should have taken fifty and had an end of it  may 3  three quiet days  this hell fiend is like a cat with a mouse she lets me loose only to pounce upon me again  i am never so frightened as when every thing is still  my physical state is deplorableperpetual hiccough and ptosis of the left eyelid  i have heard from the mardens that they will be back the day after tomorrow  i do not know whether i am glad or sorry  they were safe in london  once here they may be drawn into the miserable network in which i am myself struggling  and i must tell them of it  i cannot marry agatha so long as i know that i am not responsible for my own actions  yes i must tell them even if it brings every thing to an end between us  tonight is the university ball and i must go  god knows i never felt less in the humor for festivity but i must not have it said that i am unfit to appear in public  if i am seen there and have speech with some of the elders of the university it will go a long way toward showing them that it would be unjust to take my chair away from me  10 p m  i have been to the ball  charles sadler and i went together but i have come away before him  i shall wait up for him however for indeed i fear to go to sleep these nights  he is a cheery practical fellow and a chat with him will steady my nerves  on the whole the evening was a great success  i talked to every one who has influence and i think that i made them realize that my chair is not vacant quite yet  the creature was at the ballunable to dance of course but sitting with mrs wilson  again and again her eyes rested upon me  they were almost the last things i saw before i left the room  once as i sat sideways to her i watched her and saw that her gaze was following some one else  it was sadler who was dancing at the time with the second miss thurston  to judge by her expression it is well for him that he is not in her grip as i am  he does not know the escape he has had  i think i hear his step in the street now and i will go down and let him in  if he will  may 4  why did i break off in this way last night  i never went down stairs after allat least i have no recollection of doing so  but on the other hand i cannot remember going to bed  one of my hands is greatly swollen this morning and yet i have no remembrance of injuring it yesterday  otherwise i am feeling all the better for last nights festivity  but i cannot understand how it is that i did not meet charles sadler when i so fully intended to do so  is it possible my god it is only too probable  has she been leading me some devils dance again  i will go down to sadler and ask him  midday  the thing has come to a crisis  my life is not worth living but if i am to die then she shall come also  i will not leave her behind to drive some other man mad as she has me  no i have come to the limit of my endurance  she has made me as desperate and dangerous a man as walks the earth  god knows i have never had the heart to hurt a fly and yet if i had my hands now upon that woman she should never leave this room alive  i shall see her this very day and she shall learn what she has to expect from me  i went to sadler and found him to my surprise in bed  as i entered he sat up and turned a face toward me which sickened me as i looked at it  why sadler what has happened i cried but my heart turned cold as i said it  gilroy he answered mumbling with his swollen lips i have for some weeks been under the impression that you are a madman  now i know it and that you are a dangerous one as well  if it were not that i am unwilling to make a scandal in the college you would now be in the hands of the police  do you mean i cried  i mean that as i opened the door last night you rushed out upon me struck me with both your fists in the face knocked me down kicked me furiously in the side and left me lying almost unconscious in the street  look at your own hand bearing witness against you  yes there it was puffed up with spongelike knuckles as after some terrific blow  what could i do  though he put me down as a madman i must tell him all  i sat by his bed and went over all my troubles from the beginning  i poured them out with quivering hands and burning words which might have carried conviction to the most sceptical  she hates you and she hates me i cried  she revenged herself last night on both of us at once  she saw me leave the ball and she must have seen you also  she knew how long it would take you to reach home then she had but to use her wicked will  ah your bruised face is a small thing beside my bruised soul  he was struck by my story  that was evident  yes yes she watched me out of the room he muttered  she is capable of it  but is it possible that she has really reduced you to this  what do you intend to do  to stop it i cried  i am perfectly desperate i shall give her fair warning today and the next time will be the last  do nothing rash said he  rash i cried  the only rash thing is that i should postpone it another hour  with that i rushed to my room and here i am on the eve of what may be the great crisis of my life  i shall start at once  i have gained one thing today for i have made one man at least realize the truth of this monstrous experience of mine  and if the worst should happen this diary remains as a proof of the goad that has driven me  evening  when i came to wilsons i was shown up and found that he was sitting with miss penclosa  for half an hour i had to endure his fussy talk about his recent research into the exact nature of the spiritualistic rap while the creature and i sat in silence looking across the room at each other  i read a sinister amusement in her eyes and she must have seen hatred and menace in mine  i had almost despaired of having speech with her when he was called from the room and we were left for a few moments together  well professor gilroyor is it mr gilroy said she with that bitter smile of hers  how is your friend mr charles sadler after the ball  you fiend i cried  you have come to the end of your tricks now  i will have no more of them  listen to what i say  i strode across and shook her roughly by the shoulder as sure as there is a god in heaven i swear that if you try another of your deviltries upon me i will have your life for it  come what may i will have your life  i have come to the end of what a man can endure  accounts are not quite settled between us said she with a passion that equalled my own  i can love and i can hate  you had your choice  you chose to spurn the first now you must test the other  it will take a little more to break your spirit i see but broken it shall be  miss marden comes back tomorrow as i understand  what has that to do with you i cried  it is a pollution that you should dare even to think of her  if i thought that you would harm her  she was frightened i could see though she tried to brazen it out she read the black thought in my mind and cowered away from me  she is fortunate in having such a champion said she  he actually dares to threaten a lonely woman  i must really congratulate miss marden upon her protector  the words were bitter but the voice and manner were more acid still  there is no use talking said i  i only came here to tell youand to tell you most solemnlythat your next outrage upon me will be your last  with that as i heard wilsons step upon the stair i walked from the room  ay she may look venomous and deadly but for all that she is beginning to see now that she has as much to fear from me as i can have from her  murder  it has an ugly sound  but you dont talk of murdering a snake or of murdering a tiger  let her have a care now  may 5  i met agatha and her mother at the station at eleven oclock she is looking so bright so happy so beautiful  and she was so overjoyed to see me  what have i done to deserve such love  i went back home with them and we lunched together  all the troubles seem in a moment to have been shredded back from my life  she tells me that i am looking pale and worried and ill  the dear child puts it down to my loneliness and the perfunctory attentions of a housekeeper  i pray that she may never know the truth  may the shadow if shadow there must be lie ever black across my life and leave hers in the sunshine i have just come back from them feeling a new man  with her by my side i think that i could show a bold face to any thing which life might send  5 p m  now let me try to be accurate  let me try to say exactly how it occurred  it is fresh in my mind and i can set it down correctly though it is not likely that the time will ever come when i shall forget the doings of today  i had returned from the mardens after lunch and was cutting some microscopic sections in my freezing microtome when in an instant i lost consciousness in the sudden hateful fashion which has become only too familiar to me of late  when my senses came back to me i was sitting in a small chamber very different from the one in which i had been working  it was cosey and bright with chintzcovered settees colored hangings and a thousand pretty little trifles upon the wall  a small ornamental clock ticked in front of me and the hands pointed to halfpast three  it was all quite familiar to me and yet i stared about for a moment in a halfdazed way until my eyes fell upon a cabinet photograph of myself upon the top of the piano  on the other side stood one of mrs marden then of course i remembered where i was  it was agathas boudoir  but how came i there and what did i want  a horrible sinking came to my heart  had i been sent here on some devilish errand  had that errand already been done  surely it must otherwise why should i be allowed to come back to consciousness  oh the agony of that moment what had i done  i sprang to my feet in my despair and as i did so a small glass bottle fell from my knees on to the carpet  it was unbroken and i picked it up  outside was written sulphuric acid  fort  when i drew the round glass stopper a thick fume rose slowly up and a pungent choking smell pervaded the room  i recognized it as one which i kept for chemical testing in my chambers but why had i brought a bottle of vitriol into agathas chamber  was it not this thick reeking liquid with which jealous women had been known to mar the beauty of their rivals  my heart stood still as i held the bottle to the light  thank god it was full  no mischief had been done as yet  but had agatha come in a minute sooner was it not certain that the hellish parasite within me would have dashed the stuff into her  ah it will not bear to be thought of  but it must have been for that  why else should i have brought it  at the thought of what i might have done my worn nerves broke down and i sat shivering and twitching the pitiable wreck of a man  it was the sound of agathas voice and the rustle of her dress which restored me  i looked up and saw her blue eyes so full of tenderness and pity gazing down at me  we must take you away to the country austin she said  you want rest and quiet  you look wretchedly ill  oh it is nothing said i trying to smile  it was only a momentary weakness  i am all right again now  i am so sorry to keep you waiting  poor boy you must have been here quite half an hour  the vicar was in the drawingroom and as i knew that you did not care for him i thought it better that jane should show you up here  i thought the man would never go  thank god he stayed  thank god he stayed  i cried hysterically  why what is the matter with you austin she asked holding my arm as i staggered up from the chair  why are you glad that the vicar stayed  and what is this little bottle in your hand  nothing i cried thrusting it into my pocket  but i must go  i have something important to do  how stern you look austin  i have never seen your face like that you are angry  yes i am angry  but not with me  no no my darling  you would not understand  but you have not told me why you came  i came to ask you whether you would always love meno matter what i did or what shadow might fall on my name  would you believe in me and trust me however black appearances might be against me  you know that i would austin  yes i know that you would  what i do i shall do for you  i am driven to it  there is no other way out my darling  i kissed her and rushed from the room  the time for indecision was at an end  as long as the creature threatened my own prospects and my honor there might be a question as to what i should do  but now when agathamy innocent agathawas endangered my duty lay before me like a turnpike road  i had no weapon but i never paused for that  what weapon should i need when i felt every muscle quivering with the strength of a frenzied man  i ran through the streets so set upon what i had to do that i was only dimly conscious of the faces of friends whom i metdimly conscious also that professor wilson met me running with equal precipitance in the opposite direction  breathless but resolute i reached the house and rang the bell  a white cheeked maid opened the door and turned whiter yet when she saw the face that looked in at her  show me up at once to miss penclosa i demanded  sir she gasped miss penclosa died this afternoon at halfpast three
