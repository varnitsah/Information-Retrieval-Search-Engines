at the side opening to an inner room a desk and a chair in the middle an hourglass on a bracket near the door a creepy stool near it some benches the wise man sitting at his desk  wise man turning over the pages of a book where is that passage i am to explain to my pupils today here it is and the book says that it was written by a beggar on the walls of babylon there are two living countries the one visible and the one invisible and when it is winter with us it is summer in that country and when the november winds are up among us it is lambingtime there i wish that my pupils had asked me to explain any other passage for this is a hard passage the fool comes in and stands at the door holding out his hat he has a pair of shears in the other hand it sounds to me like foolishness and yet that cannot be for the writer of this book where i have found so much knowledge would not have set it by itself on this page and surrounded it with so many images and so many deep colors and so much fine gilding if it had been foolishness  fool give me a penny  wise man turns to another page here he has written the learned in old times forgot the visible country that i understand but i have taught my learners better  fool wont you give me a penny  wise man what do you want the words of the wise saracen will not teach you much  fool such a great wise teacher as you are will not refuse a penny to a fool  wise man what do you know about wisdom  fool oh i know i know what i have seen  wise man what is it you have seen  fool when i went by kilcluan where the bells used to be ringing at the break of every day i could hear nothing but the people snoring in their houses when i went by tubbervanach where the young men used to be climbing the hill to the blessed well they were sitting at the crossroads playing cards when i went by carrigoras where the friars used to be fasting and serving the poor i saw them drinking wine and obeying their wives and when i asked what misfortune had brought all these changes they said it was no misfortune but it was the wisdom they had learned from your teaching  wise man run round to the kitchen and my wife will give you something to eat  fool that is foolish advice for a wise man to give  wise man why fool  fool what is eaten is gone i want pennies for my bag i must buy bacon in the shops and nuts in the market and strong drink for the time when the sun is weak and i want snares to catch the rabbits and the squirrels and the bares and a pot to cook them in  wise man go away i have other things to think of now than giving you pennies  fool give me a penny and i will bring you luck bresal the fisherman lets me sleep among the nets in his loft in the wintertime because he says i bring him luck and in the summertime the wild creatures let me sleep near their nests and their holes it is lucky even to look at me or to touch me but it is much more lucky to give me a penny holds out his hand if i wasnt lucky id starve  wise man what have you got the shears for  fool i wont tell you if i told you you would drive them away  wise man whom would i drive away  fool i wont tell you  wise man not if i give you a penny  fool no  wise man not if i give you two pennies  fool you will be very lucky if you give me two pennies but i wont tell you  wise man three pennies  fool four and i will tell you  wise man very well four but i will not call you teigue the fool any longer  fool let me come close to you where nobody will hear me but first you must promise you will not drive them away wise man nods every day men go out dressed in black and spread great black nets over the hill great black nets  wise man why do they do that  fool that they may catch the feet of the angels but every morning just before the dawn i go out and cut the nets with my shears and the angels fly away  wise man ah now i know that you are teigue the fool you have told me that i am wise and i have never seen an angel  fool i have seen plenty of angels  wise man do you bring luck to the angels too  fool oh no no no one could do that but they are always there if one looks about one they are like the blades of grass  wise man when do you see them  fool when one gets quiet then something wakes up inside one something happy and quiet like the starsnot like the seven that move but like the fixed stars          he points upward  wise man and what happens then  fool then all in a minute one smells summer flowers and tall people go by happy and laughing and their clothes are the color of burning sods  wise man is it long since you have seen them teigue the fool  fool not long glory be to god i saw one coming behind me just now it was not laughing but it had clothes the color of burning sods and there was something shining about its head  wise man well there are your four pennies you a fool say glory be to god but before i came the wise men said it run away now i must ring the bell for my scholars  fool four pennies that means a great deal of luck great teacher i have brought you plenty of luck   he goes out shaking the bag  wise man though they call him teigue the fool he is not more foolish than everybody used to be with their dreams and their preachings and their three worlds but i have overthrown their three worlds with the seven sciences he touches the books with his hands with philosophy that was made for the lonely star i have taught them to forget theology with architecture i have hidden the ramparts of their cloudy heaven with music the fierce planets daughter whose hair is always on fire and with grammar that is the moons daughter i have shut their ears to the imaginary harpings and speech of the angels and i have made formations of battle with arithmetic that have put the hosts of heaven to the rout but rhetoric and dialectic that have been born out of the light star and out of the amorous star you have been my spearman and my catapult oh my swift horseman oh my keen darting arguments it is because of you that i have overthrown the hosts of foolishness an angel in a dress the color of embers and carrying a blossoming apple bough in his hand and with a gilded halo about his head stands upon the threshold before i came mens minds were stuffed with folly about a heaven where birds sang the hours and about angels that came and stood upon mens thresholds but i have locked the visions into heaven and turned the key upon them well i must consider this passage about the two countries my mother used to say something of the kind she would say that when our bodies sleep our souls awake and that whatever withers here ripens yonder and that harvests are snatched from us that they may feed invisible people but the meaning of the book must be different for only fools and women have thoughts like that their thoughts were never written upon the walls of babylon he sees the angel what are you who are you i think i saw some that were like you in my dreams when i was a childthat bright thing that dress that is the color of embers but i have done with dreams i have done with dreams  angel i am the angel of the most high god  wise man why have you come to me  angel i have brought you a message  wise man what message have yon got for me  angel you will die within the hour you will die when the last grains have fallen in this glass     he turns the hourglass  wise man my time to die has not come i have my pupils i have a young wife and children that i cannot leave why must i die  angel you must die because no souls have passed over the threshold of heaven since you came into this country the threshold is grassy and the gates are rusty and the angels that keep watch there are lonely  wise man where will death bring me to  angel the doors of heaven will not open to you for you have denied the existence of heaven and the doors of purgatory will not open to you for you have denied the existence of purgatory  wise man but i have also denied the existence of hell  angel hell is the place of those who deny  wise man kneeling i have indeed denied everything and have taught others to deny i have believed in nothing but what my senses told me but oh beautiful angel forgive me forgive me  angel you should have asked forgiveness long ago  wise man had i seen your face as i see it now oh beautiful angel i would have believed i would have asked forgiveness maybe you do not know how easy it is to doubt storm death the grass rotting many sicknesses those are the messengers that came to me oh why are you silent you carry the pardon of the most high give it to me i would kiss your hands if i were not afraid no no the hem of your dress  angel you let go undying hands too long ago to take hold of them now  wise man you cannot understand you live in that country people only see in their dreams you live in a country that we can only dream about maybe it is as hard for you to understand why we disbelieve as it is for us to believe oh what have i said you know everything give me time to undo what i have done give me a yeara montha dayan hour give me this hours end that i may undo what i have done  angel you cannot undo what you have done yet i have this power with my message if you can find one that believes before the hours end you shall come to heaven after the years of purgatory for from one fiery seed watched over by those that sent me the harvest can come again to heap the golden threshingfloor but now farewell for i am weary of the weight of time  wise man blessed be the father blessed be the son blessed be the spirit blessed be the messenger they have sent  angel at the door and pointing at the hourglass in a little while the uppermost glass will be empty        goes out  wise man everything will be well with me i will call my pupils they only say they doubt pulls the bell they will be here in a moment i hear their feet outside on the path they want to please me they pretend that they disbelieve belief is too old to be overcome all in a minute besides i can prove what i once disproved another pull at the bell they are coming now i will go to my desk i will speak quietly as if nothing had happened  he stands at the desk with a fixed look in his eyes  enter pupils and the fool  fool leave me alone leave me alone who is that pulling at my bag kings son do not pull at my bag  a young man did your friends the angels give you that bag why dont they fill your bag for you  fool give me pennies give me some pennies  a young man let go his cloak it is coming to pieces what do you want pennies for with that great bag at your waist  fool i want to buy bacon in the shops and nuts in the market and strong drink for the time when the sun is weak and snares to catch rabbits and the squirrels that steal the nuts and hares and a great pot to cook them in  a young man why dont your friends tell you where buried treasures are  another why dont they make you dream about treasures if one dreams three times there is always treasure  fool holding out his hat give me pennies give me pennies  they throw pennies into his hat he is standing close to the door that he may hold out his hat to each newcomer  a young man master will you have teigue the fool for a scholar  another young man teigue will you give us pennies if we teach you lessons no be goes to school for nothing on the mountains tell us what you learn

believe i shall be glad and not angry  a young man to his neighbor he wants somebody to dispute with  his neighbor i knew that from the beginning  a young man that is not the subject for today you were going to talk about the words the beggar wrote upon the walls of babylon  wise man if there is one amongst you that believes he will be my best friend surely there is one amongst you they are all silent surely what you learned at your mothers knees has not been so soon forgotten  a young man master till you came no teacher in this land was able to get rid of foolishness and ignorance but every one has listened to you every one has learned the truth you have had your last disputation  another what a fool you made of that monk in the marketplace he had not a word to say  wise man comes from his desk and stands among them in the middle of the room pupils dear friends i have deceived you all this time it was i myself who was ignorant there is a god there is a heaven there is fire that passes and there is fire that lasts for ever  teigue through all this is sitting on a stool by the door reckoning on his fingers what he will buy with his money  a young man to another he will not be satisfied till we dispute with him to the wise man prove it master have you seen them  wise man in a low solemn voice just now before you came in some one came to the door and when i looked up i saw an angel standing there  a young man you were in a dream anybody can see an angel in his dreams  wise man oh my god it was not a dream i was awake waking as i am now i tell you i was awake as i am now  a young man some dream when they are awake but they are the crazy and who would believe what they say forgive me master but that is what you taught me to say that is what you said to the monk when he spoke of the visions of the saints and the martyrs  another young man you see how well we remember your teaching  wise man out out from my sight i want some one with belief i must find that grain the angel spoke of before i die i tell you i must find it and you answer me with arguments out with you or i will beat you with my stick the young men laugh  a young man how well he plays at faith he is like the monk when he had nothing more to say  wise man out out or i will lay this stick about your shoulders out with you though you are a kings son  they begin to hurry out  a young man come come he wants us to find some one who will dispute with him                               all go out  wise man alone he goes to the door at the side i will call my wife she will believe women always believe

sometimes say your prayers  bridget prayers no you taught me to leave them off long ago at first i was sorry but i am glad now for i am sleepy in the evenings  wise man but do you not believe in god  bridget oh a good wife only believes what her husband tells her  wise man but sometimes when you are alone when i am in the school and the children asleep do you not think about the saints about the things you used to believe in what do you think of when you are alone  bridget considering i think about nothing sometimes i wonder if the pig is fattening well or i go out to see if the crows are picking up the chickens food  wise man oh what can i do is there nobody who believes i must go and find somebody he goes toward the door but with his eyes fixed on the hourglass i cannot go out i cannot leave that  bridget you want somebody to get up argument with  wise man oh look out of the door and tell me if there is anybody there in the street i cannot leave this glass somebody might

given a sign and save their souls alive your prayers are better than mine  fool bows his head wise mans head sinks on his arm on the books pupils enter  a young man look at the fool turned bellringer
