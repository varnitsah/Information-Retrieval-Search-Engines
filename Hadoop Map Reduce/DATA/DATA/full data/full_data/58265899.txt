58265899	history of friedrich ii of prussia  frederick the great  by thomas carlyle     book xviiisevenyears war rises to a height17571759     chapter ithe campaign opens  seldom was there seen such a combination against any man as this against friedrich after his saxon performances in 1756 the extent of his sin which is now ascertained to have been what we saw was at that time considered to transcend all computation and to mark him out for partition for suppression and enchainment as the general enemy of mankind partition him cut him down said the great powers to one another and are busy as never before in raising forces inciting new alliances and calling out the general posse comitatus of mankind for that salutary object what tempestuous fulminations in the reichstag and over all europe england alone excepted against this man  latterly the swedes who at first had compunctions on the score of protestantism have agreed to join in the partitioning adventure it brings us his pommern all pommern ours cry the swedish parliamentary eloquences with french gold in their pocket at any rate whisper they it spites the queen his sisterand drag the poor swedish nation into a series of disgraces and disastrous platitudes it was little anticipating this precious frenchswedish bargain swedes to invade with 25000 france to give fair subsidy and bribe largely was consummated in march 21st march 1757 stenzel v 38 c but did not become known to friedrich for some months later nor was it of the importance he then thought it in the first moment of surprise and provocation not indeed of importance to anybody except in the reverse way to poor sweden itself and to the french who had spent a great deal of pains and money on it and continued to spend with as good as no result at all for there never was such a war before or since not even by sweden in the captainless state and the one profit the copartners reaped from it was some discountenance it gave to the rumor which had risen more extensively than we should now think and even some nucleus of fact in it as appears that austria france and the catholic part of the reich were combining to put down protestantism to which they could now answer see protestant sweden is with usand so weaken a little what was pretty much friedrichs last hold on the public sympathies at this time  as to france itselfto france austria russiabound by such earthly treaties and the call of very heaven shall they not in united puissance and indignation rise to the rescue france touched to the heart by such treatment of a saxon kurfurst and bound by treaty of westphalia to protect all members of the reich which it has sometimes to our own knowledge so carefully done is almost more ardent than austria itself france austria russia to these add polish majesty himself and latterly the very swedes by french bribery at stockholm these are the partitioning powersand their shares let us spare one line for their shares are as follows  the swedes are to have pommern in whole polishsaxon majesty gets magdeburg halle and opulent slices thereabouts austrias share we need not say is that jewel of a silesia czarish majesty on the extreme east takes preussen konigsbergmemel country in whole adds preussen to her as yet too narrow territories weselcleve country from the other or western extremity france will take that clipping and make much of it these are quite serious businessengagements engrossed on careful parchment that spring 1757 and i suppose not yet boiled down into glue but still to be found in dusty corners with the tape much faded the high heads making preparation on the due scale think them not only executable but indubitable and almost as good as done push home upon him as united posse comitatus of mankind in a sacred cause of polish majesty and public justice how can one malefactor resistah ma treschere and oh my dearest princess and cousin what a chance has turned up  it is computed that there are arrayed against this one king under their respective kings empressqueens swedish senates catins and pompadours populations to the amount of above 100 millionsin after stages i remember to have seen 150 millions loosely given as the exaggerated cipher of armed soldiers actually in the field against him against hanover and him in 1757 there are by strict count 430000 friedrichs own dominions at this time contain about five millions of population of revenue somewhat less than two millions sterling new taxes he cannot legally and will not lay on his people his schatz readymoney treasure or hoard yearly accumulating for such end is i doubt not well filledexpress amount not mentioned of drilled men he has this year 150000 for the field portioned out thriftilyas well beseems against four invasions coming on him from different points in the field 150000 soldiers probably the best that ever were and in garrison up and down his country being by nature the least defensible of all countries near 40000 which he reckons of inferior quality so stands the account stenzel iv 308 306 v 39 ranke iii 415 preuss ii 389 43 124 c csubstantially true i doubt not but little or nothing of it so definite and conclusively distinct as it ought in all items to have been by this timehad poor dryasdust known what he was doing these are arithmetically precise his resourcesplus only what may lie in his own head and heart or funded in the other heads and hearts especially in those 150000 which he and his fathers have been diligently disciplining to good perfection for four centuries come the time  france urged by pompadour and the enthusiasms was first in the field the french army in superb equipment though privately in poorish state of discipline took the road early in march march 26th and 27th it crossed the german border cleve country and koln country had been rumored of since january and february last as terrifically grand and here it now actually is above 100000 strong110405 as the armylists flaming through all the newspapers teach mankind heldengeschichte iv 391 iii 1073 bent mainly upon prussia it would seem such the will of pompadour mainly upon prussia marechal destrees crossing at koln made offers even to his britannic majesty to be forgiven in comparison yield us a road through your hanover merely a road to those halberstadtmagdeburg parts your hanover shall have neutrality neutrality to hanover sighed britannic majesty alas am not i pledged by treaty and alas withal how is it possible with that america hanging over us and stood true nor is this all on the part of magnanimous france there is a soubise getting under way withal soubise and 30000 who will reinforce the reichs armament were it on foot and be heard of by and by so high runs french enthusiasm at present a new sting of provocation to most christian majesty it seems has been friedrichs conduct in that damiens matter miserable attempt by a poor mad creature to assassinate or at least draw blood upon the most christian majesty evening of 5th january 1757 exuberantly plentiful details of it and of the horrible lawprocedures which followed on it in adelung viii 197220 barbier c c about which friedrich busy and oblivious had never in common politeness been at the pains to condole compliment or take any notice whatever and will now take the consequences as due  the weselcleve countries these french find abandoned friedrichs garrisons have had orders to bring off the artillery and stores blow up what of the works are suitable for blowing up and join the britannic army of observation which is getting itself together in those regions considerable army britannic wholly in the money part new hanoverians so many brunswickers buckeburgers sachsengothaers so many add those precious hanoverianhessian 20000 whom we have had in england guarding our liberties so longwho are now shipped over in a lot fair wind and full sea to them army of 60000 on paper of effective more than 50000 headquarters now at bielefeld on the weserwhere april 16th or a few days later royal highness of cumberland comes to take command likely to make a fine figure against marechal destrees and his 100000 french but there was no helping it friedrich through winter has had schmettau earnestly flagitating the hanoverian officialities the weser is wadable in many places you cannot defend the weser and counselling and pleading to all lengthswithout the least effect wants to save his own halberstadt lands at our expense which was the idea in london too dont we by apocalyptic newswriters and eyesight of our own understand the man pitt is by this time in office who perhaps might have judged a little otherwise but pitts seat is altogether temporary insecure the ruling deities newcastle and royal highness who withal are in standing quarrel so that friedrich schmettau mitchell pleaded to the deaf nothing but defend the weser and ignorant fatuity ready for the impossible is to be made out there cannot help it then thinks friedrich often enough in bad moments army of observation will have its fate happily there are only 5000 prussians in it wesel and the other garrisons given up  only 5000 prussians by original engagement there should have been 25000 and friedrichs intention is even 45000 if he prosper otherwise for in january 1757 anniversary or nearly so of that neutrality convention last year there had beenencouraged by pitt as i could surmise who always likes friedricha definite much closer treaty of alliance with subsidy of a million sterling antirussian squadron of observation in the baltic 25000 prussians and other items which i forget forget the more readily as owing to the strange state of england near suffocating in its constitutional bedclothes the treaty could not be kept at all or serve as rule to poor englands exertions for friedrich this year exertions which were of the willingminded but futile kind going forward pellmell not by plan and could reach friedrich only in the lumphad there been any lump of them to sum together but pitt had gone outwe shall see what in pitts absence there was so that this treaty 1757 fell quite into the wastebasket not to say far deeper by way of pavement we know whereand is not mentioned in any english book nor was known to exist till some collector of such things printed it in comparatively recent times m koch in 1802 not very perfectly scholl iii 30 n who copies what koch has given a treaty 1757 which except as emblem of the then quasienchanted condition of england and as foreshadow of pitts new treaty in january 1758 and of three others that followed and were kept to the letter is not of moment farther     reichs thunder slight survey of it with question whitherward if anywhither  the thunderous fulminations in the reichsdietan injured saxony complaining an insulted kaiser after vain dehortatoriums reporting and denouncing horrors such as these what say you o reichhave been going on since september last and amount to boundless masses of the liveliest parliamentary eloquence now fallen extinct to all creatures given to great lengths in heldengeschichte iii iv and other easily avoidable books the kaiser otherwise a solid pacific gentleman intent on commercial operations furnishes a good deal of our meal says friedrich is officially extremely violent in behalf of injured saxonythat is to say in fact of injured austria which is ones own kurmainz chairman of the diet we remember how he was got and a battle of dettingen fought in consequence long since kurmainz is admitted to have the most decided austrian leanings britannic george austria being now in the opposite scale finds him an unhandy kurmainz and what profit it was to introduce false weights into the reichs balance that time not for long generations before had the poor old semiimaginary reichsdiet risen into such paroxysms nor did it ever again after never again in its terrestrial history was there such agonistic parliamentary struggle and terrific noise of parliamentary palaver witnessed in the poor reichsdiet noise and struggle rising ever higher peal after peal from september 1756 when it started till august 1757 when it had reached its acme as perhaps we shall see though it was far from ending then or for years to come  contemporary bystanders remark on the austrian part extraordinary rage and hatred against prussia which is now the one point memorable austria is used to speak loud in the diet as we have ourselves seen and it is again if you dive into those old aeoluscaves at your peril unpleasantly notable to what pitch of fixed rage and hot sullen hatred austria has now gone and how the tone has in it a potency of worldwide squealing and droning such as you nowhere heard before omnipotence of droning edged with shrieky squealing which fills the universe not at all in a melodious way from the depths of the gamut to the shrieky top againa droning that has something of porcine or wildboar character figure assembled the wild boars of the world all or mostly all got together and each with a knife just stuck into its side by a felonious individual too well knownyou will have some notion of the sound of these things friedrich sometimes remonstrates cannot you spare such phraseology unseemly to kings the quarrels of kings have to be decided by the sword what profit in unseemly language madambut for the first year and more there was no abatement on the austrian part  friedrichs own delegate at regensburg a baron von plotho come of old brandenburg kindred is a resolute readytongued very undaunted gentleman learned in diplomacies and reichs law carries his head high and always has his story at hand argument grounded on reichs law and the nature of the case plotho never lacks on spur of the hour and is indeed a very commendable parliamentary mastiff and honorable and melodious in the bark of him compared with those infuriated porcine specimens he has kurhanover for ally on common occasions and generally from most protestant members individually or from the corpus evangelicorum in mass some feeble whimper of support finds difficulty in getting his reichs pleadings printeddangerous everywhere in those southern parts to print anything whatever that is not austrian so that plotho at length gets printers to himself and sets up a printingpress in his own house at regensburg he did a great deal of sonorous pleading for friedrich proud deepvoiced ruggedly logical fairly beyond the austrian quality in many casesand always far briefer which is another high merit october coming we purpose to look in upon plotho for one minute october 14th 1757 which may be reckoned essentially the acme or turningpoint of these unpleasant thunderings heldengeschichte iv 745749  what good he did to friedrich or could have done with the tongue of angels in such an audience we do not accurately know some good he would do even in the reichsdiet there and out of doors over a german public still more and is worth his frugal wagessay 1000 pounds a year printing and all other expense included this is a mere guess of mine dryasdust having been incurious but to english readers it is incredible for what sums friedrich got his work done no work ever better which is itself an appreciable advantage computable in pounds sterling and is the parent of innumerable others which no arithmetic or bookkeeping by double entry will take hold of and which are indeed priceless for nations and for persons but this poor old bedridden reich starting in agonistic spasm at such rate is it not touching in a corpus moribund for so many centuries past the reich is something though it is not much nothing like so much as even kaiser franz supposes it much or not so much kaiser franz wishes to secure it for himself friedrich to hinder himand it must be a poor something if not worth plothos wages on friedrichs part  it would insult the patience of every reader to go into these spasmodic tossings of the poor paralytic reich or to mention the least item of them beyond what had some result or fraction of result on the worlds real affairs we shall say only therefore that after tempests not a few of porcine squealing answered always by counterlatration on the vigilant plothos partsquealing chiefly from the reichshofrath at vienna the head tribunal of imperial majesty which sits judging and denouncing there touched to the soul as if by a knife driven into its side by those unheardof treatments of saxony and disregard to our dehortatoriums and which bursts out peal after peal filling the universe plotho not unvigilantthe poor old reichsdiet did at last get into an acting posture and determine by clear majority of 99 against 60 that there should be a reichs execution army got on foot reichs execution army to coerce by force of arms this nefarious king of prussia into making instant restitution to saxony with ample damages on the nail that right be done to kurfursts of this reich to such height of vigor has the reichsdiet goneand was voting it at regensburg january 10th 1757 heldengeschichte iv 252 302 330 stenzel v 32 that very day when nefarious friedrich at berlin casehardened in iniquity to such a pitch sat writing his instruction to count finck which we read not long since simultaneous movements unknown to one another in this big wrestle  reichsdiet perfected its vote had it quite through and sanctioned by the kaisers majesty january 29th arming to be a triplum triple contingent required of you this time with romishmonths romermonate of cash contributions from all and sundry rigorously gathered i should hope where austria has power so many as will cover the expense army to be got on actual foot hastily instantly if possible an eilende reichsexecutions armee so it ran but the word eilende speedy had a mischance in printing and was struck off into elende contemptibly wretched so that on all marketsquares and public places of poor teutschland you read flaming placards summoning out not a speedy or immediate but a miserable reichs execution army a word which we need not say was laughed at by the unfeeling part of the public and was often called to mind by the reichs execution armys performances when said speedy army did at last take the field  for the reich performed its vote actually had a reichs execution army the last it ever had in this world not by any means the worst it ever had for they used generally to be bad commanders managers are named romermonate are gathered in or the sure prospect of them and through mayjune 1757 there is busy stir of drumming preparing and enlisting all over the reich end of july we shall see the reichs army in camp end of august actually in the field and later on a touch of its fighting withal many other things the reich tried against unfortunate friedrichgradual advance in fact to ban of the reich or total anathema and cuttingoff from fire and water but in none of these in ban as little as any did it come to practical result at all or acquire the least title to be remembered at this day finis of ban some eight months hence has something of attractive as futility the curious death of a futility finis of ban october 14th already indicated we may for one moment look in upon if there be one moment to spare the restreaders may fancy it and read only of the actuality and fighting part which will itself be enough for them on such a matter     friedrich suddenly marches on prag  four invasions from their respective points of the compass northeast northwest southeast and southwest here is a formidable outlook for the one man against whom they are all advancing openmouthed the one manwith nothing but a duke of cumberland and his observation army for backing in such duelhad need to look to himself which we well know he does wrapt in profoundly silent vigilance with his plans all laid of the four invasions three the russian french austrian are very large and the two latter especially the last are abundantly formidable the swedish of which there is rumoring he hopes may come to little or not come at all nor is russia though talking big and actually getting ready above 100000 men so immediately alarming friedrich always hopes the english with their guineas and their managements will do something for him in that quarter and he knows at worst that the russian hundred thousand will be a very slowmoving entity the swedish invasion friedrich for the present leaves to chance and against russia he has sent old marshal lehwald into those baltic parts far eastward towards the utmost memel frontier to put the country upon its own defence and make what he can of it with 30000 menwestprussian militias a good few of them this is all he can spare on the swedishrussian side austria and france are the perilous pair of entities not to be managed except by intense concentration of stroke and by going on them in succession if one have luck  friedrichs motions and procedures in cantonquarters through winter and in late months have led to the belief that he means to stand on the defensive that the scene of the campaign will probably be saxony and that austria for recovering injured saxony for recovering dear silesia will have to take an invasive attitude and austria is busy everywhere preparing with that view has tolpatcheries and advanced brigades still harassing about in the lausitz a great army assembling at pragbrowne forward towards the metal mountains securing posts gathering magazines for the crossing into saxony there there it is thought the tug of war will probably be furious and strenuous it is not doubted on this friedrichs part but against such odds what can he do with austrians in front with russians to left with french to right and arear not to mention swedes and appendages surely here if ever is a lost king  it is by no means friedrichs intention that saxony itself shall need to be invaded friedrichs habit is as his enemies might by this time be beginning to learn not that of standing on the defensive but that of going on it as the preferable method wherever possible march 24th friedrich had quitted dresden city and for a month after headquarters lockwitz edge of the pirna country he had been shifting redistributing his cantoned armyprivately into the due divisions due readiness for march which done on fixed days about the end of april the whole army he himself from lockwitz april 20thto the surprise of austria and the world friedrich in three grand columns bevern out of the lausitz king himself over the metal mountains schwerin out of schlesien is marching with extraordinary rapidity direct for prag in the notion that a right plunge into the heart of bohemia will be the best defence for saxony and the other places under menace  this is a most unexpected movement which greatly astonishes the worldtheatre pit boxes and gallery alike as friedrichs sudden movements often do and which is above all interesting on the stage itself where the actors had been counting on a quite opposite set of entries and activities feldmarschall browne and general konigseck not our old friend konigseck who used to drynurse in the netherlands but his nephew and heir may cease gathering magazines in those lausitz and metalmountain parts happy could they give wings to those already gathered magazines for austrian service are clearly not the things wanted there one does not burn ones magazines till the last extremity but wings they have none and such is the enigmatic velocity of those prussian movements one seldom has time even to burn them in the last crisis of catastrophe considerable portions of that provender fell into the prussian throat as much as three months provision for the whole army count theyadding to those frontier sundries the really important magazine which they seized at jungbunzlau farther in heldengeschichte iv 613 c it is one among their many greater advantages from this surprisal of the enemy and sudden topsyturvying of his plans browne and konigseck have to retire on prag at their swiftest looking to more important results than magazines  it is friedrichs old plan long since in 1744 we saw a march of this kind three columns rushing with simultaneous rapidity on prag and need not repeat the particulars on this occasion here are some notes on the subject which will sufficiently bring it home to readers  the three columns were for a part of the way four the kings being at first in two branches till they united again on the other side of the hills for the king what is to be noted had shot out three weeks before a small preliminary branch under moritz of dessau who marched well westward by eger starting from chemnitz in saxony and had some tussling with our poor old friend duke dahremberg brownes subordinate in those parts dahremberg having 20000 under him would not quit eger for moritz but pushed out croats upon him and sat still this it was afterwards surmised had been a feint on friedrichs part to give the austrians pleasant thoughts invading us is he would fain invade us but cannot moritz fell back from eger and was ready to join the kings march at linay april 23d third day from lockwitz on the kings part onwards from which point the columns are specifically three in strength and on routes somewhat as follows  1 the first column or kingswhich is 60000 after this junction 45000 foot 15000 horsequitted lockwitz headquarter for a month past wednesday april 20th they go by the pascopol and other roads through pirna for one place through karbitz aussig are at linay on the 23d where moritz joins 24th in the united state forward again leave lobositz two miles to left to trebnitz 25th and rest there one day  at aussig an unfortunate thing befell zastrow respectable old general zastrow was to drive the austrians out of aussig zastrow does it april 22d23d drives them well over the heights april 25th however marching forward towards lobositz zastrow is shot through both temples pandour hid among the bushes and cliffs other side of elbe and falls dead on the spot buried in gottleube kirk 1st may  in these aussig affairs especially in recapturing the castle of tetschen near by colonel mayer father of the new freecorps did shining serviceand was approved of he and they and a day or two after was detached with a fifteen hundred of that kind on more important business first to pick up one or two bohemian magazines lying handy after which to pay a visit to the reich and its bluster about executionarmy and teach certain persons who it is they are thundering against in that awkwardly truculent manner errand shiningly done by mayer as perhaps we may hearand certainly as all the newspapers loudly heardin the course of the next two months  at crossing of the eger friedrichs column had some chasing of poor dahremberg attempting to cut him off from his bridges bridge of koschlitz bridge of budin but he made good despatch browne and he and except a few prisoners of ziethens gathering and most of his magazines unburnt they did him no damage the chase was close enough more than once the austrian headquarter of tonight was that of the prussians tomorrow monday may 2d friedrichs column was on the weissenberg of prag browne dahremberg and prince karl who is now come up to take command having hastily filed through the city leaving a fit garrison the day before except his magazines nothing the least essential went wrong with browne but konigseck who had not a friedrich on his heelskonigseck trying more as his opportunities were morewas not quite so lucky  2 column second to the kings left comes from the lausitz under brunswickbevern18000 foot 5000 horse this is the bevern who so distinguished himself at lobositz last year and he is now to culminate into a still brighter exploitthe last of his very bright ones as it proved bevern set out from about zittau from grottau few miles south of zittau the same day with friedrich that is april 20thand had not well started till he came upon formidable obstacles came upon general konigseck namely a konigseck manoeuvring ahead in superior force a maguire irish subordinate of konigsecks coming from the right to cut off our baggage against whom bevern has to detach a lacy coming from the leftor indeed konigseck and lacy in concert intending to offer battle battle of reichenberg which accordingly ensued april 21stof which though it was very famous for so small a battle there can be no account given here  the short truth is konigseck falling back parthianlike with a force of 30000 or more has in front of him nothing but bevern who as he issues from the lausitz and till he can unite with schwerin farther southward is but some 20000 odd cannot konigseck call halt and bid bevern return or do worse konigseck a diligent enough soldier determines to try chooses an excellent positionat or round reichenberg which is the first bohemian town one march from zittau in the lausitz and then one from liebenau which latter would be beverns second bohemian stage on the prag road if he continued prosperous reichenberg standing nestled among hills in the neisse valley one of those four neisses known to us the neisse where prince karl got exploded in that signal manner winter 1745 by a certain king offers fine capabilities which konigseck has laid hold of there is especially one excellent hollow on the left or western bank of neisse river that is across from reichenberg backed by woody hills nothing but hills brooks woods all round hollow scooped out as if for the purpose and altogether of inviting character to konigseck there wednesday april 20th konigseck posts himself plants batteries fells abatis plenty of cannon of horse and foot and say all soldiers one of the best positions possible  so that bevern approaching reichenberg at evening evening of his first march wednesday april 20th finds his way barred and that the difficulties may be considerable nothing to be made of it tonight thinks bevern but we must try tomorrow and has to take camp with a marshy brook in front of him some way on the hither side of reichenberg and study overnight what method of unbarring there may be thursday morning early bevern having well reconnoitred and studied was at work unbarring bevern crossed his own marshy brook courageously assaulted konigsecks position left wing of konigseck stormed the abatis the batteries plunged in upon konigseck man to man horse to horse and after some fierce enough but brief dispute tumbled konigseck out of the ground konigseck made some attempt to rally attempted twice but in vain had fairly to roll away and at length to run leaving 1000 dead upon the field about 500 prisoners one or two guns and i forget how many standards or whether any kettledrums this was thought to be a decidedly bright feat on beverns part rather mismanaged latterly on konigsecks tempelhof i 100 heldengeschichte iii 1077 friedrichs own account linay in bohmen 24th april 1757 c c there is in buschings magazin xvi 139 et seq an intelligible sketch of this action of reichenherg with satirical criticisms which have some basis on lacy maguire and others by an anonymous military cynicwho gives many such in busching that of fontenoy for example not without force of judgment and signs of wide study and experience in his trademuch approved by friedrich as he hears of it at linay on his own prosperous march pragward a comfortable omen were there nothing more  konigseck and company torn out of reichenberg and set running could not fairly halt again and face about till at liebenau twenty miles off where they found some defile or difficult bit of ground fit for them and this too proved capable of yielding pause for a few hours only for schwerin with his silesian column was coming up from the northeast threatening konigseck on flank and rear konigseck could only tighten his straps a little at this liebenau and again get under way and making vain attempts to hinder the junction of schwerin and bevern to defend the jungbunzlau magazine or do any good in those parts except to detain the schwerinbevern people certain hours i think one day in all had nothing for it but to gird himself together and retreat on prag and the ziscaberg where his friends now were  the austrian force at reichenberg was 20000 would have been 30 and odd thousands had maguire come up as he might have done had not the appearances alarmed him too much bevern minus the detachment sent against maguire was but 15000 in fight and he has quite burst the austrians away who had plugged his road for him in such force is it not a comfortable little victory glorious in its sort and a good omen for the bigger things that are coming bevern marched composedly on after this inspiriting tussle through liebenau and what defiles there were april 24th at turnau he falls into the schwerin column incorporates himself therewith and as subordinate constituent part accompanies schwerin thenceforth  3 column third was schwerins out of schlesien counted to be 32000 foot 12000 horse schwerin gathering himself from glatz and the northerly country at landshutvery careless he of the pleasant hills and fine scattered peaks of the giant mountains thereaboutswas completely gathered foremost of all the columns having farthest to go and on monday 18th april started from landshut winterfeld leading one division in our

elbewards watering it is a considerable austrian town and the bohemian end of the passsohr only a few miles from it heartily indifferent to schwerin at this moment who was home from the army in a kind of disfavor or mutual pet at the time sohr was done schwerins march we shall not give his junction with bevern at turnau on the iser april 24th then their capture of jungbunzlau magazine and crossing of the elbe at melnick these were the important points and in spite of konigsecks tusslings these all went well and nothing was lost except one day of time  the austrians some days ago as we observed filed through pragsunday may 1st not a pleasant holidayspectacle to the populationsand are all encamped on the ziscaberg high ground on the other side of the city had they been alert now was the time to attack friedrich who is weaker than they while nobody has yet joined him they did not think of it under prince karl and browne and the prince are said to be in bad agreement     chapter iibattle of prag  monday morning 2d may 1757 the vanguard or advanced troops of friedrichs column had appeared upon the weissenberg northwest corner of prag ground known to them in 1744 and to the poor winterking in 1620 vanguard in the morning followed shortly by friedrich himself and hour after hour by all the others marching in so that before sunset the whole force lay posted there and had the romantic city of prag full in view at their feet a most romantic highpiled manytowered most unlevel old city its skylights and gilt steeplecocks glittering in the western sunaustrian camp very visible close beyond it spread out miles in extent on the ziscaberg heights or eastern sideprag no doubt and the austrian garrison of prag taking intense survey of this prussian phenomenon with commentaries with emotions hidden now in eternal silence as is fit enough one thing we know headquarter was in welleslawin there in that small hamlet nearly to north lodged friedrich the then busiest man of europe whom posterity is still striving for a view of as something memorable  prince karl our old friend is now in chief command yonder browne also is there who was in chief command their scheme of campaign gone all awry and to friedrich last night at his quarters in the monastery of tuchomirsitz where these two gentlemen had lodged the night before it was reported that they had been heard in violent altercation heldengeschichte  iv 11 exact diary of the march given thereboth of them naturally in illhumor at the surprising turn things had taken and feldmarschall browne firing up belike at some platitude past or coming at some advice of his rejected some imputation cast on him or we know not what prince karl is now chief and indignant browne as may well be the case dissents a good dealas he has often had to do patience my friend it is near ending now prince karl means to lie quiet on the ziscaberg and hold prag does not think of molesting friedrich in his solitary state and will undertake nothing till konigseck from jungbunzlau come in victorious or not or till perhaps even daun arrive who is rather slowly gathering reinforcement in maren what can the enemy attempt on us in a post of this strength thinks prince karl and browne whatever his insight or convictions be has to keep silence  weissenberg let readers be reminded is on the hither or western side of prag the hradschin pronounce radsheen with accent on the last syllable as in schwerin and other such cases the hradschin which is the topmost summit of the city and of the fashionable quarterold bohemian palace still occasionally habitable as such and in constant use as a downing streetlies on the slope or shoulder of the weissenberg a good way from the top and has a web of streets rushing down from it steepest streets in the world till they reach the bridge and broadflowing moldau broad as thames at halfflood but nothing like so deep after which the streets become level and spread out in intricate plenty to right and to left and ahead eastward across the river till the ziscaberg with frowning precipitous brow suddenly puts a stop to them in that particular direction from ziscaberg top to weissenberg top may be about five english miles from the hradschin to the foot of ziscaberg northwest to southeast will be half that distance the greatest length of prag city which is rather rhomboidal in shape its longer diagonal this that we mention the shorter diagonal from northmost base of ziscaberg to southmost of hradschin is perhaps a couple of miles prag stands nestled in the lap of mountains and is not in itself a strong place in war but the country round it moldau ploughing his rugged chasm of a passage through the piled tableland is difficult to manoeuvre in  moldau valley comes straight from the south crosses prag andmaking on its outgate at the northern end of prag end of shortest diagonal just spoken of one big loop or bend and counterbend of horseshoe shape which will be notable to us anonagain proceeds straight northward and elbeward it is narrow everywhere especially when once got fairly north of prag and runs along like a quasihighland strath amid rocks and hills big hillranges not to be called barren yet with rock enough on each hand and fine side valleys opening here and there the bottom of your strath which is green and fertile with pleasant busy villages much intent on waterpower and cottonspinning in our time is generally of few furlongs in breadth and so it lasts this pleasant moldau valley mile after mile on the northern or lower moldau generally straight north though with one big bend eastward just before ending and not till near melnick or the mouth of moldau do we emerge on that grand elbe valleyglanced at once already from pascopol or other height in the lobositz times  friedrichs first problem is the junction with schwerin junction not to be accomplished south of ziscaberg in the present circumstances and which friedrich knows to be a ticklish operation with those austrians looking on from the high grounds there tuesday 3d may in the way of reconnoitring and decisively on wednesday 4th friedrich is off northward along the western heights of lower moldau proper force following him to seek a fit place for the pontoons and get across in that northern quarter how dangerous that schwerin is a day too late murmurs he but hopes the austrians will undertake nothing keith with 30000 he has left on the weissenberg to straiten prag and the austrian garrison on that side our wagontrains arrive from leitmeritz on that side elbeboats bring them up to leitmeritz very indispensable to guard that side of prag friedrichs fixed purpose also is to beat the austrians on the other side of it and send them packing but for that there are steps needful  up so far as lissoley the first day friedrich has found no fit place but on the morrow thursday 5th farther up at a place called seltz friedrich finds his side of the strath to be a little higher than the otherproper therefore for cannonading the other if need beand orders his pontoons to be built together there he knows accurately of the schwerin column of the comfortable bevern victory at reichenberg and how they have got the jungbunzlau magazine and are across the elbe their bridges all secured though with delay of one day and do now wait only for the wordfor the three cannonshot in fact which are to signify that friedrich is actually crossing to their side of lower moldau  friedrichs bridge is speedily built trained human hands can be no speedier his batteries planted his precautions taken the three cannonshot go off audible to schwerin and friedrichs troops stream speedily across hardly a pandour to meddle with them nay before the passage was completewhat lighthorse squadrons are these hussars seen to be seidlitzs missioned by schwerin appear on the outskirts a meeting worthy of three cheers surely after such a march on both sides friedrich lies on the eastern hilltops that night hamlet of czimitz his headquarter discoverable if you wish it scarcely three miles north of prag and accurate appointment is made with schwerin as to the meetingplace tomorrow morning meetingplace is to be the environs of prossik village southeastward over yonder short way north of the pragkonigsgratz highway and rather nearer prag than we now are in czimitz here time at prossik to be 6 am by the clock and winterfeld and schwerin to come in person and speak with his majesty this is the program for friday may 6th which proves to be so memorable a day  schwerin is on foot by the stroke of midnight comes along over the heights of chaber by half a dozen or i know not how many roads visible in due time to friedrichs people who are likewise punctually on the advance in a word the junction is accomplished with all correctness and while the columns are marching up schwerin and winterfeld ride about in personal conference with his majesty taking survey through spyglasses of those austrians encamped yonder on the broad back of their zisca hill a couple of miles to southward what a set of austrians exclaim military critics to permit such junction without effort to devour the one half or the other in good time friedrich himself it is probable might partly be of the same opinion but he knew his austrians and had made bold to venture friedrich we can observe always got to know his man after fighting him a month or two and took liberties with him or did not take accordingly and for most partnot quite always as one signal exception will showhe does it with perfect accuracy and often with vital profit to his measures if the austrian cookingtents are asmoke before eight in the morning notes he you may calculate in such case the austrians will march that day military instructions with a surprising vividness of eye and mind beautiful to rival if one could he watches the signs of the times of the hours and the days and the places and prophesies from them reads men and their procedures as if they were mere handwriting not too cramp for himthe austrians have by this time got their konigseck home very unvictorious but still on foot all but a thousand or two they are already stronger than the prussians by count of heads and till even daun come up what hurry in a post like this the austrians are viewing friedrich too this morning but in the blankest manner their outposts fire a cannonshot or two on his group of adjutants and him without effect and the head people send their cavalry out to forage so little prophecy have they from signs seen  zisca hill where the austrians now are rises sheer up of wellnigh precipitous steepness though there are trees and grass on it from the eastern side of prag say five or six hundred feet a steep picturesque massive green hill moldau river turning suddenly to right strikes the northwest corner of it has flowed well to west of it till then and winds eastward round its northern base as will be noticed presently the ascent of ziscaberg by roads is steep and tedious but once at the top you find that it is precipitous on two sides only the city or westward side and the moldau or northward atop it spreads out far and wide into a waving upland level bare of hedges ploughable all of it studded with littery hamlets and farmsteadings far and wide a kind of plain sloping with extreme gentleness five or six miles to eastward and as far to southward before the level perceptibly rise again  another feature of the ziscaberg already hinted at is very notable that of the moldau skirting its northern base and scarping the hill on that side too into a precipitous or very steep condition moldau having arrived from southward fairly past the end of ziscaberg had so to speak made up his mind to go right eastward quarrying his way through the lower uplands there and he proceeds accordingly hugging the northern base of ziscaberg and making it steep enough but finds in the course of a mile or so that he can no more upland being still rockbuilt not underminable farther and so is obliged to wind round again to northward and finally straight westward the way he came or parallel to the way he came and has effected that great horseshoe hollow we heard of lately an extremely pretty hollow and curious to look upon pretty villas gardens and a belvedere park laid out in the bottom part with green mountainwalls rising all round it and a silver ring of river at the base of them length of horseshoe from heel to toe or from west to east is perhaps a mile breadth from heel to heel perhaps half as much having arrived at his old distance to west moldau like a repentant prodigal and as if ashamed of his frolic just over against the old point he swerved from takes straight to northward again straight northward and quarries out that fine narrow valley or quasihighland strath with its pleasant busy villages where he turns the overshot machinery and where friedrich and his men had their pontoons swimming yesterday  it is here on this broad back of the ziscaberg that the austrians now lie looking northward over to the king and trying cannonshots upon him there they have been encamping and diligently intrenching themselves for four days past diligent especially since yesterday when they heard of friedrichs crossing the river their groups of tents and batteries at all the good points stretch from near the crown of ziscaberg eastward to the villages of hlaupetin kyge and their lakes near four miles and rearward into the interior one knows not how farprince karl hardly awake yet lies at nussel near the moldau near the wischerad or southeastmost point of prag six good miles westbysouth of kyge at the other end of the diagonal line about the same distance right east from nussel and a mile or more to south of kyge over yonder is a littery farmstead named sterbohol which is not yet occupied by the austrians but will become very famous in their warannals this day  where the austrian camp or various tentgroups were at the time friedrich first cast eye on them is no great concern of his or ours inasmuch as in two or three hours hence the austrians were obliged rather suddenly to take order of battle and that and not their camping is the thing we are curious upon let us step across and take some survey of that austrian ground which friedrich is now surveying from the distance fully intending that it shall be a battleground in few hours and try to explain how the austrians drew up on it when they noticed the prussian symptoms to become serious more and more by nine in the morningsome two hours after friedrich began his scanning and the austrian outposts their firing of stray cannonshots on himit is battlelines not empty tents which there was not time to strike that salute the eye over yonder  from behind that verdant horseshoe chasm we spoke of buttressed by the inaccessible steeps and the moldau doublefolded in the form of horseshoe all along the brow of that sloping expanse stands by 9 am foragers all suddenly called in the austrian front the second line and the reserve parallel to it at good distances behind ranked there say 65000 regulars prussian force little short of the same on the brow of ziscaberg slope some four miles long their right wing ends in strong batteries in intricate marshes knolls lakelets between hlaupetin and kyge the extreme of their left wing looks over on that horseshoe hollow where moldau tried to dig his way but could not and had to turn back they have numerous redoubts in front and in all the good places and are busy with more some of them just now getting finished treblequick while the prussians are seen under way as many as sixty heavy cannon in battery up and down of fieldpieces they have a hundred and fifty excellent always with their artillery these austrians plenty of it wellplaced and wellserved thanks to prince lichtensteins fine labors within these ten years past oeuvres de frederic in several places see hormayr lichtenstein the villages the farmsteads are occupied every rising ground especially has its batteryhomoly berg tabor berg mount of tabor say knoll of tabor nothing like so high as battersea rise hardly even as constitution hill though scriptural zisca would make a mount of itthese and other bergs of the like type  that is the austrian battle order as it stood about 9 though it had still to change a little as we shall see their first line straight or nearly so looking northward stands on the brow of the zisca slope their second and their third singularly like it at the due distances behindin the intervals their tents which stand scattered in groups wide apart in the ample interior to southward the cavalry is on both wings left wing behind that moldau chasm cannot attack nor be attackedexcept it were on hippogriffs and its enemy on the like capable of fighting in the air overhead of these belvedere pleasuregrounds perhaps prince karl will remedy this oversight fruit of close following of the orthodox practice prince karl supreme chief commands on the left wing browne on the right where he can attack or be attacked not on hippogriffs as we shall see and others will light horse in any quantity hang scattered on all outskirts with foot with cannon batteries with horse light or heavy they cover in long broad flood the whole of that zisca slope to near where it ceases and the ground to eastward begins perceptibly to rise again  in this latter quarter zisca slope now nearly ended begins to get very swampy in parts on the eastern border of the austrian camp at kyge hostawitz and beyond it southward about sterbohol and michelup there are many little lakelets artificial fishponds several of them with their sluices dams and apparatus a ragged broadish lacing of ponds and lakelets all well dried in our day straggles and zigzags along there connected by the miserablest brook in nature which takes to oozing and serpentizing forward thereabouts and does finally get emptied now in a rather livelier condition into the moldau about the toepart of that horseshoe or belvedere region it runs in sight of the king i think where he now is this lower livelier part of it little does the king know how important the upper oozing portion of it will be to him this day near michelup are lakelets worth noticing a little under sterbohol in the course of this miserable brook is a string of fishponds with their sluices open at this time the water out and the mud bottom sown with herbprovender for the intended carps which is coming on beautifully green as leeks and nearly ready for the fish getting to it again  friedrich surveys diligently what he can of all this from the northern verge we will now return to friedrich and will stay on his side through the terrible action that is coming battle of prag one of the furious battles of the world loud as doomsdaythe very emblem of which done on the piano by females of energy scatters mankind to flight who love their ears of this great action the narratives old and modern are innumerable false some of them unintelligible wellnigh all there are three in lloyd known probably to some of my readers tempelhof with criticisms of these three gives a fourthperhaps the one narrative which human nature after much study can in some sort understand human readers especially military i refer to that as their finale in lloyd i 38 et seq the three in tempelhof i 123 the fourth ib i 144 strength of each army 105149 remarks of tempelhofthe history or series of lectures on the battles c of this war by the royal staffofficerswhich for the last thirty or forty years is used as textbook or military euclid in the prussian cadetschoolsappears to possess the fit professorial lucidity and amplitude and in regard to all official details enumerations and the like is received as of canonical authority it is not accessible to the general publicthough liberally enough conceded in special cases whereby in effect the main results of it are now become current in modern prussian books by favor in high quarters i had once possession of a copy for some months but not at that time the possibility of thoroughly reading any part of it other interest than militaryscientific the action now has not much the stormy fire of soul that blazed that day higher in no ancient or modern fight of men is extinct hopeless of resuscitation for english readers approximately what the thing to human eyes might be like what friedrichs procedure humor and physiognomy of soul was in it this especially the latter head is what we search forhad lazy dryasdust given us almost anything on this latter head what little can be gleaned from him on both heads let us faithfully give and finish our sad part of the combat  friedrich with his schwerin and winterfeld surveying these things from the northern edge admits that the austrian position is extremely strong but he has no doubt that it must be by some good method attacked straightway and the austrians got beaten indisputably the enterprise is difficult unattackable clearly the austrians on that left wing of theirs not in the centre well attackable nor in the front at all with that stiff ground and such redoubts and points of strength but round on their right yonder take them in flankcannot we on as far as kyge the three have ridden reconnoitring and found no possibility upon the front nor at kyge where the front ends in batteries pools and quagmires is there any difficult not undoable persists the king and it must be straightway set about and got done winterfeld always for action is of that opinion too and examining farther down along their right flank reports that there the thing is feasible  feasible perhaps but straightway objects schwerin his men have been on foot since midnight and on forced marches for days past were it not better to rest for this one day restand daun coming on with 30000 of reinforcement to them might arrive this night never my good feldmarschalland as the feldmarschall was a man of stiff notions and had a tongue of some emphasis the dialogue went on probably with increasing emphasis on friedrichs side too till old schwerin with a quite emphatic flash of countenance crushing the hat firm over his brow exclaims well your majesty the fresher fish the better fish frische fische gute fische straightway then and springs off on the gallop southward he too seeking some likely point of attack he tooconjointly or not with winterfeld i do not know winterfeld himself does not say whose own modest words on the subject readers shall see before we finish but both are mentioned in the books as searching at handgallop in this way and both once well round to south by the podschernitz podschernitz is pronounced potshernitz should we happen to mentionn it again kyge keega quarter with the austrian right flank full in view were agreed that here the thing was possible infantry to push from this quarter towards sterbohol yonder and then plunge into their redoubts and them cavalry may sweep still farther southward if found convenient and even take them in rear both agree that it will do in this way ground tolerably good slightly downwards for us then slightly upwards again tolerable for horse eventhe intermediate lacing of dirty lakelets the fishponds with their sluices drawn schwerin and winterfeld either did not notice at all or thought them insiginificant interspersed with such beautiful pasturegroundof unusual verdure at this early season of the year  the deployment or marching up aufmarschiren of the prussians was wonderful in their squadrons in their battalions horse foot artillery wheeling closing opening strangely checkering a countrysidein movements intricate chaotic to all but the scientific eye conceive them flowing along from the heights of chaber behind prossik hamlet right wing of infantry plants itself at prossik horse westward of them and ever onwards in broad manycheckered tidestream eastward eastward then southward our artillery went through podschernitz the foot and horse a little on this westward side of it intricate manyglancing tide of coming battle which swift correct as clockwork becomes two lines from prossik to near chwala baggage well behind at gbell thence round by podschernitz quarter and descends steady swift tornadostorm so beautifully hidden in it towards sterbohol there to grip to gradually in stirring up those old dead pedantic recordbooks the fact rises on us silent whirlwinds of old plattdeutsch fire beautifully held down dwell in those mute masses better human stuff there is not than that old teutsch dutch english plattdeutsch and other varieties and so disciplined as here it never was before or since in an hour and half what military men may count almost incredible they are fairly on their ground motionless the most of them by 9 am the rest wheeling rightward as they successively arrive in the chwalapodschernitz localities and descending diligently sterbohol way and will be at their harvestwork anon  meanwhile the austrians seeing to their astonishment these phenomena to the north and that it is a quite serious thing do also rapidly bestir themselves swarming like beesbringing in their foraging cavalry no time to change your jacket for a coat rank doublequick browne is on that right wing of theirs bring the left wing over hither suggests browne cavalry is useless yonder unless they had hippogriffsand again browne suggesting the austrians make a change in the position of their right wing both horse and foot change which is of vital importance though unnoted in many narratives of this battle seeing namely what the prussians intend they wheel their right wing say the last furlong or two of their long line of battle half round to right so that the last furlong or two stands at right angles en potence gallowswise or joinerssquarewise to the rest and in this way make front to the prussian onslaughtfront now not flank as the prussians are anticipating this is an important wheel to right and formation in joinerssquare manner and involves no end of interior wheeling marching and deploying which austrians cannot manage with prussian velocity swift with it here about sterbohol at least my men for here are the prussians within wind of us urges browne and here straightway the hurricane does break loose  winterfeld the van of schwerins infantry schwerins own regiment and some others with him is striding rapidly on sterbohol winterfeld catches it before browne can but near by behind that important post on the homely hill berg or mountain nothing like so high as constitution mountain are cannonbatteries of devouring quality which awaken on winterfeld as he rushes out doublequick on the advancing austrians and are fatal to winterfelds attempt and nearly to winterfeld himself winterfeld heavily wounded sank in swoon from his horse and awakening again in a pool of blood found his men all off rushing back upon the main schwerin body austrian grenadiers gazing on the thing about eighty paces off not venturing to follow winterfeld half dead scrambled across to schwerin who has now come up with the main body his front line fronting the austrians here and there ensued about sterbohol and neighborhood led on by schwerin such a deathwrestle as was seldom seen in the annals of war winterfelds miss of sterbohol was the beginning of it the exact course of sequel none can describe though the end is well known  the austrians now hold sterbohol with firm grip backed by those batteries from homoly hill redoubts cannonbatteries as we said stud all the field the austrian stock of artillery is very great arrangement of it cunning practice excellent does honor to prince lichtenstein and indeed is the real force of the austrians on this occasion schwerin must have sterbohol in spite of batteries and ranked austrians and winterfelds recoil tumbling round himand rarely had the oldest veteran such a problem old schwerin fiery as ever at the age of 73 has been in many battles from blenheim onwards and now has got to his hottest and his last vanguard could not do it main body we hope kindling all the hotter perhaps may a most willing mind is in these prussians of schwerins fatigue of overmarching has tired the muscles of them but their heartsall witnesses say these and through these their very muscles always fresh again after a few minutes of breathingtime were beyond comparison this day  schwerins prussians as they march up that is as they front and advance upon the austrians are everywhere saluted by caseshot from homoly hill and the batteries northward of homoly but march on this main line of them finely regardless of it or of winterfelds disaster by it the general prussian order this day is by push of bayonet no firing none at any rate till you see the whites of their eyes swift steady as on the paradeground swiftly making up their gaps again the prussians advance on these terms and are now near those fine sleek pasturegrounds unusually green for the season figure the actual stepping upon these fine pasturegroundsmudtanks verdant with mere bearding oatcrop sown there as carpprovender figure the sinking of whole regiments to the knee to the middle some of them the steady march become a wild sprawl through viscous mud mere caseshot singing round you tearing you away at its ease even on those terrible terms the prussians by dams by footpaths sometimes one man abreast sprawl steadily forward trailing their cannon with them only a few regiments in the footpath parts cannot bring their cannon forward rank again when the ground will carry ever forward the caseshot getting ever more murderous no human pen can describe the deadly chaos which ensued in that quarter which lasted in desperate fury issue dubious for above three hours and was the crisis or essential agony of the battle footchargings once the mudtransit was accomplished under storms of grapeshot from homoly hill by and by horsechargings prussian against austrian southward of homoly and sterbohol still farther to the prussian left huge whirlpool of tumultuous deathwrestle every species of spasmodic effort on the one side and the otherking himself present there as i dimly discover feldmarschall browne eminent in the last of his fields and as the old niebelungen has it a murder grim and great going on  schwerins prussians in that preliminary struggle through the mudtanks which winterfeld i think had happened to skirt and avoid were hard bested this so far as i can learn was the worst of the chaos this preliminary part intolerable to human nature this or nearly so even to human nature of the plattteutsch type improved by prussian drill winterfelds repulse we saw schwerins own regiment in it various repulses i perceive there werefresh regiments from our second line storming in thereupon till the poor repulsed people took breath repented and themselves stormed in again say the books fearful tugging swagging and swaying is conceivable in this sterbohol problem and after long scanning i rather judge it was in the wake of that first repulse and not of some other farther on that the veteran schwerin himself got his death no one times it for us but the fact is unforgettable and in the dim whirl of sequences dimly places itself there very certain it is at sight of his own regiment in retreat feldmarschall schwerin seized the colorsas did other generals who are not named that day seizes the colors fiery old man heran meine kinder this way my sons and rides ahead along the straight dam again his sons all turning and with hot repentance following on my children heran five bits of grapeshot deadly each of them at once hit the old man dead he sinks there on his flag and will never fight more heran storm the others with hot tears adjutant von platen takes the flag platen too is instantly shot but another takes it heran on in wild storm of rage and griefin a word they manage to do the work at sterbohol they and the rest first line second line infantry cavalry and even the very horses i suppose fighting inexpressibly conquering one of the worst problems ever seen in war for the austrians too especially their grenadiers there stood to it toughly and fought like menand every grenadier that survived of them as i read afterwards got double pay for life  done that sterbohol workthose footchargings horsechargings that battery of homoly hill and hanging upon that all manner of redoubts and batteries to the rightward and rearwardbut how it was done no pen can describe nor any intellect in clear sequence understand an enormous melee there new prussian battalions charging and ever new irrepressible by caseshot as they successively get up marshal browne too sending for new battalions at doublequick from his left disputing stiffly every inch of his ground till at length hour not given a cannonshot tore away his foot and he had to be carried into prag mortally wounded which probably was a most important circumstance or the most important of all  important too i gradually see was that of the prussian horse of the left wing prussian horse of the extreme left as already noticed had in the mean while fallen in well southward round by certain lakelets about michelup on brownes extreme right furiously charging the austrian horse which stood ranked there in many lines breaking it then again half broken by it but again rallying charging it a second time then a third time both to front and flank amid whirlwinds of dust ziethen busy there not to mention indignant warnery and othersand at length driving it wholly to the winds beyond nussel towards the sazawa country never seen again that day prince karl after brownes deathwound or before i never know came galloping to rally that important right wing of horse prince karl did his very utmost there obtesting praying raging threateningbut to no purpose the zietheners and others so heavy on the rear of themand at last there came a cramp or intolerable twinge of spasm through prince karls own person breast or heart like to take the life of him so that he too had to be carried into prag to the doctors and his cavalry fled at discretion chased by ziethen on friedrichs express order and sent quite over the horizon enough by about halfpast one sterbohol work is thoroughly done and the austrian battle both its commanders gone has heeled fairly downwards and is in an ominous way  the whole of this austrian right wing horse and foot batteries and redoubts which was put en potence or squarewise to the main battle is become a ruin gone to confusion hovers in distracted clouds seeking roads to run away by which it ultimately found done all this surely was and poor browne mortally wounded is being carried off the ground but in what sequence done under what exact vicissitudes of aspect special steps of cause and effect no man can say and only imagination guided by these few data can paint to itself such a chaotic whirlwind of blood dust mud artillerythunder sulphurous rage and human death and victorywho shall pretend to describe it or draw except in the gross the scientific plan of it  for in the mean timei think while the dispute at sterbohol on the extreme of the austrian right wing in joinerssquare form was past the hottest but nobody will give the hourthere has occurred another thing much calculated to settle that and indeed to settle everythingas it did this was a volunteer exploit upon the very elbow or angle of said joinerssquare in the wet grounds between hlaupetin and kyge a good way north of sterbohol volunteer exploit on the part of general mannstein our old russian friend which friedrich a long way off from it blames as a rash fault of mannsteins made good by prince henri and ferdinand of brunswick running up to mend it but which winterfeld and subsequent good judges admit to have been highly salutary and to have finished everything it went if i read right somewhat as follows  in the kygehlaupetin quarter at the corner of that austrian right wing en potence there had much contrary to brownes intention a perceptible gap occurred the corner is open there nothing in it but batteries and swamps the austrian right wing wheeling southward there to form potence and scrambling and marching then and subsequently through such ground at doublequick had gone too far had thinned and lengthened itself as is common in such scrambling and doublequick movement thinks tempelhof and left a little gap at elbow which always rather widened as the stress at sterbohol went on certain enough a gap there is covered only by some halfmoon battery in advance into this general mannstein has been looking wistfully a long time austrian line fallen out at elbow yonder clouted by some battery in advanceand at length cannot help dashing loose on it with his division a man liable to be rash and always too impetuous in battletime  he would have fared ill thinks friedrich had not henri and ferdinand in pain for mannstein some think privately in preconcert with him hastened in to help and done it altogether in a shining way surmounting perilous difficulties not a few hard fighting in that corner partly on the sterbohol terms batteries mudtanks chargings rechargings comrades you have got honor enough kameraden ihr habt ehre genug the second man of you lying dead let us now try said a certain regiment to a certain other in this business archenholtz i 75 tempelhof c prince henri shone especially the gallant little gentleman coming upon one of those mudtanks with battery beyond his men were spreading

tempelhof behind what redoubts and strong points it may have in those parts and then by sure stages tempelhof guesses three or perhaps four as one redoubt after another is torn from the loose grasp of it and the stand made becomes ever weaker and the confusion worseto roll pellmell into prag and hastily close the door behind it the prussians sterbohol people mannsteinhenri people left wing and right are quite across the zisca back on by nussel prince earls headquarter that was and at the moldau brink again when the thing ends ziethens hussars have been at nussel very busy plundering there ever since that final charge and chase from sterbohol plundering and i am ashamed to say mostly drunk your majesty i cannot rank a hundred sober answered ziethen doubtless with a kind of blush when the king applied for them the king himself has got to branik farther up stream part of the austrian foot fled leftwards southwards as their right wing of horse had all done up the moldau about 16000 austrians are distractedly on flight that way towards the sazawa country to unite with daun as the now advisable thing near 40000 of them are getting crammed into prag in spite of prince karl now recovered of his cramp and risen to the frantic pitch who vainly struggles at the gate against such inrush and had even got through the gate conjuring and commanding but was himself swum in again by those panic torrents of ebbtide  rallying within he again attempted twice over at two different points to get out and up the moldau with his broken people but the prussians nusselbranik way were awake to him no retreat up the moldau for you austrian gentlemen they tried by another gate on the other side of the river but keith was awake too in again ye austrian gentlemen closed gates here too what else browne from his bed of pain deathbed as it proved was for a much more determined outrush in the dead of night rank deliberately adjust yourselves storm out one and all and cut your way night favoring that was brownes last counsel but that also was not taken a really noble browne say all judges died here in about six weeksand got away from kriegshofraths and prince karls and the stupidity of neighbors and the other ills that flesh is heir to altogether  at branik the victorious king had one great disappointment prince moritz of dessau who should have been here long hours ago with keiths right wing a fresh 15000 to fall upon the enemys rearno moritz visible not even now when the business is to chase how is this ill luck your majesty moritzs pontoon bridge would not reach across when he tried it that is certain just three poor pontoons wanting rumor saysthree or more spoiled i am told in some narrow road some shortcut which moritz had commanded for them and now they are not and it is as if three hundred had been spoiled moritz would he die for it cannot get his bridge to reach his fresh 15000 stand futile there not even seidlitz with his light horse could really swim across though he tried hard and is fabled to have done so beware of shortcuts my prince your father that is gone what would he say of you here it was the worst mistake prince moritz ever made the austrian army might have been annihilated say judges of a sanguine temper had moritz been ready at his hour to fall on from rearwardand where had their retreat been as it is the austrian army is not annihilated only bottled into prag and will need sieging the brightest triumph has a bar of black in it and might always have been brighter here is a flying note which i will subjoin  friedrichs dispositions for the battle this day are allowed to have been masterly but there was one signal fault thinks retzow that he did not as schwerin counselled wait till the morrow fault which brought many in the train of it that of his tired soldiers says retzow being only a first item and small in comparison had he waited till the morrow those fishponds of sterbohol examined in the interim need not have been mistaken for green meadows prince moritz with his 15000 would have been a fact instead of a false hope the king might have done his marching down upon sterbohol in the nighttime and been ready for the austrians flank or even rear at daybreak the king mightin reality this fault seems to have been considerable to have made the victory far more costly to him and far less complete no doubt he had his reasons for making haste daun advancing pragward with 30000 was within three marches of him general beck dauns vanguard with a 10000 of irregulars did a kind of feat at brandeis on the prussian post there our saxons deserting to him in the heat of action this very day may 6th and might if lucky have taken part at ziscaberg next day and besides these solid reasons there was perhaps another retzow who is secretly of the oppositionparty and well worth hearing knows personally a curious thing he says  being then in march or april weeks before we left saxony employed to translate the plan of operations into french for marshal keiths use who did not understand german i well know that it contained the following three main objects 1 all regiments cantoning in silesia as well as saxony march for bohemia on one and the same day 2 whole army arrives at prag may 4th schwerin was a day later and got scolded in consequence if the enemy stand he is attacked may 6th and beaten 3 so soon as prag is got schwerin with the gross of the army pushes into mahren and the heart of austria itself king hastens with 40000 to help of the allied armyroyal highness of cumberlands who will much need it by that time retzow i 84 n  here is a very curious fact and consideration that the king had so prophesied and preordained may 4th four columns arrive at prag may 6th attack the austrians beat themand now wished to keep his word this is an aerial reason which i can suspect to have had its weight among others there were twirls of that kind in friedrich intricate weak places knots in the sound straightfibred mind he had as in whose mind are they notwhich now and then cost him dear the anecdotebooks say he was very ill of body that day may 6th and called for something of drug nature and swallowed it drug not named after getting on horseback the evening anecdote is prettier how in the rushing about austrians now flying he got eye on brother henri clayey to a degree and sat down with him in the blessed sunset for a minute or two and bewailed his sad losses of schwerin and others  certain it is the victory was bought by hard fighting and but for the quality of his troops had not been there but the bravery of the prussians was exemplary and covered all mistakes that were made nobler fire when did it burn in any army more perfect soldiers i have not read of plattteutsch firewhich i liken to anthracite in contradistinction to gaelic blaze of kindled strawis thrice noble when by strict stern discipline you are above it withal and wield your fireelement as jove his thunder by rule otherwise it is but halfadmirable turkjanissaries have it otherwise and it comes to comparatively little  this is the famed battle of prag fought may 6th 1757 which sounded through all the worldand used to deafen us in drawingrooms within mans memory results of it were on the prussian side killed wounded and missing 12500 men on the austrian 13000 prisoners included with many flags cannon tents much wargear gone the wrong roadand a very great humiliation and dispiritment though they had fought well no longer the old austrians by any means as friedrich sees but have iron ramrods all manner of prussian improvements and are learning to march as he once says with surprise not quite pleasant  friedrich gives the cipher of loss on both sides much higher this battle says he which began towards nine in the morning and lasted chase included till eight at night was one of the bloodiest of the age the enemy lost 24000 men of whom were 5000 prisoners the prussian loss amounted to 18000 fighting menwithout counting marshal schwerin who alone was worth above 10000 this day saw the pillars of the prussian infantry cut down says he mournfully seeming almost to think the laurels of victory were purchased too dear his account of the battle as if it had been a painful object rather avoided in his afterthoughts is unusually indistinctand helps us little in the extreme confusion that reigns otherwise both in the thing itself and in the reporters of the thing here is a word from winterfeld some private letter two days after which is well worth reading for those who would understand this battle  the enemy had his left wing leaning on the city close by the moldau at nussel and stretched with his right wing across the high hill of zisca to the village of lieben so he had stood looking into prag but faced about on hearing that friedrich was across the river having before him those terrible defiles die terriblen defilees horseshoe of the moldau as we call it and the village of prossik which was crammed with pandours it was about halfpast six in the morning when our schwerin army myself part of it at this time joined with the twenty battalions and twenty squadrons which the king had brought across to unite with us and which formed our right wing of battle that day our left wing were schweriners sterbohol and the fighting done by schweriners after their long march the king was at once determined to attack the enemy as also were schwerin say nothing of the arguing and your humble servant meine wenigkeit but the first thing was to find a hole whereby to get at him  this too was selected and decided on my proposal being found good and took effect in manner following we schweriners had marched off leftwise foremost and we now without halt continued marching so with the left wing of horse which had the van tete and moved on keeping the road for hlaupetin and ever thence onwards along for kyge round the ponds of unterpodschernitz without needing to pass these and so as to get them in our rear  the enemy who at first had expected nothing bad and never supposed that we would attack him at once flagrante delicto and least of all in this point and did not believe it possible as we should have to wade breastdeep in part through the ditches and drag our cannonwas at first quite tranquil but as he began to perceive our real design in which they say prince karl was the first to open marshal brownes eyes he drew his whole cavalry over towards us as fast as it could be done and stretched them out as right wing to complete which his grenadiers and hungarian regulars of foot ranked themselves as they got up makes his potence haken or joinerssquare outmost end of it horse  the enemys intention was to hold with the right wing of his infantry on the farmstead which they call sterbaholy sterbohol a very dirty farmstead at this day i however had the good luck plunging on head foremost with six battalions of our left wing and two of the flank to get to it before him although our second line was not yet come forward yet as the battalions of the first were tolerably well together i decided with general fouquet who had charge of the flank to begin at once and that the enemy might not have time to post himself still better i pushed forward quick step out of the farmstead of sterbohol to meet himso fast that even our cannon had not time to follow he did accordingly begin to waver and i could observe that his people here on this wing were making rightabout  meanwhile his fire of caseshot opened from homoly hill on our left and we were still pushing onmight now be about two hundred steps from the enemys line when i had the misfortune at the head of regiment schwerin to get wounded and swooning away vor tod fell from my horse to the ground awakening after some minutes and raising my head to look about i found nobody of our people now here beside or round me but all were already behind in full flood of retreat hoch anschlagen the enemys grenadiers were perhaps eighty paces from me but had halted and had not the confidence to follow us i struggled to my feet as fast as for weakness i possibly could and got up to our confused mass confusen klumpenexact place where but could not by entreaties or by threats persuade a single man of them to turn his face on the enemy much less to halt and try again  in this embarrassment the deceased feldmarschall found me and noticed that the blood was flowing streamwise from my neck as i was on foot and none of my people now near he bade give me his led horse which he still had and sent me home for surgery winterfeld handsomely effacing himself when no longer good for anything hurries on to the catastrophe leaving us to guess that he was not an eyewitness fartherbade give me the led horse which he still had and as if that had happened directly after which surely it did not and snatched the flag from captain rohr who had taken it up to make the bursche turn and rode forward with it himself but before he could succeed in the attempt this excellent man almost in a minute was hit with five caseshot balls and fell dead on the ground as also his brave adjutant von platen was so wounded that he died next day  during this confusion and repulse by which as already mentioned the enemy had not the heart to profit not only was our second line come on but those of the first who had not suffered went vigorously frisch at the enemyand in course of time perhaps two hours yet and by dint of effort we did manage sterbohol and its batterieslike as still in one sentence and without the least punctuation winterfeld being little of a grammarian and in haste for the close like as prince henris royal highness with our right wing mannstein and he without waiting for order attacked so prompt and with such fermote in that elbowhole far north of us that everywhere the enemys line began to give way and instead of continuing as line sought corpswise to gain the heights and there post itself and as without winning said heights we could not win the battle we had to storm them all one after the other and this it was that cost us the best most and bravest people  the late colonel von goltz if we glance back to sterbohol itself who with the regiment fouquet was advancing righthand of schwerin regiment and your servant had likewise got quite close to the enemy and had he not at the very instant when he was levelling bayonets been shot down i think that he with myself and the schwerin regiment would have got inand perhaps have there done the job special and general with much less expense and sooner preuss ii 4547 in winterfelds hand dated camp at prag 8th may 1757 addressed to one knows not whom first printed by preuss  this is what we get from winterfeld a rugged not much grammatical man but as i can perceive with excellent eyes in his head and interior talent for twenty grammatical people had that been his line these faithfully rendered here without change but of pointing are the only words i ever saw of his to my regretwhich surely the prussian dryasdust might still amend a littlein respect of so distinguished a person and chosen peer of friedrichs this his brief theory of prag battle if intensely read i find to be of a piece with his practice there  schwerin was much lamented in the army and has been duly honored ever since his body lies in schwerinsburg at home far away his monument finale of a series of monuments stands now under special guardianship near sterbohol on the spot where he fell a late tourist says  at first there was a monument of wood tree planted i will hope which is now all gone round this kaiser joseph ii once in the year 1776 holding some review there made his grenadier battalions and artilleries form circle fronting the sky all round and give three volleys of great arms and small kaiser in the centre doffing hat at each volley in honor of the hero which was thought a very pretty thing on the kaisers part in 1824 the tree i suppose being gone to a stump certain subscribing prussian officers had it rooted out and a modest pyramid of redveined marble built in its room which latter the then king of prussia friedrich wilhelm iii determined to improve upon and so in 1839 built a second pyramid close by bigger finer and of prussian iron this onepurchasing also from the austrian government a rood or two of ground for site and appointing some perpetual peculium or increase of pension to an austrian veteran of merit for taking charge there all which perfectly in order is in its place at this day the actual austrian pensioner of merit is a loudvoiced hardfaced very limited but honest little fellow who has worked a little polygon ditch and miniature hedge round the two monuments keeps his own cottage little garden and self respectably clean and leads stoically a lone lifeno company i should think but the sterbohol hinds who probably are czechs and cannot speak to him he was once of the regiment hohenlohe suffers somewhat from cold in the wintertime in those upland parts the cords of wood allowed him being limited but complains of nothing else two english names were in his album a military two and no more ehret den held honor the hero we said to him at parting dont i answered he glancing at his muddy bare legs and little spade with which he had been working in the polygon ditch when we arrived i could wish him an additional klafter holz cord more of firewood now and then in the cold months  sterbohol farmstead has been new built in mans memory

what friedrichs emotions after the battle of prag were we do not much know they are not inconceivable if we read his situation well but in the way of speech there is as usual next to nothing here are two stray utterances worth gathering from a man so uncommunicative in that form  friedrich a month before prag from lockwitz 25th march to princess amelia at berlinmy dearest sister i give you a thousand thanks for the hints you have got me from dr eller on the illness of our dear mother thricewelcome this and reassures me alas not on good basis against a misfortune which i should have considered very great for me  as to us and our posture of affairs political and militaryplace yourself i conjure you above every event think of our country and remember that ones first duty is to defend it if you learn that a misfortune happens to one of us ask did he die fighting and if yes give thanks to god victory or else death there is nothing else for us one or the other we must have all the world here is of that temper what you would everybody sacrifice his life for the state and you would not have your brothers give the example ah my dear sister at this crisis there is no room for bargaining either at the summit of glorious success or else abolished altogether this campaign now coming is like that of pharsalia for rome or that of leuctra for the greeksa campaign we verily shall have to win or go to wreck upon oeuvres de frederic xxvii i 391  friederich shortly after prag to his mother letter still extant in autograph without datemy brothers and i are still well the whole campaign runs risk of being lost to the austrians and i find myself free with 150000 men add to this that we are masters of a kingdom bohemia here which is obliged to furnish us with troops and money the austrians are dispersed like straw before the wind i will send a part of my troops to compliment messieurs the french and am going if i once had prag to pursue the austrians with the rest of my army ib xxvi 75  friedrich who keeps his emotions generally to himself does not as will be seen remain quite silent to us throughout this great year but by accident has left us some rather impressive gleanings in that kindand certainly in no year could such accident have been luckier to us this of 1757 being in several respects the greatest of his life from nearly the topmost heights down to the lowest deeps his fortunes oscillated this year and probably of all the sons of adam nobodys outlooks and reflections had in them successive and simultaneous more gigantic forms of fear and of hope he

condescended to make peace with a neighbor of such quality and consent to his really modest desire of being let alone possible all thisthink retzow and others see retzow i 100108 c  but the king had not waited till tomorrow no persuasion could make him wait and it is idle speculating on the small turns which here as everywhere can produce such deflections of course  beyond question prag is not captured and may as now garrisoned require a great deal of capturingand perhaps it is but a peak this high dominancy of friedrichs not a solid tableland till much more have been done friedrich has nothing of the gascon but there may well be conceivable at this time a certain glow of internal pride like that of phoebus amid the piled tempestslike that of the one man prevailing if but for a short season against the devil and all men i have made good my bit of resolution so far here are the austrians beaten at the set day and prag summoned to surrender as per program  intrinsically prag is not a strong city we have seen it taken in few days in one nightand again as in belleisles time we have seen it making tough defence for a series of weeks it depends on the garrison what extent of garrison the circuit of it being so immense and what height of humor there are now 46000 men caged in it known to have considerable magazines and friedrich aware that it will cost trouble bends all his strength upon it and from his two camps ziscaberg weissenberg due bridges uniting keith and he batter it violently aiming chiefly at the magazines which are not all bombproof and hope they may succeed before it is too late  the vienna people are in the depths of amazement and discouragement almost of terror had it not been for a few or especially for one high heart among them feldmarschall

colonel mayer with his freecorps party makes a visit of didactic nature to the reich  friedrich as we saw on entering bohmen had shot off a light detachment under colonel mayer southward to seize any austrian magazines there were especially one big magazine at pilsenwhich mayer has handsomely done may 2d pilsen a bigger magazine than jungbunzlau even after which mayer is now off westward into the oberpfalz into the nurnberg countries to teach the reich a small lesson since they will not listen to plotho prag battle as happens had already much chilled the ardor of the reich mayer has two freecorps his own and another about 1300 of foot to which are added a 200 of hussars they have 5 cannon carry otherwise a minimum of baggage are swift wild fellows sharp of stroke and do for the time prove didactic to the reich bringing home to its very bosom the late great lesson of the ziscaberg in an applied form mayer made a pretty course of it into the oberpfalz countries scattering the poor

and given at schwabach farther up the regnitz river they took quarters no exemption made clergy and laity alike getting soldiers billeted meat and drink had to be given them as also 100 carolines guineas and better and twenty new uniforms upon which next day they marched to zirndorf and the reichsgraf pucklers mansion the schloss of farrenbach there mayer took quarter in the schloss itself

farrenbach the mayer people circulated upon all the neighboring lordships at wilhelmsdorf the reichsfurst von hohenlohe a too busy antiprussian had the worst brunt to bear the adjacent baireuth lands

commissarius and eight common men did get picked up on baireuth ground and this or the other anspach official anspach being disaffected too busy on the wrong side found himself suddenly prisoner of war but was given up at wilhelminas gracious request on bamberg he was sharp as flint and had to be the bambergers reinforced at last by circlemilitias kreistruppen in quantity being called out in mass against him and at vach an actual passage of fight had occurred  of the affair at vach pretty little drawnbattle mostly an affair of art mayer versus kreistroops to the amount of 6000 with twelve cannon or some say twentyfour which they couldnt handle and how mayer cunningly took a position unassailable burnt bridges of the regnitz river and plying his five cannon against these ardent awkward

down at full length we can say nothing pauli iii 159 c who gives mayers own letter and others upon vach and will add only that having girt himself and made his packages mayer left the hill of culmbach

the stoutest of menfancy what it will be in like case and how the actingapparatuses and affairs generally will go with a poor hysterical newcastle now when his common sense is fatally withdrawn the poor man has no resource but to shuffle about in aimless perpetual fidget endeavoring vainly to say yes and no to all questions foreign and domestic that may rise whereby in the affairs of england there has as it were universal stvituss dance supervened at an important crisis and the preparations for america and for a downright lifeanddeath wrestle with france on the jenkinssear question are quite in a bad way in an ominously bad why cannot we draw a veil over these things  2 pitt and the hour of tide the fidgetings and shufflings the subtleties inane trickeries and futile hitherings and thitherings of newcastle may be imagined a man not incapable of trick but anxious to be well with everybody and to answer yes and no to almost everythingand not a little puzzled poor soul to get through in that impossible way such a paralysis of wriggling imbecility fallen over england in this great crisis of its fortunes as is still painful to contemplate and indeed it has been mostly shaken out of mind by the modern englishman who tries to laugh at it instead of weeping and considering which would better beseem pitt speaks with a tragical vivacity in all ingenious dialects lively though serious and with a depth of sad conviction which is apt to be slurred over and missed altogether by a modern reader speaks as if this brave english nation were about ended little or no hope left for it here a gleam of possibility and there a gleam which soon vanishes again in the fatal murk of impotencies donothingisms very sad to the heart of pitt a once brave nation arrived at its critical point and doomed to higgle and puddle there till it drown in the gutters considerably tragical to pitt who is lively ingenious and though not quitting the parliamentary tone for the hebrewprophetic far more serious than the modern reader thinks  in walpoles book memoirs of the last ten years of george ii there is the liveliest picture of this dismal parliamentary hellbrothsuch a mother of dead dogs as one has seldom looked into for the hour is great and the honorable gentlemen i must say are small the hour little as you dream of it my honorable friends is pregnant with questions that are immense wide continents long epochs and aeons hang on this poor jargoning of yours the eternal destinies are asking their muchfavored nation will you can youmuchfavored nation is answering in that manner astonished at its own stupidity and taking refuge in laughter the eternal destinies are very patient with some nations and can disregard their follies for a long while and have their cromwell have their pitt or what else is essential ready for the poor nation in a grandly silent way  certain it isthough how could poor newcastle know it at allhere is again the hour of tide for england tide is full again has been flowing long hundreds of years and is full certain too that time and tide wait on no man or nation in a dialect different from cromwells or pitts but with a sense true to theirs i call it the eternal destinies knocking at englands door again are you ready for the crisis birthpoint of long ages to you which is now come greater question had not been for centuries past none to be named with it since that high spiritual question truly a much higher and which was in fact the parent of this and of all of high and great that lay ahead which england and oliver cromwell were there to answer will you hold by consecrated formulas then you english and expect salvation from traditions of the elders or are you for divine realities as the one sacred and indispensable thing which they did answer in what way we know truly the highest question which if a nation can answer well it will grow in this world and may come to be considerable and to have many high questions to answerthis of pitts for example and the answers given do always extend through coming ages and do always bear harvests accursed or else blessed according as the answers were a thing awfully true if you have eye for ita thing to make honorable gentlemen serious even in the age of percussioncaps no my friend newcastleisms impious poltrooneries in a nation do not dieneither thank god do cromwellisms and pious heroisms but are alive for the poor nation even in its somnambulancies in its stupidest dreams for nations have their somnambulancies and at any rate the questions put to nations in different ages vary much not in any age or turningpoint in history had england answered the destinies in such a dialect as now under its newcastle and national palaver  3 of walpole as recording angel walpoles george the second is a book of far more worth than is commonly ascribed to it almost the one original english book yet written on those timeswhich by the accident of pitt are still memorable to us but for walpoleburning like a small steady light there shining faithfully if stingily on the evil and the goodthat sordid muddle of the pelham parliaments which chanced to be the element of things now recognizable enough as great would be forever unintelligible he is unusually accurate punctual lucid an irrefragable authority on english points and if in regard to foreign he cannot be called an understanding witness he has read the best documents accessible has conversed with select ambassadors mitchell and the like as we can guess and has informed himself to a degree far beyond most of his contemporaries in regard to pitts speeches in particular his brief jottings done rapidly while the matter was still shining to him are the only reports that have the least human resemblance we may thank walpole that pitt is not dumb to us as well as dark very curious little scratchings and etchings those of walpole frugal swift but punctual and exact hasty penandink outlines at first view all barren bald as an invoice seemingly but which yield you after long study there and elsewhere a conceivable notion of what and how excellent these pitt speeches may have been airy winged like arrowflights of phoebus apollo very superlative speeches indeed walpoles book is carefully printedfew errors in it like that chapeau for chasot which readers rememberbut in respect to editing may be characterized as still wanting an editor a book unedited little but lazy ignorance of a very hopeless type thick contented darkness traceable throughout in the marginal part no attempt at an index or at any of the natural helps to a reader now at such distance from it nay till you have at least marked on the top of each page what month and year it actually is the book cannot be read at allexcept by an idle creature doing worse than nothing under the name of reading  4 pitts speeches foreshadowing what it is a kind of epoch in your studies of modern english history when you get to understand of pitts speeches that they are not parliamentary eloquences but things which with his whole soul he means and is intent to do this surprising circumstance when at last become undeniable makes on the sudden an immense difference for the speeches and you speeches are not a thing of high moment to this editor it is the thing spoken and how far the speaker means to do it that this editor inquires for too many speeches there are which he hears admired all round and has privately to entertain a very horrid notion of speeches the finest in quality were quality really fine conceivable in such case which want a corresponding fineness of source and intention corresponding nobleness of purport conviction tendency these if we will reflect are frightful instead of beautiful yesand always the frightfuler the finer they are and the faster and farther they go sowing themselves in the dim vacancy of mens minds for speeches like all human things though the fact is now little remembered do always rank themselves as forever blessed or as forever unblessed sheep or goats on the right hand of the final judge or else on the left there are speeches which can be called true and again speeches which are not trueheavens only think what these latter are sacked wind which you are intended to sowthat you may reap the whirlwind after long reading i find chathams speeches to be what he pretends they are true and worth speaking then and there noble indeed i can call them with you the highly noble foreshadow necessary preface and accompaniment of actions which are still nobler a very singular phenomenon within those walls or without  pitt though nobly eloquent is a man of action not of speech an authentically royal kind of man and if there were a plutarch in these times with a good deal of leisure on his hands he might run a parallel between friedrich and chatham two radiant kings very shining men of action both both of them hard bested as the case often is for your born king will generally have if not all europe against him at least pretty much all the universe chathams course to kingship was not straight or smoothas friedrich too had his wellnigh fatal difficulties on the road again says the plutarch they are very brave men both and of a clearness and veracity peculiar among their contemporaries in chatham too there is something of the flash of steel a very sharpcutting penetrative rapid individual he too and shaped for action first of all though he has to talk so much in the world fastidious proud no king could be prouder though his element is that of freesenate and democracy and he has a beautiful poetic delicacy withal great tenderness in him playfulness grace in all ways an airy as well as a solid loftiness of mind not born a kingalas no not officially so only naturally so has his kingdom to seek the conquering of silesia the conquering of the pelham parliamentsbut we will shut up the plutarch with time on his hands  pitts speeches as i spell them from walpole and the other faint tracings left are full of genius in the vocal kind far beyond any speeches delivered in parliament serious always and the very truth such as he has it but going in many dialects and modes full of airy flashings twinkles and coruscations sport as of sheetlightning glancing about the bolt lying under the horizon bolt hidden as is fit under such a horizon as he had a singularly radiant man could have been a poet too in some small measure had he gone on that line there are many touches of genius comic tragic lyric something of humor even to be read in those shadows of speeches taken down for us by walpole  in one word pitt shining like a gleam of sharp steel in that murk of contemptibilities is carefully steering his way towards kingship over it tragical it is especially in pitts case first and last to see a royal man or born king wading towards his throne in such an element but alas the born king even when he tries which i take to be the rarer case so seldom can arrive there at allsinful epochs there are when heavens curse has been spoken and it is that awful being the born shamking that arrives pitt however does it yes and the more we study pitt the more we shall find he does it in a peculiarly high manful and honorable as well as dexterous manner and that english history has a right to call him the acme and highest man of constitutional parliaments the like of whom was not in any parliament called constitutional nor will again be  well probably enough too probably but what it more concerns us to remember here is the fact that in these dismal shufflings which have been pittin spite of royal dislikes and newcastle peddlings and chicanerieshas been actually in office in the due topmost place the poor english nation ardently demanding him in what ways it could been in officeand is actually out again in spite of the nation was without real power in the royal councils though of noble promise and planting himself down herolike evidently bent on work and on ending that unutterable stvitussdance that had gone so high all round him without real power we say and has had no permanency came in 11th19th november 1756

displace pitt down you i am the man said royal highness and went to the weser countries on those terms  would the reader wish to see in summary what pitts offices have been since he entered on this career about thirty years ago here from our historian is the list of them in order of time stages of pitts course he calls it  1 december 1734 comes into parliament age now twentysix cornet in the blues as well being poor and in absolute need of some career that will suit april 1736 makes his first speechprince frederick the subjectwho was much used as batteringram by the opposition whom perhaps pitt admired for his madrigals for his literary patronizings and favor to the westwickham set speech full of airy lightning was much admired followed by many with the lightning getting denser and denser always on the opposition side once on the jenkinssear question as we saw when the gazetteer editor spelt him mr pitts so that majesty was very angry sulky public much applausive and walpole was heard to say we must muzzle in some way that terrible cornet of horsebut could not on trial this mans price as would seem being awfully high augustoctober 1744 sarah duchess of marlborough bequeathed him 10000 pounds as commissariat equipment in this his campaign against the mudgods thackeray i 138glory to the old heroine for so doing which lifted pitt out of the cornetcy or horseguards

americasuch preparations as were never seen before take only one instance let one be enough  by the london gazette well on in february 1756 we learn that lord loudon a military gentleman of small faculty but of good connections has been nominated to command the forces in america and then more obscurely some days after that another has been nominatedone of them ought certainly to make haste out if he could the french by account have 25000 men in those countries with real officers to lead them haste out however is not what this lord loudon or his rival can make in march we learn that lord loudon has been again nominated in an improved manner this timeand still does not look like going again nominated why again alas reader there have been hysterical fidgetings in a high quarter internal shiftings and shufflings contradictions new proposals one knows not what gentlemans magazine  for 1756 pp 92 150 359 450 one asks only how is the business ever to be done if you cannot even settle what imbecile is to go and try it  seldom had country more need of a commander than america now america itself is of willing mind and surely has resources in such a cause but is full of anarchies as well the different states and sections of it with their discrepant legislatures their halfdrilled militias pulling each a different way there is as in the poor mother country little result except of the stvitus kind in some legislatures are anarchic quakers who think it unpermissible to fight with those hectoring french and their tail of scalping indians and that the method of love ought to be tried with them what is to become of those poor people if not even a lord loudon can get out  the result was lord loudon had not in his own poor person come to hand in america till august 1756 season now done and could only write home all is st vitus out here must have reinforcement of 10000 men yes answers pitt who is now in office you shall have them and we will take cape breton please heavenbut was thrown out and by the wrigglings that ensued nothing of the 10000 reached lord loudon till season 1757 too was done nor did they then stead his lordship much then or afterwards who never took cape breton nor was like doing itbut wriggled to and fro a good deal and revolved on his axis according to pattern given and set what chiefly induces us to name him here his not reverent enough subordinate

otherwise and elsewhere of which we must now give some account brief as may be especially in regard to the preliminary or marching part  daun whose light troops plundered brandeis almost within wind

whether he has not gone his ways altogether but proposes to ascertain by break of day  by break of day friedrich starts having cleared off certain pandour swarms visible in places of difficulty who go

seeking horse and rider are alike satisfied on that latter point silently ready for the task they have and deaf on questions that are bottomless  at this hostelry of novomiesto not of slatislunz or goldensun at all which is a sun fallen dismally eclipsed in other ways the inn of slatislunz was burnt about twenty years ago nothing of it but the stone walls now dates from friedrichs time it is a biggish solidlooking house of two stories whether ever of three i could not learn stands pleasantly at the crown of a long rise from kolinand inwardly alas in our day offers little but bad smells and negative quantities only the groundfloor is now inhabited from the front your view northward nimburg way across the elbe valley is fertile widewaving pretty but rearward upstairshaving with difficulty got permissionyou find bare balks tattered feathers several hundredweight of pigeons dung and no outlook at all except into walls of officehouses and the overhanging brow of heightsfatal clearly to any view of daun even from a third story tourists note 1858tempelhof ubi supra seems to have known the right place not retzow or almost anybody since and indeed the question except for expressly military people is of no moment friedrich halted for three hours and more saw daun developing himself into new order of battle every part of his position visible considered with his whole might what was to be tried upon himand about noon having made up his mind called his generals in sight of the phenomenon itself there to give them their various orders and injunctions in regard to the same the plan of fight which was thought then and is still thought by everybody an excellent oneresting on the oblique order of attack friedrichs favorite modewas if the reader will take his map conceivable as follows  daun has by this time deployed himself in three lines or two lines and a reserve on the highlying champaign south of the planiankolin great road south say a mile and over the crests of the rising ground or kamhayek ridge so that from the great road you can see nothing of him his line swaying here and there a little to take advantage of its ground extends nearly five miles from east to west pointing towards planian side the left wing of it from planian eastward the way friedrich has marched dauns left wing may be four miles distant on the other side dauns right wingmain line always pretty parallel to the highway and pointing rather southward of kolinreaches to the small hamlet of krzeczhorz which is two miles off kolin in front of his centre is a village called chotzemitz from which for a while in those months the battle gets its name battle of chotzemitz by dauns christening in front of him to right or to left of chotzemitz are some four or even six other villages dim rustic hamlets invisible from the high road every village of which daun has well beset with batteries with good infantry not to speak of croat parties hovering about or dismounted pandours squatted in the corn that easternmost village of his is spelt krzeczhorz unpronounceable to mankind a dirty little place in and round which the battle had its hinge or cardinal point the others as abstruse of spelling all but equally impossible to the human organs we will forbear to name except in case of necessity half a mile behind krzeczhorz let us write it kreczor for the future what can we do is a thin little oakwood bushes mainly but with sparse trees too which is now quite stubbed out though it was then important enough and played a great part in the result of this days work radowesnitz a pronounceable little village half a mile farther or southward of the oakbush is beyond the extremity of dauns position low down on a marshy little brook which oozes through lakes and swamps towards kolin in the northerly direction  most or all of these villages are on little brooks natural thirst so leading them always some little runlet of water not so swampy when there is any fall for it in general lively when it gets over the ridge and becomes visible from this highway and it is curious to see what a considerable dell or green ascending chasm this little thread of water working at all moments for thousands of years has hollowed out for itself in the sloping ground making a great military obstacle if you are mounting to attack there poor czech hamlets all of them dirty dark malodorous ignorant abhorrent of german speechin what nook those inarticulate inhabitants diving underground at a great rate this morning have hidden themselves today i know not the country consists of knolls and slopes with swamps intermediate rises higher on the planian side but except the top of that kamhayek ridge on the planian side and friedrichsberg on the kolin side there is nothing that you could think of calling a hill though many books and even friedrichs book rashly say otherwise friedrichsberg now so called is on the north side of the highway half a mile northeastward of slatislunz the malodorous inn a conical height of perhaps a hundred and fifty feet rises rather suddenly from the stillsloping ground checking the slope there on which the austrian populations have built some memorial lately notable to tourists here friedrich stood during the battle say they and the prussians had a battery there which remains uncertain to me at least the battery part of it that friedrich himself was there now and then can be believed but not that he kept standing there for long together friedrichsberg does command some view of the kreczor scene which at times was cardinal at others not but friedrich did not stand anywhere oftenest in the thick of the fire say those who saw  friedrich from his inn near planian seeing how daun deploys himself considers him impregnable on the left wing impregnable too in front not so on the kreczor side right flank and rear but capable of being rolled together if well struck at there thither therefore that is his vulnerable point march along his front quietly parallel in due order of battle till we can bend round and plunge in upon that the van which consists of ziethens horse and hulsens infantry van having faced to right at the proper moment and so become left wing will attack kreczor probably carry it each division following will in like manner face to right when it arrives there and fall on in regular succession in support of hulsen at hulsens right flank if hulsen be found prospering our right wing is to refuse itself and be as a reserveno fighting on the road you others but steady towards hulsen in continual succession all you no facing round no fighting anywhere till we get thithermarch  the word is given about 2 pm and all on the instant is in motion rolls steadily eastward in two columns which will become first line and second one along the highway the second at due distance leftward on the green ground no hedge or other obstacle obstructing in that part of the world dauns batteries on the right spit at them in passing to no purpose sputters of pandour musketry from coverts there may be prussians finely disregarding pass along flowing tidelike towards their goal and place of choice an impressive phenomenon in the sunny afternoon with daun expectant of them and the czech populations well hidden underground  ziethen vanmost of all finds nadasti and his austrian squadrons drawn across the highway hitherward of the kreczor latitude ziethen dashes on nadasti tumbles his squadrons and him away clears the road and kreczor neighborhood of nadasti drives him quite into the hollow of radowesnitz where he stood inactive for the rest of the day hulsen now at the level of kreczor in the latitude of kreczor as we phrased it halts faces to right stiffly presses up opens his cannonthunders his bayonetcharges and platoonfires upon kreczor stiffly pressing up in spite of the violent counterthunders hulsen does manage kreczor without very much delay completely enough and like a workman takes the battery two batteries overturns the infantryin a word has seized kreczor and as new tenant swept the old and their litter quite out of all which ziethen has now the chase and by no means will neglect that duty ziethen driving the rout before him has driven it in some minutes past the little oakwood above mentioned and or rather butwhat is much to be notedis there taken in flank with cannonshot and musketry daun having put batteries and croat parties in the oakwood and is forced to draw bridle and get out of range again  hulsen advancing towards this little oakwood is surprised to discover not the wood alone but a strong austrian force foot and horse to rear of itsuch had been dauns and nadastis precaution on view of those friedrich phenomena flowing on from planian guessed to be hitherward at sight of which wood and footparty hulsen no new battalion having yet arrived to second him pauses merely cannonading from the distance till new battalions shall arrive unhappily they did not arrive or not in due quantity at the set timefor what reason by what strange mistake men still ask themselves probably by more mistakes than one enough hulsen struggling here all day with reinforcements never adequate did take the wood and then lose it did take and lose this and thatbut was unable to make more of it than keep his ground thereabouts a resolute man says retzow but without invention of his own or head to mend the mistakes of others in and about kreczor hulsen did maintain himself with more and more tenacity till the general avalanche fruit of sad mistakes swept him quite spasmodically struggling at that period off to the edge of it and all the others clean away mistakes have been to rightwards one or even two the fruit of which small at first suffices to turn the balance and ends in an avalanche or precipitous descent of ruin on the prussian side  one mistake there was miles westward on the right wing due to mannstein our too impetuous russian friend mannstein well to right while marching forward according to order has croat musketry spitting upon him from amid the high corn to an inconvenient extent such was the common lot which others had borne and disregarded perhaps it was beyond the average on mannstein or mannsteins patience was less infinite any way it provoked mannstein to boil over and in an evil moment he said extinguish me that croat canaille then regiment bornstedt faced to right accordingly took to extinguishing the croat canaille which of course fled at once or squatted closer but came back with reinforcements drew mannstein deeper in fatally delayed bornstedt and proved widely ruinous for now he stopped the way to those following him regiments marching on to rear of mannstein see mannstein halted volleying with the austrians ask themselves how is there new order come attack to be in this point and successively fall on to support mannstein as the one clear point in such dubiety so that the whole right wing from regiment bornstedt westward is storming up the difficult steeps in hot conflict with the austrians there where success against them had been judged impracticableand there is now no reserve force anywhere to be applied to in emergency for hulsens behoof or anothers and the plan of battle from mannstein westward has been fatally overturned poor mannstein there is no doubt committed this error being too fiery a man surely to him it was no luxury and he paid the smart for it in skin and soul badly wounded in this business nay in direct sequel not many weeks after killed by it as we shall see  to mannsteins mistake friedrich himself in his account of kolin mainly imputes the disaster that followed and such then and afterwards was the universal judgment in military circles loading the memory of too impetuous mannstein with the whole see retzow i 135 templehof i 214 220 much talk there was in prussian military circles but there must also have been an admirable silence on the part of some to three persons it was known that another strange incident had happened far ahead far eastward of mannsteins position incident which did not by any means tend to alleviate which could only strengthen and widen the evil results of mannstein and which might have lifted part of the load from mannsteins memory not till the present century after the lapse of almost fifty years was this secret slowly dug out of silence and submitted to modern curiosity  the incident is thisnever whispered of for near fifty years so silent were the three and endlessly tossed about since that the sense of it not understood till almost now see retzow i 126 berenhorst c cthen finally kutzen pp 99 217 the three parties were king friedrich moritz of dessau leading on the centre here moritzs young nephew franz heir of dessau a brisk lad of seventeen learning war here as aidedecamp to moritz the exact spot is not known to meprobably the ground near that inn of slatislunz or goldensun between the foot of friedrichsberg and thatfact indubitable though kept dark so long moritz is marching with the centre or main battle that way intending to wheel and turn hillwards kreczorwise as per order certain furlongs ahead when friedrich having so i can conceive it seen from his hilltop how hulsen had done kreczor altogether prosperous there and what endless capability there was of prospering to all lengths and speeding the general winning were hulsen but supported soon enough were there any safe shortcut to hulsen dashed from his hilltop in hot haste towards prince moritz general of the centre intending to direct him upon such shortcut and hastily said with olympian brevity and fire face to right here with jovelike brevity and in such blaze of olympian fire as we may imagine moritz himself is of brief crabbed fiery mind brief in temper and answers to the effect impossible to attack the enemy here your majesty postured as they are and we with such orders gone abroadface to right i tell you said the king still more olympian and too emphatic for explaining moritz i hope paused but rather think he did not before remonstrating the second time neither perhaps was his voice so low as it should have been it is certain friedrich dashed quite up to moritz at this second remonstrance flashed out his sword the only time he ever drew his sword in battle and now gone all to mere olympian lightning and thundertone asks in this attitude will er will he obey orders thenmoritz fallen silent of remonstrance with gloomy rapidity obeys  prince franz the young nephew of moritz alone witnessed this scene scene to be locked in threefold silence in his old age franz had whispered it to berenhorst his bastard halfuncle a famed military criticwho is still in the highest repute that way berenhorsts kriegskunst and other deep books and is recognizable to lay readers for an abstruse strong judgment with equal strength of abstruse temper hidden behind it and very privately a deep grudge towards friedrich scarcely repressible on opportunity from berenhorst it irrepressibly oozed out heinrich van berenhorst a natural son of the old dessauers in his betrachtungen uber die kriegskunst is the first that alludes to it in print leipzig 1797page in second edition 1798 is i 219 much more to friedrichs disadvantage than it now looks when wholly seen into not change of plan not ruinous caprice on friedrichs part as berenhorst retzow and others would have it only excess of brevity towards moritz and accident of the olympian fire breaking out friedrich is chargeable with nothing except perhaps what moritz knows the evil of trying for a shortcut such is now the received interpretation prince franz to his last day refused to speak again on the subject judiciously repentant we can fancy of having spoken at all and brought such a matter into the streets and their piepowder adjudications in kutzen pp 217237 a long dissertation on it for the present he is adjutant to moritz busy obeying to the letter  friedrich withdrawing to his height again and looking back on moritz finds that he is making right in upon the austrian line which was by no means friedrichs meaning had not he been so brief friedrich doubtless with pain remembers now that he had said only face to right and had then got into olympian tempest which left things dark to moritz halblinks half to left withal he despatches that new order to moritz with the utmost speed face to right then forward half to left had moritz at the first got that commentary to his order there had probably been no remonstrance on moritzs part no olympian scene to keep silent and moritz taking that diagonal direction from the first had hit in at or below kreczor at the very point where he was needed alas for overhaste shortcuts if they are to be good ought at least to be made clear moritz on the new order reaching him does instantly steer halfleft but he arrives now above kreczor strikes the austrian line on this side of kreczor disjoined from hulsen where he can do no good to hulsen in brief moritz and now the whole line with him have to do as mannstein and sequel are doing attack in face not in flank and try what in the proportion of one to two uphill and against batteries they can make of it in that fashion  and so from right wing to left miles long there is now universal storm of volleying bayonetcharging thunder of artillery caseshot cartridgeshot and sulphurous devouring whirlwind the wrestle very tough and furious especially on the assaulting side here as at prag the prussian troops were one and all in the fire each doing strenuously his utmost no complaint to be made of their performance more perfect soldiers i believe were rarely or never seen on any field of war but there is no reserve left mannstein and the rest who should have been reserve and at a generals disposal we see what they are doing in vain or nearly so is friedrichs tactic or manoeuvring talent what now is there to manoeuvre all is now gone up into one combustion to fan the fire to be here there fanning the fire where need shows this is now friedrichs function everywhere in the hottest of the fight that is all we at present know of him invisible to us otherwise this deathwrestle lasted perhaps four hours till seven or towards eight oclock in the june evening the sun verging downwards issue still uncertain  and in fact at last the issue turned upon a hairsuch the empire of chance in war matters cautious daun it is well known did not like the aspect of the thing cautious daun thinks to himself if we get pushed back into that camp of yesternight down the kamhayek heights and right into the impassable swamps the reverse way heights now his not ours and impassable swamps waiting to swallow us wreck complete and surrender at discretion daun writes in pencil the retreat is to suchdol kuttenberg way southward where we have heights again and magazines dauns aidedecamp is galloping everywhither with that important document and generals are preparing for retreat accordinglyone general on the right wing has visibly to hulsen and us his cannon out of

lieutenantcolonel tell me where general nostitz is benkendorf can tellwill himself take the message but benkendorf looks into the important pencil document thinks it premature wasteful and that the contrary is feasible persuades nostitz so to think persuades this regiment and that saxon austrian horse and foot though the cannon in retreat go trundling past them merely shifting their battery dont you seesteady and in fine organizes of saxon and austrian horse and foot in promising quantity saxons in great fury on the pirna score not to say the striegau and other old grudges a new unanimous assault on hulsen  the assault was furious and became ever more so at length irresistible to hulsen hulsens horse pressing on as to victory are at last hurled back could not be rallied that of rucker wollt ihr ewig leben rascals would you live forever with the fritz for eight groschen this day there has been enoughis to be counted pure myth not unsuccessful in its withered kind fairly fled some of them confusing hulsens footfoot is broken instantly ranks itself as the manner of prussians is ranks itself in impromptu squares and stands fiercely defensive again amid the slashing and careering wrestle of extreme fury say the witnesses this for striegau cried the saxon dragoons furiously sabring archenholtz i 100 yes and is there nothing to account of pirna and the later scores scores unliquidated very many still but the end is hulsen is driven away retreats parthianlike downhill some space whose sad example has to spread rightwards like a powdertrain till all are in retreatnorthward towards nimburg is the roadand the battle of kolin is finished  friedrich made vehement effort to rally the horse to rally this and that but to no purpose one account says he did collect some small body and marched forth at the head of it against a certain battery but in his rear man after man fell away till lieutenantcolonel grant not le grand as some call him and indeed there is an accent of scotch in him still audible to us here had to remark your majesty and i cannot take the battery ourselves upon which friedrich turned round and finding nobody looked at the enemy through his glass and slowly rode away retzow i 139on a different errand  seeing the battle irretrievably lost he now called bevern and moritz to him gave them charge of the retreatto nimburg cross

baggagepeople grooms and led horses gathered in the train of him these latter at one point retzow has heard in opposition circles rushed up galloping enemys hussars upon us and set the whole party to the gallop for some time till they found the alarm was false ib i 140 of friedrich we see nothing except as if by cloudy moonlight in an uncertain manner through this and the other small anecdote perhaps semimythical and true only in the essence of it  daun gave no chase anywhere on his extreme left he had perhaps as preparative for chasing ordered out the cavalry general stampach and cavalry from the centre with cannon with infantry and appliances to clear away the wrecks of mannstein and what still stands to right of him on the planian highway yonder but stampach found obstacles of ground wet obstacles and also dryprussian posts smaller and greater who would not stir a handbreadth in fact an altogether deadly storm of negative spontaneous on their part from the indignant regiments thereabouts kings first battalion and two others who blazed out on stampach in an extraordinary manner tearing to shreds every attempt of his themselves stiff as steel die all of us rather than stir and in fact the second man of these poor fellows did die there kutzen p 138 from the canonical or staffofficers enumeration see supra p 403 n so that bevern commander in that part who was absent speaking with the king found on his return a new battle broken out which he did not forbid but encourage till stampach had enough and withdrew in rather torn condition this if this were some preparative for chasing was what daun did of it in the cavalry way and this was all the infantry he strictly prohibited to stir from their positionno saying if we come into the level ground with such an enemyand passed the night under arms far on our left or what was once our left ziethen with all his squadrons nay hulsen with most of his battalions continued steady on the ground and marched away at their leisure as rearguard  it seemed says tempelhof in splenetic tone as if feldmarschall daun like a good christian would not suffer the sun to go down on his wrath this day nearly the longest in the year he allowed the prussian cavalry which had beaten nadasti to stand quiet on the field till ten at night till nine he did not send a single hussar in chase of the infantry he stood all night under arms and next day returned to his old camp as if he had been afraid the king would come back arriving there himself he could see about ten in the morning behind kaurzim and planian the whole prussian baggage fallen into such a coil that the wagons were with difficulty got on way again nevertheless he let it under cover of the grenadier battalion manteuffel go in peace tempelhof i 195 a man that for caution and slowness could make no use of his victory  the austrian force in the field this day is counted to have been 60000 their losses in killed wounded and missing 8114 the prussians

very lively and intense to work however this king can shake away such things and is not given overmuch to retrospection on the unalterable past like dewdrops from the lions mane as is figuratively said the lion swiftly rampant again there was manifold swift ordering considering and determining at nimburg that day and towards night friedrich shot rapidly into headquarters at prag where by order there is as the first thing of all a very rapid business going on well forward by the time he arrives  to fold ones siegegear and army neatly together from those two hilltops and march away with them safe in sight of so many enemies this has to be the first and rapidest thing if this be found possible as one calculates it may after which the world of enemies held in the slip so long will rush in from all the four windsunknown whitherward one must wait to see whitherward and how  friedrichs history for the remaining six months of this year falls accordingly into three sections section first waiting how and towards what objects his enemies the austrians first of all will advancethis lasts for about a month friedrich waiting mainly at leitmeritz on guard there both of saxony and of silesia till this slowly declare itself slowly perhaps almost stupidly but by no means satisfactorily to friedrich as will be seen after which section second of his history lasts above two months friedrichs enemies being all got to the ground and united in hope and resolution to overwhelm and abolish him but their plans positions operations so extremely various that for a long time end of august to beginning of november friedrich cannot tell what to do with them and has to scatter himself into thin threads and roam about chiefly in thuringen and the west of saxony seeking something to fight with and finding nothing getting more and more impatient of such paltry misery at times nigh desperate and habitually drifting on desperation as on a lee shore in the night despite all his efforts till in section third which goes from november 5th through december 5th and into the new year he does find what to do and does itin a forever memorable way  three sections of which the reader shall successively have some idea if he exert himself though it is only in snatches suggestive to an active fancy that we can promise to dwell on them especially on the first two which lie pretty much unsurveyable in those chaotic records like a worldwide coil of thrums let us be swift in friedrichs own manner and try to disimprison the small portions of essential here partly from eyewitnesses are

cautious slowly puzzling mind of daun had daun used any diligence had daun and prince karl been broad awake together or even singly but friedrich guessed they seldom or never were that they would

when once it has disclosed itself horizon all round is black enough austrians french swedes russians reichs army closer upon him or not so close all are rolling in saxony the lausitz and silesia brandenburg itself it is uncertain which of these may soonest require his active presence  the very day after his arrival in leitmeritztuesday 28th june while that junction with keith was going on and the troops were defiling along the bridge for junction with keitha heavy sorrow had befallen him which he yet knew not of an irreparable domestic loss sad complement to these military and other public disasters queen sophie dorothee about whose health he had been anxious but had again been set quiet died at berlin that day monbijou 28th june 1757 born at hanover 27th march 1687 in her seventyfirst year of no definite violent disease worn down with chagrins and apprehensions in this black whirlpool of public troubles so far as appears the news came on friedrich by surprisebad cough we hear of and of his anxieties about it in the spring time then again of improvement recovery in the fine weatherno thought just now of such an event and he took it with a depth of affliction which my less informed readers are far from expecting of him  july 2d the news came king withdrew into privacy to weep and bewail under this new pungency of grief superadded to so many others mitchell says for two days he had no levee only the princes dined with him princes henri and ferdinand prince of prussia is gone to jungbunzlau would get the sad message there among his other troubles yesterday july 3d king sent for me in the afternoonthe first time he has seen anybody since the news camei had the honor to remain with him some hours in his closet i must own to your lordship i was most sensibly afflicted to see him indulging his grief and giving way to the warmest filial affections recalling to mind the many obligations he had to her late majesty all she had suffered and how nobly she bore it the good she did to everybody the one comfort he now had to think of having tried to make her last years more agreeable papers and memoirs i 253 despatch to holderness 4th july slightly abridgedsee

three weeks yet mitchells notebooks and despatches in that part have a fine biographic interest the wholly human friedrich wholly visible to us there as he seldom is going over his past life to mitchell brief candid pious to both his parentsinexpressibly sad like moonlight on the grave of ones mother silent that while so much else is too noisy  this friedrich upon whom the whole world has risen like a mad sorcererssabbath how safe he once lay in his cradle like the rest of us mothers love wrapping him softand now these thoughts commingle in a very tragic way with the avalanche of public disasters which is thundering down on all sides warm tears the meed of this new sorrow small in compass but greater in poignancy than all the rest together my poor old mother oh my mother that so loved me always and would have given her own life to shelter mineit was at leitmeritz as i guess that mitchell first made decisive acquaintance what we may almost call intimacy with the king we already defined him as a sagacious longheaded loyalhearted diplomatic gentleman scotch by birth and by turn of character abundantly polite vigilant discreet and with a fund of general sense and rugged veracity of mind whom friedrich at once recognized for what he was and much took to finding a hearty return withal so that they were soon well with one another and continued so mitchell as orders were attended the kings person all through this war sometimes in the blaze of battle itself and nothing but cannonshot going if it so chanced and has preserved in his multifarious papers a great many traits of friedrich not to be met with elsewhere  mitchells occasional society conversation with a man of sense and manly character which friedrich always much loved was no doubt a resource to friedrich in his lonely roamings and vicissitudes in those dark years no other british ambassador ever had the luck to please him or be pleased by himmost of them as exexchequer legge and the like exparliamentary people he seems to have considered dull obstinate wooden fellows of fantastic abrupt rather abstruse kind of character not worth decipheringsome of them as hanbury williams with the mischievous tic more like galvanism or stvitusdance which he called wit and the inconvenient turn for plotting and intriguing friedrich could not endure at all but had them as soon as possible recalledof course not without detestation on their part  at leitmeritz it appears he kept withdrawn to his closet a good deal gave himself up to his sorrows and his thoughts would sit many hours drowned in tears weeping bitterly like a child or a woman this is strange to some readers but it is trueand ought to alter certain current notions friedrich flashing like clear steel upon evildoers and mendacious unjust persons and their works is not by nature a cruel man then or an unfeeling as rumor reports reader no far the reverseand public rumor as you may have remarked is apt to be an extreme blockhead full of fury and stupidity on such points and had much better hold its tongue till it know in some measure extreme sensibility is not sure to be a merit though it is sure to be reckoned one by the greedy dim fellows looking idly on but in any case the degree of it that dwelt privately for most part in friedrich was great and to himself it seemed a sad rather than joyful fact speaking of this matter long afterwards to garve a silesian philosopher with whom he used to converse at breslau he saysor let dull garve himself report it in the literal thirdperson  and herein i the herr garve venturing to dispute or qualify on one of his majestys favorite topics believe lies the real ground of happiness it is the capacity and opportunity to accomplish great things this the king would not allow but said that i did not sufficiently take into account the natural feelings different in different people which when painful imbittered the life of the highest as of the lowest that in his own life he had experienced the deepest sufferings of this kind and added he with a touching tone of kindness and familiarity which never occurred again in his interviews with me if you er knew for instance what i underwent on the death of my mother you would see that i have been as unhappy as any other and unhappier than others because of the greater sensibility i had weil ich mehr

of prag had checked it in the birthpangs and given rise to pangs of another sort the poor reichs circles generally exclaiming what bring the war into our own borders bring the king of prussia on our own throatsand stopping short in their enlistments and preparations in vain for austrian officials to urge them watching there with awestruck eye while the 12000 bombs flew into prag  the battle of

momentous but prussia had taught him the routine of right soldiering surely to small purpose and friedrich no doubt glanced indignantly at this small thing among the many big ones  from about the end

pecuniary and other outfit beggaring description hildburghausen does his utmost kaiser the like the number should have far exceeded 50000 but was not on the field of above half that number 25000 add

such road  july 5th by a courier of plothos returning to regensburg who passes near you i write to apprise my dear sister of the new misery which overwhelms us we have no longer a mother this loss puts the crown on my sorrows i am obliged to act and have not time to give free course to my tears judge i pray you of the situation of a feeling heart put to so cruel a trial all losses in the world are capable of being remedied but those which death causes are beyond the reach of hope  july 7th you are too good i am ashamed to abuse your indulgence but do since you will try to sound the french what conditions of peace they would demand one might judge as to their intentions send that mirabeau ce m de mirabeau to france willingly will i pay the expense he may offer as much as five million thalers 750000 pounds to the favorite yes even to the pompadour for peace alone of course his utmost discretion will be neededshould the english get the least wind of it but if they are gone to st

have had of the best and worthiest mother in this world i am so struck down with all these blows from within and without that i feel myself in a sort of stupefaction  the french have just laid hold of friesland seized embden july 3d are about to pass the weser they have instigated the swedes to declare war against me the swedes are sending 17000 men rather more if anything but they proved beautifully ineffectual into pommernwill be burdensome to stralsund and the poor country people mainly having no captain over them but a hydraheaded national palaver at home and a longpole with cockedhat on it here at hand the russians are besieging memel have taken it ten days ago lehwald has them on his front and in his rear the troops of the reich from your plains of furth yonder are also about to march all this will force me to evacuate bohemia so soon as that crowd of enemies gets into motion  i am firmly resolved on the extremest efforts to save my country we shall see quitte a voir if fortune will take a new thought or if she will entirely turn her back upon me happy the moment when i took to training myself in philosophy there is nothing else that can sustain the soul in a situation like mine i spread out to you dear sister the detail of my sorrows if these things regarded only myself i could stand it with composure but i am bound guardian of the safety and happiness of a people which has been put under my charge there lies the sting of it and i shall have to reproach myself with every fault if by delay or by overhaste i occasion the smallest accident all the more as at present any fault may be capital  what a business here is the liberty of germany and that protestant cause for which so much blood has been shed here are those two great interests again at stake and the pinch of this huge game is such that an unlucky quarter of an hour may establish over germany the tyrannous domination of the house of austria forever i am in the case of a traveller who sees himself surrounded and ready to be assassinated by a troop of cutthroats who intend to share his spoils since the league of cambrai 15081510 with a pope in it and a kaiser and most christian king iniquitously sworn against poor veniceto no purpose as happily appears there is no example of such a conspiracy as that infamous triumvirate austria france russia now forms against me was it ever seen before that three great princes laid plot in concert to destroy a fourth who had done nothing against them i have not had the least quarrel either with france or with russia still less with sweden if in common life three citizens took it into their heads to fall upon their neighbor and burn his house about him they very certainly by sentence of tribunal would be broken on the wheel what and will sovereigns who maintain these tribunals and these laws in their states give such example to their subjects happy my dear sister is the obscure man whose good sense from youth upwards has renounced all sorts of glory who in his safe low place has none to envy him and whose fortune does not excite the cupidity of scoundrels  but these reflections are vain we have to be what our birth which decides has made us in entering upon this world i reckoned that being king it beseemed me to think as a sovereign and i took for principle that the reputation of a prince ought to be dearer to him than life they have plotted against me the court of vienna has given itself the liberty of trying to maltreat me my honor commanded me not to suffer it we have come to war a gang of robbers falls on me pistol in hand that is the adventure which has happened to me the remedy is difficult in desperate diseases there are no methods but desperate ones  i beg a thousand pardons dear sister in these three long pages i talk to you of nothing but my troubles and affairs a strange abuse it would be of any other persons friendship but yours my dear sister yours is known to me and i am persuaded you are not impatient when i open my heart to youa heart which is yours altogether being filled with sentiments of the tenderest esteem with which i am my dearest sister your in truth affectionate brother at all

elsewhere in bitter haste and impatience with outlooks worse than ever  the prince of prussias enterprise had its intricacies but by good management was capable of being done at least so friedrich thoughtthough in truth it would have been better had friedrich gone himself since the chief pressure happened to fall there the prince has to retire parthianlike as slowly as possible with the late kolin or moritzbevern army towards the lausitz keeping his eye upon silesia the while of course securing the passes and strong places in his passage for defence of his own rear at lowest especially securing zittau a fine opulent town where his chief magazine is fed from silesia now the army is in good strength guess 30000 with every equipment complete in discipline in health and in heart such as beseems a prussian armyprobably longing rather if it venture to long or wish for anything not yet commanded to have a stroke at those austrians again and pay them something towards that late kolin score  the prince arrived at jungbunzlau june 30th winterfeld with him and at his own request schmettau the austrians have not yet stirred if they do it may be upon the king it may be upon the prince in three or even in two marches prince and king can be togetherthe king only too happy in the present oppressive coil of doubts to find the austrians ready for a new passage of battle and an immediate decision the austrians did in fact break outseemingly at first upon the king but in reality upon the prince whom they judge safer game and the matter became much more critical upon him than had been expected  the prince was thought to have a good judgment too much talk in it we sometimes feared and fair knowledge in military matters the king not quite by the princes choice has given him winterfeld for mentor winterfeld who has an excellent military head in such matters and a heart firm as steelalmost like a second self in the kings estimation excellent winterfeldbut then there are also schmettau bevern and others possibly in private not too well affected to this winterfeld in fact there is rather a multitude of counsellersand an ingenuous finespirited prince perhaps more capable of eloquence on the opposition side than of condensing into real wisdom a multitude of counsels when the crisis rises and the affair becomes really difficult crisis did rise the victorious austrians after such delay had finally made up their minds to press this one a little this one rather than the king and hang upon his skirts daun and prince karl set out after him just about the time of his arrival70000 strong the prince hears including plenty of pandours certain it is the poor princes mind did flounder a good deal and his procedures succeeded extremely ill on this occasion certain too that they were extremely illtaken at headquarters and that he even died soon afterchiefly of broken heart said the censorious world it is well known how europe rang with the matter for a long while and books were printed and documents and collections by a masters hand lettres secretes touchant la deniere guerre de main de maitre divisees en deux parties francfort et amsterdam 1772 this is the princes own statement proof in hand by far the clearest account is in schmettaus leben by his son pp 353384 see also preuss ii 5761 and especially ii 407 we who can spend but a page or two on it must carefully stand by the essential part  june 30thjuly 3d prince at jungbunzlau in chief command besides winterfeld the generals under him are ziethen schmettau fouquet retzow goltz and two others who need not be of our acquaintance impossible to stay there thinks the prince thinks everybody and they shift to neuschloss westward thirty miles july 1st daun had crossed the elbe daun let us say for brevity though it is daun and karl or even karl and daun karl being chief and capable of saying so at times though daun is very splendent since kolincrossed the elbe above brandeis nadasti with precursor pandours now within an hours march of jungbunzlauand it was time to go  july 3d6th at neuschloss which is thought a strong position key of the localities there and nearer friedrich too the prince stayed not quite four days shifted to bohm bohmisch leipa july 7thrather off from leitmeritz but a march towards zittau where the provisions are a bad change said the princes friends afterwards change advised by winterfeldwho never mentioned that circumstance to his majesty many as he did mention not in the best wayprince gets to bohm leipa july 7th stays there in questionable circumstances nine days  bohm leipa is still not above thirty miles northeastward of the king and it is about the same distance southwestward from zittau out of which fine town partly by crossroads the prince gets his provisions on this march from zittau hitherward as far as the little town of gabel which lies about half way there is broad high road the great southern kaiserstrasse from gabel for bohm leipa you have to cross southwestward by country roads the keys to which especially gabel the prince has not failed to secure by proper garrison parties and so for about a week not quite uncomfortably he continues at bohm leipa getting in his convoys from zittau diligently scanning the pandour stragglings and sputterings round him which are clearly on the increasing hand diligently corresponding with the king meanwhile who much discourages undue apprehension or retreat movement till the last pinch edging backward and again backward you come bounce upon berlin one day and will then have to haltwhich is not pleasant to the prince but indisputably the pandour spurts on him do become pandour gushings with regulars also noticeable it is certain the austrians are outpretending first to mean the king and leitmeritz but knowing better and meaning the prince and bohm leipa all the whileby way of supplement take dauns positions in the interim  daun and karl were at podschernitz 26th june 1st july cross the elbe above brandeis nadasti now within an hours march of jungbunzlau 7th july day while the prince is flitting to bohm leipa daun is through jungbunzlau to munchengratz thence to liebenau 14th to niemes not above four miles from the princes rightmost outpost rightmost or eastmost which looks away from his brother while a couple of advanced parties beck and maguire hover on his flank zittauward and nadasti if he knew it is pushing on to rear  thursday 14th july about six in the evening at bohm leipa distinct cannonthunder is heard from northeast evidently gabel getting cannonaded and our wagon convoy empty going to zittau for meal general puttkammer escorting is in a dangerous state and by and by hussar parties of ours come in with articulate news to that bad effect gabel under hot attack of regulars puttkammer with his 3000 vigorously defending will expect to be relieved within not many hours here has the crisis come crisis sure enoughand the prince to meet it summons that refuge of the irresolute a council of war  winterfeld who is just come home in these moments did not attendnot till three next morning winterfeld had gone to bed fairly tired dead with long marching and hurrying about to the poor prince there are three courses visible course first that of joining the king at leitmeritz gabel zittau lost in that case game given upreception likely to be bad at leitmeritz course secondthe course friedrich himself would at once have gone upon and been already well ahead withthat of instantly taking measures for the relief of puttkammer dispute gabel to the last retreat on loss of it parthianlike to zittau by that broad highway short and broad whole distance hence only thirty miles thirty miles say the multitude of counsellors yes but the first fifteen to gabel is crossroad hilly difficult they have us in flank we are 25000 urges the prince fifteen miles is not much the thing had its difficulties the prince himself it appears faintly thought it feasible 25000 we 20000 they only fifteen miles said he but the variety of counsellors crossroads defiles flankmarch dangerous said they and so the third course which was incomparably the worst found favor in council of war that of leaving gabel and puttkammer to their fate and of pushing off for zittau leftwards through the safe hills by kamnitz kreywitz rumburgwhich if the reader look is by a circuitous nay quite parabolic course twice or thrice as farin that manner let us save zittau and our main body said the council of war yes my friends a cannonball endeavoring to get into zittau from the townditch would have to take a parabolic courseand the cannonball would be speedy upon it and not have hill roads to go by this notable parabolic circuit of narrow steep roads may have its difficulties for an army and its baggages enough the poor prince adopted that worst third course and even made no despatch in getting into it and it proved ruinous to zittau and to much else his own life partly included  july 16th22d thursday night or friday 3 am that third and incomparably worst course was adopted gabel puttkammer with his wagons ensigns kettledrums all this has to surrender in a day high road to zittau for the austrians is a smooth march when they like to gather fully there and start and in the hills with their jolts and precipitous windings infested too by pandours the poor prussian main body on its wide parabolic circuit has a time of it loses its pontoons loses most of its baggage obliged to set fire not to the pandours but to your own wagons and necessaries of army life encamps on bleak heights no food not even water road quite lost road to be rediscovered or invented pandours sputtering on you out of every bush and hollow your peasant wagoners cutting traces and galloping offsuch are the phenomena of that march by circuit leftward on the poor princes part march began soon after midnight saturday 16th schmettau as vanguard and  and in fine by friday 22d after not quite a week of it the prince curving from northward in parabolic course less speedy than the cannonballs would have been into sight of zittaubehold there are the austrians far and wide to left of us encamped impregnable behind the neisse river there they have got the eckarts hill which commands zittauand how to get into zittau and our magazines and how to subsist if we were in the poor prince takes post on what heights there are on his own side of the neisse looks wistfully down upon zittau asking how  about stroke of noon the austrians from their eckartsberg do a thing which was much talked of they open battery of redhot balls upon zittau kindle the roofs of it shingleroofs in dry july set zittau all on blaze the 10000 innocent souls shrieking in vain to heaven and earth and before sunset zittau is ashes and redhot walls not zittau but a cinderheapprussian garrison not hurt nor magazine as yet garrison busy with buckets i should guess but beginning to find the air grow very hot on the morrow morning zittau is a smouldering cinderheap hotter and hotter to the prussian garrison and does not exist as a city  one of the most inhuman actions ever heard of in war shrieks universal germany asks itself what could have set a chivalrous karl upon this devillike procedure protestants these poor zittauers were shone in commerce no such weaving industrying in all teutschland elsewhere hah an eyesorrow they with their commerce their weavings and industryings to austrian papists who cannot weave or trade that was finally the guess of some personswide of the mark we may well judge prince xavier of saxony present in the camp too made no remonstrance said others alas my friends what could xavier probably avail the foolish fellow with only three regiments prince karl it was afterwards evident could have got zittau unburnt and could even have kept the prussians out of zittau altogether zittau surely would have been very useful to prince karl but overnight let us try to fancy it so not knowing the prussian possibilities prince karl screwed to the devilish point had got his furnaces lighted his redhot balls ready and so hurried on by his pride and by his other devils hadthere are devilish things sometimes done in war and whole cities are made ashes by them for certain here is a strange way of commencing your deliverance of saxony and prince karl carries truly a brandmark from this conflagration and will till all memory of him cease as to zittau it rebuilt itself zittau is alive again a strong stone city in our day on its newbuilt townhouse stands again bene facere et male audire regium est to do well and be ill spoken of is the part of kings a saying of alexander the greats plutarch in alexandre amazingly true of themwhen they are not shams what times for herrnhuth preparing for its christian sabbath under these omens near by  the prince of prussia tells us he early next morning saturday 23d july had his tents pitched which was but an unavailing procedure with poor zittau gone such a road bring us bread out of that ruined zittau ordered the prince his detachment returns ineffectual so hot we cannot march in and the garrison colonel one dierecke and five battalions are garrison sends out word so hot we cannot stand it stand it yet a very little and answers the prince but dierecke and battalions cannot or at least cannot long enough and set to marching out in firm order i have no doubt and with some modicum of bread but the tumbling of certain burnt walls parted colonel and men in a sad way colonel himself with the colors with the honors none of his people it seems though they were scattered loose was picked up by an austrian party and made prisoner a miserable business this of zittau  next evening sunday after dark prince of prussia strikes his tents again rolls off in a very unsuccinct condition happily unchased for he admits that chase would have been ruinous off towards lobau what nights for zinzendorf and herrnhuth as such things tumble past them thence towards bautzen and arrives in the most lugubrious torn condition any prussian general ever stood in reaches bautzen on those termsand is warned that his brother will be there in a day or two  one may fancy friedrichs indignation astonishment and grief when he heard of that march towards zittau through the hills by a parabolic course the issue of which is too guessable by friedrich he himself instantly rises from leitmeritz starts in fit divisions by the pascopol by the elbe passes for pirna and leaving moritz of dessau with a 10000 to secure the passes about pirna and keith to come on with the magazines hastens across for bautzen to look into these advancing triumphant austrians these strange prussian proceedings on first hearing of that sidemarch his auguries had been bad enough letter to wilhelmina linay 22d july second day of the march from leitmeritz oeuvres xxvii i 298 but the event has far surpassed them zittau gone the army hurrying home as if in flight in that wrecked condition the door of saxony door of silesia left wide opendaun has only to choose day by day as friedrich advanced to repair that mischief the news of it have grown worse on him days rife otherwise in mere bad news the russians in memel preussen at their feet soubises french and the reichs army pushing on for erfurt to deliver saxony on that western side and from the frenchenglish scene of operationsin those same bad days royal highness of cumberland has been doing a feat worth notice in the above connection read this from an authentic source  hastenbeck 22d26th july 1757 royal highness hitching back and back had got to hameln a strong place of his on the safe side of the weser and did at last hanover itself being now nigh call halt and resolve to make a stand july 22d very day while the prince of prussia came in sight of zittau with the austrians hanging over it royal highness took post in that favorable vicinity of hameln at perfect leisure to select his ground and there sat waiting destreesswamps for our right wing and the weser not far off small hamlet of hastenbeck in front and a woody knoll for our lefttotally inactive for four days long attempting nothing upon destrees and his intricate shufflings but looking idly noonward to the courses of the sun till destrees should come up royal highness is much swollen into obesity into flabby torpor a changed man since fontenoy times shockingly inactive they say in this post at hastenbeck destrees too is ridiculously cautious has manoeuvred fifteen days in advancing about as many british miles destrees did at last come up july 25th nearly two to one of royal highness72000 some count him but considerably anarchic in parts overwhelmed with court generals and princes of the blood for one itemand decides on attacking next morning destrees duly went to reconnoitre but unluckily had mist suddenly falling well we must attack all the same  and so 26th july tuesday there ensued a battle of hastenbeck the absurdest battle in the world and which ought in fairness to have been lost by both though royal highness alone had the ill luck both captains behaved very poorly and each of them had a subaltern who behaved well destrees with his 70000 versus 40000 posted there knows nothing of royal highnesss position sees only royal highnesss left wing on that woody height and after hours of preliminary cannonading sends out general chevert upon that chevert his subaltern a bit of right soldierstuff the chevert whom we knew at prag in old belleisle times goes upon it like fury whom the brunswick grenadiers resist in like humor hotter and hotter some hard fighting there on royal highnesss left chevert very fiery grenadiers very obstinate till on the centre westward in royal highnesss chief battery there some spark went the wrong way and a powderwagon shot itself aloft with hideous blaze and roar and in the confusion the french rushed in and the battery was lost which discouraged the grenadiers so that chevert made some progress upon them on their woody height and began to have confident hope  had chevert known or had destrees known there was close behind said height a hollow through which these grenadiers might have been taken in rear dangerous hollow much neglected by royal highness who has only general breitenbach with a weak party there this breitenbach happening to have a head of his own and finding nothing to do in that hollow or to rightward bursts out of his own accord on cheverts left flank cannonading volleying horsechargingthe sound of which hah french there too struck a damp through royal highness who instantly ordered retreat and took the road what singular illluck that sound of breitenbach to royal highness for observe the effect of breitenbachwhich was to recover the lost battery gallant young prince of brunswick hereditary prince or duke that is to be striking in upon it with bayonetcharge at the right moment made destrees to order retreat battle lost thinks destreesand with good cause had breitenbach been supported at all but no subaltern durst and royal highness himself was not overtakable so far on the road royal highness wept on hearing the brunswick grenadiers too are said to have wept for rage and probably breitenbach and the hereditary prince mauvillon i 228 anonymous of hamburg i 206 who gives a plan and all manner of details if needed by anybody kausler c c  this is the last of royal highnesss exploits in war the retreat had been ordered to hanover but the baggage by mistake took the road for minden and royal highness followed thithermuch the same what road he or it takes friedrich might still hope he would retreat on magdeburg 40000 good soldiers might find a captain there and be valuable against a destrees and soubise in those parts but no it was through bremen country to stade into the sea that royal highness by ill luck retreated he has still one great vexation to give friedrichto us almost a comfort knowing what followed out of itand will have to be mentioned one other time in this history and then go over our horizon altogether  whether friedrich had heard of hastenbeck the day his brother and he met july 29th at bautzen i do not know but it is likely enough he may have got the news that very morning which was not calculated to increase ones good humor his meeting with the prince is royal not fraternal as all men have heard let us give with brevity from schmettau junior the exact features of it and leave the candid reader who has formed to himself some notion of kingship and its sorrows and stern conditions having perhaps himself some thing of kingly in a small potential way to interpret the matter and make what he can of it  bautzen 29th july 1757 the king with reinforcement is coming hither from the dresden side to take up the reins of this dishevelled zittau army to speed with it against the austrians and if humanly possible lock the doors of silesia and saxony again and chase the intruders away prince of prussia and the other generals have notice the night before at 4 am tomorrow 29th

prince henri duke ferdinand of brunswick and others in his train king noticing them at about 300 paces distance drew bridle prince of prussia did the like train and he saluting with their hats as did the kings train in return king did not saluteon the contrary he turned his horse round and dismounted as did everybody else on such signal king lay down on the ground as if waiting the arrival of his vanguard and bade winterfeld and goltz sit by him poor prince of prussia and battered heavyladen generalsafter a minute or two goltz came over and whispered to the prince hither meine herren all of you a message from his majesty cried the prince whereupon to generals and prince goltz delivered in equable official tone these affecting words his majesty commands me to inform your royal highness that he has cause to be greatly discontented with you that you deserve to have a courtmartial held over you which would sentence you and all your generals to death but that his majesty will not carry the matter so far being unable to forget that in the chief general he has a brother schmettau pp 384 385  the prince answered he wanted only a courtmartial and the like in stiff tone here is the letter he writes next day to his brother with the answer   prince of prussia to the king  bautern 30th july 1757  my dear brotherthe letters you have written me and the reception i yesterday met with are sufficient proof that in your opinion i have ruined my honor and reputation this grieves but it does not crush me as in my own mind i am not conscious of the least reproach i am perfectly convinced that i did not act by caprice i did not follow the counsels of people incapable of giving good ones i have done what i thought to be suitablest for the army all your generals will do me that justice  i reckon it useless to beg of you to have my conduct investigated this would be a favor you would do me so i cannot expect it my health has been weakened by these fatigues still more by these chagrins i have gone to lodge in the town to recruit myself  i have requested the duke of bevern to present the army reports he can give you explanation of everything be assured my dear brother that in spite of the misfortunes which overwhelm me and which i have not deserved i shall never cease to be attached to the state and as a faithful member of the same my joy will be perfect when i learn the happy issue of your enterprises i have the honor to be  august wilhelm main de maitre p 21   kings answer the same day  camp near bautzen 30th july 1757 my dear brotheryour bad guidance has greatly deranged my affairs it is not the enemy it is your illjudged measures that have done me all this mischief my generals are inexcusable either for advising you so ill or in permitting you to follow resolutions so unwise your ears are accustomed to listen to the talk of flatterers only daun has not flattered youbehold the consequences in this sad situation nothing is left for me but trying the last extremity i must go and give battle and if we cannot conquer we must all of us have ourselves killed  i do not complain of your heart but i do of your incapacity of your want of judgment in not choosing better methods a man who like me mark the phrase from such a quarter has but a few days to live need not dissemble i wish you better fortune than mine has been and that all the miseries and bad adventures you have had may teach you to treat important things with more of care more of sense and more of resolution the greater part of the misfortunes which i now see to be near comes only from you you and your children will be more overwhelmed by them than i be persuaded nevertheless that i have always loved you and that with these sentiments i shall die friedrich main de maitre p 22  as the king went off to the heights of weissenberg zittau way to encamp there against the austrians that same evening the prince did not answer this letterexcept by asking verbally through lieutenantcolonel lentulus a mute swiss figure much about the king who often turns up in these histories for leave to return to dresden by the first escortdepends on himselfan escort is going this night answered friedrich and the prince went accordingly and by two stages got into dresden with his escort on the morrow and had not yet conscious of it quitted the field of war altogether and was

before him goltz went not long after him the other zittau generals all survived this war  the poor princes fate as natural was much pitied and friedrich to this day is growled at for inhuman treatment and so on into which question we do not enter except to say that friedrich too had his sorrows and that probably his concluding words with these sentiments i shall die were perfectly true main de

peculiar intensity on this score against all the peccant parties king not excepted as indeed he was apt to have on various scores the jealous too vehement little man  friedrichs humor at this time i can guess to have been wellnigh desperate he talks once of a horse on too much provocation getting the bit between its teeth regardless thenceforth of chasms and precipices letter to wilhelmina linay

befell to rearward while the march was only half done and which greatly influenced it and all that followed it was the seventh day of friedrichs march not above eighty miles of it yet done when winterfeld perished in fight no winterfeld now to occupy the austrians in his absence to stand between silesia and them or assist him farther in his lonesome struggle against the world let us spend a moment on the exit of that brave man bernstadt gorlitz country september 7th 1757  the bevern army 36000 strong is still there in its place in the lausitz near gorlitz prince karl lies quiet in his near zittau ever since he burnt that town and stood four days in arms unattackable by friedrich with prospect of advantage the court of vienna cannot comprehend this state of inactivity two to one and a mere bevern against you the king far away in saxony upon his desperate antifrench mission there why not go in upon this bevern the french whom we are by every courier passionately importuning to sweep saxony clear what will they say of this strange mode of sweeping silesia clear maria theresa and her kriegshofrath are much exercised with these thoughts and with french and other remonstrances that come maria theresa and her kriegshofrath at length despatch their supreme kaunitz graf kaunitz in person to stir up prince karl and look into the matter with his own wise eyes and great heart prince karl by way of treat to this high gentleman determines on doing something striking upon bevern  bevern lies with his main body about gorlitz in and to westward of gorlitz a pleasant town on the left bank of the neisse readers know there are four neisses and which of them this is with fine hilly country all round bulky solitary heights and mountains rising out of fruitful plainstwo hochkirchs highkirks for example are in this region one of which will become extremely notable next yearbevern has a strong camp leaning on the due heights here with gorlitz in its lap and beyond gorlitz on the right bank of the neisse united to him by a bridge he has placed winterfeld with 10000 who lies with his back to gorlitz proper brooks and fencible places flanking him has a dorf thorp called moys in his lap and some short furlong beyond moys a 2000 of his grenadiers planted on the top of a hill called the moysberg called also the holzberg woodhill and jakelsberg of which the reader is to take notice fine outpost with proper batteries atop with hussar squadrons and hussar pickets sprinkled about which commands a far outlook towards silesia and in marching thither or in continuing here is useful to have in handwere it not a little too distant from the main body it is this jakelsberg capable of being snatched if one is sudden enough that prince karl decides on it may be good for much or for little to prince karl and if even for nothing it will be a brilliant affront upon winterfeld and bevern and more or less charming to kaunitz  winterfeld the ardent enterprising man kings other self is thought to be the mainspring of affairs here small thanks to him privately from bevern add some and is stationed in the extreme van as we see winterfeld is engaged in many things besides the care of this post and indeed where a critical thing is to be done we can imagine winterfeld goes upon it we must try to stay here till the king has finished in saxony says winterfeld always to which bevern replies excellent truly but how bevern has his provender at dresden sadly far off has to hold bautzen garrisoned and gets much trouble with his convoys better in silesia with our magazines at hand thinks bevern less mindful of other considerations  tuesday september 6th prince karl sends nadasti to the right bank of the river forward upon moys to do the jakelsberg before day tomorrow only some 2000 grenadiers on it nadasti has with him 15000 some count 20000 of all arms artillery in plenty surely sufficient for the jakelsberg and daun advances with the main body on the other side of the river to be within reach should moys lead to more serious consequences nadasti diligently marches all day posts himself at night within few miles of moys gets his cannon to the proper hills gallows hill and others his croats to the proper woods and before daylight on the morrow means to begin upon the moys hill and its 2000 grenadiers  wednesday morning at the set hour nadasti with artillery bursting out and quivering battlelines is at work accordingly hurls up 1000 croats for one item and regulars to the amount of forty companies in three lines the grenadiers somewhat astonished for the morning was misty and their hussarposts had come hastily in stood upon their guard like prussian men hurled back the 1000 croats fast enough stubbornly repulsed the regulars too and tumbled them down hill with bulletstorm for accompaniment gallantly foiling this first attempt of nadastis of course nadasti will make another will make ever others capture of the jakelsberg can hardly be doubtful to nadasti  winterfeld was not at moys he was at gorlitz just got in from escorting an important mealconvoy hither out of bautzen and was in conference with bevern when rumor of these croat attacks came in at the gallop from moys winterfeld made little of the rumors he had heard of some attack intended but it was to have been overnight and has not been mere foraging of croat rabble like yesterdays said winterfeld and continued his present business in few minutes the sound of heavy cannonading convinced him haha there are my guests said he we must see if we cannot entertain them right sprang to horseback ordered on doublequick the three regiments nearest him and was off at the galloptoo late or alas too early we might rather say arriving at the gallop winterfeld found his grenadiers and their insufficient reinforcements rolling back the hill lost winterfeld sprang to a fresh horse shot his lightning glances and energies to his hand and that stormfully rallied the matter recovered the hill and stormfully defended it for i should guess an hour or more and might still have done one knows not what had not a bullet struck him through the breast and suddenly ended all his doings in this world  three other reasons the prussians give for loss of their hill which are of no consequence to them or to us in comparison first that bevern on message after message sent no reinforcement that winterfeld was left to his own 10000 and what he and they could make of it bevern is jealous of winterfeld hint they and willing to see his impetuous audacity checked perhaps only cautious of getting into a general action for what was intrinsically nothing second that two regiments of infantry whom winterfeld detached doublequick to seize a couple of villages leopoldshayn hermsdorf on his right and therefrom fusillade nadasti on flank found the villages already occupied by thousands of croats with regular foot and cannonbatteries and could in nowise seize them this was a great reverse of advantage third that an aidedecamp made a small misnomer misreport of one word which was terribly important bring me hither regiment manteuffel winterfeld had ordered the aidedecamp reported it grenadiers manteuffel upon which the grenadiers who were posted in a walled garden an important point to winterfelds right came instantly to order and austrians instantly rushed in to the vacant post and galled winterfelds other flank by their fire abundant accounts in seyfarth ii beylagen 162163 heldengeschichte iv 615633 retzow i 216221  enough winterfeld lay bleeding to death the hill was lost prussians drawing off slowly and backforemost about two in the afternoon upon which the austrians also drew off leaving only a small party on the hill who voluntarily quitted it next morning next morning likewise winterfeld had died the hill was except as bravado and by way of comfort to kaunitz nothing for the austrians but the death of winterfeld which had come by chance to them in the business was probably a great thing better than two pitched battles gained who shall say he was a shining figure this winterfeld dangerous to the austrians the most shining figure in the prussian army except its chief and had great thoughts in his head prussia is not skilful to celebrate her heroesthe prussian muse of history choked with dry military pipeclay or with husky cobwebbery and academic pedantry how can shebut if prussia can produce heroes worth celebrating that is the one important point apart from soldiership and the outward features which are widely different there is traceable in winterfeld some kinship in soul to english chatham his contemporary though he has not had the fame of chatham  winterfeld was by no means universally liked as what brave man is or can be too susceptible to flattery too this too that he is one feels always except friedrich only the most shining figure in the prussian army and it was not unnatural he should be friedrichs one friendas seems to have been the case friedrich when this jobsmessage reached him in erfurt country eight days hence was deeply affected by it to tears or beyond tears as we can fancy against my multitude of enemies i may contrive resources he was heard to say but i shall find no winterfeld again adieu my one friend real peer sole companion to my lonely pilgrimage in these perilous high regions  the prince of prussia contrariwise says a miserable little note which must not be withheld brightened up at the news i shall now die much more content knowing that there is one so bad and dangerous man fewer in the army and six months after in his actual deathmoments he exclaimed i end my life the last period of which has cost me so much sorrow but winterfeld is he who shortened my days preuss ii 75 citing retzowvery bitter opposition humors circulating in their fashion there as elsewhere in this world  bevern the millstone of winterfeld being off his neck has become a more responsible though he feels himself a muchdelivered man had not liked winterfeld they say or had even hated him since those bad zittau times can now at any rate make for schlesien and the mealmagazines when he sees good he will find meal readier there may he find other things corresponding nobody now to keep him painfully manoeuvring in these parts with the kings army nearer to him but meal not  on the third day after september 10th bevern having finished packing took the road for schlesien daun and karl attending him nothing left of daun and karl in those saxon countriesexcept at stolpen out dresdenwards some reservepost or rearguard of 15000 should we chance to hear of that again and from the end of september onwards beverns star once somewhat bright at reichenberg shot rapidly downwards under the horizon altogether and there came post after post such news out of schlesiento say nothing of that stolpen partyas friedrich had never heard before     chapter viifriedrich in thuringen his world of enemies all come  the soubisehildburghausen people had got rendezvoused at erfurt about august 25th 50000 by account and no enemy within 200 miles of them and in the versailles circles it had been expected they would proceed to the deliverance of saxony straightway what is to hinderfriedrich haggling with the austrians at bernstadt could muster but a poor 23000 when he did march towards erfurt in those same neighborhoods within reach of soubise is the richelieu late destrees army elated with hastenbeck comfortably pushing royal highness of cumberland who makes no resistance step by step into the sea victoriously plundering far and wide in those countries hanover itself the headquarter in the versailles circles it is farther expected that richelieu conqueror of minorca will shortly besiege and conquer magdeburg and so crown his glories why not were the deliverance of saxony complete  the whole of which turned out greatly otherwise and to the sad disappointment of versailles the conqueror of minorca is probably aware that the conquering of magdeburg against one whose platforms are not rotten and who does not lie always in his bed as poor old blakeney did will be a very different matter and the private truth is marrchal de richelieu never turned his thoughts upon magdeburg at all nor upon any point of war that had difficulties but solely upon collecting plunder for himself in those countries one of the most magnificent marauders on record in no danger he of becoming monitory and a pendulum like the 1000 that already swing in that capacity to rear of him and he did manage in this campaign which was the last of his military services so as to pay off at paris above 50000 pounds of debts and to build for himself a beautiful garden mansion there which the mocking populations called hanover pavilion pavilion dhanovre a name still sticking to it i believe barbier iii 256 271 of the richelieu campaign we are happily delivered from saying almost anything and the main interest for us turns now on that soubisehildburghausen wing of itwhich also is a sufficiently contemptible affair not to be spoken of beyond the strictly unavoidable  friedrich with his 23000 setting out from dresden august 30th has a march of about 170 miles towards erfurt he may expect to findcounting richelieu if royal highness of cumberland persist in acting zero as hithertoa confused mass of about 150000 enemies of one sort and other waiting him ahead not to think of those he has just left behindand he cannot well be in a triumphant humor behind before around it is one gathering of enemies one point only certain that he must beat them or else die readers would fain follow him in this forlorn march him the one point of interest now in it and readers shall if we can manage though it is extremely difficult for on getting to erfurt he finds his soubisehildburghausen army off on retreat among the inaccessible hills still farther westward and has to linger painfully there and to detach and even to march personally against other enemies and then these finished to march back towards his erfurt ones who are taking heart in the interimand in short from september 1st to november 5th there are two months of confused manoeuvring and marching to and fro in that westsaxon region which are very intricate to readers november 5th is a day unforgettable but anterior to that what can we do here dated are the three grand epochs of the thing which readers had better fix in mind as a preliminary  1 september 13th friedrich has got to erfurt neighborhood but soubise and company are off westward to the hills of eisenach wont come down friedrich obliged to linger thereabouts painfully waiting almost a month till  2 october 11th hearing that 15000 austrians that stolpen party left as rearguard at stolpen croats mainly under a general haddick are on march for berlin he rises in haste thitherward through leipzig torgau say 100 miles hears that haddick has been in berlin 16th17th october for one day and that he is off again full speed with a ransom of 30000 pounds which they have had to pay him upon which friedrich calls halt in the torgau countryand would have been uncertain what to do had not  3 soubise and company extremely elated with this haddick feat come out from their hills intent to deliver saxony after all so that friedrich has to turn back october 26th30th through leipzig again towardsin fact towards rossbach and november 5th in his old saale country which does not prove so wearisome as formerly  these are the cardinal dates these let the reader recur to if necessary and keep steadily in mind it will then perhaps be possible to intercalate in a manner intelligible to him what other lucent phenomena there are and these dismal wanderings and miserablest two months of friedrichs life will not be wholly a provoking blotch of enigmatic darkness but in some sort a thing with features in the twilight of the past     i friedrichs march to erfurt from dresden31st august13th september 1757  the march to erfurt was of twelve days and without adventure to speak of mayer and freebattalion had the vanguard friedrich there as usual main body under keith with ferdinand and moritz following in several columns straight towards their goal with steady despatch for twelve daysweather often very wet tempelhof i 229 rodenbeck i 317 not very correct in westphalen ii 20 c a personal diary of this march and of what followed on duke ferdinands part seidlitz with cavalry had gone ahead in search of one turpin a mighty hunter and hussar among the french who was threatening leipzig threatening halle but turpin made off at sound of him without trying fight so that seidlitz had only to halt and rejoin hoping better luck another time  a march altogether of the common typethe stages of it not worth marking except for special readersand of memorable to us offers only this if even this at rotha in leipzig country the eighth stage from dresden friedrich writes willing to try for peace if it be possible   to the marechal duc de richelieu  rotha 7th september 1757  i feel m le duc that you have not been put in the post where you are for the purpose of negotiating i am persuaded however that the nephew of the great cardinal richelieu is made for signing treaties no less than for gaining battles i address myself to you from an effect of the esteem with which you inspire even those who do not intimately know you  t is a small matter monsieur il sagit dune bagatelle only to make peace if people are pleased to wish it i know not what your instructions are but in the supposition that the king your master zow assured by your successes will have put it in your power to labor in the pacification of germany i address to you the sieur delcheset sieur balbi is the real name of him an italian engineer of mine who once served with you in the fontenoy timesand some say he has privately a 15000 pounds for your graces acceptancethe sieur delcheset in whom you may place complete confidence  though the events of this year afford no hope that your court still entertains a favorable disposition for my interests i cannot persuade myself that a union which has lasted between us for sixteen years may not have left some trace in the mind perhaps i judge others by myself but however that may be i in short prefer putting my interests into the king your masters hands rather than into any others if you have not monsieur any instructions as to the proposal hereby made i beg of you to ask such and to inform me what the tenor of them is  he who has merited statues at genoa ten years ago in those antiaustrian times when genoa burst up in revolt and the french and richelieu beautifully intervened against the oppressors he who conquered minorca in spite of immense obstacles he who is on the point of subjugating lower saxonycan do nothing more glorious than to restore peace to europe of all your laurels that will be the fairest work in this cause with the activity which has secured you such rapid progress otherwise and be persuaded that nobody will feel more grateful to you than monsieur le ducyour faithful friend frederic given in rodenbeck i 313 doubtless from memoires de richelieu paris 1793 ix 175 the one fountainhead in regard to this small affair

at versailles as desired with a peremptory negative for result nothing came of the richelieu attempt there nor of ce m de mirabeau if he ever went nor of any other on that errand needless to apply for peace at versailles and a mere waste of your sum of 15000 pounds which one hopes is fabulous in the present scarcity of moneyor should we perhaps have mentioned the thing at all except for the sake of wilhelmina whose fond scheme it is in this extremity of fate scheme which she tries in still other directions as we shall see her brother willing too but probably with much less hope if a civil letter and a bribe of money will do it these need not be spared  this at rotha is the day while winterfeld on moys hill is meeting his death today at pegau in this neighborhood seidlitz who could not fall in with turpin has given the hussars of loudon a beautiful slap the first enemy we have seen on this march and the lastnothing but loudon and hussars visibly about the rest of those soubisereichs people

richelieu with one sporcken a hanoverian and one lynar a dane rapidly finishing a thing they were pleased to call convention of klosterzeven which friedrich regarded as another huge misfortune fallen on himthough it proved to have been far the reverse a while after concerning which take this brief note cannot be too brief on such a topic  never was there a more futile convention than that of klosterzeven which filled all europe with lamentable noises indignations and anxieties during the remainder of that year and is now reduced for europe and the universe to a silent mathematical point or mere mark of position requiring still to be attended to in that character though itself zero in any other here are the main particulars in their sequence  august 3d towards midnight 11 pm say the books marechal de richelieu arrives in the destrees camp camp of oldendorf still only one march west of hastenbeck to whom destrees on the instant loftily delivers up his army explains with loyalty for a few days more all things needful to the new commander declines to be himself second and loftily withdraws to the baths of aachen for his health  royal highness of cumberland is by this time well on elbeward oceanward till august 1st for one week royal highness of cumberland lay at minden some thirty odd miles from hastenbeck deploring that sad mistake but unpersuadable to stand and try amendment of it august 1st the french advancing on him again he moved off northward seaward by nienburg verden rothenburg zeven bremenvorde stadearrived at stade on the tidal waters of the elbe august 5th and by necessity did halt there from minden onwards richelieu not destrees has had the chasing of royal highness one of the simplest functions only that the country is getting muddy difficult for artillerycarriage thinks richelieu with an army so dilapidated hungry short of pay and that royal highness a very furious person to our former knowledge might turn on us like a boar at bay endangering everything and finally that ones desire is not for battle but for a fair chance of plunder to pay ones debts  britannic majesty in this awful state of his hanover armaments has been applying at the

was a convention vague absurd not capable of being executed ratification of it refused by both courts by the french court first if that was any matterand the only thing now memorable of it is that it was a total futility but that there ensued from it a fact still of importance namely  that on the 5th of october following royal highness quitted stade and his wrecked army hanging sorrowful there like a flight of plucked cranes in midairarrived at kensington october 12th heard the paternal majesty say that evening here is my son who has ruined me and disgraced himselfand thereupon indignantly

since july 29th three days after hastenbeck pitt had been in office again such the bombardment by corporationboxes and events impinging on britannic majesty but not till now as i fancy had pitts way in regard to those german matters been clear to him the question of a german army if you must have a nogeneral at the top of it might well be problematical to pitt to equip your strong fighting man and send him on your errand regardless of expense and by way of preliminary cut the head off him before saying goodspeed to you strong man but with a general pitt sees that it can be different that perhaps america can be conquered in germany and that with a britannic majesty so disposed there is no other way of trying it to this course pitt stands henceforth heedless of the gazetteer cackle hah our pitt too become german after all his talkinglike a seventyfour under full sail with sea wind pilot all of one mind and only certain waterfowl objecting and is king of england for the next four years the one king poor england has had this long whilehis hand felt shortly at the ends of the earth and proves such a blessing to friedrich among others as nothing else in this war pretty much his one blessing little as he expected it before long excellency mitchell begins consulting about a generaland friedrich dimly sees better things in the distance and that klosterzeven had not been the misfortune he imagined but only the darkest hour which it is said lies nearest to the dawn     ii the soubise hildburghausen people take into the hills friedrich in erfurt neighborhood hanging on week

horns in this way should one horn enter before the other got out much parleying and supplicating on the part of erfurt till at last about 4 pm french being all off erfurt flung its gates open and the new power did enter with some due state prussian majesty in person who could have hoped it and prince henri beside him cavalry with drawn swords infantry with fieldpieces and the band playingprussian

shall see     lamentationpsalms of friedrich  meanwhile is it not remarkable that friedrich wrote more verses this autumn than almost in any other three months of his life singular yes though perhaps not inexplicable and if readers could fairly understand that fact instead of running away with the shell of it and leaving the essence it would throw a great light on friedrich he is not a brooding inarticulate man then but a brightglancing articulate not to be struck dumb by the face of death itself flashes cleareyed into the physiognomy of death and ruin and the abysmal horrors opening and has a sharp word to say to them the explanation of his large cargo of verses this autumn is that always alternating with such fiery velocity he had intolerable periods of waiting till things were ready and took to verses by way of expectorating himself and keeping down his devils not a bad plan in the circumstancesespecially if you have so wonderful a turn for expectoration by speech all bad as poetry those verses asks the reader well some of them are not of firstrate goodness should have been burnt or the time marked which they took up and whether it was good time wasted which i suppose it

to say of it except strange  understand it or not we do gather by means of it some indisputable glimpses nearly all the direct insight allowed us out of any source into friedrichs inner man what his thoughts were what his humor was in that unique crisis and to readers in quest of that these pieces fallen obsolete and frosty to all other kinds of readers are well worth perusing and again perusing

dryasdust mahomets koran treated by the arab dryasdust merely turning up the bottom of that box of shoulderblades and printing them has become dreadfully tough reading on this side of the globe and has given rise to the impossiblest notions about mahomet indisputable it is heroes in their affliction mahomet and david have solaced themselves by snatches of psalms by suras bursts of utterance rising into songand if friedrich on far other conditions did the like what has history to say of blame to him  wilhelmina comes out very strong in this season of trouble almost the last we see of our excellent wilhelmina like a lioness like a shrill mother when her children are in peril a noble sisterly affection is in wilhelmina shrill pythian vehemence trying the impossible that a brother and such a brother the most heroic now breathing brave and true and the soul of honor in all things should have the whole world rise round him like a delirious sorcererssabbath intent to hurl the mountains on himseems such a horror and a madness to wilhelmina like the broodhen flying in the face of wild dogs and packs of hounds in full trail most christian pompadour kings enraged czarinas implacable empressqueens a whole world in armed delirium rushes on regardless of wilhelmina never mind my noble one your brother will perhaps manage to come up with this leviathan or that among the heap of them at a good time and smite into the fifth rib of him your brother does not the least shape towards giving in thank the heavens he will stand to himself at least his own poor strength will all be on his own side  wilhelminas hopes of a peace with france mission of her mirabeau missions and schemes not a few we have heard of on wilhelminas part with this view but the notablest is still to mention that of stirring up by voltaires means an importantlooking cardinal de tencin to labor in the business eminency tencin lives in lyon known to the princess on her italian tourshy of asking voltaire to dinner on that fine occasionbut except officially is not otherwise than wellaffected to voltaire was once chief minister of france and would fain again be does not like these bernis novelties and austrian alliances had he now any power to overset them let him correspond with most christian majesty at least plead for a peace with prussia prussia being so ready that way eminency tencin on voltaires suggestion did so perhaps is even now doing so till ordered to hold his peace on such subjects this is certain and well known but nothing else is known or to us knowable about it voltaire in vague form being our one authority through whom it is vain to hunt and again hunt oeuvres memoires ii 92 93 ib i 143 preuss ii 84 the dates much more the features and circumstances all lie buried from us andtill perhaps the lamentationpsalms are well editedmust continue lying as a fact certain but undeniably vague  voltaires procedure one can gather is polite but twofaced not sublime on this occasion in fact is intended to serve himself to the high princess he writes devotionally ready to obey in all things and then to his eminency cardinal tencin it rather seems as if the tone were pooh yes your eminency such are the poor ladys notions but does your eminency take notice how high my connections are what service a poor obscure creature might perhaps do the state some day friedrich himself is in these ways brought into correspondence with voltaire again and occasionally writes to him in this war and ever afterwards voltaire responds with fine sympathy always prettily in the enthusiasm of the momentand at other times he writes a good deal about friedrich oftenest in rather a mischievous dialect the traitor exclaim some prussian writers not many or important in our time in fact there is a considerable touch of grinning malice as of monkey versus cat who had once burnt his paw instead of getting his own burnt in those utterances of voltaire some of which the reader will grin over too without much tragic feelingthe rather as they did our felis leo no manner of ill and show our incomparable singe with a sparkle of the tigre in him theoretic sparkle merely and for moments which makes him all the more entertaining and interesting at the domestic hearth  of friedrichs lamentationpsalms we propose to give the first and the last these with certain prose pieces intermediate and connecting may perhaps be made intelligible to readers and throw some light on these tragic weeks of the kings history  1 epitre a ma soeur first of the lamentationpsalmsthis is the famed epistle to wilhelmina already spoken of which the king despatched from bernstadt august 24th just while quitting those parts on the erfurt errandthough written before in the tedium of waiting

and condense into our briefest prosereaders can add water and the jingle of french rhymes ad libitum it starts thus  o sweet and dear hope of my remaining days o sister whose friendship so fertile in

bids me transmit to you note lost that great man is still the same he supports his misfortunes with a courage and a firmness worthy of him he could not get the note transcribed it began by verses instead of throwing sand on it he took the inkbottle that is the reason why it is cut in two this note we say is lost to usall but accidentally thus voltaire 12th september writes twice to friends

much more lamentable the one we are now reading  i am in a frightful state and will not survive the destruction of my house and family that is the one consolation that remains to me you will have fine subjects for making tragedies of o times o manners you will by the illusory representation perhaps draw tears while all contemplate with dry eyes the reality of these miseries the downfall of a whole house against which if the truth were known there is no solid complaint i cannot write farther of it my soul is so troubled that i know not what i am doing but whatever happen be persuaded that i am

abundance of honor and glory without wounds and to you madame unalterable health the king of prussia has written me a very touching letter one line of which we have read but i have always madame

voltaire again with answer second of the prose piecesnot a very zealous friend of friedrichs after all this voltaire poor wilhelmina terrified by that epitre of her brothers and his fixed purpose of seeking death has in her despair though her letter is lost been urging voltaire to write dissuading himas voltaire does of which presently her letter to voltaire on this thriceimportant subject is lost but in the very hours while voltaire sat writing what we have just read always with madame deniss adventure on my heart wilhelmina at baireuth is again writing to him as follows  baireuth 12th september 1757 to voltaireyour letter has sensibly touched me that which you addressed to me for the king both letters lost to us has produced the same effect on him i hope you will be satisfied with his answer as to what concerns yourself but you will be as little so as i am with the resolutions he has formed i had flattered myself that your reflections would make some impression on his mind you will see the contrary by the letter adjoined to me there remains nothing but to follow his destiny if it is unfortunate i have never piqued myself on being a philosopher though i have made my efforts to become so the small progress i made did teach me to despise grandeurs and riches but i could never find in philosophy any cure for the wounds of the heart except that of getting done with our miseries by ceasing to live the state i am in is worse than death i see the greatest man of his age my brother my friend reduced to the frightfulest extremity i see my whole family exposed to dangers and perhaps destruction my native country torn by pitiless enemies the country where i am reichs army anspach what not menaced by perhaps similar misfortune would to heaven i were alone loaded with all the miseries i have described to you i would suffer them and with firmness  pardon these details you invite me by the part you take in what regards me to open my heart to you alas hope is wellnigh banished from it fortune when she changes is as constant in her persecutions as in her favors history is full of those examplesbut i have found none equal to the one we now see nor any war as inhuman and as cruel among civilized nations you would sigh if you knew the sad situation of germany and preussen the cruelties which the russians commit in that latter country make nature shudder details horrible but authentic in heldengeschichte  already cited how happy you in your hermitage where you repose on your laurels and can philosophize with a calm mind on the deliriums of men i wish you all the happiness imaginable if fortune ever favor us again count on all my gratitude i will never forget the marks of attachment which you have given my sensibility is your warrant i am never halfandhalf a friend and i shall always be wholly so of brother voltairewilhelmina  many compliments to madame denis continue i pray you to write to the king in voltaire ii 197199 lxxvii 57  voltaire to wilhelmina day uncertain the delices september 1757madam my heart is touched more than ever by the goodness and the confidence your royal highness deigns to show me how can i be but melted by emotion i see that it is solely your nobleness of soul that renders you unhappy i feel myself born to be attached with idolatry to superior and sympathetic minds who think like you you know how much i have always essentially and at heart been attached to the king your brother the more my old age is tranquil and come to renounce everything and make my retreat here a home and country the more am i devoted to that philosopherking i write nothing to him but what i think from the bottom of my heart nothing that i do not think most true and if my letter dissuasive of seeking death wait reader appears to your royal highness to be suitable i beg you to protect it with him as you have done the foregoing in voltaire lxxvii 37 39  4 friedrich to wilhelmina and by anticipation her answer third of the prose pieceskirschleben near erfurt 17th september 1757my dearest sister i find no other consolation but in your precious letters may heaven reward so much virtue and such heroic sentiments  since i wrote last to you my misfortunes have but gone on accumulating it seems as though destiny would discharge all its wrath and fury upon the poor country which i had to rule over the swedes have entered pommern the french after having concluded a neutrality humiliating to the king of england and themselves klosterzeven which we know are in full march upon halberstadt and magdeburg from preussen i am in daily expectation of hearing of a battle having been fought the proportion of combatants being 25000 against 80000 was fought grossjagersdorf 30th august and lost accordingly the austrians have marched into silesia whither the prince of bevern follows them i have advanced this way to fall upon the corps of the allied army which has run off and intrenched itself behind eisenach amongst hills whither to follow still more to attack them all rules of war forbid the moment i retire towards saxony this whole swarm will be upon my heels happen what may i am determined at all risks to fall upon whatever corps of the enemy approaches me nearest i shall even bless heaven for its mercy if it grant me the favor to die sword in hand  should this hope fail me you will allow that it would be too hard to crawl at the feet of a company of traitors to whom successful crimes have given the advantage to prescribe the law to me how my dear my incomparable sister how could i repress feelings of vengeance and of resentment against all my neighbors of whom there is not one who did not accelerate my downfall and will not share in our spoils how can a prince survive his state the glory of his country his own reputation a bavarian elector in his nonage son of the late poor kaiser and left shipwrecked in his seventeenth year or rather in a sort of subjection to his ministers and dull to the biddings of honor may give himself up as a slave to the imperious domination of the house of austria and kiss the hand which oppressed his father i pardon it to his youth and his ineptitude but is that the example for me to follow no dear sister you think too nobly to give me such mean lache advice is liberty that precious prerogative to be less dear to a sovereign in the eighteenth century than it was to roman patricians of old and where is it said that brutus and cato should carry magnanimity farther than princes and kings firmness consists in resisting misfortune but only cowards submit to the yoke bear patiently their chains and support oppression tranquilly never my dear sister could i resolve upon such ignominy  if i had followed only my own inclinations i should have ended it je me serais depeche at once after that unfortunate battle which i lost but i felt that this would be weakness and that it behooved me to repair the evil which had happened my attachment to the state awoke i said to myself it is not in seasons of prosperity that it is rare to find defenders but in adversity i made it a point of honor with myself to redress all that had got out of square in which i was not unsuccessful not even in the lausitz after those zittau disasters last of all but no sooner had i hastened this way to face new enemies than winterfeld was beaten and killed near gorlitz than the french entered the heart of my states than the swedes blockaded stettin now there is nothing effective left for me to do there are too many enemies were i even to succeed in beating two armies the third would crush me the enclosed note in cipher will show you what i am still about to try it is the last attempt  the gratitude the tender affection which i feel towards you that friendship true as the hills constrains me to deal openly with you no my divine sister i shall conceal nothing from you that i intend to do all my thoughts all my resolutions shall be open and known to you in time i will precipitate nothing but also it will be impossible for me to change my sentiments  as for you my incomparable sister i have not the heart to turn you from your resolves we think alike and i cannot condemn in you the sentiments which i daily entertain eprouve life has been given to us as a benefit when it ceases to be such i have nobody left in this world to attach me to it but you my friends the relations i loved most are in the grave in short i have lost everything if you take the resolution which i have taken we end together our misfortunes and our unhappiness and it will be the turn of them who remain in this world to provide for the concerns falling to their charge and to bear the weight which has lain on us so long these my adorable sister are sad reflections but suitable to my present condition  the day before yesterday i was at gotha yes see aboveand tomorrow if i knew it seidlitz with pictorial effects will be there  but it is time to end this long dreary letter which treats almost of nothing but my own affairs i have had some leisure and have used it to open on you a heart filled with admiration and gratitude towards you yes my adorable sister if providence troubled itself about human affairs you ought to be the happiest person in the universe your not being such confirms me in the sentiments expressed at the end of my epitre in conclusion believe that i adore you and that i would give my life a thousand times to serve you these are the sentiments which will animate me to the last breath of my life being my beloved sister everyourf oeuvres xxvii i 303307  wilhelminas answerby anticipation as we said written 15th september while friedrich was dining at gotha in quest of soubise  baireuth 15th september 1757 my dearest brother your letter and the one you wrote to voltaire my dear brother have almost killed me what fatal resolutions great god ah my dear brother you say you love me and you drive a dagger into my heart your epitre which i did receive made me shed rivers of tears i am now ashamed of such weakness my misfortune would be so great in the issue there alluded to that i should find worthier resources than tears your lot shall be mine i will not survive either your misfortunes or those of the house i belong to you may calculate that such is my firm resolution  but after this avowal allow me to entreat you to look back at what was the pitiable state of your enemy when you lay before prag it is  occur again when one is least expecting it caesar was the slave of pirates and he became the master of the world a great genius like yours finds resources even when all is lost and it is impossible this frenzy can continue my heart bleeds to think of the poor souls in preussen apraxin and his christian cossacks therewho it is noted far excel the calmuck worshippers of the dalailama what horrid barbarity the detail of cruelties that go on there i feel all that you feel on it my dear brother i know your heart and your sensibility for your subjects  i suffer a thousand times more than i can tell you nevertheless hope does not abandon me i received your letter of the 14th by w who w is no mortal knows what kindness to think of me who have nothing to give you but a useless affection which is so richly repaid by yours i am obliged to finish but i shall never cease to be with the most profound respect

october 9thvoltaires dissuasive letter is a poor piece oeuvres de voltaire  lxxvii 8085 les delices early in september 1757 no date given not worth giving here remarkable only by friedrichs quiet reception of it which readers shall now see as finis to those lamentationpsalms there is another of them widely known which we will omit the epitre to dargens in  oeuvres de frederic xii 5056 erfurt 23d september 1757  passionate enough wandering wildly over human life and sincere almost to shrillness in parts which voltaire has also got hold of omissible here the fixity of purpose being plain otherwise to voltaire and us voltaires counterarguments are weak or worse that roman death is not now expected of the philosopher that your majesty will in the worst event still have considerable dominions left all that your greatgrandfather had still plenty of resources that in paris society an estimable minority even now thinks highly of you that in paris itself your majesty does not say expressly as dethroned and going on your travels would have resources to which beautiful considerations friedrich answers not with fire and brimstone as one might have dreaded but in this quiet manner reponse au sieur voltaire           je suis homme il suffit et ne pour la souffrance           aux rigueurs du destin joppose ma constance  i am a man and therefore born to suffer to destinys rigors my steadfastness must correspondquotation from i know not whom  but with these sentiments i am far from condemning cato and otho the latter had no fine moment in his life except that of his death

water and the jingle out of it and give the substance in prose  yes if i were voltaire and a private man i could with much composure leave fortune to her whirlings and her plungings to me contented with the needful her mad caprices and sudden topsyturvyings would be amusing rather than tremendous  i know the ennui attending on honors the burdensome duties the jargon of grinning flatterers those pitiabilities of every kind those details of littleness with which you have to occupy yourself if set on high on the stage of things foolish glory has no charm for me though a poet and king when once atropos has ended me forever what will the uncertain honor of living in the temple of memory avail one moment of practical happiness is worth a thousand years of imaginary in such templeis the lot of high people so very sweet then pleasure gentle ease true and hearty mirth have always fled from the great and their peculiar pomps and labors  no it is not fickle fortune that has ever caused my sorrows let her smile her blandest let her frown her fiercest on me i should sleep every night refusing her the least worship but our respective conditions are our law we are bound and commanded to shape our temper to the employment we have undertaken voltaire in his hermitage in a country where is honesty and safety can devote himself in peace to the life of the philosopher as plato has described it but as to me threatened with shipwreck i must consider how looking the tempest in the face i can think can live and can die as a king           pour moi menace du naufrage          je dois en affrontant lorage          penser vivre et mourir en roi          oeuvres xxiii 14  this is of october 9th this ends worthily the lamentationpsalms work having now turned up which is a favorable change friedrichs notion of suicide we perceive is by no means that of puking up ones existence in the weak sick way of felo de se but far different that of dying if he needs must as seems too likely in uttermost spasm of battle for self and rights to the last from which latter notion nobody can turn him a valiantly definite lucid and shiningly practical soulwith such a power of always expectorating himself into clearness again if he do frankly wager his life in that manner beware ye soubises karls and flaccid trivial persons of the stroke that may chance to lie in him     iii rumor of an inroad on berlin suddenly sets friedrich on march thither inroad takes effectwith important results chiefly in a lefthand form  october 11th express arrived important express from general finck who is in dresden convalescent from kolin and is even commandant there of anything there is to command that the considerable austrian brigade or outpost which was left at stolpen when the others went for silesia is all on march for berlin here is news the whole 15000 of them report addsthough it proved to be only a detachment picked tolpatches mostly and of nothing like that strength shot off under a swift general haddick on this errand between them and berlin is not a vestige of force and berlin itself has nothing but palisades and perhaps a poor 4000 of garrison march instantly you moritz who lie nearest cross elbe at torgau i follow instantly orders friedrich his message to moritz orlich p 73 rodenbeck p 322 dubious or wrongand that same night is on march or has cavalry pushed ahead for reinforcement of moritz  friedrich not doubting but there would be captaincy and scheme among his enemies considered that the swedes and perhaps the richelieu french were in concert with this austrian movementfrom east from north from west three invasions coming on the core of his dominionsand that here at last was work ahead and plenty of it that was friedrichs opinion and most other peoples when the austrian inroad was first heard of mere triple ruin coming to this king as the gazetteers judgedgreat alarm prevailing among the kings friends in berlin very great friedrich glad at any rate to have done with that dismal lingering at buttelstadt hastens to arrange himself for the new contingencies to post his keiths his ferdinands with their handfuls of force to best advantage and push ahead after moritz by leipzig torgau berlinwards with all his might at leipzig in such press of business and interestjudge by the following phenomenon what a cleargoing soul this is and how

to settle there things ready things not yet ready in view of the great events ahead seeing that he would have time after dinner he at once sent for professor gottsched a gigantic gentleman reigning king of german literature for the time being to come to him at 3 pm reigning king at that time since gone wholly to the dustbinspopular delusion as old samuel defines it having since awakened to itself with scornful hahas upon its poor gottsched and rushed into other roads worse and better its poor gottsched become a name now signifying pedantry stupidity learned inanity and the worship of colored water to every german mind  at 3 precise the portly old gentleman towards sixty now huge of stature with a shrieky voice and speaks uncommonly fast bowed himself in and a colloquy ensued on literature and so forth of the kind we may conceive colloquy which had great fame in the world gottsched himself havingsuch the inaccuracy of rumor and dutch newspapers on the matterpublished authentic report of it next year in a principal leipzig magazine with name signed given in heldengeschichte iv 728739 with multifarious commentaries and flourishings denoting an attentive world nicolai anekdoten iii 286290 now one of the dullest bits of reading and worth no mans bit of time colloquy which lasted three hours with the greatest vivacity on both sides king impugning for one principal thing the roughness of german speech gottsched in swift torrents far too copious in such company ready to defend those consonants of ours said the king they afflict ones ear what names we

rousseaus repeats a stanza who could express that in german with such melody and so on branching through a great many provinces kings knowledge of all literature new and ancient perfectly astonishing to me and i myself the swiftspeaking gottsched rather copious than otherwise catastrophe and summary of the whole was gottsched undertook to translate the rousseau stanza into german of moderate softness and by the aid of water did so that very night copied duly in heldengeschichte iv 726 sent it next day and had within an hour a gracious royal answer in verse calling one incidentally saxon swan cygne saxon though one is such a goose majesty to march at 7 tomorrow morning said a postscriptno interviewing more at present  about ten days after not to let this thing interrupt us again friedrich on his return to leipzig had another interview with gottsched of only one hour this timebut with many topics reading of some gottsched ode ode very tedious frothy watery of thanks to majesty for such goodness to the saxon swan reading too of some of madam gottscheds pieces majesty confessed afterwards every hour from the very first had lowered his opinion of the saxon swan till at length goosehood became too apparent friedrich sent him a gold snuffbox by and by but had no farther dialoguing  a saying of excellency mitchells to gottschedfor gottsched on that second leipzig opportunity went swashing about among the kings suite as wellis still remembered they were talking of shakspeare genial if you will said gottsched but the laws of aristotle five acts unities strictaristotle what is to hinder a man from making his tragedy in ten acts if it suit him better impossible your excellencypooh said his excellency suppose aristotle and general fashion too had ordered that the clothes of every man were to be cut from five ells of cloth how would the herr professor like with these huge limbs of his if he found there were no breeches for him on aristotles account adieu to gottsched

like a majorgeneral as he was but in the black suit of a country parsoncoming in that unnoticeable guise to inform friedrich officially that the hanoverians and majesty of england have resolved to

our fastnesses with friedrich once across saale and sticking to the skirts of us here from eyewitnesses where possible are the successive steps of dauphiness towards her doom which is famous in the world ever since  monday 31st october 1757 as the townsyndic of weissenfels records about eight in the morning muller schlacht bei rossbach a centenary piece berlin 1857containing several curious extracts p 44 heldengeschichte iv 643 651668 the king of prussia with his whole army or what seemed to us the whole though it was but a half keith with the other half being within reach to northward marching merseburg way came before this town has been here before as keith has as soubise and others have a town much agitated lately by transit of troops it was from the eastern or high landward side where the socalled castle is that friedrich came castle built originally on some white crag weisse fels not now conspicuous from which the town and whilom duchy take their name  we have often heard of weissenfels while the poor old drunken duke lived who used to be a suitor of wilhelminas liable to hard usage and have marched through it with the salzburgers in peaceable times a solid pleasantenough little place 6000 souls or so lies leant against high ground white crags or whatever it once was on the eastern or right bank of the saale a town in part flat in part very steep the streets of it or main street and secondaries running off level enough from the river and bridge rising by slow degrees but at last rapidly against the high ground or cliffs just mentioned a stiff acclivity of streets till crowned by the socalled castle the augustus burg in those days the friedrichwilhelm barrack in ours it was on this crown of the cliffs that his prussian majesty appeared  saale is of good breadth here has done perhaps two hundred miles since he started in the fichtelgebirge pine mountains on his long course elbeward received only ten miles ago his last big branch the widewandering unstrut coming in with much drainage from the northern partsin breadth saale may be compared to thames to tay or beauley his depth not fordable though nothing like so deep as thamess main cargo visible is rafts of timber banks green definite scant of wood river of rather dark complexion mainly noiseless but of useful pleasant qualities otherwise  from this castle or landward side come friedrich and his prussians on monday morning about eight the garrison some 4000 reichs folk and a french battalion or two shut the gates and assembled in the marketplacea big square close at the foot of the heights on the other hand from the top of the heights klammerk the particular spot the prussians cannonaded town and gates to speedy bursting open of the same and rushed in over the walls of the castlecourt and by other openings into the town so that the garrison above said had to quit and roll with all speed across the saale bridge and set the same on fire behind them this was their remedy for all the three bridges when attacked but it succeeded nowhere so well as here  the fire was of extreme rapidity prepared beforehand bridge all of dry wood coated with pitchfire reinforced too in view of such event by all the suet lard and oleaginous matter the garrison could find in weissenfels some hundredweights of tallowdips for one item going up on this occasion bridge worth 100000 thalers is instantly ablaze some 400 finding the bridge so flamy and the prussians at their skirts were obliged to surrenderfeldmarschall hildburghausen sleeping about two miles off gets himself awakened in this unpleasant manner flying garrison halt on the other side of the river where the rest of their army is plant cannon there against quenching of the bridge and so keep firing answered by the prussians with much noise and no great mischief till 3 pm when the bridge is quite gone tollkeepers lodge and all and the enterprise of crossing there had plainly become impossible  friedrich quickly about a mile farther down the river has picked out another crossingplace in the interim and founded some new adequate plank or raft bridge there which by diligence all night will be crossable tomorrow so that except for amusing the enemy the cannonading may cease at weissenfels a certain duc de crillon in command at this weissenfels bridgeburning and cannonade has a chivalrous anecdote amounting nearly to zero when well examined about saving or sparing friedrichs life on this interesting occasion how being now on the safe side of the river he crillon with his staff taking some refection of breakfast after the furious flurry there had been there came to him one of his artillery captains stationed in an island in the river asking shall i shoot the king of prussia monseigneur he is down reconnoitring his end of the bridge shant i then to whom crillon gives a glass of wine and smilingly magnanimous answer to a negative effect memoires militaires de louis c duc de crillon  paris 1791 p 166as cited by preuss ii 88 concerning which one has to remark not only first that the artillery captains power of seeing friedrich which is itself uncertain would indeed mean the power of aiming at him but differs immensely from that of hitting him with shot so that this shall i kill the king was mainly thrasonic wind from captain bertin but secondly that there is no island in the river thereabouts for captain bertin to fire from so that probably the whole story is wind or little more dreamlike or at best some idle thrasonictheoretic question on the part of bertin proper answer thereto consisting mainly in a glass of wine from monseigneurall which on retrospection monseigneur feels or would fain feel to have been not theoreticthrasonic but practical and of a rather godlike nature zero mainly as we said friedrich thanks you for zero monseigneur  the prussians were billeted in the town that night says our syndic and in many a house there came to be twenty men and even thirty and above it lodged all was quiet through the night the french and the reichs folk were drawn back upon the higher grounds about burgwerben and on to tagwerben and we saw their watchfires burning friedrichs bridge meanwhile unmolested by the enemy is getting ready  keith looking across to merseburg on the morrow morning tuesday nov 1st whither he had marched direct with the other half of the army finds merseburg bridge destroyed or broken and soubise with batteries on the farther side intending to dispute the passage keith despatches duke ferdinand to halle another twelve miles down who finds halle bridge destroyed in like manner and broglio intending to dispute which however on second thoughts neither of them i did friedrichs new bridge at herrenmuhle lordships mill is of course an important point to them friedrichs passage now past dispute let us fall back say they and rank ourselves a little we are 50 or 60000 strong ill off for provisions but well able to retreat and have permission to fight on this side of the river  the combined army dauphiness or whatever we are to call it does on wednesday morning november 2d gather in its cannon and outskirts and give up the saale question retire landwards to the higher grounds some miles and diligently get itself united and into order of battle better or worse near the village of mucheln which means kirk michael and is still written sanct michel by some on this occasion there dauphiness takes post leaning on the heights not in a very scientific way leaving keith and ferdinand to rebuild their bridges unmolested and all prussians to come across at discretion which they have diligently done 2d3d november by their respective bridges and on thursday afternoon are all across encamped at bedra in close neighborhood to mucheln which friedrich has been out reconnoitring and finds that he can attack next morning very early  next morning accordingly by 2 oclock with a bright moon shining friedrich is on horseback his army following but on examining by moonlight the enemy have shifted their position turned on their axis more or less into new woodpatches new batteries and bogs which has greatly mended their affair no good attacking them so thinks friedrich and returns to his camp slightly cannonaded one wing of him from some battery of the enemy and immoderately crowed over by them dare not you see tried and was defeated cry their newspapers and theyfor one day friedrich lodges again in bedra this night others say in rossbach shifts his own camp a little left wing of it now at rossbach homebrook or beck soon to be a worldfamous hamlet the effects of hunger on the dauphiness so far from her supplies will he calculates be stronger than on him and will bring her to better terms shortly dauphiness needs bread one may have fine clipping at the skirts of her if she try retreat that dauphiness would play the prank she did next morning friedrich had not ventured to calculate     catastrophe of dauphiness saturday 5th november 1757  meandering saale is on one of his big turns as he passes weissenfels turning pretty rapidly here from southeastward which he was a dozen miles ago round to northeastward again or northward altogether which he gets to be at merseburg a dozen farther down right across from weissenfels lapped in this crook of the saale or washed by it on south side and on east rises with extreme laziness a dull circular lump of country six or eight miles in diameter with rossbach and half a dozen other scraggy sleepy hamlets scattered on itwhich till the morning of saturday 5th november 1757 had not been notable to any visitor the topmost point or points for there are two not discoverable except by tradition and guess the country people do call hills janushugel polzenhugelhill sensible to wagonhorses in those bad loose tracks of sandy mud but unimpressive on the tourist who has to admit that there seldom was so flat a hill rising let us guess forty yards in the three or four miles it has had might be called a perceptibly potbellied plain with more propriety flat country slightly puffed upin shape not steeper than the mould of an immense teasaucer would be teasaucer 6 miles in diameter 100 feet in depth and of irregular contour which indeed will sufficiently represent it to the readers mind  saale at four or five miles distance bounds this scraggy lump on the east and on the south westward and northward springing about mucheln on each hand and setting off to right and to left saaleward are what we take to be two brooks at least are two hollows and behind these the country rises higher undulating still on lazy terms but now painted azure by the distance not unpleasant to behold with its litter all lapped out of sight and its poor brooks tinkling forward as we judge into the saale merseburg way or reversewise into the unstrut the last big branch of saale southward from our janus height eight or nine miles off may be seen some vestige of freiburg steeple or gilt weathercock faintly visible on the unstrut yonderwhich i take to be soubises breadbasket at present and farther off and opposite the mouth of the unstrut well across the saale lies another namable town visible in clear weather as a smokecloud at certain hours about mealtime when the kettles are on boil the town of naumburgone of several german naumburgsthe naumburg of gustaf adolf where his slain body lay on the night of lutzen battle with his poor queen and others weeping over it naumburg is on the other side of saale not of importance to soubise in such posture  this is the circular block or lump of country on the north or northwest side of which friedrich now lies and which will become he little thinks how memorable on the morrow over the heights immediately eastward of friedrich there is a kind of hollow or scoopedout place shallow valley of some extent which deserves notice against tomorrow but in general the ground is lazily spherical and without noticeable hollows or valleys when fairly away from the river a dull blunt lump of country made of sand and mudmay have been grassy once with broom on it in the pastoral times is now under poor ploughhusbandry arable or scratchable in all parts and looks rather miserable in wintertime no vestige of hedge on it of shrub or bush one tree ugly but big which may have been alive in friedrichs time stands not far from rossbach hamlet one and no more discoverable in these areas  various hamlets lie sprinkled about very sleepy rusty irregular little places huts and cattlestalls huddled down as if shaken from a bag much straw thick thatch and crumbly mudbrick but looking warm and peaceable for the fourfooted and the twofooted which latter if you speak to them are solid reasonable people with energetic german eyes and hearts though so illlodged these hamlets needing shelter and springwater stand generally in some slight hollow if well up the height as rorschach is sometimes if near the bottom they are nestled in a sudden dell or gashwork of the primeval rains accumulating from above and ploughing out their way the rains we can see have been busy but there is seldom the least stream visible bottom being too sandy and porous on the western slope there is in our time a kind of coal or coaldust dug up in the way of quarrying not of mining and one or two big chasms of this sort are confusedly busy the natives mix this valuable coaldust with water mould it into bricks and so use as fuel one of the features of these hamlets is the strange black bricks standing on edge about the cottagedoors to drip and dry in the sun for this or for other reasons the westward slope appears to be the best and has a major share of hamlets on it rossbach is high up and looks over upon mucheln and its dim belfry and appurtenances which lie safe across the hollow perhaps two miles offsafe from friedrich if there were eatables and lodging to be had in such a place friedrichs left wing is in rossbach bedra where friedrichs right wing is branderode where the soubise right is then grost schevenroda zeuchfeld pettstadt lunstadtespecially reichartswerben where soubises right will come to be these the reader may take note of in his map several of them lie in ashes just then plundered replundered and at last set fire to so busy have soubises hungry people been of late in the country they came to deliver the freiburg road the naumburg road both towards merseburg cross this height straight like the string saale by weissenfels being the bow  the herrenhaus squires mansion still stands in rossbach with the littery hamlet at its flank a high pavilionroofed and though dilapidated pretentious kind of house some kind of court round it some kind of hedge or screen of brushwood and brickwall terribly in need of the besom it and its environment throughout king i suppose did lodge there overnight certain it is the squire was absent and the squires man three days afterwards reported to him as follows saturday the 5th about 8 am his majesty mounted to the roof of the herrenhaus here some tiles having been removed for that end or by accident is not said and saw how the french and reichs army were getting in movementwriggling out of their camp leftwards evidently aiming towards grost in about an hour near half their army was through grost and had turned southward rather southeastward from grost out in the rossbach and almsdorf region and proceeding still towards pettstadttowards schevenroda more precisely not towards pettstadt yet his majesty looked always through the perspective and to me was the grace done to be ever at his side and to name for him the roads the french and reichs army was marching muller p 50 rodenbeck p 326  the king had heard of this phenomenon hours before and had sent out hussars and scouts upon it but now sees it with his eyesgoing for freiburg and their breadcupboard thinks the king who does not as yet make much of the movement but will watch it well and calculates to have a stroke at the rear end of it in due season with which view the cavalry seidlitz and mayer are ordered to saddle foot regiments and all else to be in readiness this frenchreichs dauphiness is not rapid in her fieldexercise and has a great deal of wriggling and unwinding before she can fairly pick herself out and get forward towards schevenroda on the freiburg road in three or in two parallel columns artillery between them horse ahead horse arear haggling along theremaking for their breadbaskets thinks the king a body of french horse chiefly under st germain come out in the schortaualmsdorf part with some salvoing and prancing as if intending to attack about rossbach where our left wing is but his majesty sees it to be a pretence merely and st germain motionless and doing nothing but cannonade a little seems to agree that it is so dauphiness continues her slow movements king in this squires mansion of rossbach sits down to dinner dinner with officers at the usual hour of noonlittle dreaming what the dauphiness has in her head  truth is the dauphiness is in exultant spirits this morning intending great things against a certain little marquis of brandenburg to whom one does so much honor generals looking down yesterday on the king of prussias camp able to count every man in it and half the men being invisible owing to bends of the ground counted him to 10000 or so and had said pshaw are not we above 50000 let us end it take him on his left round yonder till we get upon his left and even upon his rear withal st germain cooperating on the other side of him on left on rear on front at the same moment is not that a sure game a very ticklish game answers surly sagacious lloyd no general will permit himself to be taken in flank with his eyes open and the king of prussia is the unlikeliest you could try it with  trying it meanwhile they are marching along by the low grounds here intending to sweep gradually leftwards towards janushill quarter there to sweep home upon him coil him up left and rear and front in their boaconstrictor folds and end his trifle of an army and him why not if we do our duty at all annihilate his trifle of an army take himself prisoner and so end it report says soubise had really in some moment of enthusiasm lately warned the versailles populations to expect such a thing and that the duchess of orleans forgetful of poor king louiss presence had in her enthusiasm exclaimed tant mieux i shall at last see a king then but perhaps it is a mere french epigram such as the winds often generate there and put down for factfriedrichs retreat to weissenfels is cut off for friedrich an austrian party has been at the herrenmuhle bridge this morning has torn it up and pitched it into the river planks far on to merseburg by this time and in fact unless friedrich be nimblebut that he usually is  friedrichs dinner had gone on with deliberation for about two hours friedrichs intentions not yet known to any but everybody great and small waiting eagerly for them like greyhounds on the slipwhen adjutant gaudi who had been on the housetop the while rushes into the diningroom faster than he ought and with some tremor in his voice and eyes reports hastily at schevenroda at pettstadt yonder enemy has turned to left clearly for the leftwell and if he do no flurry needed captain answered friedrichnot in these precise words but rebuking gaudi with a look not of laughter wholly and with a certain question as to the state of gaudis stomachic part which is still known in traditionary circles but is not mentionable hereand went with due gravity himself to the roof with his officers to the left sure enough meaning to attack us there the thing friedrich had despaired of is voluntarily coming thenand it is a thing of stern qualities withal a wager of life with glorious possibilities behind  friedrich earnestly surveys the phenomenon for some minutes in some minutes friedrich sees his way through it at least into it and how he will do it off eastward march swift are his orders almost still swifter the fulfillment of them prussian army is a nimble article in comparison with dauphiness in half an hours time all is packed and to the road and except mayer and certain freecorps or lighthorse to amuse st germain and his almsdorf people there is not a prussian visible in these localities to french eyes at halfpast two says the squires manor let us take him a sentence earlier to lose nothing of such a document at noon his majesty took dinner sat till about two oclock then again went to the roof and perceived that the enemys army at pettstadt were turning about the little wood there northeastward as if for lunstadt into the lunstadt roadsuch cannonading too from those almsdorf people that the balls flew over our headsor i tremulously thought so at halfpast two the word was given march and good speed they made about it in this herrenhaus and out of doors too striking their tents and cording up and trimly shouldering everything with incredible brevity as if machinery were doing it and at three on the prussian part all was packed and out into the court for being carried off and in fact the prussian army was on march at three seidlitz with all his horse vanishing round the corner of the height speeding along invisible on his northern slope there straight for the januspolzen hill part the infantry following doublequickwell knowing each what he has got to do  but at this interesting point the editorssmall thanks to them authentic but thricestupid mortalscut short our eyewitness not so much as telling us his name some of them not even his date or whereabouts and so the curtain tumbles down as if its string had been cut or suddenly eaten by unwise animals and we are left to gray hubbub and our own resources at secondhand except only that a french officerone of those cannonading from almsdorf no doubtdeclares that it was like a change of scene in the opera decoration dopera letter in muller p 60 in westphalen ii 128133 is a much superior french letter intercepted somewhere and fallen to duke ferdinand well worth reading on rossbach and the previous affairs so very rapid and that they all rolled off eastward at quick time at extremely quick timeand soon in the slight hollow behind janus hugel vanished from sight of these almsdorf french and of the soubisehildburghausen army in general which latter is agreeably surprised at the phenomenon and draws a highly flattering conclusion from it gone then off at doublequick for merseburg aha think the soubisehildburghausen people doublequick you too my pretty men lest they do whisk away and we never get a stroke at them  seidlitz meanwhile with his cavalry thirtyeight squadrons about 4000 horse is rapidly doing the order he has had seidlitz at a sharp military trot and the infantry at doublequick to keep up near him which they cannot quite do are as we have said making right across for the polzenhill and janushill quarter their route the string french route the bow and are invisible to the french owing to the heights between seidlitz when he gets to the proper point eastward will wheel about front to southward and be our left wing infantry as centre and right will appear in like manner andwe shall see  the exultant dauphiness or soubisehildburghausen army let us call it for brevitys sake dauphiness or french which it mainly was on that rapid disappearance of the prussians never doubted but the prussians were off on flight for merseburg to get across by the bridge there whereat dauphiness doubly exultant mended her own pace cavalry at a sharp trot infantry doublequick but unable to keep upfor the purpose of capturing or intercepting the runaway prussians speed my friendsif you would do a stroke upon friedrich and show the versailles people a king at last thus they hurrying on in two parallel columnsinfantry long floods of it coming doublequick but somewhat fallen behind cavalry 7000 or so as vanguardfaster and faster sweeping forward on their southern side of the janusandpolzen slope and now rather climbing the same  seidlitz has his hussar pickets on the top to keep him informed as to their motions and how far they are got seidlitz invisible on the south slope of the polzen hugel finds about halfpast three pm that he is now fairly ahead of dauphiness seidlitz halts wheels comes to the top got the flank of them sure enoughand without waiting signal or farther orders every instant being precious rapidly forms himself and plunges down on these poor people compact as a wall and with an incredible velocity dune vitesse incroyable says one of them figure the astonishment of dauphiness of poor broglio who commands the horse here taken in flank instead of taking other people intercepted not in the least needing to intercept has no time to form though he tried what he could only the two austrian regiments got completely formed the rest very incompletely and seidlitz in the blaze of rapid steel is in upon them the two austrian regiments and two french that are named made what debate was feasiblecourage nowise wanting in such sad want of captaincy nay soubise in person galloped into it if that could have helped but from the first the matter was hopeless seidlitz slashing it at such a rate and plunging through it and again through it thrice some say four times so that in the space of half an hour this luckless cavalry was all tumbling off the ground plunging downhill in full flight across its own infantry or whatever obstacle seidlitz on the hips of it and galloping madly over the horizon towards freiburg as it proved and was not again heard of that day  in about half an hour that bit of work was over and seidlitz with his ranks trimmed again had drawn himself southward a little into the hollow of tageswerben there to wait impending phenomena for friedrich with the infantry is now emerging over janus hill in a highly thunderous mannereighteen pieces of artillery going and four big guns taken from the walls of leipzig and there will be events anon it is said hildburghausen at the first glimpse of friedrich over the hilltop whispered to soubise we are lost royal highnesscourage soubise would answer and both let us hope did their utmost in this extremely bad predicament they had got into  friedrichs artillery goes at a murderous rate had come in view over the hilltop before seidlitz endednothing but the muzzles of it visible and the firetorrents from it to us poor french below friedrichs lines or rather his one line mere tip of his left wingonly seven battalions in it five of them under keith from the second or reserve line whole centre and right wing standing refused in oblique rank invisible behind the hillfriedrichs line we say the artillery to its right shoots out in mysterious prussian rhythm in echelons in potences obliquely down the janushill side straight rigid regular as iron clockwork and strides towards us silent with the lightning sleeping in itfriedrich has got the flank of dauphiness and means to keep it once and again and a third time poor soubise with his poor regiments much in an imbroglio here heaped on one another there with wide gaps halt being so suddenattempts to recover the flank and pushes out this regiment and the other rightward to be even with friedrich but sees with despair that it cannot be that friedrich with his echelons potences and mysterious prussian resources pulls himself out like the pieces of a prospectglass piece after piece hopelessly fast and seemingly no end to them and that the flank is lost and thatunhappy generals of dauphiness what a phenomenon for them a terrible friedrich not fled to merseburg at all but mounted there on the janus hill as on his saddlehorse with face quite the other wayand for holsterpistol has plucked out twentytwo cannon clad verily in fire chimeralike riding the janus hill in that manner left leg or wing of him spurning us into the abysses right one ready to help at discretion  hildburghausen i will hope does his utmost soubise broglio for certain do the french line is in front next the prussians poor generals of dauphiness are panting to retrieve themselves but with regiments jammed in this astonishing way and got collectively into the lions throat what can be done steady rigid as iron clockwork the prussian line strides forward at forty paces distance delivers its first shock of lightning bursts into platoon fire and so continues steady at the rate of five shots a minutehard to endure by poor masses all in a coil the artillery tore down whole ranks of us says the wutenberg dragoon his letter in muller p 83 the prussian musketry did terrible execution  things began o waver very soon french reeling back from the prussian fire reichs troops rocking very uneasy torn by such artillery when to crown the matter seidlitz seeing all things rock to the due extent bursts out of tageswerben hollow terribly compact and furious upon the rear of them which sets all things into inextricable tumble and the battle is become a rout and a riding into ruin no battle ever more lasted twentyfive minutes this second act of it or till halfpast four after which the curtains rapidly descending nights curtain were there no other cover the remainder the only stagedirection exeunt omnes which for a 50 or 60000 ridden over by seidlitz horse was not quite an easy matter they left of killed and wounded near 3000 of prisoners 5000 generals

appeared in stade on horseback at morning parade there intimating to what joy of the poor brunswick grenadiers and others that he was come to take command that klosterzeven is abolished that we are not an observation army rotting here in the parish pound any longer but an allied army such now our title intending to strike for ourselves and get out of pound straightway  thursday 24th novembertuesday 29th duke ferdinand did accordingly pick up the reins of this distracted affair and in a way wonderful to see shot sanity into every fibre of it and kept it sane and roadworthy for the five years coming with a silent velocity an energy an imperturbable steadfastness and clear insight into cause and effect which were creditable to the school he came from and were a very joyful sight to pitt and others concerned so that from next tuesday november 29th before daylight when ferdinands batteries began playing upon harburg french fortress nearest to stade the reign of the french ceased in those countries and an astonished richelieu and his french lying scattered over all the west of germany in readiness for nothing but plunder had to fall more or less distracted in their turn and do a number of astonishing things to try this and that of futile more or less frantic nature be driven from post after post be driven across the aller first of allrichelieu to go home thereupon

they are now grown  the effect of all which was that pitt with his ferdinands and reinforcements found work for the french ever onwards from rossbach french also turning as if exclusively upon perfidious albion and the thing became in teutschland as elsewhere a duel of life and death between these natural enemiesteutschland the centre of itteutschland and the accessible french seatownsbut

in lively sympathy and consultation with it but except the french subsidizings diplomatizings and great diligenae against him in foreign courts friedrich is in practical respects free of the french and ever after rossbach ferdinand and the english keep them in full workgrowing yearly too full a heavy business for england and ferdinand which is happily kept extraneous to friedrich thenceforth to him and us which is not on the stage of his affairs and ours but is to be conceived always as vigorously proceeding alongside of it close beyond the scenes and liable at any time to make tragic entry on him againof which we shall have to notice the louder occurrences and cardinal phases but for the future nothing more  soubise who had crept into the skirts of the richelieu army in hanover or hessen country had of course to take wing in that general fright before the mastiff soubise did not cross the rhine with it soubise made off eastward westphalen i 501 end of march 1758found new roost

tailand came back to the ferdinand scene to help there and never saw friedrich again both broglio and he had a good deal of fighting mostly beating from ferdinand and a great deal of trouble and sorrow in the course of this war but after rossbach it is not friedrich or we it is ferdinand and the destinies that have to do with them poor soubise except that he was the creature of generalissima pompadour which had something radically absurd in it did not deserve all the laughter he got a man of some chivalry some qualities as for broglio i remember always not without human emotion the two extreme points of his career as a soldier rossbach and the fall of the bastille he was towards forty when friedrich bestrode the janus hill in that fiery manner he was turned of seventy when from the

conquest of her imperial majestys continued to be administered in imperial majestys nameand are thriving as above  2 dauphiness proper that is soubise in thuringen at a late stage  letter from freiburg shortly after rossbachit was on the 23d october a sunday that we of freiburg had our first billeting of french a body of cavalry from different regiments going to take leipzig take torgau what not and from that day freiburg never emptied of french who kept marching through it in extraordinary quantities the marching lasted fourteen days namely till the 6th november day after rossbach when they burnt our poor bridge and marched for the last time and often the billeting was so heavy that in a single house there were forty or fifty men who at all times had to be lodged and dieted gratis nay many householders over and above the ordinary meal were obliged to give them money too and many poor people who can scarcely get their own bit of bread had to run and bring at once their sixteen or eighteen groschen pence worth of wine not to speak of coffee and sugar and a great increase of the mischief it was always that the soldiers and common people did not understand one anothers languageheavy billeting but what was that vast nearly impossible quantities of forage and provision were wrung from us as from all the other towns and villages about under continual threatening to burn and raze us from the earth often did our french colonel threaten he would have the cannon opened on freiburg straightway nay had it stood by foraging we might have reckoned ourselves lucky but our straits increased day by day and sheer plundering became more and more excessive  the robbing and torturing of travellers the plundering and burning of saxon villages almost all the towns and villages hereabouts are so plundered out that many a one now has nothing but what he carries on his body plundering was universal and no sooner was one party away than another came and still another and often the same house was three or four times plundered branderode a village two leagues from this stands on the field of rossbach if we look is so ruined out that nobody almost has anything left chief inspector baron von boses schloss there with its splendid appointments they ruined utterly took all money victuals valuables furniture clothes linen and beds all they could carry what could not be carried away they cut hewed and smashed to pieces broke the winecasks and even tore up the documents and letters they found lying in the place branderode dorf was twice set fire to by them and was at last with zeuchfeld which is an amtsdorfafter both had been plunderedreduced to ashes the churches of branderode and zeuchfeld with several other churches were plundered the altars broken the altarcloths and other vestures cut to pieces and the sacred vessels and cups carried awayexcept for we have a notarial exactness and will exaggerate nothing that in the case of branderode they sent the cup back of the pollution of the altars and of the blasphemous songs these people sang in the churches one cannot think without horror  and it was merely our pretended allies and protectors that have desecrated our divine service utterly wasted our country reduced the inhabitants to want and desperation and in short have so behaved that you would not know this region again truly these troops have realized for us most of the infamies we heard reported of the cossacks and their ravagings in preussen lately  it is one of their smallest doings that they robbed a saxon clergyman name and circumstances can be given if required three times over on the public highway shot at him tied him to a horses tail and dragged him along with them so that he is now lying ill in danger of his life on the whole it is our beloved pastors clergymen most of all that have been plundered of everything they had  balgart and zschieplitz both villages half a league from this have likewise been heavily plundered they have even left the parson nothing but what he wore on his back grost another rossbach place which belongs to the kammerjunker heldorf has likewise ohe satisall this happened between the 23d and 31st october consequently before the battle in many villages you see the trees and fields sprinkled with feathers from the beds that have been slit up  in several villages belonging to the royal electoral privy councillor von bruhl who is properly the fountain of all this and of much other misery to us if we knew it the plundering likewise had begun and a quantity of about a hundred swine so ho had been cut in pieces but in the midst of their work the allies heard that these were bruhl estates and ceased their havoc of them these accordingly are the only lands in all this region whose fate has been tolerable  the appellation every moment renewed of heretic was the courteous address from these people to our fellowchristians heretic dogs ketzerische hunde was a pradicat always

town this troop consisted of 80 men part infantry part cavalry with some 80 workhorses 10 baggagewagons and about 100 persons women sick people and the like they stayed the whole night here made meat drink corn hay and whatever they needed be brought them and went off next day without paying anything  our inns were now almost quite exhausted of forage in corn or hay and we knew not how we were to pay what had been spentwhen the thirty french light cavalry of whom we with profound submission on the 13th hujus gave your royal majesty and electoral translucency account renewed their visit upon us came under the command of rittmeister de mocu on the 22d of october while the baggagewagons workhorses women sick and so forth were hardly gone towards evening into the town consumed in meat and drink oats and hay and the like what they could lay hold of and next morning early marched away paying as their custom is nothing  not enough thatbesides the great foragecontribution lieferung which we already with profound submission notified to your royal majesty and electoral translucency as having been laid upon us and that by order of the duc de broglio a new requisition is now laid on us and we have had to engage for sixtyfour more sacks of wheat and thirtytwo of rye as is noted under head a in the enclosed copythere has farther come on us on the part of the reichs army from kreiscommissarius heldorf whose schloss of grost we perceive they have since burnt by way of thanks to him supra no 2 the simultaneous order for instant delivery of forage as under head b here enclosed thus are we at the appointed places all at once to furnish such quantities more than we can raise and know not when or where we shall either for what has been already furnished or for what is still to be receive one penny of money nay over and above we are to sustain the many marchings of troops and provide to the same what meat drink oats hay and so on they require without the least return of payment  so unendurable and taken all together so hard sic begins the conduct of these troops that profess being come as friends and helpers to appear to us and heaven alone knows how long under a continuance of such things the subjects whom the hailstorm of last year had at any rate impoverished shall be able to support the same we would were a reasonable delivery of forage laid upon us even at a low price and the board and billet of the marching troops paid to us even in part lay out our whole strength in helping to bear the burdens of the fatherland but if such things go on

chapter ixfriedrich marches for silesia  the fame of friedrich is high enough again in the gazetteer world all people and the french themselves laughing at their grandiloquent dauphinessbellona and writing epigrams on soubise but friedrichs difficulties are still enormous one enemy coming with open mouth you plunge in upon and ruin on this hand and it only gives you room to attempt upon another bigger one on that soubise he has finished handsomely for this season but now he must try conclusions with prince karl quick towards silesia after this glorious victory which the gazetteers are celebrating  the news out of silesia are ominously doubtful bad at the best duke bevern once winterfeld was gone had as we observed felt himself free to act unchecked but also unsupported by counsel of the due heroism and had acted unwisely made direct for silesia namely where are mealmagazines and strong places prince karl they say was also unwise took no thought beforehand or he might have gained marches disputed rivers bober queiss with bevern and as good as hindered him from ever getting to silesia so say critics retzow and others perhaps looking too fixedly on one side of the question certain it is bevern marched in peace to silesia found it by no means the better place it had promised to be  prince karldaun there as second but karl now the dominant handwas on the heels of bevern march after march prince karl cut athwart him by one cunning march in liegnitz country barring him from schweidnitz the chief stronghold of silesia and to appearance from breslau the chief city too bevern who did not want for soldiership when reduced to his shifts now made a beautiful manoeuvre say the critics struck out leftwards namely and crossed the oder as if making for glogau quite beyond prince karls sphere of possibilitybut turned to right not to left when across and got in upon breslau from the other or east side of the river cunning manoeuvre if you will and followed by cunning manoeuvres but the result is prince karl has got schweidnitz to rear stands between breslau and it can besiege schweidnitz when he likes and no relief to it possible that will not cost a battle a battle thinks friedrich is what bevern ought to have tried at first a wellfought battle might have settled everything and there was no other good likelihood in such an expedition but now by detaching reinforcements to this garrison and that he has weakened himself beyond right power of fighting oeuvres de frederic iv 141 159 schweidnitz is liable to siege breslau with its poor walls and multitudinous population can stand no siege worth mentioning the silesian strong places not to speak of mealmagazines are like to go a bad road quite dominant this prince karl placarding and

silesia is her imperial majestys again which seems to be fast becoming the factunless contradicted better quick  bevern has now october 1st no manoeuvre left but to draw out of breslau post himself on the southern side of it in a safe angle there marshy lohe in front broad oder to rear breslau at his righthand with bread and there intrenching himself by the best methods wait slowly in a sitting posture events which are extensively on the gallop at present one fancies had winterfeld been still there it is as brave an army 30000 or more as ever wore steel surely something could have been done with itsomething better than sit watching the events on full gallop all round bevern was a loyal considerably skilful and valiant man in the battle of lobositz and elsewhere we have seen him brave as a lion but perhaps in the other kind of bravery wanted here hewell his case was horribly difficult full of intricacy and he sat no doubt in a very wretched state consulting the oracles with events which are themselves oracular going at such a pace  schweidnitz was besieged october 26th nadasti with 20000 was set to do it prince karl with 60000 ready to protect him prince bevern asking the oracleswhat a bit of news for friedrich breaking suddenly the effulgency of rossbach with a bar of ominous black friedrich still in the thick of pure saxon business makes instant arrangement for silesia as well prince henri with such and such corps to maintain the saale and guard saxony marshal keith with such and such to step over into bohemia and raise contributions at least and tread on the tail of the big silesian snake all this friedrich settles within a week takes certain corps of his own effective about 13000 and on november 13th marches from leipzig round by torgau by muhlberg grossenhayn by bautzen weissenberg across the queiss across the bober and so with long marches strides continually forward all hearts willing and all limbs though in this sad winter weather towards relief of schweidnitz  at grossenhayn fifth day of the march friedrich learns that schweidnitz is gone november 12th14th schweidnitz went by capitulation contrary to everybodys hope or fear certainly a very short defence for such a fortress fault of the commandant was everybodys first thought not probably the best of commandants said others gradually but his garrison had saxons in itone day 180 of them in a lump threw down their arms in the trenches and went over to the enemy owing to whatsoever the place is gone such towers such curtains starramparts such an opulence of cannons stores munitions a 30000 pounds of hard cash one item all is gone after a fortnights siege what a piece of news as heard by friedrich coming at his utmost towards the scene itself as seen by bevern too in his questioning mood it was an event of very oracular nature  on monday 14th schweidnitz fell karl with nadasti reunited to him was now 80000 odd and lost no time on tuesday next november 22d 1757 at three in the morning long hours before daybreak karl with his 60000 all learnedly arranged comes rolling over upon hapless bevern with no end of cannonading and storm of war battle of breslau they call it ruinous to bevern of which we shall attempt no description except to say that karl had five bridges on the lohe came across the lohe by five bridges and that bevern stood to his arms steady as the rocks to prevent his getting over and to entertain him when over that there were five principal attacks renewed and rerenewed as long as needful with torrents of shot of death and tumult over six or eight miles of country for the space of fifteen hours battle comparable only to malplaquet said the austrians such a hurricane of artillery strongly intrenched enemy and loud doomsday of war did not end till nine at night austrians victorious more or less in four of their attacks or separate enterprises that is to say masters of the lohe and of the outmost prussian villages and posts in front of the prussian centre and right wing victorious in that northern partbut plainly unvictorious in the southeast or prussian left wingfarthest off from breslau and under ziethens commandwhere they were driven across the lohe again and lost prisoners and cannons or a cannon in seyfarth three accounts  beylagan ii 198 221 234 et seq  some of beverns people grounding on this latter circumstance and that they still held the battlefield or most part of it wrote themselves victoriousthough in a dim brief manner as if conscious of the contrary which indeed was the fact at the council of war which he summoned that evening there were proposals of nightattack and other fierce measures but bevern rejecting the plan for a night attack on the austrian camp as too dubious did in the dark hours through the silent streets of breslau withdraw himself across the oder instead leaving 80 cannon and 5000 killed and wounded an evidently beaten man and army and indeed did straightway disappear personally altogether as no longer equal to events rode out namely to reconnoitre in the gray of his second sad morning on this new bank of the oder saw little except gray mist but rode into a croat outpost only one poor groom attending him and was there made prisonerintentionally thought mankind intentionally thinks friedrich who was very angry with the poor man preuss ii 102 more exact in kutzen der tag von

friedrich sternly from the distance and would not see him at all to stettin i say your official post in time of peace command me the invalid garrison there you are fit for nothing betteri will add one other thing which unhappily will seem strange to readers that there came no whisper of complaint from bevern mere silence and loyal industry with his poor means from bevern and that he proved heroically useful in stettin two years hence against the swedes against the russians in the siegeofcolberg time and gained friedrichs favor again with other good results which i observe was a common method with prussian generals and soldiers when unjustly or justly they fell into trouble of this kind and a much better one than that of complaining in the newspapers and demanding commissions of inquiry presided over by chaos and the fourthestate now is  bevern being with the croats the prussian army falls to general kyau as next in rank who directly in the teeth of fierce orders that are speeding hither for bevern and him marches away leaving breslau to its fate and making towards glogau as the one sure point in this wreck of things and prince karl that same day goes upon breslau which is in no case to resist and be bombarded so that poor old general lestwitz the prussian commandantalways thought to be a valiant old gentleman but who had been wounded in the late action and was

message more and more rigorous precise and indignant do this do that your dilection shall answer it with your headnot one message of which reached his dilection till dilection and fate such the gallop of events had done the contrary and now dilection and his head have made a finish of it no answers friedrich to himself not till we are all finishedand pushes on he too like a kind of fate what does or can he mean then say the austrians with scornful astonishment and think his head must be turning will he beat us out of silesia with his potsdam guardparade then potsdamsche wachtparadeso they denominate his small army and are very mirthful in their messrooms i will attack them if they stood on the zobtenberg if they stood on the steeples of breslau said friedrich and tramped diligently forward day after day as the real tidings arrive his outlook in silesia is becoming darker and darker a sternly dark march this altogether prince karl has thrown a garrison into liegnitz on friedrichs road prince karl lies encamped with breslau at his back has above 80000 when fully gathered and reigns supreme in those parts darker march there seldom was all black save a light that burns in one

november 28th and there rests or at least his weary troops do till ziethen come up the king not very restful with so many things to prearrange a life or death crisis now nigh well it is but death and death has been fronted before now we who are after the event on the safe sunny side of it can form small image of the horrors and the inward dubieties to him who is passing through itand how hope is needed to shine heroically eternal in some hearts fire of hope that does not issue in mere blazings mad audacities and chaotic despair but advances with its eyes open measuredly counting its steps to the wrestlingplacethis is a godlike thing much available to mankind in all the battles they have battles with steel or of whatever sort  friedrich at parchwitz assembled his captains and spoke to them it was the night after ziethen came in night of december 3d 1757 and ziethen no doubt was there for it is an authentic meeting this at parchwitz and the words were taken down   friedrichs speech to his generals parchwitz 3d december 1757 from retzow i 240242 slightly abridged  it is not unknown to you meine herren what disasters have befallen here while we were busy with the french and reichs army schweidnitz is gone duke of bevern beaten breslau gone and all our warstores there good part of silesia gone and in fact my embarrassments would be at the insuperable pitch had not i boundless trust in you and your qualities which have been so often manifested as soldiers and sons of your country hardly one among you but has distinguished himself by some nobly memorable action all these services to the state and me i know well and will never forget  i flatter myself therefore that in this case too nothing will be wanting which the state has a right to expect of your valor the hour is at hand i should think i had done nothing if i left the austrians in possession of silesia let me apprise you then i intend in spite of the rules of art to attack prince karls army which is nearly thrice our strength wherever i find it the question is not of his numbers or the strength of his position all this by courage by the skill of our methods we will try to make good this step i must risk or everything is lost we must beat the enemy or perish all of us before his batteries so i read the case so i will act in it  make this my determination known to all officers of the army prepare the men for what work is now to ensue and say that i hold myself entitled to demand exact fulfilment of orders for you when i reflect that you are prussians can i think that you will act unworthily but if there should be one or another who dreads to share all dangers with me hecontinued his majesty with an interrogative look and then pausing for answercan have his discharge this evening and shall not suffer the least reproach from memodest strong bass murmur meaning no by the eternal if you looked into the eyes and faces of the group never will retzow junior forget that scene and how effulgently eloquent the veteran physiognomies were  hah i knew it said the king with his most radiant smile none of you would desert me i depend on your help then and on victory as surethe speech winds up with a specific passage the cavalry regiment that does not on the instant on order given dash full plunge into the enemy i will directly after the battle unhorse and make it a garrison regiment the infantry battalion which meet with what it may shows the least sign of hesitating loses its colors and its sabres and i cut the trimmings from its uniform now goodnight gentlemen shortly we have either beaten the enemy or we never see one another again  an excellent temper in this army a rough vein of heroism in it steady to the deathand plenty of hope in it too hope in vater fritz never mind the soldiers used to say in john duke of marlboroughs time corporal john will get us through itthat same evening friedrich rode into the camp where the regiments he had were now all gathered out of their cantonments to march on the morrow first regiment he came upon was the lifeguard cuirassiers the men in their accustomed way gave him goodevening which he cheerily returned some of the more veteran sort asked ruggedly confidential as well as loyal what is thy news then so late good news children kinder tomorrow you will beat the austrians tightly that we will by answered theybut think only where they stand yonder and how they have intrenched themselves said friedrich and if they had the devil in front and all round them we will knock them out only thou lead us onwell i will see what you can do now lay you down and sleep sound and good sleep to you goodnight fritz answer all muller p 21 from kaltenhorn of whom infra preuss c c as fritz ambles on to the next regiment to which as to every

manteuffel of foot yes no other archenholtz ii 61 and kutzen p 35 they have their own opinion of their capacities against an enemy and do not want for a good conceit of themselves well children how think you it will be tomorrow they are twice as strong as we never thou mind that there are no pommerners among them thou knowest what the pommerners can dofriedrich yea truly that do i otherwise i durst not risk the battle now good sleep to you tomorrow then we shall either have beaten the enemy or else be all dead yea answered the whole regiment dead or else the enemy beaten and so went to deep sleep preface to a deeper for many of themas beseems brave men in this world it much beseems the brave man uncertain about so many things to be certain of himself for one thing  these snatches of camp dialogue much more the speech preserved to us by retzow junior appear to be true though as to the dates the circumstances there has been debating kutzen pp 175181 other anecdotes dubious or more still float about in quantityof which let us give only one that of the deserter which has merit as a myth what made thee desert then hm alas your majesty we were got so down in the world and had such a time of itwell try it one day more and if we cannot mend matters thou and i will both desert  a learned doctor one of the most recent on these matters is astonished why the histories of friedrich should be such dreary reading and friedrich himself so prosaic barren an object and lays the blame upon the age insensible to real greatness led away by claptrap napoleonisms regardless of expense upon which smelfungus takes him up with a twitch  to my sad mind herr doctor it seems ascribable rather to the dryasdust of these ages especially to the prussian dryasdust sitting comfortable in his academies waving sublimely his long ears as he tramples human heroisms into unintelligible pipeclay and dreary continents of sand and cinders with the doctors all applauding  had the sacred poet or man of real human genius been at his work for the thousand years last past instead of idly fiddling far away from his workwhich surely is definable as being very mainly that of interpreting human heroisms of painfully extricating and extorting from the circumambient chaos of muddy babble rumor and mendacity some not inconceivable human and divine image of them more and more clear complete and credible for mankind poor mankind dumbly looking up to him for guidance as to what it shall think of god and of men in this scene of thingsi calculate we should by this time have had a different friedrich of it o heavens a different world of it in so many respects  my esteemed herr doctor it is too painful a subject godlike fabulous achilles and the old greek kings of men one perceives after study to be dim enough grazier sovereigns living among infinite dung till their sacred poet extricated them and our unsacred alldesecrating dryasdustherr doctor i must say it fills me with despair authentic human heroisms not fabulous a whit but true to the bone and by all appearance very much nobler than those of godlike achilles and pious aeneas ever could have beenleft in this manner trodden under foot of man and beast man and beast alike insensible that there is anything but common mud under foot and grateful to anybody that will assure them there is nothing oh doctor oh doctor and the results of ityou need not go exclusively to france to look at them they are too visible in the socalled social hierarchies and sublime gilt doggeries sltcred and secular of all modern countries let us be silent my friend  prussian dryasdust he says elsewhere does make a terrible job of it especially when he attempts to weep through his pipeclay or rise with his long ears into the moral sublime as to the german people i find that they dimly have not wanted sensibility to friedrich that their multitudes of anecdotes still circulating among them in print and viva voce are proof of this thereby they have at least made a myth of friedrichs history and given some rhythmus life and cheerful human substantiality to his work and him accept these anecdotes as the epic they could not write of him but were longing to hear from somebody who could who has not yet appeared among mankind nor will for some time alas my friend on piercing through the bewildering nimbus of babble malignity mendacity which veils sevenfold the face of friedrich from us and getting to see some glimpses of the face itself one is sorrowfully struck dumb once more what a suicidal set of creatures commanding as with one voice that there shall be no heroism more among them that all shall be doggery and commonplace henceforth ach mein lieber sulzer you dont know that damned broodwell well solomons temple the moslems say had to be built under the chirping of ten thousand sparrows ten thousand of them committee of the whole house unanimously of the opposite viewand could not quite hinder it that too is something  more to our immediate purpose is this other thing that the austrians have been in council of war and on deliberation have decided to come out of their defences to quit their strong camp which lies so eligibly ahead of breslau and arear of lissa and of schweidnitz water yonder to cross schweidnitz water leave lissa behind them and meet this offensively aggressive friedrich in pitched fight several had voted no why stirdaun especially and others with emphasis no need of fighting at all said daun we can defend schweidnitz water ruin him before he ever get across defend be assaulted by an army like his urges lucchesi the other chief general it is totally unworthy of us we have gained the game all the honors ours let us have done with it give him battle since he fortunately wishes it we finish him and gloriously finish the war too so argued lucchesi with vivacity persistencyto his own ill luck but evidently with approval from prince karl everybody sees this is the way to prince karls favor at present have not i reconquered silesia thinks prince karl to himself and beams applause on the high course not the low prudent one kutzen pp 4548 in a word the austrians decide on stepping out to meet friedrich in open battle it was the first time they ever did so and it was likewise the last  sunday december 4th at four in the morning friedrich has marched from parchwitz straight towards the austrian camp muller p 26 he hears one can fancy with what pleasure that the austrians are advancing towards him and will not need to be forced in their strong position his march is in four columns friedrich in the vanguard quarters to be neumarkt a little town about fourteen miles off within some miles of neumarkt early in the afternoon he learns that there are a thousand croats in the place the austrian bakery at work there and engineer people marking out an austrian camp on the height beyond neumarkt that will be thinks friedrich for he knows this ground having often done reviews here to breslau all the way on both hands not a rood of it but is familiar to him which was a singular advantage say the critics and a point the austrian council of war should have taken more thought of  friedrich before entering neumarkt sends a regiment to ride quietly round it on both sides and to seize that height he knows of height once seized or ready for seizing he bursts the barrier of neumarkt dashes in upon the thousand croats flings out the croats in extreme hurry musketry and sabre acting on them they find their height beset their retreat cut off and that they must vanish of the 1000 croats 569 were taken prisoners and 120 slain in this unexpected sweeping out of neumarkt better still in neumarkt is found the austrian bakery set up and in full workdelivers you 80000 breadrations hotandhot which little expected to go such a road on the height the austrian stakes and engineertools were found sticking in the ground so hasty had the flight been  how prince karl came to expose his bakery his staff of life so far ahead of him prince karl it is clear was a little puffed up with high thoughts at this time the capture of schweidnitz the late malplaquet poorish antibevern malplaquet capture of breslau and the low and lost condition of friedrichs silesian affairs had more or less turned everybodys headeverybodys except feldmarschall dauns aloneand witty messtables we already said were in the daily habit of mocking at friedrichs march towards them with aggressive views and called his insignificant little army the potsdam guardparade cogniazzo ii 417422 that was the common triumphant humor naturally shared in by prince karl the ready way to flatter him being to sing in that tune nobody otherwise can explain and nobody in any wise can justify

reasons rides with the vanguard to borne the first village on the highway is some seven or eight miles the air is damp the dim incipiences of dawn struggling among haze a little way on this side borne we come on ranks of cavalry drawn across the highway stretching right and left into the dim void austrian army this then push up to it see what it is at least  it proves to be poor general nostitz with his three saxon regiments of dragoons famous since kolinday and a couple of hussar regiments standing here as outpostwho ought to have been more alert but they could not see through the dark and so instead of catching are caught the prussians fall upon them front and flank tumble them into immediate wreck drive the whole outpost at full gallop home through borne upon nypern and the right wingwithout news except of this symbolical sort saxon regiments are quite ruined 540 of them prisoners poor nostitz himself not prisoner but wounded to death died in breslau the twelfth day after seyfarth ii 362 and the ground clear in this quarter  friedrich on the farther side of borne calls halt till the main body arrive rides forward himself and staff to the highest of a range or suite of knolls some furlongs ahead sees there in full view far and wide the austrians drawn up before him from nypern to sagschuitz yonder miles in length and so distinct while the light mended and the hazes faded that you could have counted them through your glasses man by man a highly interesting sight to friedrich who continues there in the profoundest study and calls up some horse regiments of the vanguard to maintain this height and the range of heights running south from it and there i think the king is mainly to be found looking now at the austrians now at his own people for some three hours to come his plan of battle is soon clear to him nypern with its bogs and scrags on the austrian right wing is tortuous impossible ground as he well remembers no good prospect for us there better ground for us on their left yonder at leuthen even at sagschutz farther south whither they are stretching themselves attempt their left wing try our oblique order upon that with all the skill that is in us perhaps we can do it rightly this time and prosper accordingly that is friedrichs plan of action the four columns once got to borne shall fall into two turn to the right and go southward ever southwardthey are to become our two lines of battle were they once got to the right point southward well opposite sagschutz that will be the point for facing to left and marching upin oblique order with the utmost faculty they have  the oblique order schrage stellung let the hasty reader pause to understand is an old plan practised by epaminondas and revived by friedrichwho has tried it in almost all his battles more or less from hohenfriedberg forward to prag kolin rossbach but never could in all points get it rightly done till now at leuthen in the highest time of need it is a particular manoeuvre says archenholtz rather sergeantwise which indeed other troops are now 1793 in the habit of imitating but which up to this present time none but prussian troops can execute with the precision and velocity indispensable to it you divide your line into many pieces you can push these forward stairwise so that they shall halt close to one another obliquely to either hand and so on a minimum of ground bring your mass of men to the required point at the required angle friedrich invented this mode of getting into position by its close ranking by its depth and the manner of movement used it had some resemblance to the macedonian phalanxchiefly in the latter point i should guess for when arrived at its place it is no deeper than common forming itself in this way a mass of troops takes up in proportion very little ground and it shows in the distance by reason of the mixed uniforms and standards a totally chaotic mass of men heaped on one another going in rapid mazes this way and that but it needs only that the commander lift his finger instantly this living coil of knotted intricacies develops itself in perfect order and with a speed like that of mountain rivers when the ice breaksis upon its enemy archenholtz i 209  your enemy is ranked as here in long line three or two to one you march towards him but keep him uncertain as to how you will attack then do on a sudden march up not parallel to him but oblique at an angle of 45 degreesswift vehement in overpowering numbers on the wing you have chosen roll that wing together ruined in upon its own line you may roll the whole five miles of line into disorder and ruin and always be in overpowering number at the point of dispute provided only you are swift enough about it sharp enough but extraordinary swiftness sharpness precision is the indispensable conditionby no means try it otherwise none but prussians drilled by an old dessauer capable of doing it this is the schrage ordnung about which there has been such commentating and controversying among military people whether friedrich invented it whether caesar did it how epaminondas how alexander at arbela howwhich shall not in the least concern us on this occasion  the four columns rustled themselves into two and turned southward on the two sides of bornesouthward henceforth for about two hours as if straight towards the magic mountain the zobtenberg far off which is conspicuous over all that region their steadiness their swiftness and exactitude were unsurpassable it was a beautiful sight says tempelhof an eyewitness the heads of the columns were constantly on the same level and at the distance necessary for forming all flowed on exact as if in a review and you could read in the eyes of our brave troops the noble temper they were in tempelhof i 288 287 i know not at what point of their course or for how long but it was from the column nearest him which is to be first line that the king heard borne on the winds amid their fieldmusic as they marched there the sound of psalmsmanyvoiced melody of a church hymn well known to him which had broken out band accompanying among those otherwise silent men the fact is very certain very strange to me details not very precise except that here as specimen is a verse of their hymn       grant that with zeal and skill this day i do       what me to do behooves what thou commandst me to       grant that i do it sharp at point of moment fit       and when i do it grant me good success in it       gieb dass ich thu mit fleiss was mir zu thun gebuhret       wozu mich

cited in preuss ii 107  one has heard the voice of waters one has paused in the mountains at the voice of faroff covenanter psalms but a voice like this breaking the commanded silences one has not heard shall we order that to cease your majesty by no means said the king whose hard heart seems to have been touched by it as might well be indeed there is in him in those grim days a tone as of trust in the eternal as of real religious piety and faith scarcely noticeable elsewhere in his history his religion and he had in withered forms a good deal of it if we will look well being almost always in a strictly voiceless statenay ultravoiceless or voiced the wrong way as is too well known by no means answered he and a moment after said to some one ziethen probably with men like these dont you think i shall have victory this day  the loss of their saxon forepost proved more important to the austrians than it seemednot computable in prisoners or killed and wounded the height named scheubergborne rise so we might call it which has got its pillar of memorial since with gilt victory atop not till 1854 kutzen pp 194 195where friedrich now is and where the austrians are not is at once a screen and a point of vision to friedrich by loss of their nostitz forepost they had lost view of friedrich and never could recover view of him could not for hours learn distinctly what he was about and when he did come in sight again it was in a most unexpected place on the farther side of borne edge of the big expanse of open country there friedrich has halted ridden with his adjutants to the top of the scheuberg shyhill as the books call it though it is more properly a blunt knoll or risethe nearest of a chain of knolls or swells in the ground which runs from north to south on that part  except the zobtenberg rising blue and massive on the southern horizon famous mythologic mountain reminding you of an arthurs seat in shape too only bigger and solitary this country for many miles round has nothing that could be called a hill it is definable as a bare widewaving champaign with slight bumps on it or slow heavings and sinkings country mostly under culture though it is of sandy quality one or two sluggish brooks in it and reedy meres or mires drained in our day it is dotted with hamlets of the usual kind and has patches of scraggy fir your horizon even where bare is limited owing to the wavy heavings of the ground windmills and churchbelfries are your only resource and even these from about leuthen and the austrian position leave the borne quarter mostly invisible to you leuthen belfry the same which may have stood a hundred years before this battle ends in a small tileroof open only at the gablesleuthen belfry says a recent tourist is of small resource for a view to south you can see some distance sagschutz lobetintz and other hamlets amid scraggy firpatches and meadows once miry pools but to north you are soon shut in by a swell or slow rise with two windmills upon it important to readers at present and to eastward breslau side and lissa side or to westward friedrichs side one has no view except of the old warped rafters and their old mouldy tiles within few inches or if by audacious efforts at each end to the risk of your neck you get a transient peep it is stopt far short of borne by the slow irregular heavings with or without fir about them tourists note penes me  in short friedrich keeps possession of that borne ridge of knolls escorted by cavalry in good numbers twinkling about in an enigmatic wayprussian right wing yonder think the austrianswhitherward or what can they meanand keeps his own columns and the austrian lines in view himself and his movements invisible or worse to the austrian generals from any spyglass or conjecture they can employ  the austrian generals are in windmills on churchbelfries here there diligently scanning the abstruse phenomenon of which so little can be seen daun who had always been against this adventure thinks it probable the vanished prussians are retiring southward for bohemia and our magazines probably these good people are smuggling off die guten leute paschen ab said he let them go in peace muller p 36 daun that morning in his reconnoitrings had asked of a peasant what is that then meaning the top of a villagesteeple in the distance but thought by the peasant to be meaning something nearer hand that is the hill our king chases the austrians over when he is reviewing here which daun reported at headquarters with a grin nicolai anekdoten iv 34  lucchesi on the other hand scanning those borne hills and the cavalry of friedrichs escort twinkling hither and thither on them becomes convinced to a moral certainty that yonder is the prussian vanguard probable extremity of left wing and that he lucchesi here at nypern is to be attacked attacked you said one montazet french agent or emissary here unless they were snipes it is impossible but lucchesi saw it too well  he sends to say that such is the evident fact and that he lucchesi is not equal to it but must have large reinforcement of horse to his right wing tush answer prince karl and daun and return only argument verbal consolation to distressed lucchesi lucchesi sends a second message more passionately pressing to the like effect also with the like return upon which he sends a third message quite passionate if cavalry do not come i will not be responsible for the issue and now daun does collect the required reinforcement all the reserve of horse and a great many from the left wingand daun himself heading them goes off at a swift trot to look into lucchesi and his distresses three or four miles to right five or six from where the danger lies now is friedrichs golden moment  wending always south on their western or invisible side of those knolls friedrichs people have got to about the level or latitude as we might call it of nadastis left to radaxdorf namely to lobetintz or still farther south and perhaps a mile to west of nadasti friedrich has mounted to lobetintz windmill and judges that the time is come daun and cavalry once got to support their right wing and our south latitude being now sufficient friedrich swift as prussian manoeuvring can do it falls with all his strength upon their left wing forms in oblique orderhorse foot artillery all perfect in their paces and comes streaming over the knolls at sagschutz suddenly like a firedeluge on nadasti who had charge there and was expecting no such adventure how friedrich did the forming in oblique order was at that time a mystery known only to friedrich and his prussians but soldiers of all countries gathering the secret from him now understand it and can learnedly explain it to such as are curious will readers take a touch more of the drillsergeant  you go stairwise en echelon says he first battalion starts second stands immovable till the first have done fifty steps at the fiftyfirst second battalion also steps along third waiting for its fiftyfirst step first battalion rightmost battalion or leftmost as the case may be rightmost in this leuthen case doing fifty steps before the next stirs and each battalion in succession punctually doing the same march along on these termsor halt at either end while you advance at the otherit is evident you will swing yourself out of the parallel position into any degree of obliquity and furthermore merely by halting and facing half round at the due intervals you shove yourself to right or to left as required always to right in this leuthen case and soprovided you can march as a pair of compasses wouldyou will in the given number of minutes impinge upon your enemys extremity at the required angle and overlap him to the required length whereupon at him in flank in front and rear and see if he can stand it a beautiful manoeuvre says captain archenholtz devised by friedrich by friedrich inheriting epaminondas and the old dessauer and which perhaps only friedrichs men to this day could do with the requisite perfection  nadasti a skilful warcaptain especially with horse was beautifully posted about sagschutz his extreme left folded up en potence there elbow of it at sagschutz forearm of it running to gohlau eastward potence ending in firwood knolls with croat musketeers in ditches ponds difficult ground especially towards gohlau he has a strong battery 14 pieces on the height to rear of him at the angle or elbow of his potence strong abatis well manned in front to rightwards upon this and upon the croats in the firwood the prussians intend their attack general wedell is there prince moritz as chief with six battalions and their batteries battery of 10 brummers and another ziethen also and horse coming on in swift fireflood and at an angle of fortyfive degrees most unexpected strange to behold from southwest yonder about one oclock of the day  nadasti though astonished at the prussian firedeluge stands to his arms makes in front vigorous defence and even takes in some sort the initiativethat is dashes out his cavalry on ziethen before ziethen has charged ziethens horse who are rightmost of the prussians and are bare to the rightground offering no bush no brook there though ziethen foreseeing such defect has a clump of infantry near by to mend itreel back under this first shock coming downhill upon them and would have fared badly had not the clump of infantry instantly opened fire on the nadasti visitors and poured it in such floods upon them that they in their turn had to reel back back they well out of rangeand leave ziethen free for a counterattack shortly on easier terms which was successful to him for during that first tussle of his the prussian infantry to left of ziethen has attacked the sagschutz firwood clears that of croats attacks nadastis line breaks it their brummer battery potently assisting and the rage of wedell and everybody being extreme so that in spite of the fine ground nadasti is in a bad way on the extreme left or outmost point of his potence or tactical knee round the kneepan or angle of his potence where is the abatis he fares still worse abatis beswept by those ten brummers and other batteries till bullet and bayonet can act on it speedily gives way they were mere wurtembergers these and could not stand cried the austrians apologetically at a great rate afterwards as if anybody could well have stood  indisputably the wurtembergers and the abatis are gone and the brandenburgers storming after them storm nadastis interior battery of 14 pieces and nadastis affairs are rapidly getting desperate in this quarter figure prince karls scouts galloping madly to recall that daun cavalry austrian battalions plenty of them rush down to help nadasti but they are met by the crowding fugitives the chasing prussians are themselves thrown into disorder and can do no good whatever they arrive on the ground flurried blown have not the least time to take breath and order the fewest of them ever got fairly ranked none of them ever stood above one push all goes rolling wildly back upon the centre about leuthen chaos come on usand all for mere lack of time could nadasti but once stretch out one minute into twenty but he cannot nadasti does not himself lose head skilfully covers the retreat trying to rally once and again not for the first few furlongs till the ditches till the firwood quagmires are all done could ziethen now on the open ground fairly hew in take whole battalions prisoners drive the crowd in an altogether stormy manner and wholly confound the matter in this part  prince karl his messengers flying madly has struggled as man seldom did to put himself in some posture about leuthen to get up some defences there leuthen itself the churchyard of it especially is on the defensive men are bringing cannon to the windmills to the swelling ground on the north side of leuthen they dig ditches build batteriescould they but make time halt and friedrich with him for one quarter of an hour but they cannot by the extreme of diligence the austrians have in some measure swung themselves into a new position or imperfect line round leuthen as a centrelucchesi voluntarily or by order swinging southwards on the one hand nadasti swinging northwards by compulsionnew line at an angle say of 75 degrees to the old one and here for an hour more there was stiff fighting the stiffest of the dayof which take one direct glimpse from the austrian side furnished by a young gentleman famous afterwards  leuthen let us premise is a long hamlet of the usual littery sort with two rows in some parts three of farmhouses barns cattlestalls with church or even with two churches a protestant and a catholic goes from east to west above a mile in length with the wrecks of nadasti tumbling into it pellmell from the southeast and lucchesi desperately endeavoring to swing round from the northwest not quite incoherently and the prussian firestorm for accompaniment leuthen is probably the most chaotic place in the planet earth during that hour or so from halfpast two to halfpast three while the agony lasted at one oclock nadasti was attacked at two he is tumbling in midcareer towards leuthen i guess the date of this excerpt or testimony by a notable eyewitness may be halfpast two crisis of the agony just about to begin and before four it was all finished again eyewitness is the young prince de ligne now captain in an austrian regiment of foot and standing here in this perilous posture having been called in as part of the reserve he says  cry had risen for the reserve in which was my regiment and that it must come on as fast as possibleto leuthen west of us yonder we ran what we could run our lieutenantcolonel fell killed almost at the first beyond this we lost our major and indeed all the officers but threethree only and about eleven or twelve of the voluuteer or cadet kind we had crossed two successive ditches which lay in an orchard to left of the first houses in leuthen and were beginning to form in front of the village but there was no standing of it besides a general cannonade such as can hardly be imagined there was a rain of caseshot upon this battalion of which i as there was no colonel left had to take command and a third battalion of the royal prussian footguards which had already made several of our regiments pass that kind of muster gave at a distance of eighty paces the liveliest fire on us it stood as if on the paradeground that third battalion and waited for us without stirring  the austrian regiment andlau at our right hand could not get itself formed properly by reason of the houses it was standing thirty deep and sometimes its shot hit us on the back on my left the austrian regiment merci ran its ways and i was glad of that in comparison by no method or effort could i get the dragoons of bathyani who stood fifty yards in rear of me to cut in a little and help me outno good cutting hereabouts think the dragoons of bathyani my soldiers who were still tired with running and had no cannon these either from necessity or choice they had left behind were got scattered fewer in number and were fighting mainly out of sullenness more our honor than the notion of doing good in the affair prevented us from running off an ensign of the regiment arberg helped me awhile to form from his and my own fragments a kind of line but he was shot down two officers of the grenadiers brought me what they still had some hungarians too were luckily got together but at last as with all helps and the remnants of my own brave battalion i had come down to at most 200 i drew back to the height where the windmill is kutzen p 103 from prince de lignes diary i 63 german translationwhere many have drawn back and are standing in sheltered places a hundred deep say our books  stiff fighting at leuthen especially furious till leuthen churchyard a place with high stone walls was got leuthen village we observe was crammed with austrians spitting fire from every coign of vantage church and churchyard especially are a citadel of death cannon playing from the windmill heights toomoments are inestimable the prussian commander name charitably hidden at leuthen churchyard seems to hesitate in the murderous firedeluge major mollendorf

prussian reserve was ordered up by friedrich the prussian left wing which had stood refused about radaxdorf till now at one time nearly all the prussians were in fire friedrich is here is there

from the first little hope in it behind the windmills they are a hundred men deep by and by your windmills riddled to pieces have to be abandoned the prussian left wing rushing on with bayonets will not all of you have to go lucchesi with his abundant cavalry seeing this latter movement and the prussian flank bare in that part will do a stroke upon themand this proved properly the finale of the matter finale to both lucchesi and it  the prussian flank was to appearance bare in that leftward quarter but only to appearance driesen with the left wing of horse is in a hollow hard by strictly

and in few minutes is a general deluge rearward towards saara and lissa side  at saara the austrians sun just sinking made a third attempt to stand but it was hopelessly faint this time went all

taken him but how could they know friedrich was surprised but had to put the best face on it in kutzen pp 121 209 et seq explanation of the true circumstances and source of the mistake bon soir messieurs said he with a gay tone stepping in is there still room left think you the austrians bowing to the dust make way reverently to the divinity that hedges a king of this sort mutely escort him to the best room such the popular account and for certain make off they and theirs towards the bridge which lies a little farther east at the end of the village  weistritz or schweidnitz water is a biggish muddy stream in that part gushing and eddying not voiceless vexed by mills and their weirs some firing there was from croats in the lower houses of the village and they had a cannon at the farther bridgeend but they were glad to get away and vanish in the night muddy weistritz singing hoarse adieu to their cannon and them prussian grenadiers plunged indignant into the houses made short work of the musketries there in few minutes every croat and austrian was across or silenced otherwise too well prussian cannon now going in the rear of them and continuing to gosuch had been the order

likehaving a kind of fancy for the airy schaffgotsch as well as judging him suitable for this silesian highpriesthood with his moderate ideas and quality wayswhich i have heard were a little dissolute

on another errand to drop a wreath on this deserving headwreath far too small for ever getting on owing to distance let us hope though the artless painter makes no sign and indeed both genius and wreath as he gives them look almost like a big insect which the king will be apt to treat harshly if he notice it on the opposite side again separated from friedrichs back by the handle is an enormous image of fame with wings filling half the mug with two trumpets going at once a bass probably and a treble who flies with great ease and between her eager face end the unexpectant one of friedrich who

so disgusted with it he never set foot in east preussen againnever could bear to behold it after such a transformation into temporary russian shape i cannot say he abhorred this constrained oath as i should have done on the contrary in the first spurt of indignation he not only protested aloud but made reprisalsswear me those saxons then said he and some poor magistrates of towns and official

coming we shall be sure to hear of it  lehwald was just finishing with the swedeshad got them all bottled up in stralsund again about newyears time when these russians crossed into preussen we said nothing of the swedish socalled campaign of last yearand indeed are bound to be nearly silent of that and of all the others five campaigns of them or at least four and a half such campaigns as were never made before or since of campaign 1757 the memorable feature is that of the whole swedish division as the laughing newspapers called it which was put to flight by five berlin postilionssubstantially a truth as follows  night of september 12th13th 1757 the swedes 22000 strong did at last begin business crossed peene river the boundary between their pommern and ours and having nothing but some fractions of militia to oppose them soon captured the redoubts there spread over prussian pommern and on into the uckermark diligently raising contributions to a heavy amount no less than 90000 pounds in all for this poor province though by a strange accident 60000 pounds proved to be the actual sum  towards the end of october they had got as much as 60000 pounds from the northern parts of uckermark prentzlow being their headquarter during that operation and they now sent out a detachment of 200 grenadiers and 100 dragoons towards zehdenick another little town some forty miles farther south there to wring out the remaining sum the detachment marched by night not courting notice but people had heard of its coming and five prussian postilionsshifty fellows old hussars it may be at any rate skilful on the trumpet and furnished with hussar jackets and an old pistol each determined to do something for their country the swedish detachment had not marched many miles whenafter or before some flourishes of martial trumpetingthere verily fell on the swedish flank out of a clump of dark wood five shots and wounded one man to the astonishment and panic of the other two hundred and ninetynine who made instant retreat under new shots and trumpettones as if it were from five whole hussar regiments retreat doublequick to prentzlow alarm waxing by the speed alarm spreading at prentzlow itself so that the whole division got to its feet recrossed the peene and uckermark had nothing more to pay for that bout this is not a fable such as go in the newspapers

russians with them or with somebody and do something effective in the way of destroying friedrich and besides their subsidies and bribings the french took incredible pains with this view incessantly

from starving them into surrender signifies friedrich hastily besiege me stralsund which lehwald did but should have been quicker about it or the thaw came too soon and admitted ships with provision again upon which lehwald resigned to a general graf von dohna and went home as grown too old and dohna kept them bottled there till the usual russian advent deep in june by which time what with limited stockfish diet what with sore labor breaking of the ice whenever frost reappeared and other hardship more than half of them had diedevery new season there was a new general tried but without the least improvement there was mockery enough complaint enough indignant laughter in stockholm itself and the dalecarlians thought of revolting but the senator committeemen held firm ballasted by french gold for four years  the prussian militias are a fine trait of the matter about fifteen regiments in different partsabout five in pommern which set the example which were suddenly raised last autumn by the stande themselves drilled in stettin continually while the swedes were under way and which stood ready for some action under veterans of the squirearchy when the swedes arrived they were kept up through the war the stande even raised a little fleet archenholtz i 110 river fleet and coast fleet twelve gunboats with a powerful carronade in each and effective men and captain a great check on plundering and coast mischief till the swedes who are naval at last made an effort and destroyed them all  friedrich was very sensible of these procedures on the part of his stande and perhaps readers are not prepared for such or for others of the like which we could produce elsewhere in a country without constitution to speak of friedrich raises no new taxesexcept upon himself

point is finished in four short articles given in  heldengeschichte v 16 17 that friedrich shall have four million thalers that is 670000 pounds payable in london to his order in october this year which sum friedrich engages to spend wholly in maintenance and increase of his army for behoof of the common objectneither party to dream of making the least shadow of peace or truce without the other of baltic fleet there is nothing said nor in regard to that was anything done this year or afterwards highly important as it would have been to friedrich with the navies so called of both sweden and russia doing their worst upon him why not spare me a small english squadron and blow these away nor was the why ever made clear to him the private why being that czarish majesty had last year intimated to britannic any such step on your part will annihilate the now old friendship of russia and england and be taken as a direct declaration of warwhich britannic majesty for commercial and miscellaneous reasons hoped always might be avoided be silent therefore on that of baltic fleet  in all the spoken or covenanted points the treaty was accurately kept 670000 pounds twothirds of a million very nearly will in punctual promptitude come to friedrichs hand were october here and in regard to ferdinand a point left silent this too friedrichs expectations were exceeded not the contrary so long as pitt endured this is the third englishprussian treaty of the sevenyears war as we said above and it is the first that took practical effect this was followed by three others year after year of precisely the same tenor which were likewise practical and punctually keptthe last of them 12th december 1760 had reference to subsidy for 1761and before another came pitt was out so that in all friedrich had four subsidies 670000 pounds x42680000 pounds of english money altogetherand it is computed by some there was never as much good fighting otherwise had out of all the

wyndhams subsidy march 13th 1758while pitt and knyphausen are busy on the subsidy treaty still not out with it the newspapers suddenly announce  miss bab wyndham of salisbury sister of henry wyndham esq of that city a maiden lady of ample fortune has ordered her banker to prepare the sum of 1000 pounds to be immediately remitted in her own name as a present to the king of prussia  london chronicle march 14th16th 1758  lloyds evening post c c doubtless to the king of prussias surprise and that of london society which would not want for commentaries on such a thing  before long the subsidy treaty being now out and the wyndham topic new again london society reads in the same newspaper a documentary piece calculated to help in its commentaries there is good likelihood of guess though no certainty now attainable that the english lady referred to may be miss bab herselfof whose longvanished biography and brisk airy nomadic ways we catch hereby a faint shadow momentary but conceivable and sufficient for us   to the authors of the london chronicle london chronicle of 13th15th april 1758  the following account which is a real fact will serve to show with what punctuality and exactness the king of prussia attends to the most minute affairs and how open he is to applications from all persons  an english lady being possessed of actions shares in the embden company and having occasion to raise money on them repaired to antwerp some two years ago as will be seen and made application for that purpose to a director of the company established there by the king of prussia for the managing all affairs relative thereto this person van erthorn the name of him very willingly entered into treaty with her but the sum he offered to lend being far short of what the actions would bring and he also insisting on forfeiture of her right in them if not redeemed in twelve monthsshe broke off with him and had recourse to some merchants at antwerp who were inclinable to treat with her on much more equitable terms the proceeding necessarily brought the parties before this director for receiving his sanction which was essential to the solidity of the agreement and he finding he was like to lose the advantage he had flattered himself with disputed the authenticity of the actions and thereby threw her into such discredit as to render all attempts to raise money on them ineffectual upon this the lady wrote a letter by the common post to his majesty of prussia accompanied with a memorial complaining of the treatment she had received from the director and she likewise enclosed the actions themselves in another letter to a friend at berlin by the return of the post his majesty condescended to answer her letter and the actions were returned authenticated which so restored her credit that in a few hours all difficulties were removed relating to the transaction she had in hand and it is more than probable the director has felt his majestys resentment for his illbehaviorthe ladys letter was as follows  antwerp 19th february 1756  sirhaving had the happiness to pay my court to your majesty during a pretty long residence at berlin say in voltaires time miss barbaras embden company i observe was the first of the two date 1750 that of 1753 is not hers and to receive such marks of favor from their majesties the queens a barbara capable of shining in the royal soirees at monbijou of talking to or of your voltaires and lions and investing moneys in the new embden company as i shall ever retain a grateful sense ofi presume to flatter myself that your majesty will not be offended at the respectful liberty i have taken in laying before you my complaints against one van erthorn a director of the embden china company whose bad behavior to me as set forth in my memorial hath forced me to make a very long and expensive stay at this place and as the considerable interest i have in that company may farther subject me to his caprices i cannot forbear laying my grievances at the foot of your majestys throne most respectfully supplicating your majesty that you would be graciously pleased to give orders that this director shall not act towards me for the future as he hath done hitherto  i hope for this favor from your majestys sovereign equity and i shall never cease offering up my ardent prayers for the prosperity of your glorious reign having the honor to be with the most respectful zeal sir your majestys most humble most obedient and most devoted servant      the king of prussias answer  potsdam 26th february 1756  madami received the letter of the 19th instant which you thought proper to write to me and was not a little displeased to hear of the bad behavior of one of the directors of the asiatic company of embden towards you of which you were forced to complain i shall direct your grievances to be examined and have just now despatched my orders for that purpose to lenz my president of the chamber of east friesland chief judge in those parts seyfarth ii 139 you may assure yourself the strictest justice shall be done you that the case will admit god keep you in his holy protection friedrich  whether this refers to miss barbara or not there is no affirming but the interesting point is friedrich did receive and accept miss barbaras 1000 pounds the prussian account which calls her an english jungfrau lady salisbury who actually sent a sum of money preuss ii 124 whose reference is merely  gentlemans magazine for 1758 both in the annual register of that year i 86and in the gentlemans magazine pp 142 177 the above paragraph and letters are copied from the newspapers but without the smallest commentary there or elsewhere or any mention of a lady salisbury would not itself be satisfactory but by good chance there is still living in salisbury city a very aged gentleman well known for his worth and intelligence on such matters who being inquired of makes reply at once that the first earl of malmesbury who was of his acquaintance and had many anecdotes and reminiscences of friedrich all noted down it was understood with diplomatic exactitude but never yet published or become accessible did as i well remember among other things mention the kings telling him that he the king had received a thousand pounds from miss wyndham with a part of which he had bought the flute then in his hand letter from john fowler esq salisbury 2d april 1860 to a friend of mine penes me of barbaras identity or otherwise with the antwerp embden lady mr f can say nothing which latter circumstance too is curious for at all times however straitened friedrichs exchequer might be it was his known habit during this war to have always before the current year ended the ways and means completely settled and provided for the year coming so that everything could be at once paid in money good money or badgood still up to this dateand nothing was observed to fall short so much as the customary liberality of his gifts to those about him i infer therefore friedrich had decided to lay out this 1000 pounds in what he would call luxuries chiefly giftsand among other things had said to himself i will have a new flute too probably one of his last for i understand he had by this time malmesburys time 1772 ceased much playing and ceased altogether not long after preuss i 371373  james harris first earl of malmesbury was resident at berlin 1772 that is all the date we have for the kings saying and with part of it i bought this flute date of lord malmesburys mention of it at salisbury we have nonelikeliest there might be various dates a thing mentioned more than once and not improvable by dating the wyndhams still live in the close of salisbury a respected and wellknown family record of them none of barbara there or elsewhere except here to be found in the county histories brittons beauties of england and wales xv part ii p 118 hoares salisbury mistaken p 815 c i

enough on this small wyndham matter which is nearly altogether english but in which friedrich too has his indefeasible property     friedrich as indeed pitts people and others have done takes the field uncommonly early friedrich goes upon schweidnitz schweidnitz as the preface to whatever his campaign may be  while this subsidy treaty is getting settled in england duke ferdinand has his french

pitt for miss barbara and for all english souls royal highness of cumberland hardly excepted the descent on rochefort last autumn had a good deal disappointed pitt and englandan expensively elaborate expedition military and naval which could not descend at all when it got to the point but merely went groping about on the muddy shores of the charente holding councils of war yonder cannonaded the isle of aix for two hours and returned home without result of any kind courtsmartial following on it as too usual this was an unsuccessful firststroke for pitt indeed he never did much succeed in those descents on the french coast though never again so ill as this time those are a kind of things that require an exactitude as of clockwork in all their parts and pitts generalcies and warofficeswe know whether they were of the prussian type or of the swedish a very grievous hindrance to pittwhich he will not believe to be quite incurable against which he for his part stands up in grim earnest and with his whole strength and is now and at all times doing what in him lies to abate or remedy itsuccessfully to an unexpected degree within the next four years from america he has decided to recall lord loudon as a cunctatory haggling mortal the reverse of a general how very different from his austrian cousin cousins certainly enough their progenitors were brothers of that house about 1568when matthew the cadet went into livonia into foreign soldiering papa having fallen prisoner at the battle of langside 1568 and the family prospects being low from this matthew comes through a scrips of livonian soldiers the famed austrian loudon douglas peerage of scotland p 425 c c vie de loudon illinformed on that point and some others says the first livonian loudon came from ayrshire in the fourteenth century abercrombie may be better hopes hewas better still not good but already in the gloomy imbroglio over yonder pitt discerns that one amherst the son of people unimportant at the hustings has military talent and in this puddle of a rochefort futility he has got his eye on a young officer named wolfe who was quartermaster of the expedition a young man likewise destitute of parliamentary connection but who may be worth something both of whom will be heard of in a four years determined effort of this kind things do improve and it was wonderful to what amountout of these chaotic waroffices little better than the swedish and ignorant generalcies fully worse than the swedishpitt got heroic successes and work really done  on pitt amid confused

already to go home upon your enemy swiftly with your utmost collective strength and try to strike into the heart of him before he is aware friedrich has twice tried this the second time with success respectable though far short of complete weakened as now but with ferdinand likely to find the french in employment he means to try it again and is busy preparing at neisse and elsewhere though

did felling whole forests they say building abatis within abatisnot doubting especially on these ziethenfouquet symptoms but friedrichs campaign is to be an invasion of bohemia again which he shall not do gratis hopes daun and indeed judges say the entrance would hardly have been possible on that side had friedrich tried it which he did not  schweidnitz being done and daun deep in the bohemian problemfriedrich in an unintelligible manner breaks out from grussau and the landshut region april 19th25th not straight southward as daun had been expecting but straight southeastward through neisse jagerndorf all gone or all but ziethen and fouquet gone that waymeaning who shall say what when news of it comes to daun in two divisions from 30 to 40000 strong through jagerndorf ever onward through troppau and not till then turning southward indubitable march of that cunning enemy rapidly proceeding his 40000 and he along those elevated upland countries watershed of the black sea and the baltic bleakly illumined by the april sun a march into the mists of the future tense which do not yet clear themselves to daun seeing the march turn southward at troppau a light breaks on daun ha coming round upon bohemia from the east then that is dauns opinion for some time yet and he immediately starts that way to save a fine magazine he has at leutomischl over there daun from skalitz near konigsgratz where he is has but some eighty miles to march for the kings hundred and fifty and arrives in those parts few days after the king posts himself at leutomischl veiled in pandours not for two weeks more does he ascertain it to have been a march upon the olmutz country and the intricate forks of the morawa river with a view to besieging olmutz by this wily enemy upon which daun did strive to bestir himself thitherward at last and though very slow and hesitative his measures otherwise were unexceptionable and turned out luckier than had been expected by some people  olmutz is an ancient pleasant little city in the plains of mahren romantic indistinct to the english mind with domes with steeples eminent beyond its sizepopulation little above 10000 soulshas its princearchbishop and ecclesiastic outfittings with whom friedrich has lodged in his time city which trades in leather and russian and moldavian droves of oxen memorable to the slavic populations for its grand czech library which was carried away by the swedes happily into thick night to stralsund 1645 and has not since been heard of also for that poor little wenzel of theirs last heir of the bohemian czech royalties whom no reader has the least memory of being killed on the streets hereuncertain to this day by whom though for whose benefit that daggerstroke ended is certain enough supra vol v p 118poor little wenzels dust lies under that highest dome of the old cathedral yonder if anybody thought of such a thing in hot practical times poor lafayette too lodged here in prison when the austrians seized him city trades in leather and live stock we said has much to do with artillery much with ecclesiastryand friedrich besieged it for seven weeks in the hot summer days of 1758 to no purpose friedrich has been in olmiitz more than once before his schwerin once took it in a single day and it was his for months in the old moravianforay time but the place is changed now become an arsenal or military storehouse of austria strongly fortified and with a captain in it who distinguishes himself by valiant skill and activity on this occasion  friedrichs olmutz enterprise the rather as it was unsuccessful has not wanted critics and certainly according to the ordinary rules of cautious prudence could these have been friedrichs in his present situation it was not to be called a prudent enterprise but had friedrichs arrangements been punctually fulfilled and olmutz been got in fair time as was possible or probable the thing might have been done very well duke ferdinand in these early may days is practically making preparations to follow the french across the rhine no fear of french armies interfering with us this year dohna has the swedes locked in stralsund capable of being starved had not the thaw come and in hinterpommern he has general platen with a tolerable detachment watching fermor and his russians dohna with platen may entertain the russians for a little when they get on waywhich we know will be at a slow pace and late in the season prince henri commands in saxony say with 30000kings vicegerent and other self there do your wisest and promptest hold no councils of war prince henri altogether on the aggressive as yet is waiting what reichs army there may behas already had mayer and free corps careering about in franken country once and again tearing up the incipiencies and preparations with the usual emphasis and is himself intending to follow thither in a still more impressive manner friedrichs calculation is prince henri will have his hands free for a good few weeks yet which proved true enough so far as that went  and now supposing olmutz ours and vienna itself open to our insults does not by rapid suction every armed austrian flow thitherward germany all drained of them in which case what is to hinder prince henri from stepping into bohmen by the metal mountains capturing prag getting into junction with us here and tumbling austria at a rate that will astonish her her and her miscellaneous tagraggery of confederates one and all konigsberg stralsund bamberg russians swedes reichsfolkhere in mahren will be the crown of the game for all these prosper in mahren all these are lamed one right stroke at the heart the limbs become manageable quantities this was friedrichs program and had not imperfections of execution beyond what was looked for and also a good deal of plain illluck intervened this bold stroke for mahren might have turned out far otherwise than it did  the march thither started from neisse april 27th was beautiful friedrich with vanguard and first division keith with rearguard and second always at a days distance split into proper columns for convenience of road and quarter in the hungry countries threading those silent mountain villages and upper streamlets of oder and morawa ziethen waving intrusive croateries far off fouquet in thousands of wagons shoving on from neisse in four sections with the due intervals under the due escorts the immensity of stores and siegefurniture through jagerndorf through troppau and onwards table of his routes and stages in tempelhof ii 46punctual everybody besiegers and siege materials ready on their ground by the set day daun too had made speed to save his magazine daun was at leutomischl may 5tha forty miles to west of the morawafew days after friedrich had arrived in those countries by the eastern or left bank by troppau gibau littau aschmeritz prossnitz and a week before friedrich had finished his reconnoitrings campings and taken position to his mind camps four or more shrank in the end to three on both banks of the river a matter of abstruse study so that it was may 12th before friedrich first took view of olmutz itself and could fairly begin his problemdaun with his best tolpatcheries still unable to guess what it was  of the siege i propose to say little though the accounts of it are ample useful to the artillerist and engineer if the reader can be made to conceive it as a blazing loudsounding fact on which and on friedrich in it the eyes of all europe were fixed for some weeks it may rest now in impressive indistinctness to us keith is captain of the siege whom all praise for his punctual firmness of progress balbi as before is engineer against whom goes the criticism keiths first of all that he opened his first parallel 800 yards too far offwhich much increased the labor and the expenditure of useless gunpowder shot having no effect at such a distance there were various criticisms some real as this some imaginary as that friedrich grudged gunpowder the fact being that he had it not except after carriage from neisse say a hundred and twenty miles offtroppau his last silesian town or safe place his for the moment is eighty milesand was obliged to waste none of it  friedrich is not thought to shine in the sieging line as he does in the fighting which has some truth in it though not very much when friedrich laid himself to engineering i observe he did it well see neisse graudenz magdeburg his balbi went wrong with the parallels on this occasion many things went wrong but the truly grievous thing was his distance from silesia and the supplies a hundred and twenty miles of hillcarriage eighty of them disputable for every shot of ammunition and for every loaf of bread this was hard to standand perhaps no warapparatus but a prussian with a friedrich for sole chiefmanager could have stood it so long friedrich did stand it in a wonderfully tolerable manner and was continuing to stand it and make fair progress and it is not doubted he would have got olmutz had not there another fact come on him which proved to be of unmanageable nature the actual loss namely of one convoy after so many had come safe and when as appears there was now only one wanted and no morelet us attend to this a little  had daun at olmutz been as a duke of cumberland relieving tournay rushing into fight at fontenoy like a hanover whitehorse neck clothed with thunder and head destitute of knowledgehow lucky had it been for friedrich but daun knows his trade better daun though superior in strength sits on his magazine clear not to fight by no art of manoeuvring had friedrich much tried it or hoped it this time could daun have been brought to give battle as fabins cunctator he is here in his right place taking impregnable positions no man with better skill in that branch of business pushing out parties on the troppau road and patiently waiting till this dangerous enemy with such endless shifts in him come in sight perhaps of his last cartridge or perhaps make some stumble on the way towards that consummation daun is aware of friedrichs surprising qualities bos against leo daun feels these procedures to be altogether feline felisleonine such stealthy glidings about deceptive motions appearances then such a rapidity of spring upon you and with such a set of clawsdestructive to bovine or rhinoceros nature in regard to all which bos if he will prosper surely cannot be too cautious it was remarked of daun that he was scrupulously careful never in the most impregnable situations neglecting the least precaution but punctiliously fortifying himself to the last item even to a ridiculous extent say retzow and the critics it was the one resource of daun truly a solid stubborn patience is in the man stubborn courage too of bovinerhinoceros typestupid if you will but doing at all times honestly his best and his wisest without flurry which character is often of surprising value in war capable of much mischief now and then to quicker people rhinoceros daun did play his leo a bad prank more than once and this of barring him out from olmutz was one of them perhaps the worst after kolin  dauns management of this olmutz business is by no means reckoned brilliant even in the fabius line but on the contrary inert dimminded inconclusive and in reality till almost the very last he had been of little help to the besieged for near three weeks till may 23d daun sat at leutomischl immovable on his breadbasket there forty or more miles from olmutz and did not see that a siege was meant may 27th28th balbi opened his first parallel in that mistaken way four days before which daun does move inwards a march or so to zwittau to gewitsch still thirty miles to west of olmutz still thinking of bohemia not of any siege still hanging by the mountains and the breadbasket and thereabout gewitsch siege or no siege daun sits down again pretty much immovable through the five weeks of bombardment andexcept that loudon and the light horse are very diligent to do a mischief attempting our convoys more than once to no purpose and alarming some of our outposts almost every night but every night beaten offdoes in a manner nothing sits quiet behind his impenetrable veil of pandours and lets the bombardment take its course had not express order come from vienna on him it is thought daun would have sat till olmutz was taken and would then have gone back to leutomischl and impregnable posts in the hills on express order hebut gather first these poor sparks in elucidation  the destructive sallies and the like at olmutz were principally an affair of the gazetteers and the imagination but it is certain olmutz this time was excellently well defended the commandant a vigorous skilful man prompt to seize advantages and garrison and townsfolk zealously helping so that friedrichs progress was unusually slow friedrichs feelings all this while and balbis who spent his first 1220 shots entirely in vain beginning so far off may be judged ofthe sound of him to balbi sometimes stern enough as when june 9th he personally visits balbis parallels top of the tafelberg yonder and inquires when do you calculate to get done then west side of olmutz and of the river east side lies mostly under water there is the bombarding seventyone heavy guns keith in his expertest manner doing all the captaincies keith has about 8000 of foot and horse busy and vigilant with their faces to the east in a ring of four camps or principally three prossnitz littau and neustadt which is across the river all looking westward or northwestward some ten or twenty miles from keith friedrich headquarters oftenest prossnitz the chief camp stands facing daun who lies concentric to him at the distance of another ten or twenty miles in good part still thirty or forty miles from olmutz veiled mostly under a cloud of pandours  of friedrichs impatiences we hear little though they must have been great prince henri is ready for prag many things are ready were olmutz but done may 22d prince henri had followed mayer in person with a stronger corps to root out the reichsfolkand is now in bamberg city and country and is even in baireuth itself where was lately the camp of the new reichs general serene highness of zweibruck and his nascent reichs army who are off

poor wilhelmina alas she is sunk in sickness this year more than ever journeying towards death in fact and is probably the most pungent sacredly tragic of friedrichs sorrows now and onwards june 12th friedrichs pouting brother the prince of prussia died this also he had to hear in camp at olmutz what did he die of said friedrich to the messenger a major something of chagrin said the major aus gram friedrich made no answer  on the last night of may by beautiful management military and other duke ferdinand is across the rhine again chasing the french before him who as they are far more numerous cannot surely but make some stand so that a battle there may be expected soonlet us hope a victory as indeed it beautifully proved to be three weeks after battle of crefeld 23d june on the other hand fermor and his russians are astir continually wending towards brandenburg in their voluminous manner since june 16th though at a slow rate how desirable the siege of olmutz were done  on express from vienna daun did bestir himself cautiously got on foot again detached across the river an expert hussar general be busy all ye loudons st ignons ziskowitzes doubly nowexpert hussar general one item of whose force is 1100 chosen grenadiersand himself cautiously stept southward and eastward nearer the siege lines the hussar generals meaning seemed to be some mischief on our camp of neustadt and the outposts there but in reality it was to throw his 1100 into olmutz useful to the commandant whichby ingenious manoeuvring and guidance from the peasants through bushy woods and bypaths on that east side of the riverthe expert hussar general though ziethen was sent over to handle him did perfectly manage and would not quit for ziethen till he saw it finished which done daun keeps stepping still farther southward nearer the siege lines and at prossnitz morning of june 22d friedrich with his own eyes sees daun taking post on the opposite heights says to somebody near him voila les autrichiens ils apprennent a marcher there are the austrians they are learning to march thoughgetting on their feet like infants in a certain stage marcher having that meaning too though i know not that the king intended itthey have learned a great many things since your majesty first met them friedrich took daun to be now at last meaning battle for olmutz and made some slight arrangements accordingly but that is not dauns intention at all as friedrich will find to his cost in few days that very day daun has vanished again still in the southerly direction again under veil of pandours  meanwhile in spite of all things the siege makes progress june 22d balbis sap had got to their glacis and was pushing forward therejune 22d day when daun made momentary appearance and the reinforcement stole inwithin a fortnight more balbi promises the thing shall be done but supplies are indispensable one other convoy from troppau and let it be a big one between 3 and 4000 wagons meal money iron powder friedrich hopes this one if he can get it home will suffice colonel mosel is to bring this convoy a resolute expert officer with perhaps 7000 foot and horse surely sufficient escort but as daun is astir and his loudons ziskowitzes and light people are gliding about friedrich orders ziethen to meet this important convoy with some thousands of new force and take charge of bringing it in mosel was to leave troppau june 26th ziethen pushes out to meet him from the olmutz end on the second day after and one hopes all is now safe on that head  the driving of 3000 fourhorse wagons under escort ninety miles of road is such an enterprise as cannot readily be conceived by sedentary pacific readersmuch more the attack of such military science constraining chaos into the cosmic state has nowhere such a problem there are twelve thousand horses for one thing to be shod geared kept roadworthy and regular say six thousand country wagoners thicksoled peasants then hanging to the skirts of these in miscellaneous crazy vehicles and weak teams equine and asinine are one or two thousand sutler people male and female not of select quality though on them too we keep a sharp eye the series covers many miles as many as twenty english miles says tempelhof unless in favorable points you compress them into five going four wagons abreast for defences sake defence or escort goes in three bulks or brigades vanguard middle rearguard with sparse pickets interveningwider than five miles you cannot get the parts to support one another an enemy breaking in upon you at some difficult point of road woody hollow or the like and opening cannon musketry and hussar exercise on such an object must make a confused transaction of it some commanders for the road has hitherto been mainly pacific divide their train into parts say four parts moving with their partial escorts with an interval of one day between each two this has its obvious advantages but depends of course on the road being little

eleven but the first five are peaceable tempelhof ii 48cant be hurried beyond that pace if you would save your laggards your irregulars and prevent what we may call raggery in your rearward parts the skirts of your procession get torn by the bushes if you go faster this time colonel mosel will have to mend his pace however and to go in the lump withal the case being critical as mosel knows and more than he yet knows  daun who has friends everywhere and no lack of spies in this country generally hears of the convoys he has heard in particular of this important one in good time hitherto daun had not attempted much upon convoys nor anything with success kings posted corps and other precautions are of such a kind not even loudon when he tried his best could do any good and common wandering hussar parties are as likely to get a mischief as to do one on such service cautious daun had been busy enough keeping his own camp safe and flinging a word of news or encouragement at the most a trifle of reinforcement into olmutz when possible but now it becomes evident there must be one of two things this convoy seized or else a battle riskedand that in defect of both these the inevitable third thing is olmutz will straightway go  majorgeneral loudon the best partisan soldier extant and ripening for better things has usually a force of perhaps 10000 under him four regiments of them regular grenadiers and has been active on the convoys though hitherto unsuccessful let an active loudon with increased force try this their vitally important convoy from the west side of the river an active ziskowitz cooperating on the east side where the road itself is and do their uttermost that is dauns plannow in course of execution daun instead of meaning battle that day when friedrich saw him was cautiously stealing past intending to cross the river farther down and himself support the operation daun has crossed accordingly and has doubled up northward again to the fit point ziskowitz is in the fit point in the due force on this east side too loudon on the west side goes by muglitz hof making a long deep bend far to westward and hillward of all the prussian posted corps and precautions and altogether hidden from them loudon aims to be in troppau neighborhood guntersdorf near bautsch by the proper day and pay mosel an unexpected visit in the passage there  colonel mosel marshalling his endless trains with every excellent precaution and the cleverest dispositions say the books against the known and the unknown had got upon the road and creaked forward manywheeled out of troppau monday 26th june tempelhof ii 8994 the roads worn by the much travelling and wet weather were utterly bad the pace was perhaps quicker than usual the muchjolting train got greatly into a jumblemosel to bring up the laggards made the morrow a restday did get about twothirds of his laggards marshalled again ordered the others to return as impossible they say had it not been for this restday which seemed of no consequence loudon would not have been at guntersdorf in time nor have attempted as he did at guntersdorf and afterwards at break of day wednesday 28th mosel is again on the road heavily jumbling forward from his quarters in bautsch few miles on towards guntersdorf he discovers loudon posted ahead in the defiles what a sight for mosel in his character of wagoner up with the dawn but mosel managed the defiles and loudon this time halted his train dashed up into the woody heights and difficult grounds stormed loudons cannon from him smote loudon in a valiant tempestuous manner and sent him travelling again for the present  loudon i conjecture would have struggled farther had not he known that there would be a better chance again not very many miles ahead london has studied this convoy knows of ziethen coming to it with so many of ziskowitz coming to him loudon with so many that ziethen cannot send for more roads being all beset by our industry yesterday that ziskowitz can should it be needfuland that at domstadtl there is a defile or confused woody hollow of unequalled quality mosel jumbles on all day with his train none molesting at night gets to his appointed quarters village of neudorff the l or el is a diminutive in these names neudorfl newthorplet domstadtl cathedraltownlet and the like and there finds ziethen a glad meeting we may fancy but an anxious one with domstadtl ahead on the morrow loudon concerts with ziskowitz this day calls in all reinforcements possible and takes his measures thursday morning ziethen finds the train in such a state hardly half of it come up he has to spend the whole day mosel and he in rearranging it friday morning june 30th they get under way againfriday the catastrophe is waiting them  the pass of domstadtl lapped in the dim moravian distance is not known to me or to my readers nor indeed could the human pen or intellect aided by ocular inspection or whatever helps give the least image of what now took place there rendering domstadtl a memorable locality ever since understand that ziethen and mosel with their waste slow deluge of wagons come jumbling in with anxiety with precautionsprecautions doubled now that the woody intricacies about domstadtl rise in sight pooh it is as we thought there go austrian cannonsalvos horsecharges volleying musketries as our first

everybody does keeps his wagonchaos plugged down ranks it in square mass as a wagon fortress wagenburg ranks himself and everybody his cannon his platoon musketry to the best advantage round it

plugged finally perceives himself to be beaten that the wagonchaos has got unplugged fancy itand that he ziethen must retreat back foremost if possible he did retreat fighting all the way to troppau and the convoy is a ruin and a prey  krockow with the 250 has got under way again hearing the powderwagons start into the air fired by the enemy and hearing the cannon and musketry take a northerly course and die away in that ominous direction these 250 were all the carriages that came inhappily by ziethens prudence the money a large sum had been lodged in the vanmost of these the rest of the convoy ball powder bread was of little value to loudon but beyond value to friedrich at this moment and it has gone to annihilation and the belly of chaos and the croats among the tragic wrecks of this convoy there is one that still goes to our heart a longish almost straight row of young prussian recruits stretched among the slain what are these these were 700 recruits coming up from their cantons to the wars hardly yet six months in training see how they have fought to the death poor lads and have honorably on the sudden got manumitted from the toils of life seven hundred of them stood to arms this morning some sixtyfive will get back to troppau that is the invoice account they lie there with their blond young cheeks and light hair beautiful in deathcould not have done better though the sacred poet has said nothing of them hithertonor need till times mend with us and him adieu my noble young brothers so brave so modest no spartan nor no roman more may the silence be blessed to you  contrary to some current notions it is comfortably evident that there was a considerable fire of loyalty in the prussians towards their king during this war loyalty kept well under cover not wasting itself in harangues or noisy froth but coming out among all ranks of men in practical attempts to be of help in this high struggle which was their own as well as his the stande landed gentry of pommern and other places we heard of their poor little navy of twelve gunboats which were all taken by the swedes militia regiments too which did good service at colberg as may transiently appear by and byin the gentry or upper classes a respectable zeal for their king then among the peasantry or lower classhere are seven hundred who stood well where he planted them and their mothersbe spartan

domstadtl business and by way of masking it feeling how vital it was made various extensive movements across the river by several bridges then hither thither on the farther side of olmutz mazing up and down friedrich observing him till he should ripen to something definite followed his bombarding the while perhaps having hopes of wager of battle ensuing of the disaster at domstadtl friedrich could know nothing loudon having closed the roads daun by no means ripens into battle news of the disaster reached friedrich next day saturday july 1stwho immediately assembled his generals and spoke a few inspiring words to them such as we may fancy friedrich perceives that olmutz is over that his third campaign third lunge upon the enemys heart has prospered worse thus far than either of the others that he must straightway end this of olmutz without any success whatever and try the remaining methods and resources no word of complaint they say is heard from friedrich in such cases face

my readers crave only the outlines the results daun it was thought should have ruined friedrich in this retreat but he did nothing of harm to him in fact for a week he could not comprehend the phenomenon at all and did not stir from his placewhich was on the other or wrong side of the river daun had never doubted but the retreat would be to silesia and he had made his detachments and laid himself out for doing something upon it in that direction but lo what roads are these what motions whitherward in about a week it becomes manifest that the retreat which goes on various roads sometimes three at once has converged on leutomischl straight for bohemia instead of silesia and that daun is fallen seven days behind it incapable now to do anything not even the magazine at leutomischl could be got away nor could even the whole of it be burnt  keith and the baggage once safe in leutomischl july 8th all goes in deliberate long column friedrich ahead to open the passages

redhot savagery on custrin it is lamentably necessary we should say something to say much would he a waste of record as the thing itself was a waste of powder a thing hideous to think of without the least profit to fermor but with total ruin to all the inhabitants and to the many strangers who had sought refuge there one interior circumstance is memorable and lucky to us artillerycaptain tielcke happened to be with these people had come in the train of two saxon princes serving as volunteers and with a singular lucidity and faithful good sense not scientific alone he illuminates these black russian matters for such as have to do with them  tielckes book of contributions to the art of war beytrage zur kriegekunst und zur geschichte des krieges von 1756 bis 1763 six thin vols 4to with many plates cited above is still in repute with soldiers especially in the artillery line and indeed shows a sound geometrical head and contains bits of excellent historical reading interspersed among the scientific parts this tielcke it appears was a common footsoldier one of those pirna 14000 made prussian against their will but tielcke had a milkmaid for sweetheart in those regions who good soul gave him her generous farewell a suit of her clothes perhaps a pair of her pails and in that guise he walked out of bondage clear away to warsaw to favor with the king and others being of real merit an excellent studious modest little man and here he now reappears in a higher capacity as articulate eyewitness of the custrin business and the zorndorf among much other russian darkness which shall

characterized as abominable to gods and men and not fit to be recorded in human annals execration and if it were possible oblivion being the human resource with them the russian officers it seems despise this cossack rabble incredibly for their fighting qualities withal are close on zero though their talent for arson and murder is so considerable and contrariwise the cossacks for their part

 the russians have got into the neumark of brandenburg on those bad terms and are clearly aware that without some fortress as a place of arms they are an overgrown incompetency and monstrosity in the

by good johann of custrin and roofed with copper in the reformation timeswe know it from of old and friedrich has since had some knowledge of it custrin itself is a rugged little town with some moorland traffic and is still a place of great military strength the garrison of those parts its rough pavements its heavy stone battlements and barriers give it a guarled obstinate aspectstern enough place of exile for a crownprince fallen into such disfavor with papa a rugged compact by no means handsome little town at the meeting of the warta and the oder stands naturally among sedges willows and drained mire except that human industry is pleasantly busy upon it and has long been so that the neighborhood is populous beyond expectation studded with rough cottages in whitewash hamlets in a paved condition and comfortable signs of labor victoriously wrestling with the wilderness custrin an arsenal and garrison begirt with two rivers and with awful bulwarks and bastions cased in stoneperhaps too high say the learnedis likely to be impregnable to russian engineering on those terms here with brevity is the catastrophe of custrin  tuesday 15th august 1758 at two in the morning

wood in it so much disorder too the very soldiers some of them disorderly a bad deserter set so that it soon flamed aloftfrom side to side one sea of flame and man woman and child every soul except the garrison which sat enclosed in strong stone had to fly across the river under penalty of death by fire of custrin by five in the evening there was nothing left but the black ashes the garrison standing unharmed and the church schoolhouse and some stone edifices in a charred skeleton condition no life was lost except that of one child in arms all neumark had lodged its valuables in this place of strength all are fled now in horror and terror across the oder by the bridge before it also unquenchably takes fire at the western or nonrussian end of the place such a day as was seldom seen in human experiencefermor responsible for it happily not we  fermor in the evening said to his artillery people why have you ceased to fire grenadoes excellency the town is out nothing now but ashes and stone never mind give them the rest one every quarter of an hour we shall not need the grenadoes again the cannonballs we shall them therefore do not waste on the morrow morning after this performance on the town fermor sends a trumpeter surrender or else rather in the tremendous style or else answers the commandant pointing to the ashes to the black inconsumable stones and is deaf to this expostfacto trumpeter the russians say they sent one yesterday morning not expostfacto but he was killed in the pickeerings and never heard of again a mile or so to rear of custrin on the westward or berlin side of the river lies dohna for the last four days expecting that the laws of nature will hold good and custrin prove tenable against such sieging so stands it on friedrichs arrival  we left friedrich in the lebus suburb of frankfurt sunday august 20th listening to the distant cannonade next morning he is here himself at dohnas camp of gorgast taking survey of affairs came early under rapid small escort leaving his army to follow scorn and contemptuous indignation the humor of him they say resolution to be swiftly home upon that surprising russian armament and teach it new manners the black skeleton of custrin stares hideously across the river custrin siege so called still going onhad better make despatch now and take itself away he greatly despises russian soldiership pooh pooh he would answer if keith from experience said your majesty does not do it justiceand keith has been known to hint if the trial ever come your majesty will alter that opinion a day or two hence amid these hideous russian firetraceries the hussars bring him a dozen of cossacks they have made prisoners friedrich looks at the dirty green vagabonds says to one of his staff and this is the kind of doggery i have to bother withthe sight of the poor countrypeople and their tears of joy and of sorrow on his reappearance among them much affected him taking inspection of dohna he finds dohna wonderfully clean pipeclayed complete you are very fine indeed youi bring you a set of fellows rough as grasteufeln grassdevils i never know whether insects or birds but they can bitehope you can  tuesday august 32d at five in the morning our army has all arrived the frankfurt people just come in 30000 of us now in camp at gorgast friedrich orders straightway that a certain russian redoubt on the other side of the river at schaumburg a mile or two down stream be well cannonaded into ruinas if he took it for some incipiency of a russian bridge or were himself minded to cross here under cover of custrin friedrichs intention very certainly is to crosshere or not just hereand that same night after some hours of rest to the frankfurt peoplenight of tuesdaywednesday friedrich having persuaded the russians that his crossingplace will be their redoubt at schaumburg marches ten or twelve miles down the river silently his 30000 and he till opposite the village of gustebiese rapidly makes his bridges there unmolested fermor with his eye on the cannonaded redoubt only has expected no such matter and is much astonished when he hears of it twenty hours after friedrich across with the vanguard at an early hour of wednesday gets upon the knoll at gustebiese for a view and all gustebiese hearing of him hurries out with lowvoiced tremulous blessings irrepressible tears god reward your majesty that have come to usand there is a hustling and a struggling among the women especially to kiss the skirts of his coat poor souls one could have stood tremendous cheers but this is a thing i forgive friedrich for being visibly affected with  friedrich leaves his baggage on the other side of the oder and the bridge guarded our friend hordt with his freecorps doing it friedrich marches forward some ten miles that night eastward straight for gross kamin as if to take the russians in rear encamps at a place called klossow spreading himself obliquely towards the mutzel black sluggish tributary of the oder in those parts meaning to reach neu damm on the mutzel tomorrow there almost within wind of the russians and be ready for crossing on them it was at klossow 23d august evening that the hussars brought in their dozen or two of cossacks and he had his first sight of russian soldiery by no means a favorable one ugh only lookas we are now approaching zorndorf and the monstrous tug of battle which fell out there readers will be glad of the following  from damm on the mutzel where friedrich intends crossing it tomorrow night south to gross kamin not far from the warta where fermors headquarter lately was may be about five miles from custrin kamin lies northeast about eight or ten miles zorndorf the most considerable village in this tract lieslittle dreaming of the sad glory coming to itpretty much in the centre between big warta and smaller mutzel the country is by nature a peat wilderness far and wide but it has been tamed extensively grows crops green pastures is elsewhere covered with wood scotch fir scraggy in size but evidently under forest management perhaps half the country is in fir tracts what they call heiden heaths the cultivated spaces lying like lightgreen islands with blackgreen channels and expanses of circumambient fir the drewitz heath the massin or zither heath and others about zorndorf will become notable to us the country is now much drier than in friedrichs time the human spade doing its duty everywhere so that much of the battleground has become irrecognizable when compared with the old marshy descriptions given of it zorndorf a rough substantial hamlet has nothing of boggy now visible near by lies east to west a firm broad highway leading through a sea of forest before it to south to north good dry barleygrounds or ryegrounds sensibly rising for half a mile then waving about in various slow slight changes of level towards quartschen zicher c forming an irregular cleared island altogether of perhaps four miles by three with unlimited circumambiencies of wood it was here on this island as we call it that the battle which has made zorndorf famous was fought  zorndorf or even the open ground half a mile to north of it which will be more important to us is probably not 50 feet above the level of the mutzel nor 100 above warta and oder six miles off but it is the crown of the countrythe ground dropping therefrom every way in lazy dull waves or swells towards tamsel and gross kamin on southeast towards birkenbusch quartschen darmutzel dar of the mutzel whatever dar may be on northwest as well as towards damm and its bridge northeast where friedrich will soon be and towards custrin southwest where he lately was each a five or six miles from zorndorf  such is the poor moorland tract of country zorndorf the centre of itwhere the battle is likely to bezorndorf and environs a bare quasiisland among these woods extensive bald crown of the landscape girt with a frizzle of firwoods all round boggy pools there are especially on the western side all drained in our time mutzel or north side is of course the lowest in level and accordingly what is much to be marked by readers here from the south or zorndorf side at wide intervals there saunter along in a slow obscure manner three miserable continuous leakages or oozy threads of water all making for quartschen to north or northwest there to disembogue into the mutzel each of these has its little hollow of which the westernmost called zabern hollow zaberngrund is the most considerable and the most important to us here galgengrund gallowshollow is also worth naming in this battle the third leakage though without importance invites us to name it hosebruch quasi stockingquagmirebecause you can use no stockings there except with manifest disadvantagetake this other concluding trait   inexpressible fringe of marsh two or three miles broad mostly bottomless woven with sluggish creeks and stagnant pools borders the warta for many miles towards landsberg custrinlandsberg causeway the alone sure footing in it after which the country rises insensibly but most beneficially and is mainly drier till you get to the mutzel again and find the same fringe of mud lacework again zorndorf we called the crown of it tamsel wilkersdorf klein kamin gross kamin and other places known to us lie on the dry turffuel country but looking over close upon the hem of that marshfringe and no doubt getting peats wild ducks pikefishes eels and snatches of summer pasture and cowhay out of it  thursday august 24th friedrich is again speeding on occupying darmutzel and other crossingplaces of the mutzel mitchell to holderness dermitzel 24th august 1758 memoirs and papers i 425 ib ii 4047 mitchells private journalby no means himself crossing there on the contrary carefully breaking all the bridges before he go no retreat for those russian vagabonds only death or surrender for themhimself not intending to cross till he be up at damm neu damm well eastward of his russians and have got them all pinfolded between mutzel and oder in that way in the evening he reaches damm and the mill of damm some three or four miles higher up the mutzeland there pushes partly across at once that is to say his vanguard at once and takes a defensive position his artillery and other divisions by degrees in the silent night hours and before daybreak tomorrow every soul will be across and the bridge broken againand fermor had better have his accounts settled  fermors roving cossack clouds seldom bring him in intelligence but only return stained with charcoal grime and red murder up to late last night he had not known where friedrich was at all had idly thought him busy with the schaumburg redoubt on the other side of oder fencing and precautioning but now night of the 23d these cossacks do come in with news indisputable to our poor minds the prussians are at klossow yondercaptured a dozen green vagabonds of us and have sent us gallopingwhich news with the night closing in on him was astonishing thrice and four times important to fermor  instantly he raises the siege of custrin any siege there was gets his immense baggagetrain shoved off that night to klein kamin landsberg way summons the force from landsberg to join him without loss of a momentand in the meanwhile pitches himself in long bivouac in the drewitz wood or firheath with the quaggy zaberngrund in front quaggy zaberngrunddo readers remember it one of those three continuous leakages very important to fermor and us at present this is the safest place fermor can find for himself scraggy firs around good quagmires and zabern hollow in front looking to the east waiting what a new day will bring that was fermors posture while friedrich quitted klossow in the dawn of the 24th be busy ye cossack doggeries return with news not with mere grime and marks of blood on your mouths  evening of the 24th cossacks report that friedrich has got to damm mill has hold of the bridge there and may be looked for sure as the daylight tomorrow fermor is 50000 odd his landsberg forces all coming in one detachment out stettin way which cannot come in fermor finds that his baggagetrain is fairly on the road to klein kaminand that he will have to quit this bosky bivouac and fight for himself in the open ground or do worse     theseus and the minotaur over againthat is to say friedrich at handgrips with fermor and his russians 25th august 1758  artless fermor draws out to the open ground north of zorndorf south of quartschen arranges himself in huge quadrilateral mass with his staffbaggage lighter baggage in the centre and his front so to speak everywhere excellent plan of him or rather plans in his successive shapes in tielcke ii plates 4 5 6 7 8 mass say two miles long by one mile broad but it is by no means regular and has many zigzags according to the ground and narrows and droops southward on the eastern end one of the most artless arrangements but known to fermor and the readiest on this pinch of time munnich devised this quadrilateral mode and found it good against the turks and their deluges of raging horse and foot fermor could perhaps do better but there is such a press of hurry fermors western flank or biggest breadth of quadrilateral leans on that zabern hollow with its fine quagmires his eastern narrowest part droops down on certain mudpools and conveniences towards zicher gallows hollow a slighter than the zabern runs through the centre of him and with his best people he fronts towards the mutzel bridges especially towards dammmill bridge whence friedrich will emerge sure as the sunrise one knows not with what issue artless fermor is nothing daunted nor are his people but stand patiently under arms regardless of future and present to a degree not common in soldiering  friday august 25th by halfpast three in the morning friedrich is across the mutzel self and infantry by dammmutzel bridge cavalry by another bridge kerstenbrugge means christian bridge in the dialect of charlemagnes time a very old arrangement of successive logs up there some furlongs higher up the bridge at damm is perhaps some three miles from the nearest russians about zicher but friedrich has no thought of attacking fermor there he has a quite other program laid and will attack fermor precisely on the side opposite to there friedrichs intention is to sweep quite round this monstrous russian quadrilateral to break in upon it on the western flank and hurl it back upon mutzel and its quagmires he has broken his two bridges after passing all bridges are gone there and the country is bottomless surrender at discretion if once you are driven thither and friedrichs own retreat if he fail is short and open to custrin admirable say the critics and altogether in friedrichs stylefriedrich adds one critic was not aware that the russian heavybaggage train which is their powderflask and breadbasket and staff of life lies at klein kamin within few miles on his left just now russians themselves on his right that the russians could have been abolished from those countries without fighting at all retzow i 305329 this is very true friedrichs haste is great his humor hot and he has not heard of this kleinkamin fact which in common times he would have done and of which in a calmer mood he would with a fine scientific gusto have taken his advantage  friedrich pours incessant southward cavalry parallel to infantry and a certain distance beyond it eastward of it and they have burnt the bridges which is a curious fact continually southward as if for tamselpoor old tamsel do readers recollect it at all does friedrich at all no pleasant dinner or lilyandrose complexions there for one todaysome distance short of tamsel friedrich emerging turns westwardintending what on earth thinks fermor friedrich has been mostly hidden by the woods all this while and enigmatic to fermor fermor does now at last see the color of the factsand that ones chief front must change itself to southward ones best leg and arm be foremost or towards zorndorf not towards the mutzel as hitherto fermor stirs up his quadrilateral makes the required change you best or northern line step across and front southward across to southward i say secondbest go northward in their stead and so with some other slight polishings suggested by the ground and phenomena we anew await this prussian enigma with our best leg foremost the march or circular sweep of these prussian lines from damm bridge through the woods and champaign to their appointed place of action is seven or eight miles lines when halted in battleorder will be two miles long or more  friedrich pours steadily along horse and foot by the rear cf wilkersdorf of zorndorfrussian minotaur scrutinizing him in that manner with dull bloodshot eyes uncertain what he will do it is eight in the morning hot august wind a mere lull but southernly if any small hussar pickets ride to right of the main army march to keep the cossacks in check who are roving about all on wing and pert enough in spite of the hussar pickets desperado individuals of them gallop up to the infantry ranks and fire off their pistols therewithout reply reply or firing till the word come is strictly forbidden infantry pours along like a ploughman drawing his furrow heedless of the circling crows crows or cossacks finding they are not regarded set fire to zorndorf and gallop off zorndorf goes up readily mainly wood and straw rolls in big clouds of smoke far northward in upon the russian minotaur making him still blinder in the important moments now coming  friedrich rides up to view the zabern hollow beyond expectation deep very boggy too with its foul leakage or brook no attacking of their western flank through this zaberngrundattack the corner of them then here on the southwest that is friedrichs rapid resource the lines halt accordingly make ready behind flaming zorndorf stands his extreme left which is to make the attack infantry in front horse to rear and farther leftwardsand under the command of seidlitz in this quarter which is an important circumstance right wing reaching to behind wilkersdorf is to refuse itself whole force of centre is to push upon that russian corner to support the left in doing itaccording to the leuthen or leuctra principle once more may no mistakes occur in executing it this day  the first division of the prussian infantry or extreme left marches forward by the west end of flaming zorndorf next division which should stand close to right of it or even behind it in action and follow it close into the russian fire has to march by the east end of zorndorf this is a farther road owing to the flames and not a lucky one second division could never get into fair contact with that first division again that was the mistake and it might have been fatal but was not as we shall see first division has got clear of zorndorf in advancing towards its russian businessis striding forward its left flank safe against the zaberngrund steadily by fixed stages against the fated russian corner which is its point of attack first division second division are clear of zorndorf though with a wide gap between them are steadily striding forward towards the russian corner two strong batteries wide apart have planted themselves ahead and are playing upon the russian quadrilateral their fires crossing at the due corner yonder with terrible effect russian artillery which are multitudinous and all gathered down to this southwestern corner are responding though with their fire spread and far less effectual the prussian line steps on extreme left perhaps in too animated a manner their cannon batteries enfilade the thick mass of russians at a frightful rate fortytwo men of a certain regiment blown away by a single ball in one instance tielcke drive the interior baggagehorses to despair a very agitated quadrilateral under its grim canopy of cannon smoke and of straw smoke heaped on it from the zorndorf side here manteuffel leader of that first or leftmost division sees the internal simmering steps forward still more briskly to firing distance begins his platoon thunder with the due steady furyhad the second division but got up to support manteuffel the second division is in fire too but not close to manteuffel where it should be  fermor notices the gap the wavering of manteuffel unsupported plunges out in immense torrent horse and foot into the gap into manteuffels flank and front hurls manteuffel back who has no support at hand arah arah hurrah hurrah victory victory shout the russians plunging wildly forward sweeping all before them capturing twentysix pieces of cannon for one item what a moment for friedrich looking on it from some knoll somewhere near zorndorf i suppose hastily bidding seidlitz strike in seidlitz now the hurrahing russians cannot keep rank at that rate of going like a buffalo stampede but fall into heaps and gaps seidlitz with a swiftness with a dexterity beyond praise has picked his way across that quaggy zabern hollow falls with say 5000 horse on the flank of this big buffalo stampede tumbles it into instant ruinwhich proves irretrievable as the prussian infantry come on again and back seidlitz  in fifteen minutes more i guess it now to be ten oclock the russian minotaur this end of it on to the gallows ground is one wild mass seldom was there seen such a charge issuing in such deluges of wreck of chaotic flight or chaotic refusal to fly the seidlitz cavalry went sabring till for very fatigue they gave it up and could no more the russian horse fled to kutzdorffermor with them who saw no more of this fight and did not get back till darkhad not the bridges been burnt and no crossing of the mutzel possible fermor never would have come back and here had been the end of zorndorf luckier if it had but there is no crossing of the mutzel there is only drowning in the quagmires theredeath any way what can be done but die  the russian infantry stand to be sabred in the above manner as if they had been dead oxen more remote from seidlitz they break open the sutlers brandycasks and in few minutes get roaring drunk their officers desperate split the brandycasks soldiers flap down to drink it from the puddles furiously remonstrate with their officers and kill a good many of them viele says tielcke especially the foreign sort a frightful bloodbath by all the accounts bloodbath brandybath and chief nucleus of chaos then extant aboveground fermor is swept away this chaos the very prussians drawing back from it wearied with massacring lasts till about one oclock up to the gallowsground the minotaur is mere wreck and delirium but beyond the gallowsground the other half forms a new front to itself becomes a new minotaur though in reduced shape this is part first of the battle of zorndorf friedrichon the edge of great disaster at one moment but miraculously savedhas still the other half to do unlucky that he left no bridges on the mutzel and must again change his program  half of the minotaur is gone to shreds in this manner but the attack upon it too is spent what is to be done with the other half of the monster which is again alive which still stands and polypuslike has arranged a new life for itself a new front against the galgengrund yonder friedrich brings his right wing into action rapidly arranges right wing centre all of the left that is disposable with batteries with cavalry for an attack on the opposite or southeastern end of his monster if your monster polypuslike come alive again in the tailpart you must fell that other head of him batteries well in advance begin work upon the new head of the monster which was once his tail fresh troops long lines of them pushing forward to begin platoonvolleyingtime now i should guess about halfpast two our infantry has not yet got within musketrangewhen torrents of russian horse foot too following plunge out wideflowing stormfully swift and dash against the coming attack dash against it stagger it actually tumble it back in the centre part take one of the batteries and a whole battalion prisoners here again is a moment friedrich they say rushed personally into this vortex rallied these broken battalions again rallied and led them up but it was to no purpose they could not be made to stand these centre battalionssome sudden panic in them a thing unaccountable says tempelhof they are dohnas people who fought perfectly at jagersdorf and often elsewhere they were all in such a finely burnished state the other day but have not biting talent like the grassdevils enough they fairly scour away certain disgraceful battalions and are not got ranked again till below wilkersdorf above a mile off though the grassdevils on both hands of them stand grimly steady left in this ominous manner  what would have become of the affair one knows not if it had not been that seidlitz once more made his appearance on friedrichs order or on his own i do not know but sure it is seidlitz with sixtyone squadrons arriving from some distance breaks in like a deus ex machina swift as the stormwind upon this russian horsetorrent drives it again before him like a mere torrent of chaff back ever back to the shore of acheron and the stygian quagmires of the mutzel namely so that it did not return again and the prussian infantry had free field for their platoon exercise their rage against the russians was extreme and that of the russians corresponded three of these grassdevil battalions who stood nearest to dohnas runaways were natives of this same burntout zorndorf country we may fancy the plattteutsch hearts of them and the sacred lightning with a moisture to it that was in their eyes plattteutsch platooning bayonetchargingon such terms no russian or mortal quadrilateral can stand it the russian minotaur goes all to shreds a second time but will not run no quarterwell then none  shortly after four oclock say my accounts the firing regular firing altogether ceased ammunition nearly spent on both sides prussians snatching cartridgeboxes of russian dead and then began a tug of deadly massacring and wrestling man to man with bayonets with butts of muskets with hands even with teeth in some russian instances such as was never seen before the russians beaten to fragments would not run whither run behind is mutzel and the bog of acheronon mutzel is no bridge left the shore of mutzel is thick with men and horses who have tried to cross and lie there swallowed in the oozelike a pavement says tielcke the russiansnever was such vis inertiae as theirs now they stood like sacks of clay like oxen already dead not even if you shot a bullet through them would they fall at once says archenholtz but seem to be deliberate about it  complete disorder reigned on both sides except that the prussians could always form again when bidden the russians not this lasted till nightfallrussians getting themselves shoved away on these horrid terms and obstinate to take no other towards dark there appeared on a distant knoll something like a ranked body of them againsome 2000 foot and half as many horse whom themicoud superlative swiss cossack usually written demikof or demikow had picked up and persuaded from the shore of acheron back to this knoll of vantage and some cannon with them friedrich orders these to be dispersed again general forcade with two battalions taking the front of them shall attack there you general rauter bring up those dohna fellows again and take them in flank forcade pushes on rauter toobut at the first taste of cannonshot these poor dohnapeople such their now flurried disgraced state of mind take to flight again worse than before rush quite through wilkersdorf this time into the woods and can hardly be got together at all scandalous to think of no wonder friedrich looked always askance on those regiments that had been beaten at gross jagersdorf and to the end of his life gave them proofs of it retzowand still more emphatically briefe eines alten preussischen officiers hohenzollern 1790 i 34 ii 52 c very natural if the rest were like these  of poor general rauter tempelhof and the others that can help it are politely silent only saxon tielcke tells us that friedrich

reunited in place and luck such a chaos as fermor never saw before or after no regiment or battalion now is mere simmering monads this fine army officers doing their utmost to cobble it into something of rank without regard to regiments or qualities darkness seldom sank on such a scene  wild cossack parties are scouring over all parts of the field robbing the dead murdering the wounded doing arson

next day saturday 26th fermor again brought into some kind of rank and safe beyond the quaggy zabern ground sent out a proposal that there be truce of three days for burying the deaddohna who happened to be general in command there answers that it is customary for the victor to take charge of burying the slain that such proposal is surprising and quite inadmissible in present circumstances fermor in the mean while had drawn himself out fronting his late battlefield and the morning sun and began cannonading across the zabern ground too far off for hitting but as if still intending fight to which the prussians replied with cannon and drew out before their tents in fighting order in both armies there was question or talk of attacking anew but in both there was want of ammunition want of real likelihood on fermors side that of attacking could be talk only and on friedrichs besides the scarcity of ammunition all creatures foot and especially horse were so worn out with yesterdays work it was not judged practically expedient a while before noon the prussians retired to their camp again leaving only the artillery to respond so far as needful and bowwow across the zabern ground till the russians lay down again  friedrichs hussars knew of the russian wagenburg or general baggage reservoirs at klein kamin by this time the hussars had been in it last night rummaging extensively at discretion for some time and had brought away much money and portable plunder why friedrich who lay direct between fermor and his wagenburg did not this day extinguish said wagenburg i do not know but guess it may have been a fault of omission in the great welter this was now grown to be to the weary mind beyond question if one had blown up fermors remaining gunpowder and carried off or burnt his mealsacks he must have cowered away all the faster towards landsberg to seek more or perhaps friedrich now judged it immaterial and a question only of hours  about midnight of saturdaysunday there again rose bowwowing bellowing of russian cannon not from beyond the zabern ground this time nor stationary anywhere but from the south some transient part of it and not far offone ball struck a carriage near the kings tent and shattered it thick mist mantles everything and it is difficult to know what the russians have on hand in their sylvan seclusions after a time it becomes manifest the

among the gazetteers on both partstill the dust settled and facts appeared as they were to the effect te deum non laudamus alas no we must retract and it was good gunpowder thrown after bad  on always homewards but at its own pace waited on by dohna goes the russian monster violently caseshotting if you prick into its rearward parts one palmbachunder romanzow i think who had not taken part in the battle being out stettin way and unable to join till nowpalmbach with a detachment of 15000 which was thought sufficient for the object did try to make a dash on colberghow happy had we any port on the baltic to feed us in this country but though colberg is the paltriest crowsnest bicoque according to all engineers and is defended only by 700 militia the colonel of them one heyde a gray old halfpay not yet renowned in the soldier world as he here came to be palmbach with his best diligence could make nothing of it but after battering bombarding even scalading and in all ways blurting and blazing at a mighty rate for four weeks and wasting a great deal of gunpowder and 2000 russian lives withdrew on those remarkable terms in heldengeschichte v 349365 3d31st october 1758 a complete and minute journal of this first siege of colberg which is interesting to read of as all the three of them are and did then as tail of fermor what fermor and the russian monster was universally doing make off at a good pacehaving nothing to live upon fartherand vanish from those countries to the relief of dohna and mankind  september 2d friedrich leaving all that had marched for saxony his presence urgently required there daun ought to be far on with the conquest of that country might have had it say judges if he had been as swift as someat zorndorf among the russian prisoners were certain generals soltikof czernichef sulkowski the pole proud people in their own eyes no lodging for them but the cellars of custrin russian generals complained is this a lodging for fieldofficers of rank friedrich was not used to profane swearing or vituperative outbursts but he answered to the effect silence ye incendiary individuals is there a choice left of lodgings and for you above others upon which they lay silent for some days till better suited in fact till exchangedand perhaps will soon turn up on us again     chapter xivbattle of hochkirch  so soon as friedrich quitted bohemia and silesia for his russian enterprise there rose high question at vienna to what shall our daun now turn himself a daun a reichs army free for new employment in saxony not much to oppose them in silesia almost nothing in comparison recapture of silesia yes truly that is the steady polestar at vienna but they have no magazines in silesia no siegefurnitures and the season is far spent they decide that there shall be a stroke upon dresden and recovery of saxony in friedrichs absence nothing there at present but a prince henri weak in numbers say one to two of the reichs army by itself let the reichs army rise now and advance through the metal mountains from southeast on prince henri let daun circle round on him through the lausitz from northeast cannot they extinguish henri between them snatch dresden a weak illfortified place by sudden onslaught and recapture saxony that will be magnanimous to our august alliesand that will be an excellent scaffolding for recapture of silesia next year and cannot daun leave a force in the silesian vicinitiesdeville with so many thousands harsch with so manyto besiege one of their frontier places neisse for example siegefurnitures to come from mahren neisse is not farther from olmutz than olmutz was from it  that was the scheme fallen upon now getting executed while friedrich is at zorndorf well away and that if readers fix it intelligently in their memory will suffice to introduce to them the few words more that can be allowed us here upon it a very few words compressed to the utmostmerely as preface to hochkirch whither we must hasten hochkirch being the one incident which except to studious soldiers has now and here any interest out of the very many incidents which then and there were so intensely interesting to all mankind to readers who are curious and will take with them any poorest authentic outline of the localities concerned the following condensed note will not be unintelligible     daun and the reichs army invade saxony in friedrichs absence  daun pushing out with his best speed along the bohemiansilesian border had got to zittau august 17th which poor city is to be his basis and storehouse the greatest activity and wagoning now visible thereamong the burnt walls getting rebuilt and in the same days zweibruck and his reichs army are vigorously afoot zweibruck pushing across the metal mountains the fastest he can intending to plant himself in pirna country not to mention general dombale zweibrucks austrian second who has the austrian 15000 with him and by way of preface has emerged to westward in zwickautschopau country calculating that prince henri will not be able to attend to him just now and in effect prince henri intent upon zweibruck and the pirna country takes position in the old prussian ground there headquarter gross seidlitz as in 1756 and can only leave a detachment in tschopau country to wait upon dombale who does at least shoot out croat parties quite across saxony to halle all the way and entertain the gazetteers if he can do little real mischief  august 19th from zittau daun after short pause again pushes forwardnothing but ziethen attending him in the distance till we see whitherwardmargraf karl waiting impatient at grussau till ziethen see tempelhof ii 258 260 et seq daun soon after zittau shoots out loudon brandenburg way as if magnanimously intending cooperation with the russians which would give daun pleasure could it be done without cost loudon does despatch a 500 hussars to frankfurt friedrich now gone for custrin who i think carry a letter for fermor there but lose it by the wayfor the benefit of readers if they will wait loudon captures a poor little place in brandenburg itself bullies it into surrender after a day the very day of zorndorf battle august 25thplace called peitz garrisoned by fortyfive invalids who go on free withdrawal poor old souls and leave their exiguous stock of saltvictual and military furnitures to loudon in heldengeschichte v 229232 the capitulation in extenso upon which loudon whirls back out of those countries finding his skirts trodden on by ziethenwho now sees what daun and he are at and warns margraf karl properly keith who has now joined again as real president or chief that hither is the way margraf karl on the slip for some time past starts from grussau instantly i should guess not above 25000 of all arms leaving fouquet with perhaps 10000 to do his utmost when generals harsch and deville with their 20 or 30000 come upon silesia and himas indeed they are already doing already blockading neisse more or less with an eye to besieging it so soon as possible  meanwhile serene highness of zweibruck the reichsfolk and some austrians with him prefaced by dombale more to westward is wending into pirna country and in spite of what prince henri can do mayor and the free corps shining diligent and henri one of the watchfulest of men zweibruck does get in sets maguire with austrians upon besieging pirna that is to say the sonnenstein of pirna 3d5th september gets the sonnenstein a thought sooner than was counted on in heldengeschichte v 223228 account of this poor siege and of the movements before and after and roots himself thereheadquarters in struppen again bridge at oberraden again all as in 1756 which if nothing else can well do it may give his highness a momentary interest with some readers here prince henri is at gross seidlitz alive every fibre of him but with daun circling round to northward on his left intending evidently to take him in flank or rear with dombale already to rear in the above circumstances on his right and zweibruck himself lying here in front free to act and impregnable if acted upon what is prince henri to do it is for henris rear not his flank that daun aims august 26th daun who had got to gorlitz a march or two from zittau started again at his best step by the bautzen highway towards meissen bridge a 70 or 80 miles down the elbe there daun intends to cross and to double back upon dresden and prince henri who will thus find himself enclosed between three firesif two were not enough or even if one the daun one itself or the zweibruck itself not to count the dombale in such strength as prince henri has  a lost prince henriif there be not shift in him if there be not help coming to him prince henri seeing how it was drew back from gross seidlitz with beautiful suddenness one night unmolested in the morning zweibruchs hussars find him posted inexpugnable on the heights of gahmigwhich is nearer dresden a good step nearer dombale and not so ready to be enclosed by daun without enclosure of dresden too prince henris manoeuvring in this difficult situation is the admiration of military men how he stuck by gahmig but threw out in the vital points little campscamp of kesselsdorf a place memorable on the west of dresden and on the east in the north suburb of dresden itself across the river should we have to go across the river for dauns sake a strong abatis and neglected nothing self and everybody under him lively as eagles to make themselves dangerous mayer in particular distinguishing himself much prince henri would have been a hard morsel for daun but beyond that there is help on the road     friedrich intervening daun draws back intrenches himself in neighborhood to dresden and pirna friedrich following him four armies standing there in deadlock for a month with issue a flankmarch on the part of friedrichs army which halts at hochkirch september 12thoctober 10th 1758  daun since august 26th is striding towards meissen bridge without rest day after day at the very top of his speedwhich i find is nine miles a day tempelhof ii 261 bos being heavy of foot at his best september 1st daun has got within ten miles of meissen bridge whenhere is news my friends king of prussia has beaten our poor russians will soon be in full march this way king of prussia and margraf karl both bending hitherward at the rate say of nineteen miles a day instead of ninemeissen bridge is not the thing we shall want daun instantly calls halt at this news waits intrenches and in a day or two finding the news true hurries to rearward all he can from the russian side too daun has heard of zorndorf and the grand victory of fermor there but knows well by this sudden reemergence of the antifermor what kind of victory it is  was it here while waiting about meissen or where was it that daun got his letter to fermor answered in that singular way the letter of two weeks agocarried by loudons hussars or by whomsoeverfor certain it was retorted or returned upon daun not as if from the deadletter office but with an answer he little expected here is what record i have very vague for a wellknown little fact of sparkling nature  a curious letter fell into friedrichs hands bearer i always guess the loudon hussarcaptain with his 500 pretending to form junction with fermor prussian hussars picking it up somewheredate place circumstances blurred into oblivion in those poor books letter itself indisputable enough and answer following on it letter and answer substantially to this effect  daun to fermor probably from zittau by loudons hussars  your excellenz does not know that wily enemy as i do by no means get into battle with such a one cautiously manoeuvre about detain him there till i have got my stroke in saxony done dont try fighting him  daun  answer as from fermor zorndorf once done daun by the first opportunity got his answer duly signed fermor but evidently in a certain kings handwriting  your excellenz was in the right to warn me against a cunning enemy whom you knew better than i here have i tried fighting him and got beaten your unfortunate fermor muller

margraf karl correct to their appointment meet at grossenhayn some miles north of meissen and its bridge by which time daun is clean gone again back well above dresden again strongly posted at stolpen a place we once heard of in general haddicks time last year well in contact with dauns pirna friends across the river and out of dangerous neighborhoods friedrich and the margraf have followed daun at quick step but daun would pause nowhere till he got to stolpen among the bushy gullets and chasms september 12th friedrich had speech of henri and the pleasure of dining with him in dresden glad to meet again under fortunate management on both parts and with much to speak and consult about  a day or two before there had lain or is said to have lain a grand scheme in daun zweibruck to burst out from pirna by daybreak and attack the camp of gahmig in front 35000 against 20000 daun to cross the river on pontoons some hours before under cloud of night and be ready on rear and left flank of gahmig with as many supplemental thousands as you like what can save prince henri beautiful plan on which there were personal meetings and dinings together by zweibruck and daun but nothing done tempelhof ii 262265 at the eleventh hour say the austrian accounts zweibruck sent word impossible tomorrow cannot get in my outparties in timeand next day here is friedrich come and a collapse of everything or perhaps there never seriously was such a plan certain it is daun takes camp at stolpen a place known to him one of the strongest posts in germany intrenches himself to the teethgood rearguard towards zittau and the magazines river and pirna on our left flank loudon strong and busy on our right flank barring the road to bautzenand obstinately sits there a very bad tooth in the jaw of a certain king not to be extracted by the best kinds of forceps and the skilfulest art for nearly a month to come four armies friedrichs henris dauns zweibrucks all within swordstroke of each otherthe universal gazetteer world is on tiptoe but except friedrichs eager shiftings and rubbings upon stolpen west side north and at length northeast side all is deadlock and nothing comes of it  friedrich has his food convenient from dresden but a road to bautzen withal is what he cannot do withoutand there lies the sorrow and the aching as this tooth knows well and this jaw well harsch and deville are busy upon neisse have neisse under blockade perhaps upon kosel too for some time past neisse blockaded more and more since august 4th kosel still earlier but only by pandour people not completely so till september 30th or even till october 26th heldengeschichte v 268270 and are carting the siegestock to begin bombardment a road to silesia before very long friedrich must and will have friedrichs operations on daun in this post are patiently artful and curious to look upon but beyond description here enough to say that in the second week he makes his people hut themselves weather wet and bad and in the fourth week finding that nothing contrivable would provoke daun into fightinghe loads at dresden provisions for i think nine days makes from two or from three sides a sudden spurt upon loudon who is dauns northern outpost brushes loudon hastily away and himself takes the road for bautzen by dauns right flank thrown bare in this manner tempelhof ii 278  road for bautzen which is the road for zittau withal for dauns breadbasket as well as for neisse and harsch nine days provision that is our small outfit that and our own righthands and the waste world lies all ahead october 1st retzow as vanguard sweeps out the few croats from bautzen deposits his mealwagons there occupies hochkirch and the hilly environs to east is to take possession of weissenberg especially and of the stromberg hill and other strong points which retzow punctually does forgetting nothingexcept perhaps the stromberg not quite remembered in time a thing of small consequence in retzows view since all else had gone right  hearing of which daun with astonishment finds that he must quit those beautifully chasmy fastnesses of stolpen and look to his bread which is getting to lie under the enemys feet if zittau road be left yonder as it is october 5th after councils of war and deliberation enough daun gets under way ib ii 279 cautiously favored by a night very dark and wet glides through to right of friedrichs people softly along between bautzen and the pirna country nobody molesting him so dark and wet and after one other march in those bosky solitudes sits down at kittlitzahead or to east of bautzen of hochkirch of retzow and all friedrichs peopleand again sets to palisading and intrenching there kittlitz near lobau there is dauns new headquarter lobau water with its intricate hollows his line of defence his posts going out a mile to north and to south of kittlitz and so sits once more blocking zittau road and quietly waiting what friedrich will do  friedrich is at bautzen since the 7th impatient enough to be forward but must not till a second larger provisionconvoy from dresden come in convoy once in friedrich hastens off tuesday 10th october towards weissenberg country where retzow is some ten or twelve miles to eastwardzittauward if that chance to suit us silesiaward as is sure to suit at the pass of jenkowitz short way from bautzen pandours attempt our baggage need to be battered off and again off which apprises friedrich that dauns whole army is ahead in the neighborhood somewhere marching on friedrich from the knoll of hochkirch shoulder of the southern hills gets complete view of daunstretching north and south at right angles to the zittau roads and to friedrich in the way we describedand is a little surprised and i could guess piqued at seeing daun in such a state of forwardness encamp here then he sayshere on this row of heights parallel to daun within a mile of daun just here i tell you under the very nose of daun who is above two to one of us and see what daun will do marwitz his favorite adjutant one of those freespoken marwitzes loyal skilful but liable to stiff fits takes the liberty to remonstrate argue says at length he marwitz dare not be concerned in marking out such an encampment not he for his poor part and is put under arrest and another adjutant does it cannon playing on his people and him while engaged in the operation  friedrichs obstinate rashness this tuesday evening has not wanted its abundant meed of blamerendered so emphatic by what befell on saturday morning next his somewhat too authoritative fixity a certain radiancy of selfconfidence dangerous to a man his sovereign contempt of daun as an inert dark mass who durst undertake nothing all this is undeniable and worth our recognition in estimating friedrich one considerably extenuating circumstance does at last turn upin the shape of a new piece of blame to the erring friedrich his sudden anger namely against the meritorious general retzow his putting retzow under arrest that tuesday evening how general retzow you have not taken hold of the stromberg for me that is the secret of retzow and on studying the ground you will find that the stromberg a blunt tabular hill of good height detached and towering well up over all that region might have rendered friedrichs position perfectly safe seize me the stromberg tomorrow morning the first thing ordered friedrich and a detachment went accordingly but found dauns people already thereindisposed to go nay determined not to go and getting reinforced to unlimited amounts so that the stromberg was left standing and remained dauns furnished with plenty of cannon by daun retzows arrest retzow being a steady favorite of friedrichs was only of a few hours pardonable that oversight thinks friedrich though it came to cost him dear for the rest i find friedrichs keeping of this camp without the stromberg was intended to end the third day hence saturday 14th then since friday proves impossible friedrich had settled and it did end saturday 14th though at an earlier hour and with other results than had been expected keith said the austrians deserve to be hanged if they dont attack us here we must hope they are more afraid of us than even of the gallows answered friedrich a very dangerous camp untenable without the stromberg let us try to understand it and dauns position to it in some slight degree  hochkirch highkirk is an old wendishsaxon village standing pleasantly on its hilltop conspicuous for miles round on all sides or on all but the south side where it abuts upon other heights which gradually rise into hills a good deal higher than it the village hangs confusedly a jumble of cottages and colegarths on the crown and north slope of the height thatched in part tiled and built mostly of rough stone blocks in our timenot of wood as probably in friedrichs a solid sluttishly comfortablelooking village with pleasant hayfields or long narrow haystripes each villager has his stripe reaching down to the northern levels the church is near the top churchyard and some little space farther are nearly horizontal ground till the next height begins sloping up again towards the woody hills southward the view from this little esplanade atop still better from the church belfry is wide and pretty free on all sides except the south pleasant heights and hollows of arable of wood or pasture well watered by rushing brooks all making northward direct for spree the berlin spree or else into the lobau water which is the first big branch of spree  the place is still partly of wendish speech the parson has to preach one half of the sunday in wend the other in german among the hills to south well worth noting at present is one called czarnabog or devils hill where the wendish devil and his witches equal to any german on his blocksberg or preternatural bracken of the harz hold their annual witchessabbatha thing not to be contemplated without a shudder by the wendish mind thereabouts and close from hochkirch southward all is shadowy intricacy of thicket and wild wood northward too from hochkirch and all about i perceive the scene was woodier then than nowand must have looked picturesque enough had anybody been in quest of that with the multifarious uniforms and tented people sprinkled far and wide among the leafy redandyellow of october 1758 tourists note september 1858  in the village of wuischke precisely at the northern base of that shaggy czarnabog or devils hill stand loudon and 3000 croats and grenadiers as the extreme left of dauns position wuischke is nearly straight south of hochkirch so far westward has loudon pushed forward with his croats hidden among the hills though dauns general position lies a good mile to east of friedrichsirregularly north and south both friedrich and daun the former ignorant what croats and loudonries there may be among those devils hills to his right the latter not ignorant friedrichs right wing keith in command of it stretches to hochkirch and a little farther beyond hochkirch it has four flank battalions in potence form with proper vedettes and pickets and above all with a strong battery of twenty guns which it maintains on the next height immediately adjoining hochkirch and perceptibly higher than hochkirch this is the finis of keith on his right andexcept those vedettes and pickets of freecorps people thrown out a little way ahead into the bushes on that sidefriedrichs right wing knows nothing of the shaggy elevations horrent with wood which lie to southward and merely intends to play its twenty cannon upon them should they give birth to anything this is friedrichs posture on his right or south wing  from hochkirch northward or nearly so but sprinkled about in all the villages and points of strength as far up as drehsa and beyond drehsa to near kotitz a less important village friedrich extends about four miles centre at rodewitz where his own headquarter is above two miles north of hochkirch not far from rodewitz but a little to left and ahead stands his second and best battery of thirty guns ready to play upon lauska a poor village and its roadway should the austrians try anything there or from their stromberg post which is a good mile behind lauska his strength in these lines some count to be only 28000 or less four or five miles to northeast in and behind weissenberg which we used to know last summer lies retzow with perhaps 10 or 12000 which will bring him up to 40000 were they properly joined with him as a left wing dauns force counts 90000 with friedrich lying under his nose in this insolent manner  dauns headquarter as we said is kittlitz a village some two miles short of lobau in the direction southeast of friedrich perhaps five miles to southeast of rodewitz friedrichs lodging it is close upon the bautzenzittau highway zittau some twenty miles to south of it herrnhuth and the pacific brethren about halfway thither kittlitz lies more to south than hochkirch itself and dauns outposts as we saw circle quite round among those devils hills and envelop friedrichs right flank but dauns main force lies chiefly northward and well to west of kittlitz parallel to friedrich and eastward of him with elaborate intrenchments every village brook bridge height and bit of good ground stromberg to end with punctually secured obliquely over the stromberg holding the stromberg and certain villages to southeast and to northwest of it lies dahremberg as right wing about 20000 he put into oblique potence looking into kotitz which is friedrichs extreme left and in a good measure dividing friedrich from the retzow 10000 and lastly as reserve in front of reichenbach eight or nine miles to east of all that lies the prince of badendurlach 25000 or so barring retzow on that side and all attempts on the silesian road there dauns lines not counting in the southern outposts or devilshill parties are considerably longer than friedrichs and also considerably deeper the two headquarters are about five miles apart but the two frontsdivided by a brook and good hollow running here one of many such making all for lobau waterare not half a mile apart towards hochkirch and the top of this brook the opposing posts are quite crammed close on one another divided only by their hollow many brooks each with a definite hollow run tinkling about here swift but straitened to get out especially lobau water which receives them all has to take a quite meandering circling course through dauns quarters and beyond them before it can disembogue in spree and decidedly set out for berlin under that new name the landscapeseen from hochkirch village still better from the churchsteeple which lifts you high above it and commands all round except to the south where friedrichs batteryheight quite shuts you in and hides even those devils hills beyondis cheerful and pretty village belfries steeples and towers airy green ridges of heights and intricate greener valleys now rather barer than you like the tourist tells me in friedrichs time there must have been a great deal more of wood than now     what actually befell at hochkirch saturday 14th october 1758  friedrich for some timeprobably ever since wednesday morning when he found the stromberg was not to be hishad decided to be out of this bad post in which clearly enough nothing was to be done unless daun would attempt something else than more and more intrenching and palisading himself friedrich on the second day thursday 12th rode across to weissenberg to give retzow his directions and take view of the ground saturday night herr retzow sooner it cannot be friedrich had aimed at friday night but finds the provisionconvoy cannot possibly be up saturday night in all silence we sweep round out of thiswe and youhurl badendurlach about his business and are at schops and reichenbach and the silesian highway open next morning to us tempelhof ii 320 quietly everything is speeding on towards this consummation on friedrichs part but on dauns part there isstarted i should guess on the very same thursdayanother consummation getting ready which is to fall out on saturday morning fifteen hours before that other and entirely supersede that other  keiths opinion that the austrians deserve to be hanged if they dont attack us here is also loudons opinion and lacys and indeed everybodysand at length dauns own who determines to try something here if never before or after this plan all judges admit was elaborate and good and was well executed toodaun himself presiding over the most critical part of the execution a plan to have ruined almost any army except this prussian one and the captain it chanced to have a universal camisado or surprisal of friedrich in his camp before daylight everybody knows that it took effect hochkirch saturday 14th october 1758 5 am of a misty morning nobody expects of an unassisted fellowcreature much light on so doubly dark a thing but the truth is there are ample accounts exact though very chaotic and the thing steadily examined till its essential features extricate themselves from the unessential proves to be not quite so unintelligible and nothing like so destructive overwhelming and ruinous as was supposed  dauns plan is very elaborate and includes a great many combinations all his 90000 to come into it simultaneously or in succession but the first and grandly vital part mainspring and father to all the rest is this that daun in person after nightfall of friday shall with the pick of his force say 30000 horse and foot with all their artilleries and tools silently quit his now position in front of hochkirch friedrichs right wing shall sweep off silently to southward and leftward by wuischke thence westward and northward by the northern base of those devil mountains through the shaggy hollows and thick woods there hitherto inhabited by croats only and unknown to the prussians forward ever forward through the nightwatches that way till he has fairly got to the flank of hochkirch and friedrich daun to be standing there all round from the southern environs of hochkirch westward through the woods by meschwitz steindorfel and even north to waditz if readers will consult their map silently enclosing friedrich as in the bag of a net in this mannerready every man and gun by about four on saturday morning are to wait for the stroke of five in hochkirch steeple and there and then to begin businessthere first but on success there the whole 90000 everywhereand to draw the strings on friedrich and bag and strangle his astonished people and him  the difficulty has been to keep it perfectly secret from so vigilant a man as friedrich but daun has completely succeeded perhaps friedrichs eyes have been a little dimmed by contempt of daun daun for the last two days especially has been more diligent than ever to palisade himself on every point nothing seemingly on hand but felling woods building abatis against some dangerous lionsspring they say also he detected a traitor in his camp traitor carrying letters to friedrich under pretence of fresh eggsone of the eggs blown and a note of dauns procedures substituted as yolk you are dead sirrah said daun hoisted to the highest gallows are not you but put in a note of my dictating and your beggarly life is saved retzow junior though there is no evidence except of the circumstantial kind thinks this current story may be true retzow i 347 certain it is neither friedrich nor any of his people had the least suspicion of dauns project till the moment it exploded on them when the clock at hochkirch struck five daun in the last two days had been felling even more trees than they are aware ofthousands of trees in those devils wildernesses to friedrichs right and has secretly hewn himself roads passable by night for men and ammunitionwagons thereand in front of friedrich especially hochkirch way daun seems busier than ever felling wood this friday night numbers of people running about with axes with lanterns over there as if in the push of hurry and making a great deal of noise intending retreat for zittau tomorrow thinks friedrich as the false eggyolk had taught him or merely that poor precautionary fellow supposing the false yolk a myth in short daun has got through his nocturnal wildernesses with perfect success and stands dreamt of by no enemy in the places appointed for his 30000 and him and that poor old clock of hochkirch unweariedly grunting forward to the stroke of five will strike up something it is little expecting  the prussians have vedettes pickets and small outposts of freecorps people scattered about within their border of that austrian wood the body of which about hochkirch as everywhere else belongs wholly to croats of course there are guardparties sentries duly vigilant in the big battery to southeast of hochkirchand along southwestward in that potence or forearm of four battalions which are stationed there four good battalions looking southward there with cavalry to right ziethens cavalrywhose horses stand saddled through the night ready always for the nocturnal pandourade which seldom fails them there as elsewhere are the due vigilances watchmen watchfires the rest of the prussian army is in its blankets wholly asleep while daun stands waiting for the stroke of five  that daun bursting in with his chosen 30000 will trample down the sleeping prussian potence at hochkirch capture its big battery to left its village of hochkirch to rear and do extensive ruin on the whole right wing of friedrich rendering friedrich everywhere an easy conquest to the rest of dauns people who stand far and wide duly posted and prepared waiting only their signal from hochkirch much of this all of it that had regard to hochkirch battery and village and the prussians stationed there daun did execute and readers from the data they have got must conceive the manner of ithuman description of the next two hours about hochkirch in the thick darkness there and stormful sudden inroad and stormful resistance made being manifestly an impossible thing nobody was massacred in his bed as the sympathetic gazetteers fancied nobody was killed that i hear of without arms in his hand but plenty of people perished fierce of humor on both sides and from halfpast five till towards eight there was a general blaze of fiery chaos pushing out ever and anon swallowed in the belly of night again such as was seldom seen in this world instead of confused details and wearisome enumeration of particulars which nobody would listen to or understand we will give one intelligent young gentlemans experience our friend tempelhofs who stood in this part of the prussian line experience distinct and indubitable to us and which was pretty accurately symbolical i otherwise see of what befell on all points thereabouts faithfully copied and in the essential parts not even abridged here it is  tempelhof at that time a subaltern of artillery was stationed with a couple of 24pounders in attendance on the battalion plothow which with three others and some cavalry lay to the south side of hochkirch forming a kind of forearm or potence there to right of the big battery with their rear to hochkirch and keeping vedettes and freecorps parties spread out into the woods and devils hills ahead tempelhof had risen about three as usual had his guns and gunners ready and was standing by the watchfire expecting the customary pandourade and what form it would take this morning close on five oclock and not a mouse stirring we are not to have our pandourade then on a sudden noise bursts out noise enough sharp fire among the freecorps people fire growing ever sharper noisier for the next halfhour but nothing whatever to be seen battalion plothow had soon got its clothes on all to the spatterdashes and took rank to right and left of the fleche and of my two guns in front of its post but on account of the thick fog everything was totally dark i fired off my cannons shall we say straight southward to learn whether there was anything in front of us no answer nothing therepshaw a mere crackery geknacker of pandours and our freecorps people after all but the noise grew louder and came ever nearer i turned my guns towards it southward southeastward or perhaps a gun each wayand here we had a salvo in response from some battalions who seemed to be two hundred yards or so ahead the battalion plothow hereupon gave fire i too plied my cannons what i couldand had perhaps delivered fifteen double shots from them when at once i tumbled to the ground and lost all consciousness for some minutes or moments  awakening with the blood running down his face poor tempelhof concluded it had been a musketshot in the head but on getting to his hands and knees he found the place full of austrian grenadiers who had crept in through our tents to rear and that it had been a knock with the butt of the musket from one of those fellows and not a bullet that had struck him down battalion plothow assailed on all sides resisted on all sides and tempelhof saw from the groundi suppose by the embers of watchfires and by rare flashes of musketry for they did not fire much having no room but smashed and stabbed and cutan infantry fight which in murderous intensity surpasses imagination i was taken prisoner at this turn but soon after got delivered by our cavalry again tempelhof ii 324 n  this latter circumstance of being delivered by the cavalry i find to be of frequent occurrence in that first act of the business there the prussian battalion surprised on front and rear always makes murderous fight for itself is at last overwhelmed obliged to retire perhaps opening its way by bayonet chargeupon which our cavalry ziethens and others that gathered to him cutting in upon the disordered surprisers cut them into flight rescue the prisoners and for a time reinstate matters the prussian battalions do not run nobody runs but when repulsed by the endless odds rally again the big battery is not to be had of them without fierce and dogged struggle and is retaken more than once or twice still fiercer more dogged was the struggle in hochkirch village especially in hochkirch church and churchyardwhither the battalion margrafkarl had flung themselves the poor village soon taking fire about them soon taking fire and continuing to be a scene of capture and recapture by the flamelight while battalion margrafkarl stood with invincible stubbornness pouring death from it not to be compulsed by the raging tide of austrian grenadiers not by six austrian battalions by eight or by never so many stood at bay there levelling whole masses of themtill its cartridges were spent all to one or two per man and major lange the heroic captain of it said we shall have to go then my men let us cut ourselves throughand did so in an honorably invincible manner some brave remnant actually getting through with lange himself wounded to death  i think it was not till towards six oclock that the right wing generally became aware what the case was more than a pandourade yesthough what it might be in the thick fog which had fallen blotting out all vestiges of daylight nobody could well say rallied battalions reinforced by this or the other battalion hurrying up from leftward always charge in upon the enemy in hochkirch or wherever he is busy generally push him back into the night but are then fallen upon on both flanks by endless new strength and obliged to draw back in turn and ziethens horse in the mean while do execution breaking in on the tumultuous victors new cuirassiers gensdarmes dashing up to help so soon as saddled and charging with a will so that on the whole the enemy variously attempting could make nothing of us on that western or rearward sidethanks mainly to ziethen and the horse had we but waited till three or four of our battalions had got up say the prussian narrators but it is thick mist few yards ahead you cannot see at all unless it be flame and close at hand all things and figures waver indistincthairy outlines of blacker shadows on a ground of black  it must have been while lange was still fighting perhaps before lange took to the church of hochkirch scarcely later than halfpast six but nobody thought of pulling out his watch in such a businessabout six or halfpast six when keith who has charge of this wing and lodges somewhere below or north of hochkirch came to understand that his big battery was taken that here was such a pandourade as had not been before and that of a surety said battery must be retaken keith springs on horseback hastily takes battalion kannacker and several remnants of others rushes upwards leaving hochkirch a little to right direct upon the big battery recaptures the big battery but is set upon by overwhelming multitudes bent to have it backis passionate for new assistance in this vital point but can get none had been disarted by both his aidedecamps says poor john tebay a wandering english horsesoldier who attends him as mounted groom asked twenty times and twenty more where are my aidedecamps captens cockcey and goudy he calls themcocceji whose father the kanzler we have seen and gaudi whose selfwho both had in succession struck into hochkirch as the less desperate place according to tebay see tebays letter to mitchell crossen october 29th in memoirs and papers ii 501505which is probably true every word allowing for tebays temper but is highly indecipherable though not entirely so after many readings and researehingsbut could get no response or reinforcement and at length quite surrounded and overwhelmed had to retire opening his way by the bayonet and before long suddenly stopping shortfalling dead into tebays arms shot through the heart two shots on the right side he had not regarded but this on the left side was final keiths fightings are suddenly all done tebay in distraction tried much to bring away the body but could by no present means distractedly rid for a coach found on return that the austrians had the ground and the body of his master hochkirch church and all now undisputedly theirs  to appearance it was this news of keiths repulse i know not whether of keiths death as yet that first roused friedrich to a full sense of what was now going on two miles to south of him friedrich according to his habits must have been awake and afoot when the business first broke out though for some considerable time treating it as nothing but a common crackery of pandours already finding the pandourade louder than usual he had ordered out to it one battalion and the other that lay handy but now he pushes forward several battalions under franz of brunswick his youngest brotherinlaw with margraf karl and prince moritz swift you to hochkirch yonderand himself springs on horseback to deal with the affair prince franz of brunswick poor young fellow cheerily coming on near hochkirch had his head shorn off by a cannonball moritz of dessau too riding within twenty yards of the austrians so dark was it he so nearsighted got badly hitand soon after driving to bautzen for surgery was made prisoner by pandours in archenholtz i 289 290 his dangerous adventures on the road to bautzen in this wounded condition never fought again died next year of cancer in the lip nothing but triumphant austrian shot and cannonshot going yonder these battalions too have to fall back with sore loss  friedrich himself by this time is forward in the thick of the tumult with another body of battalions storming furiously along has his horse shot under him storms through successfully by the other side of hochkirch hochkirch to his leftbut finds as the mist gradually sinks a ring of austrians massed ahead on the  map goes here facing page 160 book xviii  heights as far as steindorfel and farther a general continent of austrians enclosing all the south and southwest and in fact that here is now nothing to be done that the question of his flank is settled that the question now is of his front which the appointed austrian parties are now upon attacking question especially of the heights of drehsa and of the pass and brook of drehsa rearward of his centre part where his one retreat will lie steindorfel being now lost part first of the affair is ended part second of it begins  rapidly enough friedrich takes his new measures seizes drehsa height which will now be key of the field despatches mollendorf thither mollendorf our courageous leuthen friend who vigorously bestirs himself gets hold of drehsa height before the enemy can ziethen cooperating on the heights of kumschutz canitz and other points of vantage and thus in effect friedrich pulls up his torn right skirt as he is doing all his other skirts into new compact front against the austrians so that in that southwestern part especially the austrians do not try it farther but retire at full gallop on sight of this swift seizure of the keys by mollendorf and ziethen friedrich also despatches instant order to retzow to join him at his speediest friedrich everywhere rearranges himself hither thither with skilful rapidity in new line of battle still hopeful to dispute what is left of the fieldlonging much that retzow could come on wings  by this time towards eight if i might guess day has got the upper hand the daun austrians stand visible on their ring of heights all round behind hochkirch and our late battery on to westward and northward as far as steindorfel and waditzextremely busy rearranging themselves into something of line there being much confusion much simmering about in clumps and gaps after such a tussle in front of us to eastward the appointed austrian parties are proceeding to attack but in daylight and with our eyes open it is a thing of difficulty and does not prosper as hochkirch did duke dahremberg on their extreme right had in charge to burst in upon our left so soon as he saw hochkirch done dahremberg does try as do others in their places near daun but with comparatively little success dahremberg meeting something of check or hindrance where he tried pauses for a good while till he see how others prosper their grand chance is their superiority of number and the fact that friedrich can try nothing upon them but must stand painfully on the defensive till retzow come to friedrich retzow seems hugely slow about it but the truth is badendurlach with his 20000 of reserve has as per order made attack on retzow 20000 against 12 one of the feeblest attacks conceivable but sufficient to detain retzow till he get it repulsed retzow is diligent as time and will be here  meanwhile the austrians on front do in a sporadic way attack and again attack our batteries and posts especially that big battery of thirty guns which we have to north of rodewitz the austrians do take that battery at last and are beginning again to be dangerousthe rather as dahremberg seems again to be thinking of business it is high time retzow were here few sights could be gladder to friedrich than the first glitter of retzows vanguardhorse under prince eugen of wurtembergbeautifully wending down from weissenberg yonder skilfully posting themselves at belgern and elsewhere as thorns in the sides of dahremberg sharp enough on trial by dahremberg followed before long by retzow himself serenely crossing lobau water and with great celerity and the best of skill likewise posting himselfhopelessly to dahremberg who tries nothing farther the sun is now shining it is now ten of the day had retzow come an hour soonerefore we lost that big battery and other things but he could come no sooner be thankful he is here at last in such an overawing manner  friedrich judging that nothing now can be made of the affair orders retreat retreat which had been getting schemed i suppose and planned in the gloom of the royal mind ever since loss of that big battery at rodewitz little to occupy him in this interim except indignant waiting rigorously steady and some languid interchange of cannonshot between the parties retreat is to kleinbautzen neighborhood new headquarter doberschutz outposts

would be surprised to discover some hints of him will perhaps be allowed us farther on     sequel of hochkirch the campaign ends in a way surprising to an attentive public 22d october20th november 1758  there followed upon hochkirch five weeks of rapid events such as nobody had been calculating on to the reader so weary of marchings manoeuvrings surprisals campings and details of war not many words we hope may render these results conceivable  friedrich stayed ten days refitting himself in that camp of kleinbautzen on one of the branches of the spree daun who had retired to his old strong place on the 14th scarcely occupying hochkirch field at all came out in about a week and took a strong post near friedrich not attempting anything upon him but watching him now better within sight friedrichs fixed intention is to march to neisse all the same what probably daun under the shadow of his laurels and his new papal hat may not have considered possible with the road to neisse blocked by 80000 men friedrich has refitted himself with the requisite new cannon and furnitures from dresden especially with prince henri and 6000 foot and horseled by prince henri in person so prince henri would have it the capricious little man and that finck should be left in saxony instead of him all which weakens saxony not a little but friedrich hopes the reichs army is a feeble article ill off for provision in those parts and not likely to attempt very much on the sudden accordingly     friedrich marches enigmatically not on glogau but on reichenbach and gorlitz to dauns astonishment  sunday evening october 22d convoy of many wagons quit bautzen bautzen proper not the village but the town laden with all the wounded of hochkirch above 3000 by count to carry them to dresden for deliberate surgery keiths tebay i perceive is in this convoy not ill hurt but willing to lie in hospital a little and consider these poor fellows cannot get to dresden on the second day a daun detachment hussaring about in those parts is announced ahead and by new order from headquarters the convoy turns northwards for hoyerswerdato tebays disgust with the commandant shied off says tebay for twelve hussars second letter from tebay in mitchell ubi supraand i think in the end went on to glogau instead of dresden which was very fortunate for tebay and the others the poor wounded being thus disposed of friedrich next night at 10 oclock monday 23d in the softest manner pushes off his bakery and army stores a little way northward down the spree valley on the western fork of the spree fork farthest from daun follows himself with the rest of the army next evening down the eastern fork also northward going for glogau thinks daun when the hussars report about it late on tuesday night let him go if he fancy that a road to neisse but indeed what other shift has he considers daun but to try rallying at glogau yonder safe under the gunsand is not in the slightest haste about this new matter tempelhof ii 341347  united with his baggagecolumn friedrich proceeds northeastward crosses spree still northward or northeastward encamps there in the dark hours of tuesday no daun heeding him before daylight however friedrich is again on foot in several columns now for the bad countryroads aheadand has struck straight southeastward if daun were noting him and in the afternoon of wednesday daun is astonished to learn that this wily enemy is arrived in reichenbach vicinity sweeping in our poor posts thereabouts immovably astride of the silesian highway after all an astonished daun hastens out what he can to take survey of the sudden phenomenon tries it next day and next with his best loudons and appliances finds that this phenomenon can actually march to neisse ahead of him indifferent to pandours or giving them as good as they bringand that nothing but a battle and beating could we rashly dream of such a thing which we cannot will prevent it very well then daun strives to say and lets the phenomenon march from gorlitz october 30th loudon harassing the rear of it for some days not without counter harassment much waste of cannonading and ruin to several poor lausitz villages by fireprussians scandalously burn them when we attack says loudon till at last finding this march impregnably arranged split into two routes and ready for all chances loudon also withdraws to more promising business poor general retzow senior was of this march absolutely could not be excused though fallen ill of dysentery like to dieand did die the day after he got to schweidnitz when the difficulties and excitement were over retzow i 372  of friedrichs march onward from gorlitz we shall say nothing farther except that the very wind of it was salvatory to his silesian fortresses and

army try some siege of dresden 9th16th november  october 30th daun seeing neisse siege as good as gone to water decided with himself that he could still do a far more important stroke capture dresden get hold of saxony in friedrichs absence daun turned round from reichenbach accordingly and at his slowfooted pace addressed himself to that new errand had he made better despatch or even been in better luck it is very possible he might have done something there in dresden and in governor schmettau with his small garrison there is no strength for a siege in saxony is nothing but some poor remnant under finck much of it freecorps and light people capable of being swallowed by the reichs army itselfwere the reichs army enterprising or in good circumstances otherwise it is true the russians have quitted colberg as impossible and are flowing homewards dragged by hunger the little dohna army will therefore march for saxony the little antiswedish army under wedell has likewise been mostly ordered thither both at their quickest for daun all turns on despatch loiter a little and friedrich himself will be here again  daun i have no doubt stirred his slow feet the fastest he could november 7th daun was in the neighborhood of pirna country again had his bridge at pirna for communication urged the reichs army to bestir itself now or never reichs army did push out a little against finck made him leave that perpetual camp of gahmig take new camps kesselsdorf and elsewhere and at length made him shoot across elbe to the northwest on a pontoon bridge below dresden with retreating room to northward and shelter under the guns of that city reichs army has likewise made powerful detachments for capture of leipzig and the northwestern towns capture of torgau the magazine town first of all summon them with force evidently overpowering free withdrawal if you dont resist and if you do at torgau there was actual attempt made november 12th rather elaborate and dangerous looking under

and gesticulation as was quite extraordinary as if wedell were here already till wedells self did come in sight and the overpowering reichs detachment made its best speed elsewhither tempelhof c letter from a prussian officer in heldengeschichte v 286 the other sieges remained things of theory the other reichs detachments hurried home i think without summoning anybody  meanwhile daun with the proper artilleries at last ready comes flowing forward november 8th9th and takes post in the great garden or south side of dresden minatory to schmettau and that city the walls or works are weak outside there is nothing but mayer and the free corps to resist who indeed has surpassed himself this season and been extraordinarily diligent upon that lazy reichs army commandant schmettau signifies to daun the day daun came in sight if your excellenz advance farther on me the grim rules of war in besieged places will order that i burn the suburbs which are your defences in attacking meand actually fills the fine houses on the southern suburb with combustible matter making due announcements to court and population as well as to dann burn the suburbs answers daun in the name of civilized humanity you will never think of such thing that will i your excellenz of a surety and do it answers schmettau so that dresden is full of pity terror and speculation the common rumor is says excellency mitchell who is sojourning there for the present that bruhl nefarious bruhl born to be the death of us has persuaded polish majesty to sanction this enterprise of daunsvery careless bruhl what become of dresden or us so the king of prussia be well hurt or spited  certain enough november 9th daun does come on regardless of schmettaus assurances so that about midnight mayer who can hear the enemy busily building four big batteries withal has to report himself driven to the edge of those high houses which are filled with combustibles and that some croats are got into the upper windows burn them then answers schmettasu such the dire necessity of sieged places and at 3 am three hours notice to the poor inmates mayer does so hideous flames bursting out punctually at the stroke of 3 whole suburb seemed on blaze about a sixth part of it actually so nay you would have said the whole town was environed in flames excellency mitchell climbed a steeple will not describe to your lordship the horror the terror and confusion of this night wretched inhabitants running with their furniture what of it they had got flung out between 12 oclock and 3 towards the great garden all dresden to appearance girt in flames ruins and smoke such a night in dresden especially in the pirna suburb as was never seen before mitchell memoirs and papers i 459 in heldengeschichte v 295302 minute account corresponding well with mitchells ib 303333 the certified details of the damage done 280 houses lost 4 human lives this was the sad beginning or attempt at beginning of dresden siege and this also was the end of it on dauns part at present for four days more he hung about the place minatory hesitative but attempted nothing feasible and on the fifth dayfor a certain weighty reason as the austrian gazettes express ithe saw good to vanish into the pirna rockcountry and be out of harms way in the mean while  the truth is dauns was an intricate case just now needing above all things swiftness of treatment what of all things it could not get from daun his denunciations on that burnt suburb were again loud but schmettau continues deaf to all thatmeans to defend himself by the known rules of war and of honor declares he will dispute from street to street and only finish in the middle of polish majestys royal palace denunciation will do nothing daun had above 100000 men in those parts rushing forward with sharp shot and bayonet storm instead of logical denunciation it is probable daun might have settled his schmettau but the hour of tide was rigorous withaland such an ebb if you missed it in hesitating november 15th daun withdrew the ebbing come that same day friedrich was at lauban in the lausitz within a hundred miles again speeding hitherward behind him a silesia brushed clear before him a saxony to be brushed reason weighty enough think daun and the austrian gazettes but such since you have missed the tidehour is the inexorable fact of ebbgoing at that frightful rate daun never was the man to dispute facts  november 20th friedrich arrived in dresden heard next day that daun had wheeled decisively homeward from pirna country that the reichs army and he are diligently climbing the metal mountains and that there is not in saxony more than in silesia an enemy left what a sequel to hochkirch neisse and dresden both we had hoped as sequel if lucky neisse or dresden seemed infallible and we are climbing the metal mountains under facts superior to us  and campaign third has closed in this mannerleaving things much as it found them essentially a drawn match contending parties little altered in relative strengthboth of them it may be presumed considerably weaker friedrich is not triumphant or shining in the light of bonfires as last year but in the mind of judges stands higher than ever if that could help him muchand is not annihilated in the least which is the surprising circumstance  friedrichs marches especially have been wonderful this year in the springtime old marechal de belleisle french minister of war consulting officially about future operations heard it objected once but if the king of prussia were to burst in upon us there the king of prussia is a great soldier answered m de belleisle but his army is not a shuttle navetteto be shot about in that way from side to side of the world no surely not altogether but the king of prussia has among other arts an art of marching armies which by degrees astonishes the old marechal to come upon us en navette suddenly like a shuttle from the other side of the web became an established phrase among the french concerned in these unfortunate matters archenholtz i 316 montalembert saepius for the phrase en navette  the pittandferdinand campaign of 1758 says a note which i would fain abridge is more palpably victorious than friedrichs much more an affair of bonfires than his though it too has had its rubs loss of honor at crefeld loss of louisburg and codfishery these are serious blows our enemy has had but then to temper the joy over louisburg there was at ticonderoga by abercrombie on the small scale all the extent of scale he had a melancholy platitude committed that of walking into an enemy without the least reconnoitring of him who proves to be chindeep in abatis and fieldworks and kills much at his ease about 2000 brave fellows brought 5000 miles for that object and obliges you to walk away on the instant and quit ticonderoga like asurely like a very tragic dignitary in cockedhat to be cashiered we will hope at least to be laid on the shelf and replaced by some wolfe or some amherst fitter for the business nor were the descents on the french coast much to speak of great guns got at cherbourg these truly as exhibited in hydepark were a comfortable sight especially to the simpler sort but on the other hand at morlaix on the part of poor old general bligh and company there had been a platitude equal or superior to that of abercrombie though not so tragical in loss of men what of that said an enthusiastic public striking their balance and joyfully illuminatinghere is a clipping from ohio country letter of an officer distilled

turn it to use this day a detachment of us goes to braddocks field of battle poor braddock to bury the bones of our slaughtered countrymen many of whom the french butchered in cold blood and to their

couple of stupid fellows general prince von ysenburg and general oberg detached by ferdinand on that service escape the lively treatment ferdinand had prepared for him and even gave a kind of beating to each of those stupid fellows 1 fight of sandershausen broglio as soubises vanguard 12000 versus ysenburg 7000 who stupidly would not withdraw till beaten 23d july 1758 before ferdinand had come

and his detachment altogether had soubise been alert which he by no means was paris made such jeering about rossbach and the prince de soubise says voltaire histoire de louis xv  and nobody said a word about these two victories of his next year for which there might be two reasons one according to tempelhof that the victories were of the soso kind sic waren auch darnach and another that they were ascribed to broglio on both occasionshow justly nobody will now argue  contades had not failed in the mean while to follow with the main army and was now elaborately manoeuvring about intent to have lippstadt or some fortress in those rhineweser countries on the tail of that second soso victory by soubise contades thought now would be the chance and did try hard but without effect ferdinand was himself attending contades and mistakes were not likely ferdinand in the thick of the game october 21st30th made a masterly movementthat is to say cut contades and his soubise irretrievably asunder no junction now possible to them the weaker of them liable to ruinunless contades the stronger would give battle which though greatly outnumbering ferdinand he was cautious not to do a melancholic cautious man apt to be overcautiousnicknamed lapothecaire by the parisians from his down looksbut had good soldier qualities withal soubise and he haggled about a short whilenot a long in

neufchatel  dresden 23d november 1758  there is nothing left for us mon cher mylord but to mingle and blend our weeping for the losses we have had if my head were a fountain of tears it would not suffice for the grief i feel  our campaign is over and there has nothing come of it on one side or the other but the loss of a great many worthy people the misery of a great many poor soldiers crippled forever the ruin of some provinces the ravage pillage and conflagration of some flourishing towns exploits these which make humanity shudder sad fruits of the wickedness and ambition of certain people in power who sacrifice everything to their unbridled passions i wish you mon cher mylord nothing that has the least resemblance to my destiny and everything that is wanting to it your
