77640922	captains all  by ww jacobs    the constables move  illustration the constables move  mr bob grummit sat in the kitchen with his corduroyclad legs stretched on the fender  his wifes halfeaten dinner was getting cold on the table mr grummit who was badly in need of cheering up emptied her halfempty glass of beer and wiped his lips with the back of his hand  come away i tell you he called  dye hear  come away  youll be locked up if you dont  he gave a little laugh at the sarcasm and sticking his short pipe in his mouth lurched slowly to the frontroom door and scowled at his wife as she lurked at the back of the window watching intently the furniture which was being carried in next door  come away or else youll be locked up repeated mr grummit  you mustnt look at policemens furniture its agin the law  mrs grummit made no reply but throwing appearances to the winds stepped to the window until her nose touched as a walnut sideboard with bevelled glass back was tenderly borne inside under the personal supervision of policeconstable evans  theyll be aving a pianner next said the indignant mr grummit peering from the depths of the room  theyve got one responded his wife theres the end if it stickin up in the van  mr grummit advanced and regarded the end fixedly  did you throw all them tin cans and things into their yard wot i told you to he demanded  he picked up three of em while i was upstairs replied his wife  i eard im tell her that theyd come in handy for paint and things  thats ow coppers get on and buy pianners said the incensed mr grummit sneaking other peoples property  i didnt tell you to throw good uns over did i  wot dye mean by it  mrs grummit made no reply but watched with bated breath the triumphal entrance of the piano  the carman set it tenderly on the narrow footpath while p c evans stooping low examined it at all points and mrs evans raising the lid struck a few careless chords  showing off explained mrs grummit with a half turn and shes got fingers like carrots  its a disgrace to mulberry gardens to ave a copper come and live in it said the indignant grummit and to come and live next to me thats what i cant get over  to come and live next door to a man wot has been fined twice and both times wrong  why for two pins id go in and smash is pianner first and im after it  he wont live ere long you take my word for it  why not inquired his wife  why repeated mr grummit  why  why becos ill make the place too ot to hold him  aint there enough houses in tunwich without im acoming and living next door to me  for a whole week the brain concealed in mr grummits bulletshaped head worked in vain and his temper got correspondingly bad  the day after the evans arrival he had found his yard littered with tins which he recognized as old acquaintances and since that time they had travelled backwards and forwards with monotonous regularity  they sometimes made as many as three journeys a day and on one occasion the heavens opened to drop a battered tin bucket on the back of mr grummit as he was tying his bootlace  five minutes later he spoke of the outrage to mr evans who had come out to admire the sunset  i heard something fall said the constable eyeing the pail curiously  you threw it said mr grummit breathing furiously  me  nonsense said the other easily  i was having tea in the parlour with my wife and my motherinlaw and my brother joe and his young lady  any more of em demanded the hapless mr grummit aghast at this list of witnesses for an alibi  it aint a bad pail if you look at it properly said the constable i should keep it if i was you unless the owner offers a reward for it itll hold enough water for your wants  mr grummit flung indoors and after wasting some time concocting impossible measures of retaliation with his sympathetic partner went off to discuss affairs with his intimates at the bricklayers arms  the company although unanimously agreeing that mr evans ought to be boiled were miserably deficient in ideas as to the means by which such a desirable end was to be attained  make im a laughingstock thats the best thing said an elderly labourer  the police dont like being laughed at  ow demanded mr grummit with some asperity  theres plenty o ways said the old man  i should find em out fast enough if i ad a bucket dropped on my back i know  mr grummit made a retort the feebleness of which was somewhat balanced by its ferocity and subsided into glum silence  his back still ached but despite that aid to intellectual effort the only ways he could imagine of making the constable look foolish contained an almost certain risk of hard labour for himself  he pondered the question for a week and meanwhile the tinsto the secret disappointment of mr evansremained untouched in his yard  for the whole of the time he went about looking as mrs grummit expressed it as though his dinner had disagreed with him  ive been talking to old bill smith he said suddenly as he came in one night  mrs grummit looked up and noticed with wifely pleasure that he was looking almost cheerful  hes given me a tip said mr grummit with a faint smile a copper mustnt come into a freeborn englishmans ouse unless hes invited  wot of it inquired his wife  you wasnt think of asking him in was you  mr grummit regarded her almost playfully  if a copper comes in without being told to he continued he gets into trouble for it  now dye see  but he wont come said the puzzled mrs grummit  mr grummit winked  yes e will if you scream loud enough he retorted  wheres the copperstick  have you gone mad demanded his wife or do you think i ave  you go up into the bedroom said mr grummit emphasizing his remarks with his forefinger  i come up and beat the bed black and blue with the copperstick you scream for mercy and call out help murder and things like that  dont call out police cos bill aint sure about that part  evans comes bursting in to save your lifeill leave the door on the latchand there you are  hes sure to get into trouble for it  bill said so  hes made a study o that sort o thing  mrs grummit pondered this simple plan so long that her husband began to lose patience  at last against her better sense she rose and fetched the weapon in question  and you be careful what youre hitting she said as they went upstairs to bed  wed better have igh words first i spose  you pitch into me with your tongue said mr grummit amiably  mrs grummit first listening to make sure that the constable and his wife were in the bedroom the other side of the flimsy wall complied and in a voice that rose gradually to a piercing falsetto told mr grummit things that had been rankling in her mind for some months  she raked up misdemeanours that he had long since forgotten and not content with that had a fling at the entire grummit family beginning with her motherinlaw and ending with mr grummits youngest sister  the hand that held the copperstick itched  any more to say demanded mr grummit advancing upon her  mrs grummit emitted a genuine shriek and mr grummit suddenly remembering himself stopped short and attacked the bed with extraordinary fury  the room resounded with the blows and the efforts of mrs grummit were a revelation even to her husband  illustration mr grummit suddenly remembering himself stopped short and attacked the bed with extraordinary fury  i can hear im moving whispered mr grummit pausing to take breath  murder wailed his wife  help  help  mr grummit changing the stick into his left hand renewed the attack mrs grummit whose voice was becoming exhausted sought a temporary relief in moans  ishedeaf panted the wifebeater or wot  he knocked over a chair and mrs grummit contrived another frenzied scream  a loud knocking sounded on the wall  hellp moaned mrs grummit  halloa there came the voice of the constable  why dont you keep that baby quiet  we cant get a wink of sleep  mr grummit dropped the stick on the bed and turned a dazed face to his wife  hehes afraidto come in he gasped  keep it up old gal  he took up the stick again and mrs grummit did her best but the heart had gone out of the thing and he was about to give up the task as hopeless when the door below was heard to open with a bang  here he is cried the jubilant grummit  now  his wife responded and at the same moment the bedroom door was flung open and her brother who had been hastily fetched by the neighbours on the other side burst into the room and with one hearty blow sent mr grummit sprawling  hit my sister will you he roared as the astounded mr grummit rose take that  mr grummit took it and several other favours while his wife tugging at her brother endeavoured to explain  it was not however until mr grummit claimed the usual sanctuary of the defeated by refusing to rise that she could make herself heard  joke repeated her brother incredulously  joke  mrs grummit in a husky voice explained  her brother passed from incredulity to amazement and from amazement to mirth  he sat down gurgling and the indignant face of the injured grummit only added to his distress  best joke i ever heard in my life he said wiping his eyes  dont look at me like that bob i cant bear it  get off ome responded mr grummit glowering at him  theres a crowd outside and half the doors in the place open said the other  well its a good job theres no harm done  so long  he passed beaming down the stairs and mr grummit drawing near the window heard him explaining in a broken voice to the neighbours outside strong men patted him on the back and urged him gruffly to say what he had to say and laugh afterwards  mr grummit turned from the window and in a slow and stately fashion prepared to retire for the night  even the sudden and startling disappearance of mrs grummit as she got into bed failed to move him  the beds broke bob she said faintly  beds wont last for ever he said shortly sleep on the floor  mrs grummit clambered out and after some trouble secured the bedclothes and made up a bed in a corner of the room  in a short time she was fast asleep but her husband broad awake spent the night in devising further impracticable schemes for the discomfiture of the foe next door  he saw mr evans next morning as he passed on his way to work  the constable was at the door smoking in his shirtsleeves and mr grummit felt instinctively that he was waiting there to see him pass  i heard you last night said the constable playfully  my word  good gracious  wots the matter with you demanded mr grummit stopping short  the constable stared at him  she has been knocking you about he gasped  why it must ha been you screaming then  i thought it sounded loud  why dont you go and get a summons and have her locked up i should be pleased to take her  mr grummit faced him quivering with passion  wot would it cost if i set about you he demanded huskily  two months said mr evans smiling serenely praps three  mr grummit hesitated and his fists clenched nervously  the constable lounging against his doorpost surveyed him with a dispassionate smile that would be besides what youd get from me he said softly  come out in the road said mr grummit with sudden violence  its agin the rules said mr evans sorry i cant  why not go and ask your wifes brother to oblige you  he went in laughing and closed the door and mr grummit after a frenzied outburst proceeded on his way returning the smiles of such acquaintances as he passed with an icy stare or a stronglyworded offer to make them laugh the other side of their face  the rest of the day he spent in working so hard that he had no time to reply to the anxious inquiries of his fellowworkmen  he came home at night glum and silent the hardship of not being able to give mr evans his deserts without incurring hard labour having weighed on his spirits all day  to avoid the annoyance of the piano next door which was slowly and reluctantly yielding up the last rose of summer note by note he went out at the back and the first thing he saw was mr evans mending his path with tins and other bricabrac  nothing like it said the constable looking up  your missus gave em to us this morning  a little gravel on top and there you are  he turned whistling to his work again and the other after endeavouring in vain to frame a suitable reply took a seat on an inverted washtub and lit his pipe  his one hope was that constable evans was going to try and cultivate a garden  the hope was realized a few days later and mr grummit at the back window sat gloating over a dozen fine geraniums some lobelias and calceolarias which decorated the constables plot of ground  he could not sleep for thinking of them  he rose early the next morning and after remarking to mrs grummit that mr evanss flowers looked as though they wanted rain went off to his work  the cloud which had been on his spirits for some time had lifted and he whistled as he walked  the sight of flowers in front windows added to his good humour  he was still in good spirits when he left off work that afternoon but some slight hesitation about returning home sent him to the bricklayers firms instead  he stayed there until closing time and then being still disinclined for home paid a visit to bill smith who lived the other side of tunwich  by the time he started for home it was nearly midnight  the outskirts of the town were deserted and the houses in darkness  the clock of tunwich church struck twelve and the last stroke was just dying away as he turned a corner and ran almost into the arms of the man he had been trying to avoid  halloa said constable evans sharply  here i want a word with you  mr grummit quailed  with me sir he said with involuntary respect  what have you been doing to my flowers demanded the other hotly  flowers repeated mr grummit as though the word were new to him flowers  what flowers  you know well enough retorted the constable  you got over my fence last night and smashed all my flowers down  you be careful wot youre saying urged mr grummit  why i love flowers  you dont mean to tell me that all them beautiful flowers wot you put in so careful as been spoiled  you know all about it said the constable choking  i shall take out a summons against you for it  ho said mr grummit  and wot time do you say it was when i done it  never you mind the time said the other  cos its important said mr grummit  my wifes brotherthe one youre so fond ofslept in my ouse last night  he was ill arf the night pore chap but come to think of it itll make im a good witness for my innocence  if i wasnt a policeman said mr evans speaking with great deliberation id take hold o you bob grummit and id give you the biggest hiding youve ever had in your life  if you wasnt a policeman said mr grummit yearningly id arf murder you  the two men eyed each other wistfully loth to part  if i gave you what you deserve i should get into trouble said the constable  if i gave you a quarter of wot you ought to ave i should go to quod sighed mr grummit  i wouldnt put you there said the constable earnestly i swear i wouldnt  everythings beautiful and quiet said mr grummit trembling with eagerness and i wouldnt say a word to a soul  ill take my solemn davit i wouldnt  when i think o my garden began the constable  with a sudden movement he knocked off mr grummits cap and then seizing him by the coat began to hustle him along the road  in the twinkling of an eye they had closed  tunwich church chimed the halfhour as they finished and mr grummit forgetting his own injuries stood smiling at the wreck before him  the constables helmet had been smashed and trodden on his uniform was torn and covered with blood and dirt and his good looks marred for a fortnight at least  he stooped with a groan and recovering his helmet tried mechanically to punch it into shape  he stuck the battered relic on his head and mr grummit fell backawed despite himself  it was a fair fight he stammered  the constable waved him away  get out o my sight before i change my mind he said fiercely and mind if you say a word about this itll be the worse for you  do you think ive gone mad said the other  he took another look at his victim and turning away danced fantastically along the road home the constable making his way to a gaslamp began to inspect damages  they were worse even than he had thought and leaning against the lamppost he sought in vain for an explanation that in the absence of a prisoner would satisfy the inspector  a button which was hanging by a thread fell tinkling on to the footpath and he had just picked it up and placed it in his pocket when a faint distant outcry broke upon his ear  he turned and walked as rapidly as his condition would permit in the direction of the noise  it became louder and more imperative and cries of police became distinctly audible  he quickened into a run and turning a corner beheld a little knot of people standing at the gate of a large house  other people only partially clad were hastening towards them  the constable arrived out of breath  better late than never said the owner of the house sarcastically  mr evans breathing painfully supported himself with his hand on the fence  they went that way but i suppose you didnt see them continued the householder  halloa he added as somebody opened the hall door and the constables damaged condition became visible in the gaslight  are you hurt  yes said mr evans who was trying hard to think clearly  to gain time he blew a loud call on his whistle  the rascals continued the other  i think i should know the big chap with a beard again but the others were too quick for me  mr evans blew his whistle againthoughtfully  the opportunity seemed too good to lose  did they get anything he inquired  not a thing said the owner triumphantly  i was disturbed just in time  the constable gave a slight gulp  i saw the three running by the side of the road he said slowly  their behaviour seemed suspicious so i collared the big one but they set on me like wild cats  they had me down three times the last time i laid my head open against the kerb and when i came to my senses again they had gone  he took off his battered helmet with a flourish and amid a murmur of sympathy displayed a nasty cut on his head  a sergeant and a constable both running appeared round the corner and made towards them  get back to the station and make your report said the former as constable evans in a somewhat defiant voice repeated his story youve done your best i can see that  mr evans enacting to perfection the part of a wounded hero limped painfully off praying devoutly as he went that the criminals might make good their escape  if not he reflected that the word of a policeman was at least equal to that of three burglars  he repeated his story at the station and after having his head dressed was sent home and advised to keep himself quiet for a day or two  he was off duty for four days and the tunwich gazette having devoted a column to the affair headed a gallant constable modestly secluded himself from the public gaze for the whole of that time  to mr grummit who had read the article in question until he could have repeated it backwards this modesty was particularly trying  the constables yard was deserted and the front door ever closed  once mr grummit even went so far as to tap with his nails on the front parlour window and the only response was the sudden lowering of the blind  it was not until a week afterwards that his eyes were gladdened by a sight of the constable sitting in his yard and fearing that even then he might escape him he ran out on tiptoe and put his face over the fence before the latter was aware of his presence  wot about that ere burglary he demanded in truculent tones  good evening grummit said the constable with a patronizing air  wot about that burglary repeated mr grummit with a scowl  i dont believe you ever saw a burglar  mr evans rose and stretched himself gracefully  youd better run indoors my good man he said slowly  telling all them lies about burglars continued the indignant mr grummit producing his newspaper and waving it  why i gave you that black eye i smashed your elmet i cut your silly ead open i  youve been drinking said the other severely  you mean to say i didnt demanded mr grummit ferociously  mr evans came closer and eyed him steadily  i dont know what youre talking about he said calmly  mr grummit about to speak stopped appalled at such hardihood  of course if you mean to say that you were one o them burglars continued the constable why say it and ill take you with pleasure come to think of it i did seem to remember one o their voices  mr grummit with his eyes fixed on the others backed a couple of yards and breathed heavily  about your height too he was mused the constable  i hope for your sake you havent been saying to anybody else what you said to me just now  mr grummit shook his head  not a word he faltered  thats all right then said mr evans  i shouldnt like to be hard on a neighbour not that we shall be neighbours much longer  mr grummit feeling that a reply was expected of him gave utterance to a feeble oh  no said mr evans looking round disparagingly  it aint good enough for us now i was promoted to sergeant this morning  a sergeant cant live in a common place like this  mr grummit a prey to a sickening fear drew near the fence again  a a sergeant he stammered  mr evans smiled and gazed carefully at a distant cloud  for my bravery with them burglars the other night grummit he said modestly  i might have waited years if it hadnt been for them  he nodded to the frantic grummit and turned away mr grummit without any adieu at all turned and crept back to the house
