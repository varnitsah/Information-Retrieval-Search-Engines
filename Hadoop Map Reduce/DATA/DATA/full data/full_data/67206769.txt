   kilmeny looked up with a lovely grace         but nae smile was seen on kilmenys face         as still was her look and as still was her ee         as the stillness that lay on the emerant lea

a day in early spring honey pale and honey sweet was showering over the red brick buildings of queenslea college and the grounds about them throwing through the bare budding maples and elms delicate evasive etchings of gold and brown on the paths and coaxing into life the daffodils that were peering greenly and perkily up under the windows of the coeds dressingroom  a young april wind as fresh and sweet as if it had been blowing over the fields of memory instead of through dingy streets was purring in the treetops and whipping the loose tendrils of the ivy network which covered the front of the main building  it was a wind that sang of many things but what it sang to each listener was only what was in that listeners heart  to the college students who had just been capped and diplomad by old charlie the grave president of queenslea in the presence of an admiring throng of parents and sisters sweethearts and friends it sang perchance of glad hope and shining success and high achievement  it sang of the dreams of youth that may never be quite fulfilled but are well worth the dreaming for all that god help the man who has never known such dreamswho as he leaves his alma mater is not already rich in aerial castles the proprietor of many a spacious estate in spain  he has missed his birthright  the crowd streamed out of the entrance hall and scattered over the campus fraying off into the many streets beyond eric marshall and david baker walked away together  the former had graduated in arts that day at the head of his class the latter had come to see the graduation nearly bursting with pride in erics success  between these two was an old and tried and enduring friendship although david was ten years older than eric as the mere tale of years goes and a hundred years older in knowledge of the struggles and difficulties of life which age a man far more quickly and effectually than the passing of time  physically the two men bore no resemblance to one another although they were second cousins  eric marshall tall broadshouldered sinewy walking with a free easy stride which was somehow suggestive of reserve strength and power was one of those men regarding whom lessfavoured mortals are tempted seriously to wonder why all the gifts of fortune should be showered on one individual  he was not only clever and good to look upon but he possessed that indefinable charm of personality which is quite independent of physical beauty or mental ability he had steady grayishblue eyes dark chestnut hair with a glint of gold in its waves when the sunlight struck it and a chin that gave the world assurance of a chin  he was a rich mans son with a clean young manhood behind him and splendid prospects before him  he was considered a practical sort of fellow utterly guiltless of romantic dreams and visions of any sort  i am afraid eric marshall will never do one quixotic thing said a queenslea professor who had a habit of uttering rather mysterious epigrams but if he ever does it will supply the one thing lacking in him  david baker was a short stocky fellow with an ugly irregular charming face his eyes were brown and keen and secretive his mouth had a comical twist which became sarcastic or teasing or winning as he willed  his voice was generally as soft and musical as a womans but some few who had seen david baker righteously angry and heard the tones which then issued from his lips were in no hurry to have the experience repeated  he was a doctora specialist in troubles of the throat and voiceand he was beginning to have a national reputation  he was on the staff of the queenslea medical college and it was whispered that before long he would be called to fill an important vacancy at mcgill  he had won his way to success through difficulties and drawbacks which would have daunted most men  in the year eric was born david baker was an errand boy in the big department store of marshall  company  thirteen years later he graduated with high honors from queenslea medical college  mr marshall had given him all the help which davids sturdy pride could be induced to accept and now he insisted on sending the young man abroad for a postgraduate course in london and germany  david baker had eventually repaid every cent mr marshall had expended on him but he never ceased to cherish a passionate gratitude to the kind and generous man and he loved that mans son with a love surpassing that of brothers  he had followed erics college course with keen watchful interest  it was his wish that eric should take up the study of law or medicine now that he was through arts and he was greatly disappointed that eric should have finally made up his mind to go into business with his father  its a clean waste of your talents he grumbled as they walked home from the college  youd win fame and distinction in law that glib tongue of yours was meant for a lawyer and it is sheer flying in the face of providence to devote it to commercial usesa flat crossing of the purposes of destiny  where is your ambition man  in the right place answered eric with his ready laugh  it is not your kind perhaps but there is room and need for all kinds in this lusty young country of ours  yes i am going into the business  in the first place it has been fathers cherished desire ever since i was born and it would hurt him pretty badly if i backed out now  he wished me to take an arts course because he believed that every man should have as liberal an education as he can afford to get but now that i have had it he wants me in the firm  he wouldnt oppose you if he thought you really wanted to go in for something else  not he but i dont really want tothats the point david man  you hate a business life so much yourself that you cant get it into your blessed noddle that another man might like it there are many lawyers in the worldtoo many perhapsbut there are never too many good honest men of business ready to do clean big things for the betterment of humanity and the upbuilding of their country to plan great enterprises and carry them through with brain and courage to manage and control to aim high and strike ones aim  there im waxing eloquent so id better stop  but ambition man  why im full of itits bubbling in every pore of me  i mean to make the department store of marshall  company famous from ocean to ocean  father started in life as a poor boy from a nova scotian farm  he has built up a business that has a provincial reputation  i mean to carry it on  in five years it shall have a maritime reputation in ten a canadian  i want to make the firm of marshall  company stand for something big in the commercial interests of canada  isnt that as honourable an ambition as trying to make black seem white in a court of law or discovering some new disease with a harrowing name to torment poor creatures who might otherwise die peacefully in blissful ignorance of what ailed them  when you begin to make poor jokes it is time to stop arguing with you said david with a shrug of his fat shoulders  go your own gait and dree your own weird  id as soon expect success in trying to storm the citadel singlehanded as in trying to turn you from any course about which you had once made up your mind  whew this street takes it out of a fellow  what could have possessed our ancestors to run a town up the side of a hill im not so slim and active as i was on my graduation day ten years ago  by the way what a lot of coeds were in your classtwenty if i counted right  when i graduated there were only two ladies in our class and they were the pioneers of their sex at queenslea  they were well past their first youth very grim and angular and serious and they could never have been on speaking terms with a mirror in their best days  but mark you they were excellent femalesoh very excellent  times have changed with a vengeance judging from the lineup of coeds today  there was one girl there who cant be a day over eighteenand she looked as if she were made out of gold and roseleaves and dewdrops  the oracle speaks in poetry laughed eric  that was florence percival who led the class in mathematics as im a living man by many she is considered the beauty of her class  i cant say that such is my opinion  i dont greatly care for that blonde babyish style of lovelinessi prefer agnes campion  did you notice herthe tall dark girl with the ropes of hair and a sort of crimson velvety bloom on her face who took honours in philosophy  i did notice her said david emphatically darting a keen side glance at his friend  i noticed her most particularly and criticallyfor someone whispered her name behind me and coupled it with the exceedingly interesting information that miss campion was supposed to be the future mrs eric marshall  whereupon i stared at her with all my eyes  there is no truth in that report said eric in a tone of annoyance  agnes and i are the best of friends and nothing more  i like and admire her more than any woman i know but if the future mrs eric marshall exists in the flesh i havent met her yet  i havent even started out to look for herand dont intend to for some years to come  i have something else to think of he concluded in a tone of contempt for which anyone might have known he would be punished sometime if cupid were not deaf as well as blind  youll meet the lady of the future some day said david dryly and in spite of your scorn i venture to predict that if fate doesnt bring her before long youll very soon start out to look for her  a word of advice oh son of your mother  when you go courting take your common sense with you  do you think i shall be likely to leave it behind asked eric amusedly  well i mistrust you said david sagely wagging his head the lowland scotch part of you is all right but theres a celtic streak in you from that little highland grandmother of yours and when a man has that theres never any knowing where it will break out or what dance it will lead him especially when it comes to this lovemaking business  you are just as likely as not to lose your head over some little fool or shrew for the sake of her outward favour and make yourself miserable for life  when you pick you a wife please remember that i shall reserve the right to pass a candid opinion on her  pass all the opinions you like but it is my opinion and mine only which will matter in the long run retorted eric  confound you yes you stubborn offshoot of a stubborn breed growled david looking at him affectionately  i know that and that is why ill never feel at ease about you until i see you married to the right sort of a girl  shes not hard to find nine out of ten girls in this country of ours are fit for kings palaces  but the tenth always has to be reckoned with  you are as bad as clever alice in the fairy tale who worried over the future of her unborn children protested eric  clever alice has been very unjustly laughed at said david gravely  we doctors know that  perhaps she overdid the worrying business a little but she was perfectly right in principle  if people worried a little more about their unborn childrenat least to the extent of providing a proper heritage physically mentally and morally for themand then stopped worrying about them after they are born this world would be a very much pleasanter place to live in and the human race would make more progress in a generation than it has done in recorded history  oh if you are going to mount your dearly beloved hobby of heredity i am not going to argue with you david man  but as for the matter of urging me to hasten and marry me a wife why dont youit was on erics lips to say why dont you get married to a girl of the right sort yourself and set me a good example  but he checked himself  he knew that there was an old sorrow in david bakers life which was not to be unduly jarred by the jests even of privileged friendship  he changed his question to why dont you leave this on the knees of the gods where it properly belongs  i thought you were a firm believer in predestination david  well so i am to a certain extent said david cautiously  i believe as an excellent old aunt of mine used to say that what is to be will be and what isnt to be happens sometimes  and it is precisely such unchancy happenings that make the scheme of things go wrong  i dare say you think me an old fogy eric but i know something more of the world than you do and i believe with tennysons arthur that theres no more subtle master under heaven than is the maiden passion for a maid  i want to see you safely anchored to the love of some good woman as soon as may be thats all  im rather sorry miss campion isnt your lady of the future  i liked her looks that i did  she is good and strong and trueand has the eyes of a woman who could love in a way that would be worth while  moreover shes wellborn wellbred and welleducatedthree very indispensable things when it comes to choosing a woman to fill your mothers place friend of mine  i agree with you said eric carelessly i could not marry any woman who did not fulfill those conditions  but as i have said i am not in love with agnes campionand it wouldnt be of any use if i were  she is as good as engaged to larry west  you remember west  that thin leggy fellow you chummed with so much your first two years in queenslea  yes what has become of him  he had to drop out after his second year for financial reasons he is working his own way through college you know  for the past two years he has been teaching school in some outoftheway place over in prince edward island  he isnt any too well poor fellownever was very strong and has studied remorselessly  i havent heard from him since february  he said then that he was afraid he wasnt going to be able to stick it out till the end of the school year  i hope larry wont break down  he is a fine fellow and worthy even of agnes campion  well here we are coming in david  not this afternoonhavent got time  i must mosey up to the north end to see a man who has got a lovely throat  nobody can find out what is the matter  he has puzzled all the doctors  he has puzzled me but ill find out what is wrong with him if hell only live long enough    chapter ii a letter of destiny  eric finding that his father had not yet returned from the college went into the library and sat down to read a letter he had picked up from the hall table  it was from larry west and after the first few lines erics face lost the absent look it had worn and assumed an expression of interest  i am writing to ask a favour of you marshall wrote west the fact is ive fallen into the hands of the philistinesthat is to say the doctors  ive not been feeling very fit all winter but ive held on hoping to finish out the year  last week my landladywho is a saint in spectacles and calicolooked at me one morning at the breakfast table and said very gently you must go to town tomorrow master and see a doctor about yourself  i went and did not stand upon the order of my going  mrs williamson is shewhomustbeobeyed  she has an inconvenient habit of making you realize that she is exactly right and that you would be all kinds of a fool if you didnt take her advice you feel that what she thinks today you will think tomorrow  in charlottetown i consulted a doctor  he punched and pounded me and poked things at me and listened at the other end of them and finally he said i must stop work immejutly and to onct and hie me straightway to a climate not afflicted with the northeast winds of prince edward island in the spring  i am not to be allowed to do any work until the fall  such was his dictum and mrs williamson enforces it  i shall teach this week out and then the spring vacation of three weeks begins  i want you to come over and take my place as pedagogue in the lindsay school for the last week in may and the month of june  the school year ends then and there will be plenty of teachers looking for the place but just now i cannot get a suitable substitute  i have a couple of pupils who are preparing to try the queens academy entrance examinations and i dont like to leave them in the lurch or hand them over to the tender mercies of some thirdclass teacher who knows little latin and less greek   come over and take the school till the end of the term you petted son of luxury  it will do you a world of good to learn how rich a man feels when he is earning twentyfive dollars a month by his own unaided efforts  seriously marshall i hope you can come for i dont know any other fellow i can ask  the work isnt hard though youll likely find it monotonous  of course this little northshore farming settlement isnt a very lively place  the rising and setting of the sun are the most exciting events of the average day  but the people are very kind and hospitable and prince edward island in the month of june is such a thing as you dont often see except in happy dreams  there are some trout in the pond and youll always find an old salt at the harbour ready and willing to take you out codfishing or lobstering  ill bequeath you my boarding house  youll find it comfortable and not further from the school than a good constitutional  mrs williamson is the dearest soul alive and she is one of those oldfashioned cooks who feed you on feasts of fat things and whose price is above rubies  her husband robert or bob as he is commonly called despite his sixty years is quite a character in his way  he is an amusing old gossip with a turn for racy comment and a finger in everybodys pie  he knows everything about everybody in lindsay for three generations back  they have no living children but old bob has a black cat which is his especial pride and darling  the name of this animal is timothy and as such he must always be called and referred to never as you value roberts good opinion let him hear you speaking of his pet as the cat or even as tim  you will never be forgiven and he will not consider you a fit person to have charge of the school  you shall have my room a little place over the kitchen with a ceiling that follows the slant of the roof down one side against which you will bump your head times innumerable until you learn to remember that it is there and a looking glass which will make one of your eyes as small as a pea and the other as big as an orange  but to compensate for these disadvantages the supply of towels is generous and unexceptionable and there is a window whence you will daily behold an occidental view over lindsay harbour and the gulf beyond which is an unspeakable miracle of beauty  the sun is setting over it as i write and i see such a sea of glass mingled with fire as might have figured in the visions of the patmian seer  a vessel is sailing away into the gold and crimson and pearl of the horizon the big revolving light on the tip of the headland beyond the harbour has just been lighted and is winking and flashing like a beacon                             oer the foam            of perilous seas in faerie lands forlorn  wire me if you can come and if you can report for duty on the twentythird of may  mr marshall senior came in just as eric was thoughtfully folding up his letter  the former looked more like a benevolent old clergyman or philanthropist than the keen shrewd somewhat hard although just and honest man of business that he really was  he had a round rosy face fringed with white whiskers a fine head of long white hair and a pursedup mouth  only in his blue eyes was a twinkle that would have made any man who designed getting the better of him in a bargain think twice before he made the attempt  it was easily seen that eric must have inherited his personal beauty and distinction of form from his mother whose picture hung on the dark wall between the windows  she had died while still young when eric was a boy of ten  during her lifetime she had been the object of the passionate devotion of both her husband and son and the fine strong sweet face of the picture was a testimony that she had been worthy of their love and reverence  the same face cast in a masculine mold was repeated in eric the chestnut hair grew off his forehead in the same way his eyes were like hers and in his grave moods they held a similar expression half brooding half tender in their depths  mr marshall was very proud of his sons success in college but he had no intention of letting him see it  he loved this boy of his with the dead mothers eyes better than anything on earth and all his hopes and ambitions were bound up in him  well that fuss is over thank goodness he said testily as he dropped into his favourite chair  didnt you find the programme interesting asked eric absently  most of it was tommyrot said his father  the only things i liked were charlies latin prayer and those pretty little girls trotting up to get their diplomas  latin is the language for praying in i do believeat least when a man has a voice like old charlies  there was such a sonorous roll to the words that the mere sound of them made me feel like getting down on my marrow bones  and then those girls were as pretty as pinks now werent they  agnes was the finestlooking of the lot in my opinion  i hope its true that youre courting her eric  confound it father said eric half irritably half laughingly have you and david baker entered into a conspiracy to hound me into matrimony whether i will or no  ive never said a word to david baker on such a subject protested mr marshall  well you are just as bad as he is  he hectored me all the way home from the college on the subject  but why are you in such a hurry to have me married dad  because i want a homemaker in this house as soon as may be there has never been one since your mother died  i am tired of housekeepers  and i want to see your children at my knees before i die eric and im an old man now  well your wish is natural father said eric gently with a glance at his mothers picture  but i cant rush out and marry somebody offhand can i  and i fear it wouldnt exactly do to advertise for a wife even in these days of commercial enterprise  isnt there anybody youre fond of queried mr marshall with the patient air of a man who overlooks the frivolous jests of youth  no i never yet saw the woman who could make my heart beat any faster  i dont know what you young men are made of nowadays growled his father  i was in love half a dozen times before i was your age  you might have been in love  but you never loved any woman until you met my mother  i know that father  and it didnt happen till you were pretty well on in life either  youre too hard to please  thats whats the matter thats whats the matter  perhaps i am  when a man has had a mother like mine his standard of womanly sweetness is apt to be pitched pretty high lets drop the subject father  here i want you to read this letterits from larry  humph grunted mr marshall when he had finished with it  so larrys knocked out at lastalways thought he would bealways expected it  sorry too  he was a decent fellow  well are you going  yes i think so if you dont object  youll have a pretty monotonous time of it judging from his account of lindsay  probably  but i am not going over in search of excitement  im going to oblige larry and have a look at the island  well its worth looking at some parts of the year conceded mr marshall  when im on prince edward island in the summer i always understand an old scotch islander i met once in winnipeg he was always talking of the island  somebody once asked him what island do you mean  he simply looked at that ignorant man  then he said why prince edward island mon  what other island is there  go if youd like to  you need a rest after the grind of examinations before settling down to business  and mind you dont get into any mischief young sir  not much likelihood of that in a place like lindsay i fancy laughed eric  probably the devil finds as much mischief for idle hands in lindsay as anywhere else  the worst tragedy i ever heard of happened on a backwoods farm fifteen miles from a railroad and five from a store  however i expect your mothers son to behave himself in the fear of god and man  in all likelihood the worst thing that will happen to you over there will be that some misguided woman will put you to sleep in a spare room bed  and if that does happen may the lord have mercy on your soul    chapter iii the master of lindsay school  one evening a month later eric marshall came out of the old whitewashed schoolhouse at lindsay and locked the doorwhich was carved over with initials innumerable and built of double plank in order that it might withstand all the assaults and batteries to which it might be subjected  erics pupils had gone home an hour before but he had stayed to solve some algebra problems and correct some latin exercises for his advanced students  the sun was slanting in warm yellow lines through the thick grove of maples to the west of the building and the dim green air beneath them burst into golden bloom  a couple of sheep were nibbling the lush grass in a far corner of the playground a cowbell somewhere in the maple woods tinkled faintly and musically on the still crystal air which in spite of its blandness still retained a touch of the wholesome austerity and poignancy of a canadian spring  the whole world seemed to have fallen for the time being into a pleasant untroubled dream  the scene was very peaceful and pastoralalmost too much so the young man thought with a shrug of his shoulders as he stood in the worn steps and gazed about him  how was he going to put in a whole month here he wondered with a little smile at his own expense  father would chuckle if he knew i was sick of it already he thought as he walked across the playground to the long red road that ran past the school  well one week is ended at any rate ive earned my own living for five whole days and that is something i could never say before in all my twentyfour years of existence  it is an exhilarating thought  but teaching the lindsay district school is distinctly not exhilaratingat least in such a wellbehaved school as this where the pupils are so painfully good that i havent even the traditional excitement of thrashing obstreperous bad boys  everything seems to go by clock work in lindsay educational institution  larry must certainly have possessed a marked gift for organizing and drilling  i feel as if i were merely a big cog in an orderly machine that ran itself  however i understand that there are some pupils who havent shown up yet and who according to all reports have not yet had the old adam totally drilled out of them  they may make things more interesting  also a few more compositions such as john reids would furnish some spice to professional life  erics laughter wakened the echoes as he swung into the road down the long sloping hill  he had given his fourth grade pupils their own choice of subjects in the composition class that morning and john reid a sober matteroffact little urchin with not the slightest embryonic development of a sense of humour had acting upon the whispered suggestion of a roguish deskmate elected to write upon courting  his opening sentence made erics face twitch mutinously whenever he recalled it during the day  courting is a very pleasant thing which a great many people go too far with  the distant hills and wooded uplands were tremulous and aerial in delicate springtime gauzes of pearl and purple  the young greenleafed maples crowded thickly to the very edge of the road on either side but beyond them were emerald fields basking in sunshine over which cloud shadows rolled broadened and vanished  far below the fields a calm ocean slept bluely and sighed in its sleep with the murmur that rings for ever in the ear of those whose good fortune it is to have been born within the sound of it  now and then eric met some callow checkshirted barelegged lad on horseback or a shrewdfaced farmer in a cart who nodded and called out cheerily howdy master  a young girl with a rosy oval face dimpled cheeks and pretty dark eyes filled with shy coquetry passed him looking as if she would not be at all averse to a better acquaintance with the new teacher  half way down the hill eric met a shambling old gray horse drawing an express wagon which had seen better days  the driver was a woman she appeared to be one of those drabtinted individuals who can never have felt a rosy emotion in all their lives  she stopped her horse and beckoned eric over to her with the knobby handle of a faded and bony umbrella  reckon youre the new master aint you she asked  eric admitted that he was  well im glad to see you she said offering him a hand in a much darned cotton glove that had once been black  i was right sorry to see mr west go for he was a right good teacher and as harmless inoffensive a creetur as ever lived but i always told him every time i laid eyes on him that he was in consumption if ever a man was  you look real healthythough you cant aways tell by looks either  i had a brother complected like you but he was killed in a railroad accident out west when he was real young  ive got a boy ill be sending to school to you next week  hed oughter gone this week but i had to keep him home to help me put the pertaters in for his father wont work and doesnt work and cant be made to work  sandyhis full name is edward alexandercalled after both his grandfathershates the idee of going to school worse n pisen always did  but go he shall for im determined hes got to have more larning hammered into his head yet  i reckon youll have trouble with him master for hes as stupid as an owl and as stubborn as solomons mule  but mind this master ill back you up  you just lick sandy good and plenty when he needs it and send me a scrape of the pen home with him and ill give him another dose  theres people that always sides in with their young ones when theres any rumpus kicked up in the school but i dont hold to that and never did  you can depend on rebecca reid every time master  thank you  i am sure i can said eric in his most winning tones  he kept his face straight until it was safe to relax and mrs reid drove on with a soft feeling in her leathery old heart which had been so toughened by long endurance of poverty and toil and a husband who wouldnt work and couldnt be made to work that it was no longer a very susceptible organ where members of the opposite sex were concerned  mrs reid reflected that this young man had a way with him  eric already knew most of the lindsay folks by sight but at the foot of the hill he met two people a man and a boy whom he did not know  they were sitting in a shabby oldfashioned wagon and were watering their horse at the brook which gurgled limpidly under the little plank bridge in the hollow  eric surveyed them with some curiosity  they did not look in the least like the ordinary run of lindsay people  the boy in particular had a distinctly foreign appearance in spite of the gingham shirt and homespun trousers which seemed to be the regulation workaday outfit for the lindsay farmer lads  he had a lithe supple body with sloping shoulders and a lean satiny brown throat above his open shirt collar  his head was covered with thick silky black curls and the hand that hung down by the side of the wagon was unusually long and slender his face was richly though somewhat heavily featured olive tinted save for the cheeks which had a dusky crimson bloom his mouth was as red and beguiling as a girls and his eyes were large bold and black  all in all he was a strikingly handsome fellow but the expression of his face was sullen and he somehow gave eric the impression of a sinuous feline creature basking in lazy grace but ever ready for an unexpected spring  the other occupant of the wagon was a man between sixtyfive and seventy with irongray hair a long full gray beard a harshfeatured face and deepset hazel eyes under bushy bristling brows  he was evidently tall with a spare ungainly figure and stooping shoulders  his mouth was closelipped and relentless and did not look as if it had ever smiled  indeed the idea of smiling could not be connected with this manit was utterly incongruous  yet there was nothing repellent about his face and there was something in it that compelled erics attention  he rather prided himself on being a student of physiognomy and he felt quite sure that this man was no ordinary lindsay farmer of the genial garrulous type with which he was familiar  long after the old wagon with its oddly assorted pair had gone lumbering up the hill eric found himself thinking of the stern heavy browed man and the blackeyed redlipped boy    chapter iv a tea table conversation  the williamson place where eric boarded was on the crest of the succeeding hill  he liked it as well as larry west had prophesied that he would  the williamsons as well as the rest of the lindsay people took it for granted that he was a poor college student working his way through as larry west had been doing  eric did not disturb this belief although he said nothing to contribute to it  the williamsons were at tea in the kitchen when eric went in mrs williamson was the saint in spectacles and calico which larry west had termed her  eric liked her greatly  she was a slight grayhaired woman with a thin sweet highbred face deeply lined with the records of outlived pain  she talked little as a rule but in the pungent country phrase she never spoke but she said something  the one thing that constantly puzzled eric was how such a woman ever came to marry robert williamson  she smiled in a motherly fashion at eric as he hung his hat on the whitewashed wall and took his place at the table  outside of the window behind him was a birch grove which in the westering sun was a tremulous splendour with a sea of undergrowth wavered into golden billows by every passing wind  old robert williamson sat opposite him on a bench  he was a small lean old man half lost in loose clothes that seemed far too large for him  when he spoke his voice was as thin and squeaky as he appeared to be himself  the other end of the bench was occupied by timothy sleek and complacent with a snowy breast and white paws  after old robert had taken a mouthful of anything he gave a piece to timothy who ate it daintily and purred resonant gratitude  you see were busy waiting for you master said old robert youre late this evening  keep any of the youngsters in thats a foolish way of punishing them as hard on yourself as on them  one teacher we had four years ago used to lock them in and go home  then hed go back in an hour and let them outif they were there  they werent always  tom ferguson kicked the panels out of the old door once and got out that way  we put a new door of double plank in that they couldnt kick out  i stayed in the schoolroom to do some work said eric briefly  well youve missed alexander tracy  he was here to find out if you could play checkers and when i told him you could he left word for you to go up and have a game some evening soon  dont beat him too often even if you can  youll need to stand in with him i tell you master for hes got a son that may brew trouble for you when he starts in to go to school  seth tracys a young imp and hed far sooner be in mischief than eat  he tries to run on every new teacher and hes run two clean out of the school  but he met his match in mr west  william tracys boys nowyou wont have a scrap of bother with them  theyre always good because their mother tells them every sunday that theyll go straight to hell if they dont behave in school  its effective  take some preserve master  you know we dont help things here the way mrs adam scott does when she has boarders i spose you dont want any of thisnor younor you  mother aleck says old george wright is having the time of his life  his wife has gone to charlottetown to visit her sister and he is his own boss for the first time since he was married forty years ago  hes on a regular orgy aleck says  he smokes in the parlour and sits up till eleven oclock reading dime novels  perhaps i met mr tracy said eric  is he a tall man with gray hair and a dark stern face  no hes a round jolly fellow is aleck and he stopped growing pretty much before hed ever begun  i reckon the man you mean is thomas gordon  i seen him driving down the road too  he wont be troubling you with invitations up small fear of it  the gordons aint sociable to say the least of it  no sir mother pass the biscuits to the master  who was the young fellow he had with him asked eric curiously  neilneil gordon  that is a scotchy name for such a face and eyes  i should rather have expected guiseppe or angelo  the boy looks like an italian  well now you know master i reckon its likely he does seeing that thats exactly what he is  youve hit the nail square on the head italyun yes sir  rather too much so im thinking for decent folks taste  how has it happened that an italian boy with a scotch name is living in a place like lindsay  well master it was this way  about twentytwo years agowas it twentytwo mother or twentyfour  yes it was twentytwo twas the same year our jim was born and hed have been twentytwo if hed lived poor little fellow  well master twentytwo years ago a couple of italian pack peddlers came along and called at the gordon place  the country was swarming with them then  i useter set the dog on one every day on an average  well these peddlers were man and wife and the woman took sick up there at the gordon place and janet gordon took her in and nursed her  a baby was born the next day and the woman died then the first thing anybody knew the father skipped clean out pack and all and was never seen or heard tell of afterwards the gordons were left with the fine youngster to their hands folks advised them to send him to the orphan asylum and twould have been the wisest plan but the gordons were never fond of taking advice  old james gordon was living then thomas and janets father and he said he would never turn a child out of his door  he was a masterful old man and liked to be boss folks used to say he had a grudge against the sun cause it rose and set without his say so  anyhow they kept the baby  they called him neil and had him baptized same as any christian child hes always lived there  they did well enough by him  he was sent to school and taken to church and treated like one of themselves  some folks think they made too much of him  it doesnt always do with that kind for whats bred in bone is mighty apt to come out in flesh if taint kept down pretty well  neils smart and a great worker they tell me  but folks hereabouts dont like him  they say he aint to be trusted furthern you can see him if as far  its certain hes awful hot tempered and one time when he was going to school he near about killed a boy hed took a spite tochoked him till he was black in the face and neil had to be dragged off  well now father you know they teased him terrible protested mrs williamson  the poor boy had a real hard time when he went to school master  the other children were always casting things up to him and calling him names  oh i daresay they tormented him a lot admitted her husband hes a great hand at the fiddle and likes company  he goes to the harbour a good deal  but they say he takes sulky spells when he hasnt a word to throw to a dog  twouldnt be any wonder living with the gordons  theyre all as queer as dicks hatband  father you shouldnt talk so about your neighbours said his wife rebukingly  well now mother you know they are if youd only speak up honest  but youre like old aunt nancy scott you never say anything uncharitable except in the way of business  you know the gordons aint like other people and never were and never will be  theyre about the only queer folks we have in lindsay master except old peter cook who keeps twentyfive cats  lord master think of it  what chanct would a poor mouse have  none of the rest of us are queer leastwise we haint found it out if we are  but then were mighty uninteresting im bound to admit that  where do the gordons live asked eric who had grown used to holding fast to a given point of inquiry through all the bewildering mazes of old roberts conversation  away up yander half a mile in from radnor road with a thick spruce wood atween them and all the rest of the world  they never go away anywheres except to churchthey never miss thatand nobody goes there  theres just old thomas and his sister janet and a niece of theirs and this here neil weve been talking about  theyre a queer dour cranky lot and i will say it mother  there give your old man a cup of tea and never mind the way his tongue runs on  speaking of tea do you know mrs adam palmer and mrs jim martin took tea together at foster reids last wednesday afternoon  no why i thought they were on bad terms said mrs williamson betraying a little feminine curiosity  so they are so they are  but they both happened to visit mrs foster the same afternoon and neither would leave because that would be knuckling down to the other  so they stuck it out on opposite sides of the parlour  mrs foster says she never spent such an uncomfortable afternoon in all her life before  she would talk a spell to one and then tother  and they kept talking to mrs foster and at each other  mrs foster says she really thought shed have to keep them all night for neither would start to go home afore the other  finally jim martin came in to look for his wife cause he thought she must have got stuck in the marsh and that solved the problem  master you aint eating anything  dont mind my stopping i was at it half an hour afore you come and anyway im in a hurry  my hired boy went home today  he heard the rooster crow at twelve last night and hes gone home to see which of his family is dead  he knows one of em is  he heard a rooster crow in the middle of the night onct afore and the next day he got word that his second cousin down at souris was dead  mother if the master dont want any more tea aint there some cream for timothy    chapter v a phantom of delight  shortly before sunset that evening eric went for a walk  when he did not go to the shore he liked to indulge in long tramps through the lindsay fields and woods in the mellowness of the sweet o the year  most of the lindsay houses were built along the main road which ran parallel to the shore or about the stores at the corner  the farms ran back from them into solitudes of woods and pasture lands  eric struck southwest from the williamson homestead in a direction he had not hitherto explored and walked briskly along enjoying the witchery of the season all about him in earth and air and sky  he felt it and loved it and yielded to it as anyone of clean life and sane pulses must do  the spruce wood in which he presently found himself was smitten through with arrows of ruby light from the setting sun  he went through it walking up a long purple aisle where the woodfloor was brown and elastic under his feet and came out beyond it on a scene which surprised him  no house was in sight but he found himself looking into an orchard an old orchard evidently long neglected and forsaken but an orchard dies hard and this one which must have been a very delightful spot once was delightful still none the less so for the air of gentle melancholy which seemed to pervade it the melancholy which invests all places that have once been the scenes of joy and pleasure and young life and are so no longer places where hearts have throbbed and pulses thrilled and eyes brightened and merry voices echoed  the ghosts of these things seem to linger in their old haunts through many empty years  the orchard was large and long enclosed in a tumbledown old fence of longers bleached to a silvery gray in the suns of many lost summers  at regular intervals along the fence were tall gnarled fir trees and an evening wind sweeter than that which blew over the beds of spice from lebanon was singing in their tops an earthold song with power to carry the soul back to the dawn of time  eastward a thick fir wood grew beginning with tiny treelets just feathering from the grass and grading up therefrom to the tall veterans of the midgrove unbrokenly and evenly giving the effect of a solid sloping green wall so beautifully compact that it looked as if it had been clipped into its velvet surface by art  most of the orchard was grown over lushly with grass but at the end where eric stood there was a square treeless place which had evidently once served as a homestead garden  old paths were still visible bordered by stones and large pebbles  there were two clumps of lilac trees one blossoming in royal purple the other in white  between them was a bed ablow with the starry spikes of june lilies  their penetrating haunting fragrance distilled on the dewy air in every soft puff of wind  along the fence rosebushes grew but it was as yet too early in the season for roses  beyond was the orchard proper three long rows of trees with green avenues between each tree standing in a wonderful blow of pink and white  the charm of the place took sudden possession of eric as nothing had ever done before  he was not given to romantic fancies but the orchard laid hold of him subtly and drew him to itself and he was never to be quite his own man again  he went into it over one of the broken panels of fence and so unknowing went forward to meet all that life held for him  he walked the length of the orchards middle avenue between long sinuous boughs picked out with delicate rosehearted bloom when he reached its southern boundary he flung himself down in a grassy corner of the fence where another lilac bush grew with ferns and wild blue violets at its roots  from where he now was he got a glimpse of a house about a quarter of a mile away its gray gable peering out from a dark spruce wood  it seemed a dull gloomy remote place and he did not know who lived there  he had a wide outlook to the west over far hazy fields and misty blue intervales  the sun had just set and the whole world of green meadows beyond swam in golden light  across a long valley brimmed with shadow were uplands of sunset and great sky lakes of saffron and rose where a soul might lose itself in colour the air was very fragrant with the baptism of the dew and the odours of a bed of wild mint upon which he had trampled  robins were whistling clear and sweet and sudden in the woods all about him  this is a veritable haunt of ancient peace quoted eric looking around with delighted eyes  i could fall asleep here dream dreams and see visions  what a sky  could anything be diviner than that fine crystal eastern blue and those frail white clouds that look like woven lace  what a dizzying intoxicating fragrance lilacs have  i wonder if perfume could set a man drunk  those apple trees nowwhy what is that  eric started up and listened  across the mellow stillness mingled with the croon of the wind in the trees and the flutelike calls of the robins came a strain of delicious music so beautiful and fantastic that eric held his breath in astonishment and delight  was he dreaming  no it was real music the music of a violin played by some hand inspired with the very spirit of harmony  he had never heard anything like it and somehow he felt quite sure that nothing exactly like it ever had been heard before he believed that that wonderful music was coming straight from the soul of the unseen violinist and translating itself into those most airy and delicate and exquisite sounds for the first time the very soul of music with all sense and earthliness refined away  it was an elusive haunting melody strangely suited to the time and place it had in it the sigh of the wind in the woods the eerie whispering of the grasses at dewfall the white thoughts of the june lilies the rejoicing of the apple blossoms all the soul of all the old laughter and song and tears and gladness and sobs the orchard had ever known in the lost years and besides all this there was in it a pitiful plaintive cry as of some imprisoned thing calling for freedom and utterance  at first eric listened as a man spellbound mutely and motionlessly lost in wonderment  then a very natural curiosity overcame him  who in lindsay could play a violin like that  and who was playing so here in this deserted old orchard of all places in the world  he rose and walked up the long white avenue going as slowly and silently as possible for he did not wish to interrupt the player  when he reached the open space of the garden he stopped short in new amazement and was again tempted into thinking he must certainly be dreaming  under the big branching white lilac tree was an old sagging wooden bench and on this bench a girl was sitting playing on an old brown violin  her eyes were on the faraway horizon and she did not see eric  for a few moments he stood there and looked at her  the pictures she made photographed itself on his vision to the finest detail never to be blotted from his book of remembrance  to his latest day eric marshall will be able to recall vividly that scene as he saw it thenthe velvet darkness of the spruce woods the overarching sky of soft brilliance the swaying lilac blossoms and amid it all the girl on the old bench with the violin under her chin  he had in his twentyfour years of life met hundreds of pretty women scores of handsome women a scant half dozen of really beautiful women  but he knew at once beyond all possibility of question or doubt that he had never seen or imagined anything so exquisite as this girl of the orchard  her loveliness was so perfect that his breath almost went from him in his first delight of it  her face was oval marked in every cameolike line and feature with that expression of absolute flawless purity found in the angels and madonnas of old paintings a purity that held in it no faintest strain of earthliness  her head was bare and her thick jetblack hair was parted above her forehead and hung in two heavy lustrous braids over her shoulders  her eyes were of such a blue as eric had never seen in eyes before the tint of the sea in the still calm light that follows after a fine sunset they were as luminous as the stars that came out over lindsay harbour in the afterglow and were fringed about with very long sootblack lashes and arched over by most delicately pencilled dark eyebrows  her skin was as fine and purely tinted as the heart of a white rose  the collarless dress of pale blue print she wore revealed her smooth slender throat her sleeves were rolled up above her elbows and the hand which guided the bow of her violin was perhaps the most beautiful thing about her perfect in shape and texture firm and white with rosynailed taper fingers  one long drooping plume of lilac blossom lightly touched her hair and cast a wavering shadow over the flowerlike face beneath it  there was something very childlike about her and yet at least eighteen sweet years must have gone to the making of her  she seemed to be playing half unconsciously as if her thoughts were far away in some fair dreamland of the skies  but presently she looked away from the bourne of sunset and her lovely eyes fell on eric standing motionless before her in the shadow of the apple tree  the sudden change that swept over her was startling  she sprang to her feet the music breaking in midstrain and the bow slipping from her hand to the grass  every hint of colour fled from her face and she trembled like one of the windstirred june lilies  i beg your pardon said eric hastily  i am sorry that i have alarmed you  but your music was so beautiful that i did not remember you were not aware of my presence here  please forgive me  he stopped in dismay for he suddenly realized that the expression on the girls face was one of terrornot merely the startled alarm of a shy childlike creature who had thought herself alone but absolute terror  it was betrayed in her blanched and quivering lips and in the widely distended blue eyes that stared back into his with the expression of some trapped wild thing  it hurt him that any woman should look at him in such a fashion at him who had always held womanhood in such reverence  dont look so frightened he said gently thinking only of calming her fear and speaking as he would to a child  i will not hurt you you are safe quite safe  in his eagerness to reassure her he took an unconscious step forward  instantly she turned and without a sound fled across the orchard through a gap in the northern fence and along what seemed to be a lane bordering the fir wood beyond and arched over with wild cherry trees misty white in the gathering gloom before eric could recover his wits she had vanished from his sight among the firs  he stooped and picked up the violin bow feeling slightly foolish and very much annoyed  well this is a most mysterious thing he said somewhat impatiently  am i bewitched  who was she  what was she  can it be possible that she is a lindsay girl  and why in the name of all thats provoking should she be so frightened at the mere sight of me  i have never thought i was a particularly hideous person but certainly this adventure has not increased my vanity to any perceptible extent  perhaps i have wandered into an enchanted orchard and been outwardly transformed into an ogre now that i have come to think of it there is something quite uncanny about the place  anything might happen here  it is no common orchard for the production of marketable apples that is plain to be seen  no its a most unwholesome locality and the sooner i make my escape from it the better  he glanced about it with a whimsical smile  the light was fading rapidly and the orchard was full of soft creeping shadows and silences  it seemed to wink sleepy eyes of impish enjoyment at his perplexity he laid the violin bow down on the old bench  well there is no use in my following her and i have no right to do so even if it were of use  but i certainly wish she hadnt fled in such evident terror  eyes like hers were never meant to express anything but tenderness and trust  whywhywhy was she so frightened  and whowhowhocan she be  all the way home over fields and pastures that were beginning to be moonlight silvered he pondered the mystery  let me see he reflected  mr williamson was describing the lindsay girls for my benefit the other evening  if i remember rightly he said that there were four handsome ones in the district  what were their names  florrie woods melissa fosterno melissa palmeremma scott and jennie may ferguson can she be one of them  no it is a flagrant waste of time and gray matter supposing it  that girl couldnt be a florrie or a melissa or an emma while jennie may is completely out of the question  well there is some bewitchment in the affair  of that im convinced  so id better forget all about it  but eric found that it was impossible to forget all about it the more he tried to forget the more keenly and insistently he remembered  the girls exquisite face haunted him and the mystery of her tantalized him  true he knew that in all likelihood he might easily solve the problem by asking the williamsons about her  but somehow to his own surprise he found that he shrank from doing this  he felt that it was impossible to ask robert williamson and probably have the girls name overflowed in a stream of petty gossip concerning her and all her antecedents and collaterals to the third and fourth generation  if he had to ask any one it should be mrs williamson but he meant to find out the secret for himself if it were at all possible  he had planned to go to the harbour the next evening  one of the lobstermen had promised to take him out codfishing  but instead he wandered southwest over the fields again  he found the orchard easilyhe had half expected not to find it it was still the same fragrant grassy windhaunted spot  but it had no occupant and the violin bow was gone from the old bench  perhaps she tiptoed back here for it by the light o the moon thought eric pleasing his fancy by the vision of a lithe girlish figure stealing with a beating heart through mingled shadow and moonshine  i wonder if she will possibly come this evening or if i have frightened her away for ever  ill hide me behind this spruce copse and wait  eric waited until dark but no music sounded through the orchard and no one came to it  the keenness of his disappointment surprised him nay more it vexed him  what nonsense to be so worked up because a little girl he had seen for five minutes failed to appear  where was his common sense his gumption as old robert williamson would have said  naturally a man liked to look at a pretty face  but was that any reason why he should feel as if life were flat stale and unprofitable simply because he could not look at it  he called himself a fool and went home in a petulant mood  arriving there he plunged fiercely into solving algebraical equations and working out geometry exercises determined to put out of his head forthwith all vain imaginings of an enchanted orchard white in the moonshine with lilts of elfin music echoing down its long arcades  the next day was sunday and eric went to church twice  the williamson pew was one of the side ones at the top of the church and its occupants practically faced the congregation  eric looked at every girl and woman in the audience but he saw nothing of the face which setting will power and common sense flatly at defiance haunted his memory like a star  thomas gordon was there sitting alone in his long empty pew near the top of the building and neil gordon sang in the choir which occupied the front pew of the gallery  he had a powerful and melodious though untrained voice which dominated the singing and took the colour out of the weaker more commonplace tones of the other singers  he was welldressed in a suit of dark blue serge with a white collar and tie  but eric idly thought it did not become him so well as the working clothes in which he had first seen him  he was too obviously dressed up and he looked coarser and more out of harmony with his surroundings  for two days eric refused to let himself think of the orchard monday evening he went codfishing and tuesday evening he went up to play checkers with alexander tracy  alexander won all the games so easily that he never had any respect for eric marshall again  played like a feller whose thoughts were wool gathering he complained to his wife  hell never make a checker player never in this world    chapter vi the story of kilmeny  wednesday evening eric went to the orchard again and again he was disappointed  he went home determined to solve the mystery by open inquiry  fortune favoured him for he found mrs williamson alone sitting by the west window of her kitchen and knitting at a long gray sock  she hummed softly to herself as she knitted and timothy slept blackly at her feet  she looked at eric with quiet affection in her large candid eyes  she had liked mr west  but eric had found his way into the inner chamber of her heart by reason that his eyes were so like those of the little son she had buried in the lindsay churchyard many years before  mrs williamson said eric with an affectation of carelessness i chanced on an old deserted orchard back behind the woods over there last week a charming bit of wilderness  do you know whose it is  i suppose it must be the old connors orchard answered mrs williamson after a moments reflection  i had forgotten all about it  it must be all of thirty years since mr and mrs connors moved away  their house and barns were burned down and they sold the land to thomas gordon and went to live in town theyre both dead now  mr connors used to be very proud of his orchard  there werent many orchards in lindsay then though almost everybody has one now  there was a young girl in it playing on a violin said eric annoyed to find that it cost him an effort to speak of her and that the blood mounted to his face as he did so  she ran away in great alarm as soon as she saw me although i do not think i did or said anything to frighten or vex her  i have no idea who she was  do you know  mrs williamson did not make an immediate reply  she laid down her knitting and gazed out of the window as if pondering seriously some question in her own mind  finally she said with an intonation of keen interest in her voice  i suppose it must have been kilmeny gordon master  kilmeny gordon  do you mean the niece of thomas gordon of whom your husband spoke  yes  i can hardly believe that the girl i saw can be a member of thomas gordons family  well if it wasnt kilmeny gordon i dont know who it could have been  there is no other house near that orchard and ive heard she plays the violin  if it was kilmeny youve seen what very few people in lindsay have ever seen master  and those few have never seen her close by  i have never laid eyes on her myself its no wonder she ran away poor girl  she isnt used to seeing strangers  im rather glad if that was the sole reason of her flight said eric  i admit i didnt like to see any girl so frightened of me as she appeared to be  she was as white as paper and so terrified that she never uttered a word but fled like a deer to cover  well she couldnt have spoken a word in any case said mrs williamson quietly  kilmeny gordon is dumb  eric sat in dismayed silence for a moment  that beautiful creature afflicted in such a fashionwhy it was horrible mingled with his dismay was a strange pang of personal regret and disappointment  it couldnt have been kilmeny gordon then he protested at last remembering  the girl i saw played on the violin exquisitely  i never heard anything like it  it is impossible that a deaf mute could play like that  oh she isnt deaf master responded mrs williamson looking at eric keenly through her spectacles  she picked up her knitting and fell to work again  that is the strange part of it if anything about her can be stranger than another  she can hear as well as anybody and understands everything that is said to her  but she cant speak a word and never could at least so they say  the truth is nobody knows much about her  janet and thomas never speak of her and neil wont either  he has been well questioned too you can depend on that but he wont ever say a word about kilmeny and he gets mad if folks persist  why isnt she to be spoken of queried eric impatiently  what is the mystery about her  its a sad story master  i suppose the gordons look on her existence as a sort of disgrace  for my own part i think its terrible the way shes been brought up  but the gordons are very strange people mr marshall  i kind of reproved father for saying so you remember but it is true  they have very strange ways  and youve really seen kilmeny  what does she look like ive heard that she was handsome  is it true  i thought her very beautiful said eric rather curtly  but how has she been brought up mrs williamson  and why  well i might as well tell you the whole story master  kilmeny is the niece of thomas and janet gordon  her mother was margaret gordon their younger sister  old james gordon came out from scotland janet and thomas were born in the old country and were small children when they came here  they were never very sociable folks but still they used to visit out some then and people used to go there  they were kind and honest people even if they were a little peculiar  mrs gordon died a few years after they came out and four years later james gordon went home to scotland and brought a new wife back with him  she was a great deal younger than he was and a very pretty woman as my mother often told me  she was friendly and gay and liked social life  the gordon place was a very different sort of place after she came there and even janet and thomas got thawed out and softened down a good bit  they were real fond of their stepmother ive heard  then six years after she was married the second mrs gordon died too  she died when margaret was born  they say james gordon almost broke his heart over it  janet brought margaret up  she and thomas just worshipped the child and so did their father  i knew margaret gordon well once we were just the same age and we set together in school  we were always good friends until she turned against all the world  she was a strange girl in some ways even then but i always liked her though a great many people didnt  she had some bitter enemies but she had some devoted friends too  that was her way  she made folks either hate or love her  those who did love her would have gone through fire and water for her  when she grew up she was very prettytall and splendid like a queen with great thick braids of black hair and red red cheeks and lips  everybody who saw her looked at her a second time she was a little vain of her beauty i think master  and she was proud oh she was very proud  she liked to be first in everything and she couldnt bear not to show to good advantage she was dreadful determined too  you couldnt budge her an inch master when she once had made up her mind on any point but she was warmhearted and generous  she could sing like an angel and she was very clever  she could learn anything with just one look at it and she was terrible fond of reading  when im talking about her like this it all comes back to me just what she was like and how she looked and spoke and acted and little ways she had of moving her hands and head  i declare it almost seems as if she was right here in this room instead of being over there in the churchyard  i wish youd light the lamp master  i feel kind of nervous  eric rose and lighted the lamp rather wondering at mrs williamsons unusual exhibition of nerves  she was generally so calm and composed  thank you master  thats better  i wont be fancying now that margaret gordons here listening to what im saying  i had the feeling so strong a moment ago  i suppose you think im a long while getting to kilmeny but im coming to that  i didnt mean to talk so much about margaret but somehow my thoughts got taken up with her  well margaret passed the board and went to queens academy and got a teachers license  she passed pretty well up when she came out but janet told me she cried all night after the pass list came out because there were some ahead of her  she went to teach school over at radnor  it was there she met a man named ronald fraser  margaret had never had a beau before she could have had any young man in lindsay if she had wanted him but she wouldnt look at one of them  they said it was because she thought nobody was good enough for her but that wasnt the way of it at all master  i knew because margaret and i used to talk of those matters as girls do  she didnt believe in going with anybody unless it was somebody she thought everything of  and there was nobody in lindsay she cared that much for  this ronald fraser was a stranger from nova scotia and nobody knew much about him  he was a widower although he was only a young man  he had set up storekeeping in radnor and was doing well  he was real handsome and had taking ways women like  it was said that all the radnor girls were in love with him but i dont think his worst enemy could have said he flirted with them he never took any notice of them but the very first time he saw margaret gordon he fell in love with her and she with him  they came over to church in lindsay together the next sunday and everybody said it would be a match  margaret looked lovely that day so gentle and womanly  she had been used to hold her head pretty high but that day she held it drooping a little and her black eyes cast down  ronald fraser was very tall and fair with blue eyes  they made as handsome a couple as i ever saw  but old james gordon and thomas and janet didnt much approve of him  i saw that plain enough one time i was there and he brought margaret home from radnor friday night  i guess they wouldnt have liked anybody though who come after margaret  they thought nobody was good enough for her  but margaret coaxed them all round in time  she could do pretty near anything with them they were so fond and proud of her  her father held out the longest but finally he give in and consented for her to marry ronald fraser  they had a big wedding tooall the neighbours were asked margaret always liked to make a display  i was her bridesmaid master  i helped her dress and nothing would please her she wanted to look that nice for ronalds sake  she was a handsome bride dressed in white with red roses in her hair and at her breast  she wouldnt wear white flowers she said they looked too much like funeral flowers  she looked like a picture  i can see her this minute as plain as plain just as she was that night blushing and turning pale by turns and looking at ronald with her eyes of love  if ever a girl loved a man with all her heart margaret gordon did  it almost made me feel frightened she gave him the worship it isnt right to give anybody but god master and i think that is always punished  they went to live at radnor and for a little while everything went well  margaret had a nice house and was gay and happy she dressed beautiful and entertained a good deal  thenwell ronald frasers first wife turned up looking for him  she wasnt dead after all  oh there was terrible scandal master  the talk and gossip was something dreadful  every one you met had a different story and it was hard to get at the truth  some said ronald fraser had known all the time that his wife wasnt dead and had deceived margaret  but i dont think he did  he swore he didnt  they hadnt been very happy together it seems  her mother made trouble between them  then she went to visit her mother in montreal and died in the hospital there so the word came to ronald  perhaps he believed it a little too readily but that he did believe it i never had a doubt  her story was that it was another woman of the same name  when she found out ronald thought her dead she and her mother agreed to let him think so but when she heard he had got married again she thought shed better let him know the truth  it all sounded like a queer story and i suppose you couldnt blame people for not believing it too readily  but ive always felt it was true  margaret didnt think so though  she believed that ronald fraser had deceived her knowing all the time that he couldnt make her his lawful wife  she turned against him and hated him just as much as she had loved him before  ronald fraser went away with his real wife and in less than a year word came of his death  they said he just died of a broken heart nothing more nor less  margaret came home to her fathers house  from the day that she went over its threshold she never came out until she was carried out in her coffin three years ago  not a soul outside of her own family ever saw her again  i went to see her but janet told me she wouldnt see me  it was foolish of margaret to act so  she hadnt done anything real wrong and everybody was sorry for her and would have helped her all they could  but i reckon pity cut her as deep as blame could have done and deeper because you see master she was so proud she couldnt bear it  they say her father was hard on her too and that was unjust if it was true  janet and thomas felt the disgrace too  the people that had been in the habit of going to the gordon place soon stopped going for they could see they were not welcome  old james gordon died that winter  he never held his head up again after the scandal  he had been an elder in the church but he handed in his resignation right away and nobody could persuade him to withdraw it  kilmeny was born in the spring but nobody ever saw her except the minister who baptized her  she was never taken to church or sent to school  of course i suppose there wouldnt have been any use in her going to school when she couldnt speak and its likely margaret taught her all she could be taught herself  but it was dreadful that she was never taken to church or let go among the children and young folks  and it was a real shame that nothing was ever done to find out why she couldnt talk or if she could be cured  margaret gordon died three years ago and everybody in lindsay went to the funeral  but they didnt see her  the coffin lid was screwed down  and they didnt see kilmeny either  i would have loved to see her for margarets sake but i didnt want to see poor margaret  i had never seen her since the night she was a bride for i had left lindsay on a visit just after that and what i came home the scandal had just broken out  i remembered margaret in all her pride and beauty and i couldnt have borne to look at her dead face and see the awful changes i knew must be there  it was thought perhaps janet and thomas would take kilmeny out after her mother was gone but they never did so i suppose they must have agreed with margaret about the way she had been brought up  ive often felt sorry for the poor girl and i dont think her people did right by her even if she was mysteriously afflicted  she must have had a very sad lonely life  that is the story master and ive been a long time telling it as i dare say you think  but the past just seemed to be living again for me as i talked  if you dont want to be pestered with questions about kilmeny gordon master youd better not let on youve seen her  eric was not likely to  he had heard all he wanted to know and more  so this girl is at to core of a tragedy he reflected as he went to his room  and she is dumb  the pity of it  kilmeny the name suits her  she is as lovely and innocent as the heroine of the old ballad  and oh kilmeny was fair to see  but the next line is certainly not so appropriate for her eyes were anything but still and steadfastafter she had seen me at all events  he tried to put her out of his thoughts but he could not  the memory of her beautiful face drew him with a power he could not resist  the next evening he went again to the orchard    chapter vii a rose of womanhood  when he emerged from the spruce wood and entered the orchard his heart gave a sudden leap and he felt that the blood rushed madly to his face  she was there bending over the bed of june lilies in the centre of the garden plot  he could only see her profile virginal and white  he stopped not wishing to startle her again  when she lifted her head he expected to see her shrink and flee but she did not do so she only grew a little paler and stood motionless watching him intently  seeing this he walked slowly towards her and when he was so close to her that he could hear the nervous flutter of her breath over her parted trembling lips he said very gently  do not be afraid of me  i am a friend and i do not wish to disturb or annoy you in any way  she seemed to hesitate a moment  then she lifted a little slate that hung at her belt wrote something on it rapidly and held it out to him  he read in a small distinctive handwriting  i am not afraid of you now  mother told me that all strange men were very wicked and dangerous but i do not think you can be  i have thought a great deal about you and i am sorry i ran away the other night  he realized her entire innocence and simplicity  looking earnestly into her still troubled eyes he said  i would not do you any harm for the world  all men are not wicked although it is too true that some are so  my name is eric marshall and i am teaching in the lindsay school  you i think are kilmeny gordon  i thought your music so very lovely the other evening that i have been wishing ever since that i might hear it again  wont you play for me  the vague fear had all gone from her eyes by this time and suddenly she smileda merry girlish wholly irresistible smile which broke through the calm of her face like a gleam of sunlight rippling over a placid sea  then she wrote i am very sorry that i cannot play this evening  i did not bring my violin with me  but i will bring it tomorrow evening and play for you if you would like to hear me  i should like to please you  again that note of innocent frankness  what a child she waswhat a beautiful ignorant child utterly unskilled in the art of hiding her feelings  but why should she hide them  they were as pure and beautiful as herself  eric smiled back at her with equal frankness  i should like it more than i can say and i shall be sure to come tomorrow evening if it is fine  but if it is at all damp or unpleasant you must not come  in that case another evening will do  and now wont you give me some flowers  she nodded with another little smile and began to pick some of the june lilies carefully selecting the most perfect among them he watched her lithe graceful motions with delight every movement seemed poetry itself  she looked like a very incarnation of springas if all the shimmer of young leaves and glow of young mornings and evanescent sweetness of young blossoms in a thousand springs had been embodied in her  when she came to him radiant her hands full of the lilies a couplet from a favourite poem darted into his head      a blossom vermeil white     that lightly breaks a faded flower sheath     here by gods rood is the one maid for me  the next moment he was angry with himself for his folly  she was after all nothing but a childand a child set apart from her fellow creatures by her sad defect  he must not let himself think nonsense  thank you  these june lilies are the sweetest flowers the spring brings us  do you know that their real name is the white narcissus  she looked pleased and interested  no i did not know she wrote  i have often read of the white narcissus and wondered what it was like  i never thought of it being the same as my dear june lilies  i am glad you told me  i love flowers very much  they are my very good friends  you couldnt help being friends with the lilies  like always takes to like said eric  come and sit down on the old benchhere where you were sitting that night i frightened you so badly  i could not imagine who or what you were  sometimes i thought i had dreamed youonly he added under his breath and unheard by her i could never have dreamed anything half so lovely  she sat down beside him on the old bench and looked unshrinkingly in his face  there was no boldness in her glancenothing but the most perfect childlike trust and confidence  if there had been any evil in his heartany skulking thought he was afraid to acknowledgethose eyes must have searched it out and shamed it  but he could meet them unafraid  then she wrote  i was very much frightened you must have thought me very silly but i had never seen any man except uncle thomas and neil and the egg peddler  and you are different from themoh very very different  i was afraid to come back here the next evening  and yet somehow i wanted to come  i did not want you to think i did not know how to behave  i sent neil back for my bow in the morning  i could not do without it  i cannot speak you know are you sorry  i am very sorry for your sake  yes but what i mean is would you like me better if i could speak like other people  no it does not make any difference in that way kilmeny  by the way do you mind my calling you kilmeny  she looked puzzled and wrote what else should you call me that is my name  everybody calls me that  but i am such a stranger to you that perhaps you would wish me to call you miss gordon  oh no i would not like that she wrote quickly with a distressed look on her face  nobody ever calls me that  it would make me feel as if i were not myself but somebody else and you do not seem like a stranger to me  is there any reason why you should not call me kilmeny  no reason whatever if you will allow me the privilege  you have a very lovely namethe very name you ought to have  i am glad you like it  do you know that i was called after my grandmother and she was called after a girl in a poem  aunt janet has never liked my name although she liked my grandmother but i am glad you like both my name and me  i was afraid you would not like me because i cannot speak  you can speak through your music kilmeny  she looked pleased  how well you understand she wrote  yes i cannot speak or sing as other people can but i can make my violin say things for me  do you compose your own music he asked  but he saw she did not understand him  i mean did any one ever teach you the music you played here that evening  oh no  it just came as i thought  it has always been that way  when i was very little neil taught me to hold the violin and the bow and the rest all came of itself  my violin once belonged to neil but he gave it to me  neil is very good and kind to me but i like you better  tell me about yourself  the wonder of her grew upon him with every passing moment  how lovely she was  what dear little ways and gestures she hadways and gestures as artless and unstudied as they were effective and how strangely little her dumbness seemed to matter after all she wrote so quickly and easily her eyes and smile gave such expression to her mobile face that voice was hardly missed  they lingered in the orchard until the long languid shadows of the trees crept to their feet  it was just after sunset and the distant hills were purple against the melting saffron of the sky in the west and the crystalline blue of the sky in the south eastward just over the fir woods were clouds white and high heaped like snow mountains and the westernmost of them shone with a rosy glow as of sunset on an alpine height  the higher worlds of air were still full of lightperfect stainless light unmarred of earth shadow but down in the orchard and under the spruces the light had almost gone giving place to a green dewy dusk made passionately sweet with the breath of the apple blossoms and mint and the balsamic odours that rained down upon them from the firs  eric told her of his life and the life in the great outer world in which she was girlishly and eagerly interested  she asked him many questions about itdirect and incisive questions which showed that she had already formed decided opinions and views about it  yet it was plain to be seen that she did not regard it as anything she might ever share herself  hers was the dispassionate interest with which she might have listened to a tale of the land of fairy or of some great empire long passed away from earth  eric discovered that she had read a great deal of poetry and history and a few books of biography and travel  she did not know what a novel meant and had never heard of one  curiously enough she was well informed regarding politics and current events from the weekly paper for which her uncle subscribed  i never read the newspaper while mother was alive she wrote nor any poetry either  she taught me to read and write and i read the bible all through many times and some of the histories after mother died aunt janet gave me all her books  she had a great many  most of them had been given to her as prizes when she was a girl at school and some of them had been given to her by my father  do you know the story of my father and mother  eric nodded  yes mrs williamson told me all about it she was a friend of your mother  i am glad you have heard it  it is so sad that i would not like to tell it but you will understand everything better because you know  i never heard it until just before mother died  then she told me all  i think she had thought father was to blame for the trouble but before she died she told me she believed that she had been unjust to him and that he had not known  she said that when people were dying they saw things more clearly and she saw she had made a mistake about father  she said she had many more things she wanted to tell me but she did not have time to tell them because she died that night  it was a long while before i had the heart to read her books  but when i did i thought them so beautiful  they were poetry and it was like music put into words  i will bring you some books to read if you would like them said eric  her great blue eyes gleamed with interest and delight  oh thank you i would like it very much  i have read mine over so often that i know them nearly all by heart  one cannot get tired of really beautiful things but sometimes i feel that i would like some new books  are you never lonely kilmeny  oh no how could i be  there is always plenty for me to do helping aunt janet about the house  i can do a great many thingsshe glanced up at him with a pretty pride as her flying pencil traced the words  i can cook and sew  aunt janet says i am a very good housekeeper and she does not praise people very often or very much  and then when i am not helping her i have my dear dear violin  that is all the company i want  but i like to read and hear of the big world so far away and the people who live there and the things that are done  it must be a very wonderful place  wouldnt you like to go out into it and see its wonders and meet those people yourself he asked smiling at her  at once he saw that in some way he could not understand he had hurt her  she snatched her pencil and wrote with such swiftness of motion and energy of expression that it almost seemed as if she had passionately exclaimed the words aloud  no no no  i do not want to go anywhere away from home  i do not want ever to see strangers or have them see me  i could not bear it  he thought that possibly the consciousness of her defect accounted for this  yet she did not seem sensitive about her dumbness and made frequent casual references to it in her written remarks  or perhaps it was the shadow on her birth  yet she was so innocent that it seemed unlikely she could realize or understand the existence of such a shadow  eric finally decided that it was merely the rather morbid shrinking of a sensitive child who had been brought up in an unwholesome and unnatural way  at last the lengthening shadows warned him that it was time to go  you wont forget to come tomorrow evening and play for me he said rising reluctantly  she answered by a quick little shake of her sleek dark head and a smile that was eloquent  he watched her as she walked across the orchard      with the moons beauty and the moons soft pace  and along the wild cherry lane  at the corner of the firs she paused and waved her hand to him before turning it  when eric reached home old robert williamson was having a lunch of bread and milk in the kitchen  he looked up with a friendly grin as eric strode in whistling  been having a walk master he queried  yes said eric  unconsciously and involuntarily he infused so much triumph into the simple monosyllable that even old robert felt it  mrs williamson who was cutting bread at the end of the table laid down her knife and loaf and looked at the young man with a softly troubled expression in her eyes  she wondered if he had been back to the connors orchardand if he could have seen kilmeny gordon again  you didnt discover a gold mine i spose said old robert dryly  you look as if you might have    chapter viii at the gate of eden  when eric went to the old connors orchard the next evening he found kilmeny waiting for him on the bench under the white lilac tree with the violin in her lap  as soon as she saw him she caught it up and began to play an airy delicate little melody that sounded like the laughter of daisies  when it was finished she dropped her bow and looked up at him with flushed cheeks and questioning eyes  what did that say to you she wrote  it said something like this answered eric falling into her humour smilingly  welcome my friend  it is a very beautiful evening  the sky is so blue and the apple blossoms so sweet the wind and i have been here alone together and the wind is a good companion but still i am glad to see you  it is an evening on which it is good to be alive and to wander in an orchard that is fine and white  welcome my friend  she clapped her hands looking like a pleased child  you are very quick to understand she wrote  that was just what i meant  of course i did not think it in just those words but that was the feeling of it  i felt that i was so glad i was alive and that the apple blossoms and the white lilacs and the trees and i were all pleased together to see you come  you are quicker than neil  he is almost always puzzled to understand my music and i am puzzled to understand his  sometimes it frightens me  it seems as if there were something in it trying to take hold of mesomething i do not like and want to run away from  somehow eric did not like her references to neil  the idea of that handsome lowborn boy seeing kilmeny every day talking to her sitting at the same table with her dwelling under the same roof meeting her in the hundred intimacies of daily life was distasteful to him  he put the thought away from him and flung himself down on the long grass at her feet  now play for me please he said  i want to lie here and listen to you  and look at you he might have added  he could not tell which was the greater pleasure  her beauty more wonderful than any pictured loveliness he had ever seen delighted him  every tint and curve and outline of her face was flawless  her music enthralled him  this child he told himself as he listened had genius  but it was being wholly wasted  he found himself thinking resentfully of the people who were her guardians and who were responsible for her strange life  they had done her a great and irremediable wrong  how dared they doom her to such an existence  if her defect of utterance had been attended to in time who knew but that it might have been cured  now it was probably too late  nature had given her a royal birthright of beauty and talent but their selfish and unpardonable neglect had made it of no account  what divine music she lured out of the old violinmerry and sad gay and sorrowful by turns music such as the stars of morning might have made singing together music that the fairies might have danced to in their revels among the green hills or on yellow sands music that might have mourned over the grave of a dead hope  then she drifted into a still sweeter strain  as he listened to it he realized that the whole soul and nature of the girl were revealing themselves to him through her musicthe beauty and purity of her thoughts her childhood dreams and her maiden reveries  there was no thought of concealment about her she could not help the revelation she was unconscious of making  at last she laid her violin aside and wrote  i have done my best to give you pleasure  it is your turn now do you remember a promise you made me last night  have you kept it  he gave her the two books he had brought for hera modern novel and a volume of poetry unknown to her  he had hesitated a little over the former but the book was so fine and full of beauty that he thought it could not bruise the bloom of her innocence ever so slightly  he had no doubts about the poetry  it was the utterance of one of those great inspired souls whose passing tread has made the kingdom of their birth and labour a veritable holy land  he read her some of the poems  then he talked to her of his college days and friends  the minutes passed very swiftly there was just then no world for him outside of that old orchard with its falling blossoms and its shadows and its crooning winds  once when he told her the story of some college pranks wherein the endless feuds of freshmen and sophomores figured she clapped her hands together according to her habit and laughed alouda clear musical silvery peal  it fell on erics ear with a shock of surprise  he thought it strange that she could laugh like that when she could not speak  wherein lay the defect that closed for her the gates of speech  was it possible that it could be removed  kilmeny he said gravely after a moments reflection during which he had looked up as she sat with the ruddy sunlight falling through the lilac branches on her bare silky head like a shower of red jewels do you mind if i ask you something about your inability to speak  will it hurt you to talk of the matter with me  she shook her head  oh no she wrote i do not mind at all  of course i am sorry i cannot speak but i am quite used to the thought and it never hurts me at all  then kilmeny tell me this  do you know why it is that you are unable to speak when all your other faculties are so perfect  no i do not know at all why i cannot speak  i asked mother once and she told me it was a judgment on her for a great sin she had committed and she looked so strangely that i was frightened and i never spoke of it to her or anyone else again  were you ever taken to a doctor to have your tongue and organs of speech examined  no i remember when i was a very little girl that uncle thomas wanted to take me to a doctor in charlottetown and see if anything could be done for me but mother would not let him  she said it would be no use  and i do not think uncle thomas thought it would be either  you can laugh very naturally  can you make any other sound  yes sometimes  when i am pleased or frightened i have made little cries  but it is only when i am not thinking of it at all that i can do that  if i try to make a sound i cannot do it at all  this seemed to eric more mysterious than ever  do you ever try to speakto utter words he persisted  oh yes very often  all the time i am saying the words in my head just as i hear other people saying them but i never can make my tongue say them  do not look so sorry my friend  i am very happy and i do not mind so very much not being able to speakonly sometimes when i have so many thoughts and it seems so slow to write them out some of them get away from me  i must play to you again  you look too sober  she laughed again picked up her violin and played a tinkling roguish little melody as if she were trying to tease him looking at eric over her violin with luminous eyes that dared him to be merry  eric smiled but the puzzled look returned to his face many times that evening  he walked home in a brown study  kilmenys case certainly seemed a strange one and the more he thought of it the stranger it seemed  it strikes me as something very peculiar that she should be able to make sounds only when she is not thinking about it he reflected  i wish david baker could examine her  but i suppose that is out of the question  that grim pair who have charge of her would never consent    chapter ix the straight simplicity of eve  for the next three weeks eric marshall seemed to himself to be living two lives as distinct from each other as if he possessed a double personality  in one he taught the lindsay district school diligently and painstakingly solved problems argued on theology with robert williamson called at the homes of his pupils and took tea in state with their parents went to a rustic dance or two and played havoc all unwittingly with the hearts of the lindsay maidens  but this life was a dream of workaday  he only lived in the other which was spent in an old orchard grassy and overgrown where the minutes seemed to lag for sheer love of the spot and the june winds made wild harping in the old spruces  here every evening he met kilmeny in that old orchard they garnered hours of quiet happiness together together they went wandering in the fair fields of old romance together they read many books and talked of many things and when they were tired of all else kilmeny played to him and the old orchard echoed with her lovely fantastic melodies  at every meeting her beauty came home afresh to him with the old thrill of glad surprise  in the intervals of absence it seemed to him that she could not possibly be as beautiful as he remembered her and then when they met she seemed even more so he learned to watch for the undisguised light of welcome that always leaped into her eyes at the sound of his footsteps  she was nearly always there before him and she always showed that she was glad to see him with the frank delight of a child watching for a dear comrade  she was never in the same mood twice  now she was grave now gay now stately now pensive  but she was always charming thrawn and twisted the old gordon stock might be but it had at least this one offshoot of perfect grace and symmetry  her mind and heart utterly unspoiled of the world were as beautiful as her face  all the ugliness of existence had passed her by shrined in her double solitude of upbringing and muteness  she was naturally quick and clever  delightful little flashes of wit and humour sparkled out occasionally  she could be whimsicaleven charmingly capricious  sometimes innocent mischief glimmered out in the unfathomable deeps of her blue eyes  sarcasm even was not unknown to her  now and then she punctured some harmless bubble of a young mans conceit or masculine superiority with a biting little line of daintily written script  she assimilated the ideas in the books they read speedily eagerly and thoroughly always seizing on the best and truest and rejecting the false and spurious and weak with an unfailing intuition at which eric marvelled  hers was the spear of ithuriel trying out the dross of everything and leaving only the pure gold  in manner and outlook she was still a child  yet now and again she was as old as eve  an expression would leap into her laughing face a subtle meaning reveal itself in her smile that held all the lore of womanhood and all the wisdom of the ages  her way of smiling enchanted him  the smile always began far down in her eyes and flowed outward to her face like a sparkling brook stealing out of shadow into sunshine  he knew everything about her life  she told him her simple history freely  she often mentioned her uncle and aunt and seemed to regard them with deep affection  she rarely spoke of her mother  eric came somehow to understand less from what she said than from what she did not say that kilmeny though she had loved her mother had always been rather afraid of her  there had not been between them the natural beautiful confidence of mother and child  of neil she wrote frequently at first and seemed very fond of him  later she ceased to mention him  perhapsfor she was marvellously quick to catch and interpret every fleeting change of expression in his voice and faceshe discerned what eric did not know himselfthat his eyes clouded and grew moody at the mention of neils name  once she asked him naively  are there many people like you out in the world  thousands of them said eric laughing  she looked gravely at him  then she gave her head a quick decided little shake  i do not think so she wrote  i do not know much of the world but i do not think there are many people like you in it  one evening when the faraway hills and fields were scarfed in gauzy purples and the intervales were brimming with golden mists eric carried to the old orchard a little limp worn volume that held a love story  it was the first thing of the kind he had ever read to her for in the first novel he had lent her the love interest had been very slight and subordinate  this was a beautiful passionate idyl exquisitely told  he read it to her lying in the grass at her feet she listened with her hands clasped over her knee and her eyes cast down  it was not a long story and when he had finished it he shut the book and looked up at her questioningly  do you like it kilmeny he asked  very slowly she took her slate and wrote  yes i like it  but it hurt me too  i did not know that a person could like anything that hurt her  i do not know why it hurt me  i felt as if i had lost something that i never had that was a very silly feeling was it not  but i did not understand the book very well you see  it is about love and i do not know anything about love  mother told me once that love is a curse and that i must pray that it would never enter into my life  she said it very earnestly and so i believed her  but your book teaches that it is a blessing  it says that it is the most splendid and wonderful thing in life  which am i to believe  lovereal loveis never a curse kilmeny said eric gravely there is a false love which is a curse  perhaps your mother believed it was that which had entered her life and ruined it and so she made the mistake  there is nothing in the worldor in heaven either as i believeso truly beautiful and wonderful and blessed as love  have you ever loved asked kilmeny with the directness of phrasing necessitated by her mode of communication which was sometimes a little terrible  she asked the question simply and without embarrassment  she knew of no reason why love might not be discussed with eric as other mattersmusic and books and travelmight be  no said erichonestly as he thought but every one has an ideal of love whom he hopes to meet some daythe ideal woman of a young mans dream  i suppose i have mine in some sealed secret chamber of my heart  i suppose your ideal woman would be beautiful like the woman in your book  oh yes i am sure i could never care for an ugly woman said eric laughing a little as he sat up  our ideals are always beautiful whether they so translate themselves into realities or not  but the sun is going down  time does certainly fly in this enchanted orchard  i believe you bewitch the moments away kilmeny  your namesake of the poem was a somewhat uncanny maid if i recollect aright and thought as little of seven years in elfland as ordinary folk do of half an hour on upper earth  some day i shall waken from a supposed hours lingering here and find myself an old man with white hair and ragged coat as in that fairy tale we read the other night  will you let me give you this book  i should never commit the sacrilege of reading it in any other place than this  it is an old book kilmeny  a new book savouring of the shop and marketplace however beautiful it might be would not do for you  this was one of my mothers books  she read it and loved it  seethe faded rose leaves she placed in it one day are there still  ill write your name in itthat quaint pretty name of yours which always sounds as if it had been specially invented for youkilmeny of the orchardand the date of this perfect june day on which we read it together  then when you look at it you will always remember me and the white buds opening on that rosebush beside you and the rush and murmur of the wind in the tops of those old spruces  he held out the book to her but to his surprise she shook her head with a deeper flush on her face  wont you take the book kilmeny  why not  she took her pencil and wrote slowly unlike her usual quick movement  do not be offended with me  i shall not need anything to make me remember you because i can never forget you  but i would rather not take the book  i do not want to read it again  it is about love and there is no use in my learning about love even if it is all you say  nobody will ever love me  i am too ugly  you  ugly exclaimed eric  he was on the point of going off into a peal of laughter at the idea when a glimpse of her half averted face sobered him  on it was a hurt bitter look such as he remembered seeing once before when he had asked her if she would not like to see the world for herself  kilmeny he said in astonishment you dont really think yourself ugly do you  she nodded without looking at him and then wrote  oh yes i know that i am  i have known it for a long time mother told me that i was very ugly and that nobody would ever like to look at me  i am sorry  it hurts me much worse to know i am ugly than it does to know i cannot speak  i suppose you will think that is very foolish of me but it is true  that was why i did not come back to the orchard for such a long time even after i had got over my fright  i hated to think that you would think me ugly  and that is why i do not want to go out into the world and meet people  they would look at me as the egg peddler did one day when i went out with aunt janet to his wagon the spring after mother died  he stared at me so  i knew it was because he thought me so ugly and i have always hidden when he came ever since  erics lips twitched in spite of his pity for the real suffering displayed in her eyes he could not help feeling amused over the absurd idea of this beautiful girl believing herself in all seriousness to be ugly  but kilmeny do you think yourself ugly when you look in a mirror he asked smiling  i have never looked in a mirror she wrote  i never knew there was such a thing until after mother died and i read about it in a book  then i asked aunt janet and she said mother had broken all the looking glasses in the house when i was a baby but i have seen my face reflected in the spoons and in a little silver sugar bowl aunt janet has  and it is uglyvery ugly  erics face went down into the grass  for his life he could not help laughing and for his life he would not let kilmeny see him laughing  a certain little whimsical wish took possession of him and he did not hasten to tell her the truth as had been his first impulse  instead when he dared to look up he said slowly  i dont think you are ugly kilmeny  oh but i am sure you must she wrote protestingly  even neil does  he tells me i am kind and nice but one day i asked him if he thought me very ugly and he looked away and would not speak so i knew what he thought about it too  do not let us speak of this again  it makes me feel sorry and spoils everything  i forget it at other times  let me play you some goodbye music and do not feel vexed because i would not take your book  it would only make me unhappy to read it  i am not vexed said eric and i think you will take it some day yetafter i have shown you something i want you to see never mind about your looks kilmeny  beauty isnt everything  oh it is a great deal she wrote naively  but you do like me even though i am so ugly dont you  you like me because of my beautiful music dont you  i like you very much kilmeny answered eric laughing a little but there was in his voice a tender note of which he was unconscious  kilmeny was aware of it however and she picked up her violin with a pleased smile  he left her playing there and all the way through the dim resinous spruce wood her music followed him like an invisible guardian spirit  kilmeny the beautiful he murmured and yet good heavens the child thinks she is uglyshe with a face more lovely than ever an artist dreamed of  a girl of eighteen who has never looked in a mirror  i wonder if there is another such in any civilized country in the world  what could have possessed her mother to tell her such a falsehood  i wonder if margaret gordon could have been quite sane  it is strange that neil has never told her the truth  perhaps he doesnt want her to find out  eric had met neil gordon a few evenings before this at a country dance where neil had played the violin for the dancers influenced by curiosity he had sought the lads acquaintance neil was friendly and talkative at first but at the first hint concerning the gordons which eric threw out skilfully his face and manner changed  he looked secretive and suspicious almost sinister  a sullen look crept into his big black eyes and he drew his bow across the violin strings with a discordant screech as if to terminate the conversation  plainly nothing was to be found out from him about kilmeny and her grim guardians    chapter x a troubling of the waters  one evening in late june mrs williamson was sitting by her kitchen window  her knitting lay unheeded in her lap and timothy though he nestled ingratiatingly against her foot as he lay on the rug and purred his loudest was unregarded  she rested her face on her hand and looked out of the window across the distant harbour with troubled eyes  i guess i must speak she thought wistfully  i hate to do it i always did hate meddling  my mother always used to say that ninetynine times out of a hundred the last state of a meddler and them she meddled with was worse than the first  but i guess its my duty  i was margarets friend and it is my duty to protect her child any way i can  if the master does go back across there to meet her i must tell him what i think about it  overhead in his room eric was walking about whistling presently he came downstairs thinking of the orchard and the girl who would be waiting for him there  as he crossed the little front entry he heard mrs williamsons voice calling to him  mr marshall will you please come here a moment  he went out to the kitchen  mrs williamson looked at him deprecatingly  there was a flush on her faded cheek and her voice trembled  mr marshall i want to ask you a question  perhaps you will think it isnt any of my business  but it isnt because i want to meddle  no no  it is only because i think i ought to speak i have thought it over for a long time and it seems to me that i ought to speak  i hope you wont be angry but even if you are i must say what i have to say  are you going back to the old connors orchard to meet kilmeny gordon  for a moment an angry flush burned in erics face  it was more mrs williamsons tone than her words which startled and annoyed him  yes i am mrs williamson he said coldly  what of it  then sir said mrs williamson with more firmness i have got to tell you that i dont think you are doing right  i have been suspecting all along that that was where you went every evening but i havent said a word to any one about it  even my husband doesnt know  but tell me this master  do kilmenys uncle and aunt know that you are meeting her there  why said eric in some confusion ii do not know whether they do or not  but mrs williamson surely you do not suspect me of meaning any harm or wrong to kilmeny gordon  no i dont master  i might think it of some men but never of you  i dont for a minute think that you would do her or any woman any wilful wrong  but you may do her great harm for all that  i want you to stop and think about it  i guess you havent thought  kilmeny cant know anything about the world or about men and she may get to thinking too much of you  that might break her heart because you couldnt ever marry a dumb girl like her  so i dont think you ought to be meeting her so often in this fashion  it isnt right master  dont go to the orchard again  without a word eric turned away and went upstairs to his room mrs williamson picked up her knitting with a sigh  thats done timothy and im real thankful she said  i guess therell be no need of saying anything more  mr marshall is a fine young man only a little thoughtless  now that hes got his eyes opened im sure hell do what is right  i dont want margarets child made unhappy  her husband came to the kitchen door and sat down on the steps to enjoy his evening smoke talking between whiffs to his wife of elder tracys church row and mary alice martins beau the price jake crosby was giving for eggs the quantity of hay yielded by the hill meadow the trouble he was having with old mollys calf and the respective merits of plymouth rock and brahma roosters mrs williamson answered at random and heard not one word in ten  whats got the master mother inquired old robert presently i hear him striding up and down in his room sif he was caged sure you didnt lock him in by mistake  maybe hes worried over the way seth tracys acting in school suggested mrs williamson who did not choose that her gossipy husband should suspect the truth about eric and kilmeny gordon  shucks he neednt worry a morsel over that  sethll quiet down as soon as he finds he cant run the master  hes a rare good teacherbettern mr west was even and thats saying something the trustees are hoping hell stay for another term  theyre going to ask him at the school meeting tomorrow and offer him a raise of supplement  upstairs in his little room under the eaves eric marshall was in the grip of the most intense and overwhelming emotion he had ever experienced  up and down to and fro he walked with set lips and clenched hands  when he was wearied out he flung himself on a chair by the window and wrestled with the flood of feeling  mrs williamsons words had torn away the delusive veil with which he had bound his eyes  he was face to face with the knowledge that he loved kilmeny gordon with the love that comes but once and is for all time  he wondered how he could have been so long blind to it  he knew that he must have loved her ever since their first meeting that may evening in the old orchard  and he knew that he must choose between two alternativeseither he must never go to the orchard again or he must go as an avowed lover to woo him a wife  worldly prudence his inheritance from a long line of thrifty coolheaded ancestors was strong in eric and he did not yield easily or speedily to the dictates of his passion  all night he struggled against the new emotions that threatened to sweep away the common sense which david baker had bade him take with him when he went awooing  would not a marriage with kilmeny gordon be an unwise thing from any standpoint  then something stronger and greater and more vital than wisdom or unwisdom rose up in him and mastered him  kilmeny beautiful dumb kilmeny was as he had once involuntarily thought the one maid for him  nothing should part them  the mere idea of never seeing her again was so unbearable that he laughed at himself for having counted it a possible alternative  if i can win kilmenys love i shall ask her to be my wife he said looking out of the window to the dark southwestern hill beyond which lay his orchard  the velvet sky over it was still starry but the water of the harbour was beginning to grow silvery in the reflection of the dawn that was breaking in the east  her misfortune will only make her dearer to me  i cannot realize that a month ago i did not know her  it seems to me that she has been a part of my life for ever  i wonder if she was grieved that i did not go to the orchard last nightif she waited for me  if she does she does not know it herself yet it will be my sweet task to teach her what love means and no man has ever had a lovelier purer pupil  at the annual school meeting the next afternoon the trustees asked eric to take the lindsay school for the following year  he consented unhesitatingly  that evening he went to mrs williamson as she washed her tea dishes in the kitchen  mrs williamson i am going back to the old connors orchard to see kilmeny again tonight  she looked at him reproachfully  well master i have no more to say  i suppose it wouldnt be of any use if i had  but you know what i think of it  i intend to marry kilmeny gordon if i can win her  an expression of amazement came into the good womans face  she looked scrutinizingly at the firm mouth and steady gray eyes for a moment  then she said in a troubled voice  do you think that is wise master  i suppose kilmeny is pretty the egg peddler told me she was and no doubt she is a good nice girl  but she wouldnt be a suitable wife for youa girl that cant speak  that doesnt make any difference to me  but what will your people say  i have no people except my father  when he sees kilmeny he will understand  she is all the world to me mrs williamson  as long as you believe that there is nothing more to be said was the quiet answer id be a little bit afraid if i was you though  but young people never think of those things  my only fear is that she wont care for me said eric soberly  mrs williamson surveyed the handsome broadshouldered young man shrewdly  i dont think there are many women would say you no master i wish you well in your wooing though i cant help thinking youre doing a daftlike thing  i hope you wont have any trouble with thomas and janet  they are so different from other folks there is no knowing  but take my advice master and go and see them about it right off  dont go on meeting kilmeny unbeknownst to them  i shall certainly take your advice said eric gravely  i should have gone to them before  it was merely thoughtlessness on my part  possibly they do know already  kilmeny may have told them  mrs williamson shook her head decidedly  no no master she hasnt  theyd never have let her go on meeting you there if they had known  i know them too well to think of that for a moment  go you straight to them and say to them just what you have said to me  that is your best plan master  and take care of neil  people say he has a notion of kilmeny himself  hell do you a bad turn if he can ive no doubt  them foreigners cant be trustedand hes just as much a foreigner as his parents before himthough he has been brought up on oatmeal and the shorter catechism as the old saying has it  i feel that somehowi always feel it when i look at him singing in the choir  oh i am not afraid of neil said eric carelessly  he couldnt help loving kilmenynobody could  i suppose every young man thinks that about his girlif hes the right sort of young man said mrs williamson with a little sigh  she watched eric out of sight anxiously  i hope itll all come out right she thought  i hope he aint making an awful mistakebutim afraid  kilmeny must be very pretty to have bewitched him so  well i suppose there is no use in my worrying over it  but i do wish he had never gone back to that old orchard and seen her    chapter xi a lover and his lass  kilmeny was in the orchard when eric reached it and he lingered for a moment in the shadow of the spruce wood to dream over her beauty  the orchard had lately overflowed in waves of oldfashioned caraway and she was standing in the midst of its sea of bloom with the lacelike blossoms swaying around her in the wind  she wore the simple dress of pale blue print in which he had first seen her silk attire could not better have become her loveliness  she had woven herself a chaplet of half open white rosebuds and placed it on her dark hair where the delicate blossoms seemed less wonderful than her face  when eric stepped through the gap she ran to meet him with outstretched hands smiling  he took her hands and looked into her eyes with an expression before which hers for the first time faltered  she looked down and a warm blush strained the ivory curves of her cheek and throat  his heart bounded for in that blush he recognized the banner of loves vanguard  are you glad to see me kilmeny he asked in a low significant tone  she nodded and wrote in a somewhat embarrassed fashion  yes  why do you ask  you know i am always glad to see you  i was afraid you would not come  you did not come last night and i was so sorry  nothing in the orchard seemed nice any longer  i couldnt even play  i tried to and my violin only cried  i waited until it was dark and then i went home  i am sorry you were disappointed kilmeny  i couldnt come last night  some day i shall tell you why  i stayed home to learn a new lesson  i am sorry you missed meno i am glad  can you understand how a person may be glad and sorry for the same thing  she nodded again with a return of her usual sweet composure  yes i could not have understood once but i can now  did you learn your new lesson  yes very thoroughly  it was a delightful lesson when i once understood it  i must try to teach it to you some day  come over to the old bench kilmeny  there is something i want to say to you but first will you give me a rose  she ran to the bush and after careful deliberation selected a perfect halfopen bud and brought it to hima white bud with a faint sunrise flush about its golden heart  thank you  it is as beautiful asas a woman i know eric said  a wistful look came into her face at his words and she walked with a drooping head across the orchard to the bench  kilmeny he said seriously i am going to ask you to do something for me  i want you to take me home with you and introduce me to your uncle and aunt  she lifted her head and stared at him incredulously as if he had asked her to do something wildly impossible  understanding from his grave face that he meant what he said a look of dismay dawned in her eyes  she shook her head almost violently and seemed to be making a passionate instinctive effort to speak then she caught up her pencil and wrote with feverish haste  i cannot do that  do not ask me to  you do not understand they would be very angry  they do not want to see any one coming to the house  and they would never let me come here again  oh you do not mean it  he pitied her for the pain and bewilderment in her eyes but he took her slender hands in his and said firmly  yes kilmeny i do mean it  it is not quite right for us to be meeting each other here as we have been doing without the knowledge and consent of your friends  you cannot now understand this butbelieve meit is so  she looked questioningly pityingly into his eyes  what she read there seemed to convince her for she turned very pale and an expression of hopelessness came into her face  releasing her hands she wrote slowly  if you say it is wrong i must believe it  i did not know anything so pleasant could be wrong  but if it is wrong we must not meet here any more  mother told me i must never do anything that was wrong but i did not know this was wrong  it was not wrong for you kilmeny  but it was a little wrong for me because i knew betteror rather should have known better  i didnt stop to think as the children say  some day you will understand fully  now you will take me to your uncle and aunt and after i have said to them what i want to say it will be all right for us to meet here or anywhere  she shook her head  no she wrote uncle thomas and aunt janet will tell you to go away and never come back  and they will never let me come here any more  since it is not right to meet you i will not come but it is no use to think of going to them  i did not tell them about you because i knew that they would forbid me to see you but i am sorry since it is so wrong  you must take me to them said eric firmly  i am quite sure that things will not be as you fear when they hear what i have to say  uncomforted she wrote forlornly  i must do it since you insist but i am sure it will be no use i cannot take you tonight because they are away  they went to the store at radnor  but i will take you tomorrow night and after that i shall not see you any more  two great tears brimmed over in her big blue eyes and splashed down on her slate  her lips quivered like a hurt childs  eric put his arm impulsively about her and drew her head down upon his shoulder  as she cried there softly miserably he pressed his lips to the silky black hair with its coronal of rosebuds  he did not see two burning eyes which were looking at him over the old fence behind him with hatred and mad passion blazing in their depths  neil gordon was crouched there with clenched hands and heaving breast watching them  kilmeny dear dont cry said eric tenderly  you shall see me again  i promise you that whatever happens  i do not think your uncle and aunt will be as unreasonable as you fear but even if they are they shall not prevent me from meeting you somehow  kilmeny lifted her head and wiped the tears from her eyes  you do not know what they are like she wrote  they will lock me into my room  that is the way they always punished me when i was a little girl  and once not so very long ago when i was a big girl they did it  if they do ill get you out somehow said eric laughing a little  she allowed herself to smile but it was a rather forlorn little effort  she did not cry any more but her spirits did not come back to her  eric talked gaily but she only listened in a pensive absent way as if she scarcely heard him  when he asked her to play she shook her head  i cannot think any music tonight she wrote i must go home for my head aches and i feel very stupid  very well kilmeny  now dont worry little girl  it will all come out all right  evidently she did not share his confidence for her head drooped again as they walked together across the orchard  at the entrance of the wild cherry lane she paused and looked at him half reproachfully her eyes filling again  she seemed to be bidding him a mute farewell  with an impulse of tenderness which he could not control eric put his arm about her and kissed her red trembling mouth  she started back with a little cry  a burning colour swept over her face and the next moment she fled swiftly up the darkening lane  the sweetness of that involuntary kiss clung to erics lips as he went homeward halfintoxicating him  he knew that it had opened the gates of womanhood to kilmeny  never again he felt would her eyes meet his with their old unclouded frankness  when next he looked into them he knew that he should see there the consciousness of his kiss  behind her in the orchard that night kilmeny had left her childhood    chapter xii a prisoner of love  when eric betook himself to the orchard the next evening he had to admit that he felt rather nervous  he did not know how the gordons would receive him and certainly the reports he had heard of them were not encouraging to say the least of it  even mrs williamson when he had told her where he was going seemed to look upon him as one bent on bearding a lion in his den  i do hope they wont be very uncivil to you master was the best she could say  he expected kilmeny to be in the orchard before him for he had been delayed by a call from one of the trustees but she was nowhere to be seen  he walked across it to the wild cherry lane but at its entrance he stopped short in sudden dismay  neil gordon had stepped from behind the trees and stood confronting him with blazing eyes and lips which writhed in emotion so great that at first it prevented him from speaking  with a thrill of dismay eric instantly understood what must have taken place  neil had discovered that he and kilmeny had been meeting in the orchard and beyond doubt had carried that tale to janet and thomas gordon  he realized how unfortunate it was that this should have happened before he had had time to make his own explanation  it would probably prejudice kilmenys guardians still further against him  at this point in his thoughts neils pent up passion suddenly found vent in a burst of wild words  so youve come to meet her again  but she isnt hereyoull never see her again  i hate youi hate youi hate you  his voice rose to a shrill scream  he took a furious step nearer eric as if he would attack him  eric looked steadily in his eyes with a calm defiance before which his wild passion broke like foam on a rock  so you have been making trouble for kilmeny neil have you said eric contemptuously  i suppose you have been playing the spy  and i suppose that you have told her uncle and aunt that she has been meeting me here  well you have saved me the trouble of doing it that is all  i was going to tell them myself tonight  i dont know what your motive in doing this has been  was it jealousy of me  or have you done it out of malice to kilmeny  his contempt cowed neil more effectually than any display of anger could have done  never you mind why i did it he muttered sullenly  what i did or why i did it is no business of yours  and you have no business to come sneaking around here either  kilmeny wont meet you here again  she will meet me in her own home then said eric sternly neil in behaving as you have done you have shown yourself to be a very foolish undisciplined boy  i am going straightway to kilmenys uncle and aunt to explain everything  neil sprang forward in his path  nonogo away he implored wildly  oh siroh mr marshall please go away  ill do anything for you if you will i love kilmeny  ive loved her all my life  id give my life for her  i cant have you coming here to steal her from me  if you doill kill you  i wanted to kill you last night when i saw you kiss her  oh yes i saw you  i was watchingspying if you like  i dont care what you call it  i had followed heri suspected something  she was so differentso changed she never would wear the flowers i picked for her any more  she seemed to forget i was there  i knew something had come between us  and it was you curse you  oh ill make you sorry for it  he was working himself up into a fury againthe untamed fury of the italian peasant thwarted in his hearts desire  it overrode all the restraint of his training and environment  eric amid all his anger and annoyance felt a thrill of pity for him  neil gordon was only a boy still and he was miserable and beside himself  neil listen to me he said quietly  you are talking very foolishly  it is not for you to say who shall or shall not be kilmenys friend  now you may just as well control yourself and go home like a decent fellow  i am not at all frightened by your threats and i shall know how to deal with you if you persist in interfering with me or persecuting kilmeny  i am not the sort of person to put up with that my lad  the restrained power in his tone and look cowed neil  the latter turned sullenly away with another muttered curse and plunged into the shadow of the firs  eric not a little ruffled under all his external composure by this most unexpected and unpleasant encounter pursued his way along the lane which wound on by the belt of woodland in twist and curve to the gordon homestead  his heart beat as he thought of kilmeny  what might she not be suffering  doubtless neil had given a very exaggerated and distorted account of what he had seen and probably her dour relations were very angry with her poor child  anxious to avert their wrath as soon as might be he hurried on almost forgetting his meeting with neil  the threats of the latter did not trouble him at all  he thought the angry outburst of a jealous boy mattered but little  what did matter was that kilmeny was in trouble which his heedlessness had brought upon her  presently he found himself before the gordon house  it was an old building with sharp eaves and dormer windows its shingles stained a dark gray by long exposure to wind and weather  faded green shutters hung on the windows of the lower story  behind it grew a thick wood of spruces  the little yard in front of it was grassy and prim and flowerless but over the low front door a luxuriant earlyflowering rose vine clambered in a riot of bloodred blossom which contrasted strangely with the general bareness of its surroundings  it seemed to fling itself over the grim old house as if intent on bombarding it with an alien life and joyousness  eric knocked at the door wondering if it might be possible that kilmeny should come to it  but a moment later it was opened by an elderly womana woman of rigid lines from the hem of her lank dark print dress to the crown of her head covered with black hair which despite its few gray threads was still thick and luxuriant  she had a long pale face somewhat worn and wrinkled but possessing a certain harsh comeliness of feature which neither age nor wrinkles had quite destroyed and her deepset light gray eyes were not devoid of suggested kindliness although they now surveyed eric with an unconcealed hostility  her figure in its merciless dress was very angular yet there was about her a dignity of carriage and manner which eric liked  in any case he preferred her unsmiling dourness to vulgar garrulity  he lifted his hat  have i the honour of speaking to miss gordon he asked  i am janet gordon said the woman stiffly  then i wish to talk with you and your brother  come in  she stepped aside and motioned him to a low brown door opening on the right  go in and sit down  ill call thomas she said coldly as she walked out through the hall  eric walked into the parlour and sat down as bidden  he found himself in the most oldfashioned room he had ever seen  the solidly made chairs and tables of some wood grown dark and polished with age made even mrs williamsons parlour set of horsehair seem extravagantly modern by contrast  the painted floor was covered with round braided rugs  on the centre table was a lamp a bible and some theological volumes contemporary with the squarerunged furniture  the walls wainscoted half way up in wood and covered for the rest with a dark diamond patterned paper were hung with faded engravings mostly of clericallooking bewigged personages in gowns and bands  but over the high undecorated black mantelpiece in a ruddy glow of sunset light striking through the window hung one which caught and held erics attention to the exclusion of everything else  it was the enlarged crayon photograph of a young girl and in spite of the crudity of execution it was easily the center of interest in the room  eric at once guessed that this must be the picture of margaret gordon for although quite unlike kilmenys sensitive spirited face in general there was a subtle unmistakable resemblance about brow and chin  the pictured face was a very handsome one suggestive of velvety dark eyes and vivid colouring but it was its expression rather than its beauty which fascinated eric  never had he seen a countenance indicative of more intense and stubborn will power margaret gordon was dead and buried the picture was a cheap and inartistic production in an impossible frame of gilt and plush yet the vitality in that face dominated its surroundings still what then must have been the power of such a personality in life  eric realized that this woman could and would have done whatsoever she willed unflinchingly and unrelentingly  she could stamp her desire on everything and everybody about her moulding them to her wish and will in their own despite and in defiance of all the resistance they might make  many things in kilmenys upbringing and temperament became clear to him  if that woman had told me i was ugly i should have believed her he thought  ay even though i had a mirror to contradict her  i should never have dreamed of disputing or questioning anything she might have said  the strange power in her face is almost uncanny peering out as it does from a mask of beauty and youthful curves  pride and stubbornness are its salient characteristics  well kilmeny does not at all resemble her mother in expression and only very slightly in feature  his reflections were interrupted by the entrance of thomas and janet gordon  the latter had evidently been called from his work  he nodded without speaking and the two sat gravely down before eric  i have come to see you with regard to your niece mr gordon he said abruptly realizing that there would be small use in beating about the bush with this grim pair  i met youri met neil gordon in the connors orchard and i found that he has told you that i have been meeting kilmeny there  he paused  thomas gordon nodded again but he did not speak and he did not remove his steady piercing eyes from the young mans flushed countenance  janet still sat in a sort of expectant immovability  i fear that you have formed an unfavourable opinion of me on this account mr gordon eric went on  but i hardly think i deserve it  i can explain the matter if you will allow me  i met your niece accidentally in the orchard three weeks ago and heard her play  i thought her music very wonderful and i fell into the habit of coming to the orchard in the evenings to hear it  i had no thought of harming her in any way mr gordon  i thought of her as a mere child and a child who was doubly sacred because of her affliction  but recently iiit occurred to me that i was not behaving quite honourably in encouraging her to meet me thus  yesterday evening i asked her to bring me here and introduce me to you and her aunt  we would have come then if you had been at home  as you were not we arranged to come tonight  i hope you will not refuse me the privilege of seeing your niece mr gordon said eric eagerly  i ask you to allow me to visit her here  but i do not ask you to receive me as a friend on my own recommendations only  i will give you referencesmen of standing in charlottetown and queenslea if you refer to them  i dont need to do that said thomas gordon quietly  i know more of you than you think master  i know your father well by reputation and i have seen him  i know you are a rich mans son whatever your whim in teaching a country school may be  since you have kept your own counsel about your affairs i supposed you didnt want your true position generally known and so i have held my tongue about you  i know no ill of you master and i think none now that i believe you were not beguiling kilmeny to meet you unknown to her friends of set purpose  but all this doesnt make you a suitable friend for her sirit makes you all the more unsuitable  the less she sees of you the better  eric almost started to his feet in an indignant protest but he swiftly remembered that his only hope of winning kilmeny lay in bringing thomas gordon to another way of thinking  he had got on better than he had expected so far he must not now jeopardize what he had gained by rashness or impatience  why do you think so mr gordon he asked regaining his selfcontrol with an effort  well plain speaking is best master  if you were to come here and see kilmeny often shed most likely come to think too much of you  i mistrust theres some mischief done in that direction already  then when you went away she might break her heartfor she is one of those who feel things deeply  she has been happy enough  i know folks condemn us for the way she has been brought up but they dont know everything  it was the best way for her all things considered  and we dont want her made unhappy master  but i love your niece and i want to marry her if i can win her love said eric steadily  he surprised them out of their self possession at last  both started and looked at him as if they could not believe the evidence of their ears  marry her marry kilmeny exclaimed thomas gordon incredulously  you cant mean it sir  why she is dumbkilmeny is dumb  that makes no difference in my love for her although i deeply regret it for her own sake answered eric  i can only repeat what i have already said mr gordon  i want kilmeny for my wife  the older man leaned forward and looked at the floor in a troubled fashion drawing his bushy eyebrows down and tapping the calloused tips of his fingers together uneasily  he was evidently puzzled by this unexpected turn of the conversation and in grave doubt what to say  what would your father say to all this master he queried at last  i have often heard my father say that a man must marry to please himself said eric with a smile  if he felt tempted to go back on that opinion i think the sight of kilmeny would convert him  but after all it is what i say that matters in this case isnt it mr gordon  i am well educated and not afraid of work i can make a home for kilmeny in a few years even if i have to depend entirely on my own resources  only give me the chance to win herthat is all i ask  i dont think it would do master said thomas gordon shaking his head  of course i dare say youyouhe tried to say love but scotch reserve balked stubbornly at the terrible wordyou think you like kilmeny now but you are only a ladand lads fancies change  mine will not eric broke in vehemently  it is not a fancy mr gordon  it is the love that comes once in a lifetime and once only  i may be but a lad but i know that kilmeny is the one woman in the world for me  there can never be any other oh im not speaking rashly or inconsiderately  i have weighed the matter well and looked at it from every aspect  and it all comes to thisi love kilmeny and i want what any decent man who loves a woman truly has the right to havethe chance to win her love in return  well thomas gordon drew a long breath that was almost a sigh maybeif you feel like that masteri dont knowthere are some things it isnt right to cross  perhaps we oughtntjanet woman what shall we say to him  janet gordon had hitherto spoken no word  she had sat rigidly upright on one of the old chairs under margaret gordons insistent picture with her knotted toilworn hands grasping the carved arms tightly and her eyes fastened on erics face  at first their expression had been guarded and hostile but as the conversation proceeded they lost this gradually and became almost kindly  now when her brother appealed to her she leaned forward and said eagerly  do you know that there is a stain on kilmenys birth master  i know that her mother was the innocent victim of a very sad mistake miss gordon  i admit no real stain where there was no conscious wrong doing  though for that matter even if there were it would be no fault of kilmenys and would make no difference to me as far as she is concerned  a sudden change swept over janet gordons face quite marvelous in the transformation it wrought  her grim mouth softened and a flood of repressed tenderness glorified her cold gray eyes  well then she said almost triumphantly since neither that nor her dumbness seems to be any drawback in your eyes i dont see why you should not have the chance you want  perhaps your world will say she is not good enough for you but she isshe isthis half defiantly  she is a sweet and innocent and truehearted lassie  she is bright and clever and she is not ill looking  thomas i say let the young man have his will  thomas gordon stood up as if he considered the responsibility off his shoulders and the interview at an end  very well janet woman since you think it is wise  and may god deal with him as he deals with her  good evening master ill see you again and you are free to come and go as suits you but i must go to my work now  i left my horses standing in the field  i will go up and send kilmeny down said janet quietly  she lighted the lamp on the table and left the room  a few minutes later kilmeny came down  eric rose and went to meet her eagerly but she only put out her right hand with a pretty dignity and while she looked into his face she did not look into his eyes  you see i was right after all kilmeny he said smiling  your uncle and aunt havent driven me away  on the contrary they have been very kind to me and they say i may see you whenever and wherever i like  she smiled and went over to the table to write on her slate  but they were very angry last night and said dreadful things to me  i felt very frightened and unhappy  they seemed to think i had done something terribly wrong  uncle thomas said he would never trust me out of his sight again  i could hardly believe it when aunt janet came up and told me you were here and that i might come down  she looked at me very strangely as she spoke but i could see that all the anger had gone out of her face  she seemed pleased and yet sad  but i am glad they have forgiven us  she did not tell him how glad she was and how unhappy she had been over the thought that she was never to see him again yesterday she would have told him all frankly and fully but for her yesterday was a lifetime awaya lifetime in which she had come into her heritage of womanly dignity and reserve  the kiss which eric had left on her lips the words her uncle and aunt had said to her the tears she had shed for the first time on a sleepless pillowall had conspired to reveal her to herself she did not yet dream that she loved eric marshall or that he loved her  but she was no longer the child to be made a dear comrade of  she was though quite unconsciously the woman to be wooed and won exacting with sweet innate pride her dues of allegiance    chapter xiii a sweeter woman neer drew breath  thenceforward eric marshall was a constant visitor at the gordon homestead  he soon became a favourite with thomas and janet especially the latter  he liked them both discovering under all their outward peculiarities sterling worth and fitness of character  thomas gordon was surprisingly well read and could floor eric any time in argument once he became sufficiently warmed up to attain fluency of words  eric hardly recognized him the first time he saw him thus animated  his bent form straightened his sunken eyes flashed his face flushed his voice rang like a trumpet and he poured out a flood of eloquence which swept erics smart uptodate arguments away like straws in the rush of a mountain torrent  eric enjoyed his own defeat enormously but thomas gordon was ashamed of being thus drawn out of himself and for a week afterwards confined his remarks to yes and no or at the outside to a brief statement that a change in the weather was brewing  janet never talked on matters of church and state such she plainly considered to be far beyond a womans province  but she listened with lurking interest in her eyes while thomas and eric pelted on each other with facts and statistics and opinions and on the rare occasions when eric scored a point she permitted herself a sly little smile at her brothers expense  of neil eric saw but little  the italian boy avoided him or if they chanced to meet passed him by with sullen downcast eyes eric did not trouble himself greatly about neil but thomas gordon understanding the motive which had led neil to betray his discovery of the orchard trysts bluntly told kilmeny that she must not make such an equal of neil as she had done  you have been too kind to the lad lassie and hes got presumptuous  he must be taught his place  i mistrust we have all made more of him than we should  but most of the idyllic hours of erics wooing were spent in the old orchard the garden end of it was now a wilderness of rosesroses red as the heart of a sunset roses pink as the early flush of dawn roses white as the snows on mountain peaks roses full blown and roses in buds that were sweeter than anything on earth except kilmenys face  their petals fell in silken heaps along the old paths or clung to the lush grasses among which eric lay and dreamed while kilmeny played to him on her violin  eric promised himself that when she was his wife her wonderful gift for music should be cultivated to the utmost  her powers of expression seemed to deepen and develop every day growing as her soul grew taking on new colour and richness from her ripening heart  to eric the days were all pages in an inspired idyl  he had never dreamed that love could be so mighty or the world so beautiful  he wondered if the universe were big enough to hold his joy or eternity long enough to live it out  his whole existence was for the time being bounded by that orchard where he wooed his sweetheart  all other ambitions and plans and hopes were set aside in the pursuit of this one aim the attainment of which would enhance all others a thousandfold the loss of which would rob all others of their reason for existence  his own world seemed very far away and the things of that world forgotten  his father on hearing that he had taken the lindsay school for a year had written him a testy amazed letter asking him if he were demented  or is there a girl in the case he wrote  there must be to tie you down to a place like lindsay for a year  take care master eric youve been too sensible all your life  a man is bound to make a fool of himself at least once and when you didnt get through with that in your teens it may be attacking you now  david also wrote expostulating more gravely but he did not express the suspicions eric knew he must entertain  good old david  he is quaking with fear that i am up to something he cant approve of but he wont say a word by way of attempting to force my confidence  it could not long remain a secret in lindsay that the master was going to the gordon place on courting thoughts intent  mrs williamson kept her own and erics counsel the gordons said nothing but the secret leaked out and great was the surprise and gossip and wonder  one or two incautious people ventured to express their opinion of the masters wisdom to the master himself but they never repeated the experiment  curiosity was rife  a hundred stories were circulated about kilmeny all greatly exaggerated in the circulation  wise heads were shaken and the majority opined that it was a great pity  the master was a likely young fellow he could have his pick of almost anybody you might think it was too bad that he should go and take up with that queer dumb niece of the gordons who had been brought up in such a heathenish way  but then you never could guess what way a mans fancy would jump when he set out to pick him a wife they guessed neil gordon didnt like it much  he seemed to have got dreadful moody and sulky of late and wouldnt sing in the choir any more  thus the buzz of comment and gossip ran  to those two in the old orchard it mattered not a whit  kilmeny knew nothing of gossip  to her lindsay was as much of an unknown world as the city of erics home  her thoughts strayed far and wide in the realm of her fancy but they never wandered out to the little realities that hedged her strange life around in that life she had blossomed out a fair unique thing  there were times when eric almost regretted that one day he must take her out of her white solitude to a world that in the last analysis was only lindsay on a larger scale with just the same pettiness of thought and feeling and opinion at the bottom of it he wished he might keep her to himself for ever in that old sprucehidden orchard where the roses fell  one day he indulged himself in the fulfillment of the whim he had formed when kilmeny had told him she thought herself ugly  he went to janet and asked her permission to bring a mirror to the house that he might have the privilege of being the first to reveal kilmeny to herself exteriorly  janet was somewhat dubious at first  there hasnt been such a thing in the house for sixteen years master  there never was but threeone in the spare room and a little one in the kitchen and margarets own  she broke them all the day it first struck her that kilmeny was going to be bonny  i might have got one after she died maybe  but i didnt think of it and theres no need of lasses to be always prinking at their looking glasses  but eric pleaded and argued skilfully and finally janet said  well well have your own way  youd have it anyway i think lad  you are one of those men who always get their own way  but that is different from the men who take their own wayand thats a mercy she added under her breath  eric went to town the next saturday and picked out a mirror that pleased him  he had it shipped to radnor and thomas gordon brought it home not knowing what it was for janet had thought it just as well he should not know  its a present the master is making kilmeny she told him  she sent kilmeny off to the orchard after tea and eric slipped around to the house by way of the main road and lane  he and janet together unpacked the mirror and hung it on the parlour wall  i never saw such a big one master said janet rather doubtfully as if after all she distrusted its gleaming pearly depth and richly ornamented frame  i hope it wont make her vain  she is very bonny but it may not do her any good to know it  it wont harm her said eric confidently  when a belief in her ugliness hasnt spoiled a girl a belief in her beauty wont  but janet did not understand epigrams  she carefully removed a little dust from the polished surface and frowned meditatively at the by no means beautiful reflection she saw therein  i cannot think what made kilmeny suppose she was ugly master  her mother told her she was said eric rather bitterly  ah janet shot a quick glance at the picture of her sister was that it  margaret was a strange woman master  i suppose she thought her own beauty had been a snare to her  she was bonny  that picture doesnt do her justice  i never liked it it was taken before she wasbefore she met ronald fraser  we none of us thought it very like her at the time  but master three years later it was like heroh it was like her then that very look came in her face  kilmeny doesnt resemble her mother remarked eric glancing at the picture with the same feeling of mingled fascination and distaste with which he always regarded it  does she look like her father  no not a great deal though some of her ways are very like his she looks like her grandmothermargarets mother master  her name was kilmeny too and she was a handsome sweet woman  i was very fond of my stepmother master  when she died she gave her baby to me and asked me to be a mother to it  ah well i tried but i couldnt fence the sorrow out of margarets life and it sometimes comes to my mind that maybe ill not be able to fence it out of kilmenys either  that will be my task said eric  youll do your best i do not doubt  but maybe it will be through you that sorrow will come to her after all  not through any fault of mine aunt janet  no no im not saying it will be your fault  but my heart misgives me at times  oh i dare say i am only a foolish old woman master  go your ways and bring your lass here to look at your plaything when you like  ill not make or meddle with it  janet betook herself to the kitchen and eric went to look for kilmeny  she was not in the orchard and it was not until he had searched for some time that he found her  she was standing under a beech tree in a field beyond the orchard leaning on the longer fence with her hands clasped against her cheek  in them she held a white marylily from the orchard  she did not run to meet him while he was crossing the pasture as she would once have done  she waited motionless until he was close to her  eric began half laughingly half tenderly to quote some lines from her namesake ballad      kilmeny kilmeny where have you been     long hae we sought baith holt and den     by linn by ford and greenwood tree     yet you are halesome and fair to see     where got you that joup o the lily sheen     that bonny snood o the birk sae green     and those roses the fairest that ever was seen     kilmeny kilmeny where have you been  only its a lily and not a rose you are carrying  i might go on and quote the next couplet too      kilmeny looked up with a lovely grace     but there was nae smile on kilmenys face  why are you looking so sober  kilmeny did not have her slate with her and could not answer but eric guessed from something in her eyes that she was bitterly contrasting the beauty of the ballads heroine with her own supposed ugliness  come down to the house kilmeny  i have something there to show yousomething lovelier than you have ever seen before he said with boyish pleasure shining in his eyes  i want you to go and put on that muslin dress you wore last sunday evening and pin up your hair the same way you did then  run alongdont wait for me  but you are not to go into the parlour until i come  i want to pick some of those marylilies up in the orchard  when eric returned to the house with an armful of the long stemmed white madonna lilies that bloomed in the orchard kilmeny was just coming down the steep narrow staircase with its striped carpeting of homespun drugget  her marvelous loveliness was brought out into brilliant relief by the dark wood work and shadows of the dim old hall  she wore a trailing clinging dress of some creamy tinted fabric that had been her mothers  it had not been altered in any respect for fashion held no sway at the gordon homestead and kilmeny thought that the dress left nothing to be desired  its quaint style suited her admirably the neck was slightly cut away to show the round white throat and the sleeves were long full bishops out of which her beautiful slender hands slipped like flowers from their sheaths  she had crossed her long braids at the back and pinned them about her head like a coronet a late white rose was fastened low down on the left side      a man had given all other bliss     and all his worldly wealth for this     to waste his whole heart in one kiss     upon her perfect lips  quoted eric in a whisper as he watched her descend  aloud he said  take these lilies on your arm letting their bloom fall against your shoulderso  now give me your hand and shut your eyes dont open them until i say you may  he led her into the parlour and up to the mirror  look he cried gaily  kilmeny opened her eyes and looked straight into the mirror where like a lovely picture in a golden frame she saw herself reflected  for a moment she was bewildered  then she realized what it meant  the lilies fell from her arm to the floor and she turned pale  with a little low involuntary cry she put her hands over her face  eric pulled them boyishly away  kilmeny do you think you are ugly now  this is a truer mirror than aunt janets silver sugar bowl  looklooklook  did you ever imagine anything fairer than yourself dainty kilmeny  she was blushing now and stealing shy radiant glances at the mirror  with a smile she took her slate and wrote naively  i think i am pleasant to look upon  i cannot tell you how glad i am  it is so dreadful to believe one is ugly  you can get used to everything else but you never get used to that  it hurts just the same every time you remember it  but why did mother tell me i was ugly  could she really have thought so perhaps i have become better looking since i grew up  i think perhaps your mother had found that beauty is not always a blessing kilmeny and thought it wiser not to let you know you possessed it  come let us go back to the orchard now  we mustnt waste this rare evening in the house  there is going to be a sunset that we shall remember all our lives  the mirror will hang here  it is yours  dont look into it too often though or aunt janet will disapprove  she is afraid it will make you vain  kilmeny gave one of her rare musical laughs which eric never heard without a recurrence of the old wonder that she could laugh so when she could not speak  she blew an airy little kiss at her mirrored face and turned from it smiling happily  on their way to the orchard they met neil  he went by them with an averted face but kilmeny shivered and involuntarily drew nearer to eric  i dont understand neil at all now she wrote nervously  he is not nice as he used to be and sometimes he will not answer when i speak to him  and he looks so strangely at me too besides he is surly and impertinent to uncle and aunt  dont mind neil said eric lightly  he is probably sulky because of some things i said to him when i found he had spied on us  that night before she went up stairs kilmeny stole into the parlour for another glimpse of herself in that wonderful mirror by the light of a dim little candle she carried  she was still lingering there dreamily when aunt janets grim face appeared in the shadows of the doorway  are you thinking about your own good looks lassie  ay but remember that handsome is as handsome does she said with grudging admirationfor the girl with her flushed cheeks and shining eyes was something that even dour janet gordon could not look upon unmoved  kilmeny smiled softly  ill try to remember she wrote but oh aunt janet i am so glad i am not ugly  it is not wrong to be glad of that is it  the older womans face softened  no i dont suppose it is lassie she conceded  a comely face is something to be thankful foras none know better than those who have never possessed it  i remember well when i was a girlbut that is neither here nor there  the master thinks you are wonderful bonny kilmeny she added looking keenly at the girl  kilmeny started and a scarlet blush scorched her face  that and the expression that flashed into her eyes told janet gordon all she wished to know  with a stifled sigh she bade her niece good night and went away  kilmeny ran fleetly up the stairs to her dim little room that looked out into the spruces and flung herself on her bed burying her burning face in the pillow  her aunts words had revealed to her the hidden secret of her heart  she knew that she loved eric marshalland the knowledge brought with it a strange anguish  for was she not dumb  all night she lay staring wideeyed through the darkness till the dawn    chapter xiv in her selfless mood  eric noticed a change in kilmeny at their next meetinga change that troubled him  she seemed aloof abstracted almost ill at ease  when he proposed an excursion to the orchard he thought she was reluctant to go  the days that followed convinced him of the change  something had come between them  kilmeny seemed as far away from him as if she had in truth like her namesake of the ballad sojourned for seven years in the land where the rain never fell and the wind never blew and had come back washed clean from all the affections of earth  eric had a bad week of it but he determined to put an end to it by plain speaking  one evening in the orchard he told her of his love  it was an evening in august with wheat fields ripening to their harvestrya soft violet night made for love with the distant murmur of an unquiet sea on a rocky shore sounding through it kilmeny was sitting on the old bench where he had first seen her she had been playing for him but her music did not please her and she laid aside the violin with a little frown  it might be that she was afraid to playafraid that her new emotions might escape her and reveal themselves in music  it was difficult to prevent this so long had she been accustomed to pour out all her feelings in harmony  the necessity for restraint irked her and made of her bow a clumsy thing which no longer obeyed her wishes  more than ever at that instant did she long for speechspeech that would conceal and protect where dangerous silence might betray  in a low voice that trembled with earnestness eric told her that he loved herthat he had loved her from the first time he had seen her in that old orchard  he spoke humbly but not fearfully for he believed that she loved him and he had little expectation of any rebuff  kilmeny will you be my wife he asked finally taking her hands in his  kilmeny had listened with averted face  at first she had blushed painfully but now she had grown very pale  when he had finished speaking and was waiting for her answer she suddenly pulled her hands away and putting them over her face burst into tears and noiseless sobs  kilmeny dearest have i alarmed you  surely you knew before that i loved you  dont you care for me  eric said putting his arm about her and trying to draw her to him  but she shook her head sorrowfully and wrote with compressed lips  yes i do love you but i will never marry you because i cannot speak  oh kilmeny said eric smiling for he believed his victory won that doesnt make any difference to meyou know it doesnt sweetest  if you love me that is enough  but kilmeny only shook her head again  there was a very determined look on her pale face  she wrote  no it is not enough  it would be doing you a great wrong to marry you when i cannot speak and i will not do it because i love you too much to do anything that would harm you  your world would think you had done a very foolish thing and it would be right  i have thought it all over many times since something aunt janet said made me understand and i know i am doing right i am sorry i did not understand sooner before you had learned to care so much  kilmeny darling you have taken a very absurd fancy into that dear black head of yours  dont you know that you will make me miserably unhappy all my life if you will not be my wife  no you think so now and i know you will feel very badly for a time  then you will go away and after awhile you will forget me and then you will see that i was right  i shall be very unhappy too but that is better than spoiling your life  do not plead or coax because i shall not change my mind  eric did plead and coax howeverat first patiently and smilingly as one might argue with a dear foolish child then with vehement and distracted earnestness as he began to realize that kilmeny meant what she said  it was all in vain  kilmeny grew paler and paler and her eyes revealed how keenly she was suffering  she did not even try to argue with him but only listened patiently and sadly and shook her head  say what he would entreat and implore as he might he could not move her resolution a hairsbreadth  yet he did not despair he could not believe that she would adhere to such a resolution he felt sure that her love for him would eventually conquer and he went home not unhappily after all  he did not understand that it was the very intensity of her love which gave her the strength to resist his pleading where a more shallow affection might have yielded  it held her back unflinchingly from doing him what she believed to be a wrong    chapter xv an old unhappy faroff thing  the next day eric sought kilmeny again and renewed his pleadings but again in vain  nothing he could say no argument which he could advance was of any avail against her sad determination when he was finally compelled to realize that her resolution was not to be shaken he went in his despair to janet gordon  janet listened to his story with concern and disappointment plainly visible on her face  when he had finished she shook her head  im sorry master  i cant tell you how sorry i am  i had hoped for something very different  hoped  i have prayed for it  thomas and i are getting old and it has weighed on my mind for yearswhat was to become of kilmeny when we would be gone since you came i had hoped she would have a protector in you but if kilmeny says she will not marry you i am afraid shell stick to it  but she loves me cried the young man and if you and her uncle speak to herurge herperhaps you can influence her  no master it wouldnt be any use  oh we will of course but it will not be any use  kilmeny is as determined as her mother when once she makes up her mind  she has always been good and obedient for the most part but once or twice we have found out that there is no moving her if she does resolve upon anything when her mother died thomas and i wanted to take her to church we could not prevail on her to go  we did not know why then but now i suppose it was because she believed she was so very ugly it is because she thinks so much of you that she will not marry you  she is afraid you would come to repent having married a dumb girl  maybe she is rightmaybe she is right  i cannot give her up said eric stubbornly  something must be done  perhaps her defect can be remedied even yet  have you ever thought of that  you have never had her examined by a doctor qualified to pronounce on her case have you  no master we never took her to anyone  when we first began to fear that she was never going to talk thomas wanted to take her to charlottetown and have her looked to  he thought so much of the child and he felt terrible about it  but her mother wouldnt hear of it being done  there was no use trying to argue with her  she said that it would be no usethat it was her sin that was visited on her child and it could never be taken away  and did you give in meekly to a morbid whim like that asked eric impatiently  master you didnt know my sister  we had to give innobody could hold out against her  she was a strange womanand a terrible woman in many waysafter her trouble  we were afraid to cross her for fear she would go out of her mind  but could you not have taken kilmeny to a doctor unknown to her mother  no that was not possible  margaret never let her out of her sight not even when she was grown up  besides to tell you the whole truth master we didnt think ourselves that it would be much use to try to cure kilmeny  it was a sin that made her as she is  aunt janet how can you talk such nonsense  where was there any sin  your sister thought herself a lawful wife  if ronald fraser thought otherwiseand there is no proof that he didhe committed a sin but you surely do not believe that it was visited in this fashion on his innocent child  no i am not meaning that master  that wasnt where margaret did wrong and though i never liked ronald fraser over much i must say this in his defencei believe he thought himself a free man when he married margaret  no its something elsesomething far worse  it gives me a shiver whenever i think of it  oh master the good book is right when it says the sins of the parents are visited on the children  there isnt a truer word in it than that from cover to cover  what in heavens name is the meaning of all this exclaimed eric  tell me what it is  i must know the whole truth about kilmeny  do not torment me  i am going to tell you the story master though it will be like opening an old wound  no living person knows it but thomas and me  when you hear it you will understand why kilmeny cant speak and why it isnt likely that there can ever be anything done for her  she doesnt know the truth and you must never tell her  it isnt a fit story for her ears especially when it is about her mother  promise me that you will never tell her no matter what may happen  i promise  go ongo on said the young man feverishly  janet gordon locked her hands together in her lap like a woman who nerves herself to some hateful task  she looked very old the lines on her face seemed doubly deep and harsh  my sister margaret was a very proud highspirited girl master but i would not have you think she was unlovable  no no that would be doing a great injustice to her memory  she had her faults as we all have but she was bright and merry and warmhearted  we all loved her  she was the light and life of this house  yes master before the trouble that came on her margaret was a winsome lass singing like a lark from morning till night  maybe we spoiled her a littlemaybe we gave her too much of her own way  well master you have heard the story of her marriage to ronald fraser and what came after so i need not go into that  i know or used to know elizabeth williamson well and i know that whatever she told you would be the truth and nothing more or less than the truth  our father was a very proud man  oh master if margaret was too proud she got it from no stranger  and her misfortune cut him to the heart  he never spoke a word to us here for more than three days after he heard of it  he sat in the corner there with bowed head and would not touch bite or sup  he had not been very willing for her to marry ronald fraser and when she came home in disgrace she had not set foot over the threshold before he broke out railing at her  oh i can see her there at the door this very minute master pale and trembling clinging to thomass arm her great eyes changing from sorrow and shame to wrath  it was just at sunset and a red ray came in at the window and fell right across her breast like a stain of blood  father called her a hard name master  oh he was too hard even though he was my father i must say he was too hard on her brokenhearted as she was and guilty of nothing more after all than a little willfulness in the matter of her marriage  and father was sorry for itoh master the word wasnt out of his mouth before he was sorry for it  but the mischief was done oh ill never forget margarets face master  it haunts me yet in the black of the night  it was full of anger and rebellion and defiance  but she never answered him back  she clenched her hands and went up to her old room without saying a word all those mad feelings surging in her soul and being held back from speech by her sheer stubborn will  and master never a word did margaret say from that day until after kilmeny was bornnot one word master  nothing we could do for her softened her  and we were kind to her master and gentle with her and never reproached her by so much as a look  but she would not speak to anyone  she just sat in her room most of the time and stared at the wall with such awful eyes  father implored her to speak and forgive him but she never gave any sign that she heard him  i havent come to the worst yet master  father sickened and took to his bed  margaret would not go in to see him  then one night thomas and i were watching by him it was about eleven oclock  all at once he said  janet go up and tell the lasshe always called margaret thatit was a kind of pet name he had for herthat im deein and ask her to come down and speak to me afore im gone  master i went  margaret was sitting in her room all alone in the cold and dark staring at the wall  i told her what our father had said  she never let on she heard me  i pleaded and wept master  i did what i had never done to any human creaturei kneeled to her and begged her as she hoped for mercy herself to come down and see our dying father  master she wouldnt  she never moved or looked at me  i had to get up and go downstairs and tell that old man she would not come  janet gordon lifted her hands and struck them together in her agony of remembrance  when i told father he only said oh so gently  poor lass i was too hard on her  she isna to blame  but i canna go to meet her mother till our little lass has forgien me for the name i called her  thomas help me up  since she winna come to me i must een go to her  there was no crossing himwe saw that  he got up from his deathbed and thomas helped him out into the hall and up the stair  i walked behind with the candle  oh master ill never forget itthe awful shadows and the storm wind wailing outside and fathers gasping breath  but we got him to margarets room and he stood before her trembling with his white hairs falling about his sunken face  and he prayed margaret to forgive him to forgive him and speak just one word to him before he went to meet her mother  masterjanets voice rose almost to a shriekshe would notshe would not  and yet she wanted to speakafterwards she confessed to me that she wanted to speak but her stubbornness wouldnt let her  it was like some evil power that had gripped hold of her and wouldnt let go  father might as well have pleaded with a graven image  oh it was hard and dreadful  she saw her father die and she never spoke the word he prayed for to him  that was her sin masterand for that sin the curse fell on her unborn child  when father understood that she would not speak he closed his eyes and was like to have fallen if thomas had not caught him  oh lass youre a hard woman was all he said  and they were his last words  thomas and i carried him back to his room but the breath was gone from him before we ever got him there  well master kilmeny was born a month afterwards and when margaret felt her baby at her breast the evil thing that had held her soul in its bondage lost its power  she spoke and wept and was herself again  oh how she wept  she implored us to forgive her and we did freely and fully  but the one against whom she had sinned most grievously was gone and no word of forgiveness could come to her from the grave  my poor sister never knew peace of conscience again master  but she was gentle and kind and humble untiluntil she began to fear that kilmeny was never going to speak  we thought then that she would go out of her mind  indeed master she never was quite right again  but that is the story and its a thankful woman i am that the telling of it is done  kilmeny cant speak because her mother wouldnt  eric had listened with a gray horror on his face to the gruesome tale  the black tragedy of it appalled himthe tragedy of that merciless law the most cruel and mysterious thing in gods universe which ordains that the sin of the guilty shall be visited on the innocent  fight against it as he would the miserable conviction stole into his heart that kilmenys case was indeed beyond the reach of any human skill  it is a dreadful tale he said moodily getting up and walking restlessly to and fro in the dim spruceshadowed old kitchen where they were  and if it is true that her mothers willful silence caused kilmenys dumbness i fear as you say that we cannot help her  but you may be mistaken  it may have been nothing more than a strange coincidence  possibly something may be done for her  at all events we must try  i have a friend in queenslea who is a physician  his name is david baker and he is a very skilful specialist in regard to the throat and voice  i shall have him come here and see kilmeny  have your way assented janet in the hopeless tone which she might have used in giving him permission to attempt any impossible thing  it will be necessary to tell dr baker why kilmeny cannot speakor why you think she cannot  janets face twitched  must that be master  oh its a bitter tale to tell a stranger  dont be afraid  i shall tell him nothing that is not strictly necessary to his proper understanding of the case  it will be quite enough to say that kilmeny may be dumb because for several months before her birth her mothers mind was in a very morbid condition and she preserved a stubborn and unbroken silence because of a certain bitter personal resentment  well do as you think best master  janet plainly had no faith in the possibility of anything being done for kilmeny  but a rosy glow of hope flashed over kilmenys face when eric told her what he meant to do  oh do you think he can make me speak she wrote eagerly  i dont know kilmeny  i hope that he can and i know he will do all that mortal skill can do  if he can remove your defect will you promise to marry me dearest  she nodded  the grave little motion had the solemnity of a sacred promise  yes she wrote when i can speak like other women i will marry you    chapter xvi david bakers opinion  the next week david baker came to lindsay  he arrived in the afternoon when eric was in school  when the latter came home he found that david had in the space of an hour captured mrs williamsons heart wormed himself into the good graces of timothy and become hailfellowwellmet with old robert  but he looked curiously at eric when the two young men found themselves alone in the upstairs room  now eric i want to know what all this is about  what scrape have you got into  you write me a letter entreating me in the name of friendship to come to you at once  accordingly i come post haste  you seem to be in excellent health yourself explain why you have inveigled me hither  i want you to do me a service which only you can do david said eric quietly  i didnt care to go into the details by letter  i have met in lindsay a young girl whom i have learned to love  i have asked her to marry me but although she cares for me she refuses to do so because she is dumb  i wish you to examine her and find out the cause of her defect and if it can be cured  she can hear perfectly and all her other faculties are entirely normal  in order that you may better understand the case i must tell you the main facts of her history  this eric proceeded to do  david baker listened with grave attention his eyes fastened on his friends face  he did not betray the surprise and dismay he felt at learning that eric had fallen in love with a dumb girl of doubtful antecedents and the strange case enlisted his professional interest  when he had heard the whole story he thrust his hands into his pockets and strode up and down the room several times in silence  finally he halted before eric  so you have done what i foreboded all along you would doleft your common sense behind you when you went courting  if i did said eric quietly i took with me something better and nobler than common sense  david shrugged his shoulders  youll have hard work to convince me of that eric  no it will not be difficult at all  i have one argument that will convince you speedilyand that is kilmeny gordon herself but we will not discuss the matter of my wisdom or lack of it just now  what i want to know is thiswhat do you think of the case as i have stated it to you  david frowned thoughtfully  i hardly know what to think  it is very curious and unusual but it is not totally unprecedented  there have been cases on record where prenatal influences have produced a like result  i cannot just now remember whether any were ever cured  well ill see if anything can be done for this girl  i cannot express any further opinion until i have examined her  the next morning eric took david up to the gordon homestead  as they approached the old orchard a strain of music came floating through the resinous morning arcades of the spruce wooda wild sorrowful appealing cry full of indescribable pathos yet marvelously sweet  what is that exclaimed david starting  that is kilmeny playing on her violin answered eric  she has great talent in that respect and improvises wonderful melodies  when they reached the orchard kilmeny rose from the old bench to meet them her lovely luminous eyes distended her face flushed with the excitement of mingled hope and fear  oh ye gods muttered david helplessly  he could not hide his amazement and eric smiled to see it  the latter had not failed to perceive that his friend had until now considered him as little better than a lunatic  kilmeny this is my friend dr baker he said  kilmeny held out her hand with a smile  her beauty as she stood there in the fresh morning sunshine beside a clump of her sister lilies was something to take away a mans breath  david who was by no means lacking in confidence and generally had a ready tongue where women were concerned found himself as mute and awkward as a school boy as he bowed over her hand  but kilmeny was charmingly at ease  there was not a trace of embarrassment in her manner though there was a pretty shyness eric smiled as he recalled his first meeting with her  he suddenly realized how far kilmeny had come since then and how much she had developed  with a little gesture of invitation kilmeny led the way through the orchard to the wild cherry lane and the two men followed  eric she is simply unutterable said david in an undertone last night to tell you the truth i had a rather poor opinion of your sanity  but now i am consumed with a fierce envy  she is the loveliest creature i ever saw  eric introduced david to the gordons and then hurried away to his school  on his way down the gordon lane he met neil and was half startled by the glare of hatred in the italian boys eyes  pity succeeded the momentary alarm  neils face had grown thin and haggard his eyes were sunken and feverishly bright he looked years older than on the day when eric had first seen him in the brook hollow  prompted by sudden compassionate impulse eric stopped and held out his hand  neil cant we be friends he said  i am sorry if i have been the cause of inflicting pain on you  friends  never said neil passionately  you have taken kilmeny from me  i shall hate you always  and ill be even with you yet  he strode fiercely up the lane and eric with a shrug of his shoulders went on his way dismissing the meeting from his mind  the day seemed interminably long to him  david had not returned when he went home to dinner but when he went to his room in the evening he found his friend there staring out of the window  well he said impatiently as david wheeled around but still kept silence what have you to say to me  dont keep me in suspense any longer david  i have endured all i can  today has seemed like a thousand years  have you discovered what is the matter with kilmeny  there is nothing the matter with her answered david slowly flinging himself into a chair by the window  what do you mean  just exactly what i say  her vocal organs are all perfect  as far as they are concerned there is absolutely no reason why she should not speak  then why cant she speak  do you thinkdo you think  i think that i cannot express my conclusion in any better words than janet gordon used when she said that kilmeny cannot speak because her mother wouldnt  that is all there is to it  the trouble is psychological not physical  medical skill is helpless before it  there are greater men than i in my profession but it is my honest belief eric that if you were to consult them they would tell you just what i have told you neither more nor less  then there is no hope said eric in a tone of despair  you can do nothing for her  david took from the back of his chair a crochet antimacassar with a lion rampant in the center and spread it over his knee  i can do nothing for her he said scowling at that work of art  i do not believe any living man can do anything for her but i do not sayexactlythat there is no hope  come david i am in no mood for guessing riddles  speak plainly man and dont torment me  david frowned dubiously and poked his finger through the hole which represented the eye of the king of beasts  i dont know that i can make it plain to you  it isnt very plain to myself  and it is only a vague theory of mine of course  i cannot substantiate it by any facts  in short eric i think it is possible that kilmeny may speak sometimeif she ever wants it badly enough  wants to  why man she wants to as badly as it is possible for any one to want anything  she loves me with all her heart and she wont marry me because she cant speak  dont you suppose that a girl under such circumstances would want to speak as much as any one could  yes but i do not mean that sort of wanting no matter how strong the wish may be  what i do mean isa sudden vehement passionate inrush of desire physical psychical mental all in one mighty enough to rend asunder the invisible fetters that hold her speech in bondage  if any occasion should arise to evoke such a desire i believe that kilmeny would speakand having once spoken would thenceforth be normal in that respectay if she spoke but the one word  all this sounds like great nonsense to me said eric restlessly  i suppose you have an idea what you are talking about but i havent  and in any case it practically means that there is no hope for heror me  even if your theory is correct it is not likely such an occasion as you speak of will ever arise  and kilmeny will never marry me  dont give up so easily old fellow  there have been cases on record where women have changed their minds  not women like kilmeny said eric miserably  i tell you she has all her mothers unfaltering will and tenacity of purpose although she is free from any taint of pride or selfishness  i thank you for your sympathy and interest david  you have done all you couldbut heavens what it would have meant to me if you could have helped her  with a groan eric flung himself on a chair and buried his face in his hands  it was a moment which held for him all the bitterness of death  he had thought that he was prepared for disappointment he had not known how strong his hope had really been until that hope was utterly taken from him  david with a sigh returned the crochet antimacassar carefully to its place on the chair back  eric last night to be honest i thought that if i found i could not help this girl it would be the best thing that could happen as far as you were concerned  but since i have seen herwell i would give my right hand if i could do anything for her  she is the wife for you if we could make her speak yes and by the memory of your motherdavid brought his fist down on the window sill with a force that shook the casementshe is the wife for you speech or no speech if we could only convince her of it  she cannot be convinced of that  no david i have lost her did you tell her what you have told me  i told her i could not help her  i did not say anything to her of my theorythat would have done no good  how did she take it  very bravely and quietlylike a winsome lady  but the look in her eyeseric i felt as if i had murdered something  she bade me goodbye with a pitiful smile and went upstairs  i did not see her again although i stayed to dinner as her uncles request  those old gordons are a queer pair  i liked them though  they are strong and staunchgood friends bitter enemies  they were sorry that i could not help kilmeny but i saw plainly that old thomas gordon thought that i had been meddling with predestination in attempting it  eric smiled mechanically  i must go up and see kilmeny  youll excuse me wont you david  my books are therehelp yourself  but when eric reached the gordon house he saw only old janet who told him that kilmeny was in her room and refused to see him  she thought you would come up and she left this with me to give you master  janet handed him a little note  it was very brief and blotted with tears  do not come any more eric it ran  i must not see you because it would only make it harder for us both  you must go away and forget me  you will be thankful for this some day  i shall always love and pray for you                                                        kilmeny  i must see her said eric desperately  aunt janet be my friend  tell her she must see me for a little while at least  janet shook her head but went upstairs  she soon returned  she says she cannot come down  you know she means it master and it is of no use to coax her  and i must say i think she is right  since she will not marry you it is better for her not to see you  eric was compelled to go home with no better comfort than this in the morning as it was sunday he drove david baker to the station  he had not slept and he looked so miserable and reckless that david felt anxious about him  david would have stayed in lindsay for a few days but a certain critical case in queenslea demanded his speedy return  he shook hands with eric on the station platform  eric give up that school and come home at once  you can do no good in lindsay now and youll only eat your heart out here  i must see kilmeny once more before i leave was all erics answer  that afternoon he went again to the gordon homestead  but the result was the same kilmeny refused to see him and thomas gordon said gravely  master you know i like you and i am sorry kilmeny thinks as she does though maybe she is right  i would be glad to see you often for your own sake and ill miss you much but as things are i tell you plainly youd better not come here any more  it will do no good and the sooner you and she get over thinking about each other the better for you both  go now lad and god bless you  do you know what it is you are asking of me said eric hoarsely  i know i am asking a hard thing for your own good master  it is not as if kilmeny would ever change her mind  we have had some experience with a womans will ere this  tush janet woman dont be weeping  you women are foolish creatures  do you think tears can wash such things away  no they cannot blot out sin or the consequences of sin  its awful how one sin can spread out and broaden till it eats into innocent lives sometimes long after the sinner has gone to his own accounting master if you take my advice youll give up the lindsay school and go back to your own world as soon as may be    chapter xvii a broken fetter  eric went home with a white haggard face  he had never thought it was possible for a man to suffer as he suffered then  what was he to do  it seemed impossible to go on with lifethere was no life apart from kilmeny  anguish wrung his soul until his strength went from him and youth and hope turned to gall and bitterness in his heart  he never afterwards could tell how he lived through the following sunday or how he taught school as usual on monday  he found out how much a man may suffer and yet go on living and working  his body seemed to him an automaton that moved and spoke mechanically while his tortured spirit pentup within endured pain that left its impress on him for ever  out of that fiery furnace of agony eric marshall was to go forth a man who had put boyhood behind him for ever and looked out on life with eyes that saw into it and beyond  on tuesday afternoon there was a funeral in the district and according to custom the school was closed  eric went again to the old orchard  he had no expectation of seeing kilmeny there for he thought she would avoid the spot lest she might meet him but he could not keep away from it although the thought of it was an added torment and he vibrated between a wild wish that he might never see it again and a sick wonder how he could possibly go away and leave itthat strange old orchard where he had met and wooed his sweetheart watching her develop and blossom under his eyes like some rare flower until in the space of three short months she had passed from exquisite childhood into still more exquisite womanhood  as he crossed the pasture field before the spruce wood he came upon neil gordon building a longer fence  neil did not look up as eric passed but sullenly went on driving poles  before this eric had pitied neil now he was conscious of feeling sympathy with him  had neil suffered as he was suffering  eric had entered into a new fellowship whereof the passport was pain  the orchard was very silent and dreamy in the thick deep tinted sunshine of the september afternoon a sunshine which seemed to possess the power of extracting the very essence of all the odours which summer has stored up in wood and field  there were few flowers now most of the lilies which had queened it so bravely along the central path a few days before were withered the grass had become ragged and sere and unkempt  but in the corners the torches of the goldenrod were kindling and a few misty purple asters nodded here and there  the orchard kept its own strange attractiveness as some women with youth long passed still preserve an atmosphere of remembered beauty and innate indestructible charm  eric walked drearily and carelessly about it and finally sat down on a half fallen fence panel in the shadow of the overhanging spruce boughs  there he gave himself up to a reverie poignant and bitter sweet in which he lived over again everything that had passed in the orchard since his first meeting there with kilmeny  so deep was his abstraction that he was conscious of nothing around him  he did not hear stealthy footsteps behind him in the dim spruce wood  he did not even see kilmeny as she came slowly around the curve of the wild cherry lane  kilmeny had sought the old orchard for the healing of her heartbreak if healing were possible for her  she had no fear of encountering eric there at that time of day for she did not know that it was the district custom to close the school for a funeral  she would never have gone to it in the evening but she longed for it continually it and her memories were all that was left her now  years seemed to have passed over the girl in those few days  she had drunk of pain and broken bread with sorrow  her face was pale and strained with bluish transparent shadows under her large wistful eyes out of which the dream and laughter of girlhood had gone but into which had come the potent charm of grief and patience  thomas gordon had shaken his head bodingly when he had looked at her that morning at the breakfast table  she wont stand it he thought  she isnt long for this world  maybe it is all for the best poor lass  but i wish that young master had never set foot in the connors orchard or in this house  margaret margaret its hard that your child should have to be paying the reckoning of a sin that was sinned before her birth  kilmeny walked through the lane slowly and absently like a woman in a dream  when she came to the gap in the fence where the lane ran into the orchard she lifted her wan drooping face and saw eric sitting in the shadow of the wood at the other side of the orchard with his bowed head in his hands  she stopped quickly and the blood rushed wildly over her face  the next moment it ebbed leaving her white as marble  horror filled her eyesblank deadly horror as the livid shadow of a cloud might fill two blue pools  behind eric neil gordon was standing tense crouched murderous even at that distance kilmeny saw the look on his face saw what he held in his hand and realized in one agonized flash of comprehension what it meant  all this photographed itself in her brain in an instant  she knew that by the time she could run across the orchard to warn eric by a touch it would be too late  yet she must warn himshe mustshe must  a mighty surge of desire seemed to rise up within her and overwhelm her like a wave of the seaa surge that swept everything before it in an irresistible flood  as neil gordon swiftly and vindictively with the face of a demon lifted the axe he held in his hand kilmeny sprang forward through the gap  eric eric look behind youlook behind you  eric started up confused bewildered as the voice came shrieking across the orchard  he did not in the least realize that it was kilmeny who had called to him but he instinctively obeyed the command  he wheeled around and saw neil gordon who was looking not at him but past him at kilmeny  the italian boys face was ashen and his eyes were filled with terror and incredulity as if he had been checked in his murderous purpose by some supernatural interposition  the axe lying at his feet where he had dropped it in his unutterable consternation on hearing kilmenys cry told the whole tale  but before eric could utter a word neil turned with a cry more like that of an animal than a human being and fled like a hunted creature into the shadow of the spruce wood  a moment later kilmeny her lovely face dewed with tears and sunned over with smiles flung herself on erics breast  oh eric i can speaki can speak  oh it is so wonderful eric i love youi love you    chapter xviii neil gordon solves his own problem  it is a miracle said thomas gordon in an awed tone  it was the first time he had spoken since eric and kilmeny had rushed in hand in hand like two children intoxicated with joy and wonder and gasped out their story together to him and janet  oh no it is very wonderful but it is not a miracle said eric  david told me it might happen  i had no hope that it would  he could explain it all to you if he were here  thomas gordon shook his head  i doubt if he could masterhe or any one else  it is near enough to a miracle for me  let us thank god reverently and humbly that he has seen fit to remove his curse from the innocent  your doctors may explain it as they like lad but im thinking they wont get much nearer to it than that  it is awesome that is what it is  janet woman i feel as if i were in a dream can kilmeny really speak  indeed i can uncle said kilmeny with a rapturous glance at eric  oh i dont know how it came to mei felt that i must speakand i did  and it is so easy nowit seems to me as if i could always have done it  she spoke naturally and easily  the only difficulty which she seemed to experience was in the proper modulation of her voice occasionally she pitched it too highagain too low  but it was evident that she would soon acquire perfect control of it  it was a beautiful voicevery clear and soft and musical  oh i am so glad that the first word i said was your name dearest she murmured to eric  what about neil asked thomas gordon gravely rousing himself with an effort from his abstraction of wonder  what are we to do with him when he returns  in one way this is a sad business  eric had almost forgotten about neil in his overwhelming amazement and joy  the realization of his escape from sudden and violent death had not yet had any opportunity to take possession of his thoughts  we must forgive him mr gordon  i know how i should feel towards a man who took kilmeny from me  it was an evil impulse to which he gave way in his sufferingand think of the good which has resulted from it  that is true master but it does not alter the terrible fact that the boy had murder in his heartthat he would have killed you  an overruling providence has saved him from the actual commission of the crime and brought good out of evil but he is guilty in thought and purpose  and we have cared for him and instructed him as our ownwith all his faults we have loved him it is a hard thing and i do not see what we are to do  we cannot act as if nothing had happened  we can never trust him again  but neil gordon solved the problem himself  when eric returned that night he found old robert williamson in the pantry regaling himself with a lunch of bread and cheese after a trip to the station  timothy sat on the dresser in black velvet state and gravely addressed himself to the disposal of various tidbits that came his way  good night master  glad to see youre looking more like yourself  i told the wife it was only a lovers quarrel most like  shes been worrying about you but she didnt like to ask you what was the trouble  she aint one of them unfortunate folks who cant be happy athout theyre everlasting poking their noses into other peoples business  but what kind of a rumpus was kicked up at the gordon place tonight master  eric looked amazed  what could robert williamson have heard so soon  what do you mean he asked  why us folks at the station knew there must have been a todo of some kind when neil gordon went off on the harvest excursion the way he did  neil gone  on the harvest excursion exclaimed eric  yes sir  you know this was the night the excursion train left they cross on the boat tonightspecial trip  there was a dozen or so fellows from hereabouts went  we was all standing around chatting when lincoln frame drove up full speed and neil jumped out of his rig  just bolted into the office got his ticket and out again and on to the train without a word to any one and as black looking as the old scratch himself  we was all too surprised to speak till he was gone  lincoln couldnt give us much information  he said neil had rushed up to their place about dark looking as if the constable was after him and offered to sell that black filly of his to lincoln for sixty dollars if lincoln would drive him to the station in time to catch the excursion train  the filly was neils own and lincoln had been wanting to buy her but neil would never hear to it afore  lincoln jumped at the chance  neil had brought the filly with him and lincoln hitched right up and took him to the station  neil hadnt no luggage of any kind and wouldnt open his mouth the whole way up lincoln says  we concluded him and old thomas must have had a row  dye know anything about it  or was you so wrapped up in sweethearting that you didnt hear or see nothing else  eric reflected rapidly  he was greatly relieved to find that neil had gone  he would never return and this was best for all concerned  old robert must be told a part of the truth at least since it would soon become known that kilmeny could speak  there was some trouble at the gordon place tonight mr williamson he said quietly  neil gordon behaved rather badly and frightened kilmeny terriblyso terribly that a very surprising thing has happened  she has found herself able to speak and can speak perfectly  old robert laid down the piece of cheese he was conveying to his mouth on the point of a knife and stared at eric in blank amazement  god bless my soul master what an extraordinary thing he ejaculated  are you in earnest  or are you trying to see how much of a fool you can make of the old man  no mr williamson i assure you it is no more than the simple truth dr baker told me that a shock might cure herand it has  as for neil he has gone no doubt for good and i think it well that he has  not caring to discuss the matter further eric left the kitchen but as he mounted the stairs to his room he heard old robert muttering like a man in hopeless bewilderment  well i never heard anything like this in all my born daysnevernever  timothy did you ever hear the like  them gordons are an unaccountable lot and no mistake  they couldnt act like other people if they tried  i must wake mother up and tell her about this or ill never be able to sleep    chapter xix victor from vanquished issues  now that everything was settled eric wished to give up teaching and go back to his own place  true he had signed papers to teach the school for a year but he knew that the trustees would let him off if he procured a suitable substitute  he resolved to teach until the fall vacation which came in october and then go  kilmeny had promised that their marriage should take place in the following spring  eric had pleaded for an earlier date but kilmeny was sweetly resolute and thomas and janet agreed with her  there are so many things that i must learn yet before i shall be ready to be married kilmeny had said  and i want to get accustomed to seeing people  i feel a little frightened yet whenever i see any one i dont know although i dont think i show it  i am going to church with uncle and aunt after this and to the missionary society meetings  and uncle thomas says that he will send me to a boarding school in town this winter if you think it advisable  eric vetoed this promptly  the idea of kilmeny in a boarding school was something that could not be thought about without laughter  i cant see why she cant learn all she needs to learn after she is married to me just as well as before he grumbled to her uncle and aunt  but we want to keep her with us for another winter yet explained thomas gordon patiently  we are going to miss her terrible when she does go master  she has never been away from us for a dayshe is all the brightness there is in our lives it is very kind of you to say that she can come home whenever she likes but there will be a great difference  she will belong to your world and not to ours  that is for the bestand we wouldnt have it otherwise  but let us keep her as our own for this one winter yet  eric yielded with the best grace he could muster  after all he reflected lindsay was not so far from queenslea and there were such things as boats and trains  have you told your father about all this yet asked janet anxiously  no he had not  but he went home and wrote a full account of his summer to old mr marshall that night  mr marshall senior answered the letter in person  a few days later eric coming home from school found his father sitting in mrs williamsons prim fleckless parlour  nothing was said about erics letter however until after tea  when they found themselves alone mr marshall said abruptly  eric what about this girl  i hope you havent gone and made a fool of yourself  it sounds remarkably like it  a girl that has been dumb all her lifea girl with no right to her fathers namea country girl brought up in a place like lindsay  your wife will have to fill your mothers placeand your mother was a pearl among women  do you think this girl is worthy of it  it isnt possible  youve been led away by a pretty face and dairy maid freshness  i expected some trouble out of this freak of yours coming over here to teach school  wait until you see kilmeny father said eric smiling  humph  thats just exactly what david baker said  i went straight to him when i got your letter for i knew that there was some connection between it and that mysterious visit of his over here concerning which i never could drag a word out of him by hook or crook  and all he said was wait until you see kilmeny gordon sir  well i will wait till i see her but i shall look at her with the eyes of sixtyfive mind you not the eyes of twentyfour  and if she isnt what your wife ought to be sir you give her up or paddle your own canoe  i shall not aid or abet you in making a fool of yourself and spoiling your life  eric bit his lip but only said quietly  come with me father  we will go to see her now  they went around by way of the main road and the gordon lane kilmeny was not in when they reached the house  she is up in the old orchard master said janet  she loves that place so much she spends all her spare time there  she likes to go there to study  they sat down and talked awhile with thomas and janet  when they left mr marshall said  i like those people  if thomas gordon had been a man like robert williamson i shouldnt have waited to see your kilmeny but they are all rightrugged and grim but of good stock and pithnative refinement and strong character  but i must say candidly that i hope your young lady hasnt got her aunts mouth  kilmenys mouth is like a lovesong made incarnate in sweet flesh said eric enthusiastically  humph said mr marshall  well he added more tolerantly a moment later i was a poet too for six months in my life when i was courting your mother  kilmeny was reading on the bench under the lilac trees when they reached the orchard  she stood up and came shyly forward to meet them guessing who the tall whitehaired old gentleman with eric must be  as she approached eric saw with a thrill of exultation that she had never looked lovelier  she wore a dress of her favourite blue simply and quaintly made as all her gowns were revealing the perfect lines of her lithe slender figure  her glossy black hair was wound about her head in a braided coronet against which a spray of wild asters shone like pale purple stars  her face was flushed delicately with excitement  she looked like a young princess crowned with a ruddy splash of sunlight that fell through the old trees  father this is kilmeny said eric proudly  kilmeny held out her hand with a shyly murmured greeting  mr marshall took it and held it in his looking so steadily and piercingly into her face that even her frank gaze wavered before the intensity of his keen old eyes  then he drew her to him and kissed her gravely and gently on her white forehead  my dear he said i am glad and proud that you have consented to be my sons wifeand my very dear and honoured daughter  eric turned abruptly away to hide his emotion and on his face was a light as of one who sees a great glory widening and deepening down the vista of his future  the end
