sans souci  autour de mon chapeau  on alexandrinesa letter to some country cousins  on a medal of george the fourth  strange to say on club paper  the last sketch     roundabout papers     on a lazy idle boy   i had occasion to pass a week in the autumn in the little old town of coire or chur in the grisons where lies buried that very ancient british king saint and martyr lucius who founded the church of st peter on cornhill few people note the church nowadays and fewer ever heard of the saint in the cathedral at chur his statue appears surrounded by other sainted persons of his family with tight red breeches a roman habit a curly brown beard and a neat little gilt crown and sceptre he stands a very comely and cheerful image and from what i may call his peculiar position with regard to cornhill i beheld this figure of st lucius with more interest than i should have bestowed upon personages who hierarchically are i dare say his superiors        stow quotes the inscription still extant from the table      fast chained in st peters church cornhill and says he      was after some chronicle buried at london and after some      chronicle buried at glowcesterbut oh these incorrect      chroniclers when alban butler in the lives of the      saints v xii and murrays handbook and the sacristan      at chur all say lucius was killed there and i saw his tomb      with my own eyes  the pretty little city stands so to speak at the end of the worldof the world of today the world of rapid motion and rushing railways and the commerce and intercourse of men from the northern gate the iron road stretches away to zurich to basle to paris to home from the old southern barriers before which a little river rushes and around which stretch the crumbling battlements of the ancient town the road bears the slow diligence or lagging vetturino by the shallow rhine through the awful gorges of the via mala and presently over the splugen to the shores of como  i have seldom seen a place more quaint pretty calm and pastoral than this remote little chur what need have the inhabitants for walls and ramparts except to build summerhouses to trail vines and hang clothes to dry on them no enemies approach the great mouldering gates only at morn and even the cows come lowing past them the village maidens chatter merrily round the fountains and babble like the evervoluble stream that flows under the old walls the schoolboys with book and satchel in smart uniforms march up to the gymnasium and return thence at their stated time there is one coffeehouse in the town and i see one old gentleman goes to it there are shops with no customers seemingly and the lazy tradesmen look out of their little windows at the single stranger sauntering by there is a stall with baskets of queer little black grapes and apples and a pretty brisk trade with half a dozen urchins standing round but beyond this there is scarce any talk or movement in the street theres nobody at the bookshop if you will have the goodness to come again in an hour says the banker with his mouthful of dinner at one oclock you can have the money there is nobody at the hotel save the good landlady the kind waiters the brisk young cook who ministers to you nobody is in the protestant churchoh strange sight the two confessions are here at peacenobody in the catholic church until the sacristan from his snug abode in the cathedral close espies the traveller eying the monsters and pillars before the old sharktoothed arch of his cathedral and comes out with a view to remuneration possibly and opens the gate and shows you the venerable church and the queer old relics in the sacristy and the ancient vestments a black velvet cope amongst other robes as fresh as yesterday and presented by that notorious pervert henry of navarre and france and the statue of st lucius who built st peters church on cornhill  what a quiet kind quaint pleasant pretty old town has it been asleep these hundreds and hundreds of years and is the brisk young prince of the sidereal realms in his screaming car drawn by his snorting steel elephant coming to waken it time was when there must have been life and bustle and commerce here those vast venerable walls were not made to keep out cows but menatarms led by fierce captains who prowled about the gates and robbed the traders as they passed in and out with their bales their goods their packhorses and their wains is the place so dead that even the clergy of the different denominations cant quarrel why seven or eight or a dozen or fifteen hundred years ago they havent the register at st peters up to that remote period i dare say it was burnt in the fire of londona dozen hundred years ago when there was some life in the town st lucius was stoned here on account of theological differences after founding our church in cornhill  there was a sweet pretty river walk we used to take in the evening and mark the mountains round glooming with a deeper purple the shades creeping up the golden walls the river brawling the cattle calling the maids and chatterboxes round the fountains babbling and bawling and several times in the course of our sober walks we overtook a lazy slouching boy or hobbledehoy with a rusty coat and trousers not too long and big feet trailing lazily one after the other and large lazy hands dawdling from out the tight sleeves and in the lazy hands a little book which my lad held up to his face and which i dare say so charmed and ravished him that he was blind to the beautiful sights around him unmindful i would venture to lay any wager of the lessons he had to learn for tomorrow forgetful of mother waiting supper and father preparing a scoldingabsorbed utterly and entirely in his book  what was it that so fascinated the young student as he stood by the river shore not the pons asinorum what book so delighted him and blinded him to all the rest of the world so that he did not care to see the applewoman with her fruit or more tempting still to sons of eve the pretty girls with their apple cheeks who laughed and prattled round the fountain what was the book do you suppose it was livy or the greek grammar no it was a novel that you were reading you lazy not very clean goodfornothing sensible boy it was dartagnan locking up general monk in a box or almost succeeding in keeping charles the firsts head on it was the prisoner of the chateau dif cutting himself out of the sack fifty feet under water i mention the novels i like best myselfnovels without love or talking or any of that sort of nonsense but containing plenty of fighting escaping robbery and rescuingcutting himself out of the sack and swimming to the island of monte cristo o dumas o thou brave kind gallant old alexandre i hereby offer thee homage and give thee thanks for many pleasant hours i have read thee being sick in bed for thirteen hours of a happy day and had the ladies of the house fighting for the volumes be assured that lazy boy was reading dumas or i will go so far as to let the reader here pronounce the eulogium or insert the name of his favorite author and as for the anger or it may be the reverberations of his schoolmaster or the remonstrances of his father or the tender pleadings of his mother that he should not let the supper grow coldi dont believe the scapegrace cared one fig no figs are sweet but fictions are sweeter  have you ever seen a score of whitebearded whiterobed warriors or grave seniors of the city seated at the gate of jaffa or beyrout and listening to the storyteller reciting his marvels out of antar or the arabian nights i was once present when a young gentleman at table put a tart away from him and said to his neighbor the younger son with rather a fatuous air i never eat sweets  not eat sweets and do you know why says t  because i am past that kind of thing says the young gentleman  because you are a glutton and a sot cries the elder and juvenis winces a little all people who have natural healthy appetites love sweets all children all women all eastern people whose tastes are not corrupted by gluttony and strong drink and a plateful of raspberries and cream disappeared before the philosopher  you take the allegory novels are sweets all people with healthy literary appetites love themalmost all womena vast number of clever hardheaded men why one of the most learned physicians in england said to me only yesterday i have just read soandso for the second time naming one of joness exquisite fictions judges bishops chancellors mathematicians are notorious novelreaders as well as young boys and sweet girls and their kind tender mothers who has not read about eldon and how he cried over novels every night when he was not at whist  as for that lazy naughty boy at chur i doubt whether he will like novels when he is thirty years of age he is taking too great a glut of them now he is eating jelly until he will be sick he will know most plots by the time he is twenty so that he will never be surprised when the stranger turns out to be the rightful earlwhen the old waterman throwing off his beggarly gabardine shows his stars and the collars of his various orders and clasping antonia to his bosom proves himself to be the prince her longlost father he will recognize the novelists same characters though they appear in redheeled pumps and ailesdepigeon or the garb of the nineteenth century he will get weary of sweets as boys of private schools grow or used to grow for i have done growing some little time myself and the practice may have ended tooas private schoolboys used to grow tired of the pudding before their mutton at dinner  and pray what is the moral of this apologue the moral i take to be this the appetite for novels extending to the end of the world far away in the frozen deep the sailors reading them to one another during the endless nightfar away under the syrian stars the solemn sheikhs and elders hearkening to the poet as he recites his tales far away in the indian camps where the soldiers listen to s tales or s after the hot days march far away in little chur yonder where the lazy boy pores over the fond volume and drinks it in with all his eyesthe demand being what we know it is the merchant must supply it as he will supply saddles and pale ale for bombay or calcutta  but as surely as the cadet drinks too much pale ale it will disagree with him and so surely dear youth will too much novels cloy on thee i wonder do novelwriters themselves read many novels if you go into gunters you dont see those charming young ladies to whom i present my most respectful compliments eating tarts and ices but at the proper eventide they have good plain wholesome tea and breadandbutter can anybody tell me does the author of the tale of two cities read novels does the author of the tower of london devour romances does the dashing harry lorrequer delight in plain or ringlets or sponges sporting tour does the veteran from whose flowing pen we had the books which delighted our young days darnley and richelieu and delorme relish the works of alexandre the great and thrill over the three musqueteers does the accomplished author of the caxtons read the other tales in blackwood for example that ghoststory printed last august and which for my part though i read it in the public readingroom at the pavilion hotel at folkestone i protest frightened me so that i scarce dared look over my shoulder does uncle tom admire adam bede and does the author of the vicar of wrexhill laugh over the warden and the the three clerks dear youth of ingenuous countenance and ingenuous pudor i make no doubt that the eminent parties above named all partake of novels in moderationeat jelliesbut mainly nourish themselves upon wholesome roast and boiled        by the way what a strange fate is that which befell the      veteran novelist  he was appointed her majestys consul      general in venice the only city in europe where the famous      two cavaliers cannot by any possibility be seen riding      together  here dear youth aforesaid our cornhill magazine owners strive to provide thee with facts as well as fiction and though it does not become them to brag of their ordinary at least they invite thee to a table where thou shalt sit in good company that story of the fox was written by one of the gallant seamen who sought for poor franklin under the awful arctic night that account of china is told by the man of all the empire most likely to know of what he speaks those pages regarding volunteers come from an honored hand that has borne the sword in a hundred famous fields and pointed the british guns in the greatest siege in the world        the search for sir john franklin  from the private      journal of an officer of the fox        the chinese and the outer barbarians  by sir john      bowring        our volunteers  by sir john burgoyne  shall we point out others we are fellowtravellers and shall make acquaintance as the voyage proceeds in the atlantic steamers on the first day out and on highand holydays subsequently the jellies set down on table are richly ornamented medioque in fonte leporum rise the american and british flags nobly emblazoned in tin as the passengers remark this pleasing phenomenon the captain no doubt improves the occasion by expressing a hope to his right and left that the flag of mr bull and his younger brother may always float side by side in friendly emulation novels having been previously compared to jellieshere are two one perhaps not entirely saccharine and flavored with an amari aliquid very distasteful to some palatestwo novels under two flags the one that ancient ensign which has hung before the wellknown booth of vanity fair the other that fresh and handsome standard which has lately been hoisted on barchester towers pray sir or madam to which dish will you be helped        lovel the widower and framley parsonage  so have i seen my friends captain lang and captain comstock press their guests to partake of the fare on that memorable first day out when there is no man i think who sits down but asks a blessing on his voyage and the good ship dips over the bar and bounds away into the blue water     on two children in black   montaigne and howels letters are my bedside books if i wake at night i have one or other of them to prattle me to sleep again they talk about themselves for ever and dont weary me i like to hear them tell their old stories over and over again i read them in the dozy hours and only half remember them i am informed that both of them tell coarse stories i dont heed them it was the custom of their time as it is of highlanders and hottentots to dispense with a part of dress which we all wear in cities but people cant afford to be shocked either at cape town or at inverness every time they meet an individual who wears his national airy raiment i never knew the arabian nights was an improper book until i happened once to read it in a family edition well qui sexcuse    who pray has accused me as yet here am i smothering dear good old mrs grundys objections before she has opened her mouth i love i say and scarcely ever tire of hearing the artless prattle of those two dear old friends the perigourdin gentleman and the priggish little clerk of king charless council their egotism in nowise disgusts me i hope i shall always like to hear men in reason talk about themselves what subject does a man know better if i stamp on a friends corn his outcry is genuinehe confounds my clumsiness in the accents of truth he is speaking about himself and expressing his emotion of grief or pain in a manner perfectly authentic and veracious i have a story of my own of a wrong done to me by somebody as far back as the year 1838 whenever i think of it and have had a couple of glasses of wine i cannot help telling it the toe is stamped upon the pain is just as keen as ever i cry out and perhaps utter imprecatory language i told the story only last wednesday at dinner  mr roundabout says a lady sitting by me how comes it that in your books there is a certain class it may be of men or it may be of women but that is not the question in pointhow comes it dear sir there is a certain class of persons whom you always attack in your writings and savagely rush at goad poke toss up in the air kick and trample on  i couldnt help myself i knew i ought not to do it i told her the whole story between the entrees and the roast the wound began to bleed again the horrid pang was there as keen and as fresh as ever if i live half as long as tithonus that crack across my heart can never be cured there are wrongs and griefs that cant be mended it is all very well of you my dear mrs g to say that this spirit is unchristian and that we ought to forgive and forget and so forth how can i forget at will how forgive i can forgive the occasional waiter who broke my beautiful old decanter at that very dinner i am not going to do him any injury but all the powers on earth cant make that claretjug whole        tithonus by tennyson had appeared in the preceding      the 2nd number of the cornhill magazine  so you see i told the lady the inevitable story i was egotistical i was selfish no doubt but i was natural and was telling the truth you say you are angry with a man for talking about himself it is because you yourself are selfish that that other persons self does not interest you be interested by other people and with their affairs let them prattle and talk to you as i do my dear old egotists just mentioned when you have had enough of them and sudden hazes come over your eyes lay down the volume pop out the candle and dormez bien i should like to write a nightcap booka book that you can muse over that you can smile over that you can yawn overa book of which you can say well this man is so and so and so and so but he has a friendly heart although some wiseacres have painted him as black as bogey and you may trust what he says i should like to touch you sometimes with a reminiscence that shall waken your sympathy and make you say io anche have so thought felt smiled suffered now how is this to be done except by egotism linea recta brevissima that right line i is the very shortest simplest straightforwardest means of communication between us and stands for what it is worth and no more sometimes authors say the present writer has often remarked or the undersigned has observed or mr roundabout presents his compliments to the gentle reader and begs to state c but i is better and straighter than all these grimaces of modesty and although these are roundabout papers and may wander who knows whither i shall ask leave to maintain the upright and simple perpendicular when this bundle of egotisms is bound up together as they may be one day if no accident prevents this tongue from wagging or this ink from running they will bore you very likely so it would to read through howels letters from beginning to end or to eat up the whole of a ham but a slice on occasion may have a relish a dip into the volume at random and so on for a page or two and now and then a smile and presently a gape and the book drops out of your hand and so bon soir and pleasant dreams to you i have frequently seen men at clubs asleep over their humble servants works and am always pleased even at a lecture i dont mind if they dont snore only the other day when my friend a said youve left off that roundabout business i see very glad you have i joined in the general roar of laughter at the table i dont care a fig whether archilochus likes the papers or no you dont like partridge archilochus or porridge or what not try some other dish i am not going to force mine down your throat or quarrel with you if you refuse it once in america a clever and candid woman said to me at the close of a dinner during which i had been sitting beside her mr roundabout i was told i should not like you and i dont well maam says i in a tone of the most unfeigned simplicity i dont care and we became good friends immediately and esteemed each other ever after  so my dear archilochus if you come upon this paper and say fudge and pass on to another i for one shall not be in the least mortified if you say what does he mean by calling this paper on two children in black when theres nothing about people in black at all unless the ladies he met and evidently bored at dinner were black women what is all this egotistical pother a plague on his is my dear fellow if you read montaignes essays you must own that he might call almost any one by the name of any other and that an essay on the moon or an essay on green cheese would be as appropriate a title as one of his on coaches on the art of discoursing or experience or what you will besides if i have a subject and i have i claim to approach it in a roundabout manner  you remember balzacs tale of the peau de chagrin and how every time the possessor used it for the accomplishment of some wish the fairy peau shrank a little and the owners life correspondingly shortened i have such a desire to be well with my public that i am actually giving up my favorite story i am killing my goose i know i am i cant tell my story of the children in black after this after printing it and sending it through the country when they are gone to the printers these little things become public property i take their hands i bless them i say goodby my little dears i am quite sorry to part with them but the fact is i have told all my friends about them already and dont dare to take them about with me any more  now every word is true of this little anecdote and i submit that there lies in it a most curious and exciting little mystery i am like a man who gives you the last bottle of his 25 claret it is the pride of his cellar he knows it and he has a right to praise it he takes up the bottle fashioned so slenderlytakes it up tenderly cants it with care places it before his friends declares how good it is with honest pride and wishes he had a hundred dozen bottles more of the same wine in his cellar si quid novisti c i shall be very glad to hear from you i protest and vow i am giving you the best i have  well who those little boys in black were i shall never probably know to my dying day they were very pretty little men with pale faces and large melancholy eyes and they had beautiful little hands and little boots and the finest little shirts and black paletots lined with the richest silk and they had picturebooks in several languages english and french and german i remember two more aristocraticlooking little men i never set eyes on they were travelling with a very handsome pale lady in mourning and a maidservant dressed in black too and on the ladys face there was the deepest grief the little boys clambered and played about the carriage and she sat watching it was a railwaycarriage from frankfort to heidelberg  i saw at once that she was the mother of those children and going to part from them perhaps i have tried parting with my own and not found the business very pleasant perhaps i recollect driving down with a certain trunk and carpetbag on the box with my own mother to the end of the avenue where we waitedonly a few minutesuntil the whirring wheels of that defiance coach were heard rolling towards us as certain as death twang goes the horn up goes the trunk down come the steps bah i see the autumn evening i hear the wheels now i smart the cruel smart again and boy or man have never been able to bear the sight of people parting from their children  i thought these little men might be going to school for the first time in their lives and mamma might be taking them to the doctor and would leave them with many fond charges and little wistful secrets of love bidding the elder to protect his younger brother and the younger to be gentle and to remember to pray to god always for his mother who would pray for her boy too our party made friends with these young ones during the little journey but the poor lady was too sad to talk except to the boys now and again and sat in her corner pale and silently looking at them  the next day we saw the lady and her maid driving in the direction of the railwaystation without the boys the parting had taken place then that night they would sleep among strangers the little beds at home were vacant and poor mother might go and look at them well tears flow and friends part and mothers pray every night all over the world i dare say we went to see heidelberg castle and admired the vast shattered walls and quaint gables and the neckar running its bright course through that charming scene of peace and beauty and ate our dinner and drank our wine with relish the poor mother would eat but little abendessen that night and as for the childrenthat first night at schoolhard bed hard words strange boys bullying and laughing and jarring you with their hateful merrimentas for the first night at a strange school we most of us remember what that is and the first is not the worst my boys theres the rub but each man has his share of troubles and i suppose you must have yours  from heidelberg we went to badenbaden and i dare say saw madame de schlangenbad and madame de la cruchecassee and count punter and honest captain blackball and whom should we see in the evening but our two little boys walking on each side of a fierce yellowfaced bearded man we wanted to renew our acquaintance with them and they were coming forward quite pleased to greet us but the father pulled back one of the little men by his paletot gave a grim scowl and walked away i can see the children now looking rather frightened away from us and up into the fathers face or the cruel uncleswhich was he i think he was the father so this was the end of them not school as i at first had imagined the mother was gone who had given them the heaps of pretty books and the pretty studs in the shirts and the pretty silken clothes and the tendertender cares and they were handed to this scowling practitioner of trente et quarante ah this is worse than school poor little men poor mother sitting by the vacant little beds we saw the children once or twice after always in scowlers company but we did not dare to give each other any marks of recognition  from baden we went to basle and thence to lucerne and so over the st gothard into italy from milan we went to venice and now comes the singular part of my story in venice there is a little court of which i forget the name but in it is an apothecarys shop whither i went to buy some remedy for the bites of certain animals which abound in venice crawling animals skipping animals and humming flying animals all three will have at you at once and one night nearly drove me into a straitwaistcoat well as i was coming out of the apothecarys with the bottle of spirits of hartshorn in my hand it really does do the bites a great deal of good whom should i light upon but one of my little heidelbergbaden boys  i have said how handsomely they were dressed as long as they were with their mother when i saw the boy at venice who perfectly recognized me his only garb was a wretched yellow cotton gown his little feet on which i had admired the little shiny boots were without shoe or stocking he looked at me ran to an old hag of a woman who seized his hand and with her he disappeared down one of the thronged lanes of the city  from venice we went to trieste the vienna railway at that time was only opened as far as laybach and the magnificent semmering pass was not quite completed at a station between laybach and graetz one of my companions alighted for refreshment and came back to the carriage saying  theres that horrible man from baden with the two little boys  of course we had talked about the appearance of the little boy at venice and his strange altered garb my companion said they were pale wretchedlooking and dressed quite shabbily  i got out at several stations and looked at all the carriages i could not see my little men from that day to this i have never set eyes on them that is all my story who were they what could they be how can you explain that mystery of the mother giving them up of the remarkable splendor and elegance of their appearance while under her care of their barefooted squalor in venice a month afterwards of their shabby habiliments at laybach had the father gambled away his money and sold their clothes how came they to have passed out of the hands of a refined lady as she evidently was with whom i first saw them into the charge of quite a common woman like her with whom i saw one of the boys at venice here is but one chapter of the story can any man write the next or that preceding the strange one on which i happened to light who knows the mystery may have some quite simple solution i saw two children attired like little princes taken from their mother and consigned to other care and a fortnight afterwards one of them barefooted and like a beggar who will read this riddle of the two children in black     on ribbons   the uncle of the present sir louis n bonaparte kg c inaugurated his reign as emperor over the neighboring nation by establishing an order to which all citizens of his country military naval and civilall men most distinguished in science letters arts and commercewere admitted the emblem of the order was but a piece of ribbon more or less long or broad with a toy at the end of it the bourbons had toys and ribbons of their own blue black and allcolored and on their return to dominion such good old tories would naturally have preferred to restore their good old orders of saint louis saint esprit and saint michel but france had taken the ribbon of the legion of honor so to her heart that no bourbon sovereign dared to pluck it thence  in england until very late days we have been accustomed rather to poohpooh national orders to vote ribbons and crosses tinsel gewgaws foolish foreign ornaments and so forth it is known how the great duke the breast of whose own coat was plastered with some halfhundred decorations was averse to the wearing of ribbons medals clasps and the like by his army we have all of us read how uncommonly distinguished lord castlereagh looked at vienna where he was the only gentleman present without any decoration whatever and the great dukes theory was that clasps and ribbons stars and garters were good and proper ornaments for himself for the chief officers of his distinguished army and for gentlemen of high birth who might naturally claim to wear a band of garter blue across their waistcoats but that for common people your plain coat without stars and ribbons was the most sensible wear  and no doubt you and i are as happy as free as comfortable we can walk and dine as well we can keep the winters cold out as well without a star on our coats as without a feather in our hats how often we have laughed at the absurd mania of the americans for dubbing their senators members of congress and states representatives honorable we have a right to call our privy councillors right honorable our lords sons honorable and so forth but for a nation as numerous well educated strong rich civilized free as our own to dare to give its distinguished citizens titles of honormonstrous assumption of lowbred arrogance and parvenu vanity our titles are respectable but theirs absurd mr jones of london a chancellors son and a tailors grandson is justly honorable and entitled to be lord jones at his noble fathers decease but mr brown the senator from new york is a silly upstart for tacking honorable to his name and our sturdy british good sense laughs at him who has not laughed i have myself at honorable nahum dodge honorable zeno scudder honorable hiram boake and the rest a score of such queer names and titles i have smiled at in america and mutato nomine i meet a born idiot who is a peer and born legislator this drivelling noodle and his descendants through life are your natural superiors and mineyour and my childrens superiors i read of an alderman kneeling and knighted at court i see a goldstick waddling backwards before majesty in a procession and if we laugh dont you suppose the americans laugh too  yes stars garters orders knighthoods and the like are folly yes bobus citizen and soapboiler is a good man and no one laughs at him or good mrs bobus as they have their dinner at one oclock but who will not jeer at sir thomas on a melting day and lady bobus at margate eating shrimps in a donkeychaise yes knighthood is absurd and chivalry an idiotic superstition and sir walter manny was a zany and nelson with his flaming stars and cordons splendent upon a day of battle was a madman and murat with his crosses and orders at the head of his squadrons charging victorious was only a crazy mountebank who had been a tavernwaiter and was puffed up with absurd vanity about his dress and legs and the men of the french line at fontenoy who told messieurs de la garde to fire first were smirking french dancingmasters and the black prince waiting upon his royal prisoner was acting an inane masquerade and chivalry is naught and honor is humbug and gentlemanhood is an extinct folly and ambition is madness and desire of distinction is criminal vanity and glory is bosh and fair fame is idleness and nothing is true but two and two and the color of all the world is drab and all men are equal and one man is as tall as another and one man is as good as anotherand a great dale betther as the irish philosopher said  is this so titles and badges of honor are vanity and in the american revolution you have his excellency general washington sending back and with proper spirit sending back a letter in which he is not addressed as excellency and general titles are abolished and the american republic swarms with men claiming and bearing them you have the french soldier cheered and happy in his dying agony and kissing with frantic joy the chiefs hand who lays the little cross on the bleeding bosom at home you have the dukes and earls jobbing and intriguing for the garter the military knights grumbling at the civil knights of the bath the little ribbon eager for the collar the soldiers and seamen from india and the crimea marching in procession before the queen and receiving from her hands the cross bearing her royal name and remember there are not only the cross wearers but all the fathers and friends all the women who have prayed for their absent heroes harrys wife and toms mother and jacks daughter and franks sweetheart each of whom wears in her heart of hearts afterwards the badge which son father lover has won by his merit each of whom is made happy and proud and is bound to the country by that little bit of ribbon  i have heard in a lecture about george the third that at his accession the king had a mind to establish an order for literary men it was to have been called the order of minervai suppose with an owl for a badge the knights were to have worn a star of sixteen points and a yellow ribbon and good old samuel johnson was talked of as president or grand cross or grand owl of the society now about such an order as this there certainly may be doubts consider the claimants the difficulty of settling their claims the rows and squabbles amongst the candidates and the subsequent decision of posterity dr beattie would have ranked as first poet and twenty years after the sublime mr hayley would no doubt have claimed the grand cross mr gibbon would not have been eligible on account of his dangerous freethinking opinions and her sex as well as her republican sentiments might have interfered with the knighthood of the immortal mrs catharine macaulay how goldsmith would have paraded the ribbon at madame cornelyss or the academy dinner how peter pindar would have railed at it fifty years later the noble scott would have worn the grand cross and deserved it but gifford would have had it and byron and shelley and hazlitt and hunt would have been without it and had keats been proposed as officer how the tory prints would have yelled with rage and scorn had the star of minerva lasted to our present timebut i pause not because the idea is dazzling but too awful fancy the claimants and the row about their precedence which philosopher shall have the grand cordonwhich the collarwhich the little scrap no bigger than a buttercup of the historiansa sayand c and f and g and s and twhich shall be companion and which grand owl of the poets who wears or claims the largest and brightest star of the novelists there is a and b and c d and e star of first magnitude newly discovered and f a magazine of wit and fair g and h and i and brave old j and charming k and l and m and n and o fair twinklers and i am puzzled between three pspeacock miss pardoe and paul pryand queechy and r and s and t mere et fils and very likely u o gentle reader for who has not written his novel nowadayswho has not a claim to the star and strawcolored ribbonand who shall have the biggest and largest fancy the struggle fancy the squabble fancy the distribution of prizes  who shall decide on them shall it be the sovereign shall it be the minister for the time being and has lord palmerston made a deep study of novels in this matter the late ministry to be sure was better qualified but even then grumblers who had not got their canary cordons would have hinted at professional jealousies entering the cabinet and the ribbons being awarded jack would have scowled at his because dick had a broader one ned been indignant because bobs was as large tom would have thrust his into the drawer and scorned to wear it at all nono the socalled literary world was well rid of minerva and her yellow ribbon the great poets would have been indifferent the little poets jealous the funny men furious the philosophers satirical the historians supercilious and finally the jobs without end say ingenuity and cleverness are to be rewarded by state tokens and prizesand take for granted the order of minerva is establishedwho shall have it a great philosopher no doubt we cordially salute him gcm a great historian gcm of course a great engineer gcm a great poet received with acclamation gcm a great painter oh certainly gcm if a great painter why not a great novelist well pass great novelist gcm but if a poetic a pictorial a storytelling or musiccomposing artist why not a singing artist why not a bassoprofondo why not a primo tenore and if a singer why should not a balletdancer come bounding on the stage with his cordon and cut capers to the music of a row of decorated fiddlers a chemist puts in his claim for having invented a new color an apothecary for a new pill the cook for a new sauce the tailor for a new cut of trousers we have brought the star of minerva down from the breast to the pantaloons stars and garters can we go any farther or shall we give the shoe maker the yellow ribbon of the order for his shoetie        that of lord derby in 1859 which included mr disraeli      and sir edward bulwer lytton  when i began this present roundabout excursion i think i had not quite made up my mind whether we would have an order of all the talents or not perhaps i rather had a hankering for a rich ribbon and gorgeous star in which my family might like to see me at parties in my best waistcoat but then the door opens and there come in and by the same right too sir alexis soyer sir alessandro tamburini sir agostino velluti sir antonio paganini violinist sir sandy mcguffog piper to the most noble the marquis of farintosh sir alcide flicflac premier danseur of h m theatre sir harley quin and sir joseph grimaldi from covent garden they have all the yellow ribbon they are all honorable and clever and distinguished artists let us elbow through the rooms make a bow to the lady of the house give a nod to sir george thrum who is leading the orchestra and go and get some champagne and seltzerwater from sir richard gunter who is presiding at the buffet a national decoration might be well and good a token awarded by the country to all its benemerentibus but most gentlemen with minerva stars would i think be inclined to wear very wide breastcollars to their coats suppose yourself brother penman decorated with this ribbon and looking in the glass would you not laugh would not wife and daughters laugh at that canarycolored emblem  but suppose a man old or young of figure ever so stout thin stumpy homely indulging in lookingglass reflections with that hideous ribbon and cross called v c on his coat would he not be proud and his family would they not be prouder for your nobleman there is the famous old blue garter and star and welcome if i were a marquisif i had thirtyforty thousand a year settle the sum my dear alnaschar according to your liking i should consider myself entitled to my seat in parliament and to my garter the garter belongs to the ornamental classes have you seen the new magnificent pavo spicifer at the zoological gardens and do you grudge him his jewelled coronet and the azure splendor of his waistcoat i like my lord mayor to have a gilt coach my magnificent monarch to be surrounded by magnificent nobles i huzzay respectfully when they pass in procession it is good for mr briefless 50 pump court fourth floor that there should be a lord chancellor with a gold robe and fifteen thousand a year it is good for a poor curate that there should be splendid bishops at fulham and lambeth their lordships were poor curates once and have won so to speak their ribbon is a man who puts into a lottery to be sulky because he does not win the twenty thousand pounds prize am i to fall into a rage and bully my family when i come home after going to see chatsworth or windsor because we have only two little drawingrooms welcome to your garter my lord and shame upon him qui mal y pense  so i arrive in my roundabout way near the point towards which i have been trotting ever since we set out  in a voyage to america some nine years since on the seventh or eighth day out from liverpool captain l came to dinner at eight bells as usual talked a little to the persons right and left of him and helped the soup with his accustomed politeness then he went on deck and was back in a minute and operated on the fish looking rather grave the while  then he went on deck again and this time was absent it may be three or five minutes during which the fish disappeared and the entrees arrived and the roast beef say ten minutes passedi cant tell after nine years  then l came down with a pleased and happy countenance this time and began carving the sirloin we have seen the light he said madam may i help you to a little gravy or a little horseradish or what not  i forget the name of the light nor does it matter it was a point off newfoundland for which he was on the lookout and so well did the canada know where she was that between soup and beef the captain had sighted the headland by which his course was lying  and so through storm and darkness through fog and midnight the ship had pursued her steady way over the pathless ocean and roaring seas so surely that the officers who sailed her knew her place within a minute or two and guided us with a wonderful providence safe on our way since the noble cunard company has run its ships but one accident and that through the error of a pilot has happened on the line  by this little incident hourly of course repeated and trivial to all seagoing people i own i was immensely moved and never can think of it but with a heart full of thanks and awe we trust our lives to these seamen and how nobly they fulfil their trust they are under heaven as a providence for us whilst we sleep their untiring watchfulness keeps guard over us all night through that bell sounds at its season and tells how our sentinels defend us it rang when the amazon was on fire and chimed its heroic signal of duty and courage and honor think of the dangers these seamen undergo for us the hourly peril and watch the familiar storm the dreadful iceberg the long winter nights when the decks are as glass and the sailor has to climb through icicles to bend the stiff sail on the yard think of their courage and their kindnesses in cold in tempest in hunger in wreck the women and children to the boats says the captain of the birkenhead and with the troops formed on the deck and the crew obedient to the word of glorious command the immortal ship goes down read the story of the sarah sands   sarah sands  the screw steamship sarah sands 1330 registered tons was chartered by the east india company in the autumn of 1858 for the conveyance of troops to india she was commanded by john squire castle she took out a part of the 54th regiment upwards of 350 persons besides the wives and children of some of the men and the families of some of the officers all went well till the 11th november when the ship had reached lat 14 s long 56 e upwards of 400 miles from the mauritius  between three and four p m on that day a very strong smell of fire was perceived arising from the afterdeck and upon going below into the hold captain castle found it to be on fire and immense volumes of smoke arising from it endeavors were made to reach the seat of the fire but in vain the smoke and heat were too much for the men there was however no confusion every order was obeyed with the same coolness and courage with which it was given the engine was immediately stopped all sail was taken in and the ship brought to the wind so as to drive the smoke and fire which was in the afterpart of the ship astern others were at the same time getting firehoses fitted and passed to the scene of the fire the fire however continued to increase and attention was directed to the ammunition contained in the powdermagazines which were situated one on each side the ship immediately above the fire the starboard magazine was soon cleared but by this time the whole of the afterpart of the ship was so much enveloped in smoke that it was scarcely possible to stand and great fears were entertained on account of the port magazine volunteers were called for and came immediately and under the guidance of lieutenant hughes attempted to clear the port magazine which they succeeded in doing with the exception as was supposed of one or two barrels it was most dangerous work the men became overpowered with the smoke and heat and fell and several while thus engaged were dragged up by ropes senseless  the flames soon burst up through the deck and running rapidly along the various cabins set the greater part on fire  in the meantime captain castle took steps for lowering the boats there was a heavy gale at the time but they were launched without the least accident the soldiers were mustered on deckthere was no rush to the boats and the men obeyed the word of command as if on parade the men were informed that captain castle did not despair of saving the ship but that they must be prepared to leave her if necessary the women and children were lowered into the port lifeboat under the charge of mr very third officer who had orders to keep clear of the ship until recalled  captain castle then commenced constructing rafts of spare spars in a short time three were put together which would have been capable of saving a great number of those on board two were launched overboard and safely moored alongside and then a third was left across the deck forward ready to be launched  in the meantime the fire had made great progress the whole of the cabins were one body of fire and at about 830 p m flames burst through the upper deck and shortly after the mizzen rigging caught fire fears were entertained of the ship paying off in which case the flames would have been swept forwards by the wind but fortunately the afterbraces were burnt through and the mainyard swung round which kept the ships head to wind about nine p m a fearful explosion took place in the port magazine arising no doubt from the one or two barrels of powder which it had been impossible to remove by this time the ship was one body of flame from the stern to the main rigging and thinking it scarcely possible to save her captain castle called major brett then in command of the troops for the colonel was in one of the boats forward and telling him that he feared the ship was lost requested him to endeavor to keep order amongst the troops till the last but at the same time to use every exertion to check the fire providentially the iron bulkhead in the afterpart of the ship withstood the action of the flames and here all efforts were concentrated to keep it cool  no person says the captain can describe the manner in which the men worked to keep the fire back one party were below keeping the bulkhead cool and when several were dragged up senseless fresh volunteers took their places who were however soon in the same state at about ten p m the maintopsailyard took fire mr welch one quartermaster and four or five soldiers went aloft with wet blankets and succeeded in extinguishing it but not until the yard and mast were nearly burnt through the work of fighting the fire below continued for hours and about midnight it appeared that some impression was made and after that the men drove it back inch by inch until daylight when they had completely got it under the ship was now in a frightful plight the afterpart was literally burnt outmerely the shell remainingthe port quarter blown out by the explosion fifteen feet of water in the hold  the gale still prevailed and the ship was rolling and pitching in a heavy sea and taking in large quantities of water abaft the tanks too were rolling from side to side in the hold  as soon as the smoke was partially cleared away captain castle got spare sails and blankets aft to stop the leak passing two hawsers round the stern and setting them up the troops were employed baling and pumping this continued during the whole morning  in the course of the day the ladies joined the ship the boats were ordered alongside but they found the sea too heavy to remain there the gig had been abandoned during the night and the crew under mr wood fourth officer had got into another of the boats the troops were employed the remainder of the day baling and pumping and the crew securing the stern all hands were employed during the following night baling and pumping the boats being moored alongside where they received some damage at daylight on the 13th the crew were employed hoisting time boats the troops were working manfully baling and pumping latitude at noon 13 deg 12 min south at five p m the foresail and foretopsail were set the rafts were cut away and the ship bore for the mauritius on thursday the 19th she sighted the island of rodrigues and arrived at mauritius on monday the 23rd   the nile and trafalgar are not more glorious to our country are not greater victories than these won by our merchantseamen and if you look in the captains reports of any maritime register you will see similar acts recorded every day i have such a volume for last year now lying before me in the second number as i open it at hazard captain roberts master of the ship empire from shields to london reports how on the 14th ult the 14th december 1859 he being off whitby discovered the ship to be on fire between the main hold and boilers got the hose from the engine laid on and succeeded in subduing the fire but only apparently for at seven the next morning the dudgeon bearing sse seven miles distance the fire again broke out causing the ship to be enveloped in flames on both sides of midships got the hose again into play and all hands to work with buckets to combat with the fire did not succeed in stopping it till four p m to effect which were obliged to cut away the deck and top sides and throw overboard part of the cargo the vessel was very much damaged and leaky determined to make for the humber ship was run on shore on the mud near grimsby harbor with five feet of water in her hold the donkeyengine broke down the water increased so fast as to put out the furnace fires and render the ship almost unmanageable on the tide flowing a tug towed the ship off the mud and got her into grimsby to repair  on the 2nd of november captain strickland of the purchase brigantine from liverpool to yarmouth u s encountered heavy gales from wnw to wsw in lat 43 deg n long 34 deg w in which we lost jib foretopmast staysail topsail and carried away the foretopmast stays bobstays and bowsprit headsails cutwater and stern also started the wood ends which caused the vessel to leak put her before the wind and sea and hove about twentyfive tons of cargo overboard to lighten the ship forward slung myself in a bowline and by means of thrusting 2 12inch rope in the opening contrived to stop a great portion of the leak  december 16ththe crew continuing night and day at the pumps could not keep the ship free deemed it prudent for the benefit of those concerned to bear up for the nearest port on arriving in lat 48 deg 45 n long 23 deg w observed a vessel with a signal of distress flying made towards her when she proved to be the barque carleton waterlogged the captain and crew asked to be taken off hove to and received them on board consisting of thirteen men and their ship was abandoned we then proceeded on our course the crew of the abandoned vessel assisting all they could to keep my ship afloat we arrived at cork harbor on the 27th ult  captain coulson master of the brig othello reports that his brig foundered off portland december 27encountering a strong gale and shipping two heavy seas in succession which hove the ship on her beamends observing no chance of saving the ship took to the long boat and within ten minutes of leaving her saw the brig founder we were picked up the same morning by the french ship commerce de paris captain tombarel  here in a single column of a newspaper what strange touching pictures do we find of seamens dangers vicissitudes gallantry generosity the ship on firethe captain in the gale slinging himself in a bowline to stop the leakthe frenchman in the hour of danger coming to his british comrades rescuethe brigantine almost a wreck working up to the barque with the signal of distress flying and taking off her crew of thirteen men we then proceeded on our course the crew of the abandoned vessel assisting all they could to keep my ship afloat what noble simple words what courage devotedness brotherly love do they not cause the heart to beat and the eyes to fill  this is what seamen do daily and for one another one lights occasionally upon different stories it happened not very long since that the passengers by one of the great ocean steamers were wrecked and after undergoing the most severe hardships were left destitute and helpless at a miserable coaling port amongst them were old men ladies and children when the next steamer arrived the passengers by that steamer took alarm at the haggard and miserable appearance of their unfortunate predecessors and actually remonstrated with their own captain urging him not to take the poor creatures on board there was every excuse of course the lastarrived steamer was already dangerously full the cabins were crowded there were sick and delicate people on boardsick and delicate people who had paid a large price to the company for room food comfort already not too sufficient if fourteen of us are in an omnibus will we see three or four women outside and say come in because this is the last bus and it rains of course not but think of that remonstrance and of that samaritan master of the purchase brigantine  in the winter of 53 i went from marseilles to civita vecchia in one of the magnificent p and o ships the valetta the master of which subsequently did distinguished service in the crimea this was his first mediterranean voyage and he sailed his ship by the charts alone going into each port as surely as any pilot i remember walking the deck at night with this most skilful gallant wellbred and welleducated gentleman and the glow of eager enthusiasm with which he assented when i asked him whether he did not think a ribbon or order would be welcome or useful in his service  why is there not an order of britannia for british seamen in the merchant and the royal navy alike occur almost daily instances and occasions for the display of science skill bravery fortitude in trying circumstances resource in danger in the first number of the cornhill magazine a friend contributed a most touching story of the mclintock expedition in the dangers and dreadful glories of which he shared and the writer was a merchant captain how many more are there and for the honor of england may there be many like himgallant accomplished highspirited enterprising masters of their noble profession can our fountain of honor not be brought to such men it plays upon captains and colonels in seemly profusion it pours forth not illiberal rewards upon doctors and judges it sprinkles mayors and aldermen it bedews a painter now and again it has spirited a baronetcy upon two and bestowed a coronet upon one noble man of letters diplomatists take their bath in it as of right and it flings out a profusion of glittering stars upon the nobility of the three kingdoms cannot britannia find a ribbon for her sailors the navy royal or mercantile is a service the command of a ship or the conduct of her implies danger honor science skill subordination good faith it may be a victory such as that of the sarah sands it may be discovery such as that of the fox it may be heroic disaster such as that of the birkenhead and in such events merchant seamen as well as royal seamen take their share  why is there not then an order of britannia one day a young officer of the euryalus may win it and having just read the memoirs of lord dundonald i know who ought to have the first grand cross        prince alfred was serving on board the frigate euryalus      when this was written     on some late great victories   on the 18th day of april last i went to see a friend in a neighboring crescent and on the steps of the next house beheld a group something like that here depicted a newsboy had stopped in his walk and was reading aloud the journal which it was his duty to deliver a pretty orangegirl with a heap of blazing fruit rendered more brilliant by one of those great blue papers in which oranges are now artfully wrapped leant over the railing and listened and opposite the nympham discentem there was a capering and acuteeared young satirist of a crossingsweeper who had left his neighboring professional avocation and chance of profit in order to listen to the tale of the little newsboy  that intelligent reader with his hand following the line as he read it out to his audience was sayingandnowtomcoming up smilingafter his falldeedelivered a rattling clinker upon the benicia boyspotatotrapbut was met by apunisher on the nosewhich c c or words to that effect betty at 52 let me in while the boy was reading his lecture and having been some twenty minutes or so in the house and paid my visit i took leave  the little lecturer was still at work on the 51 doorstep and his audience had scarcely changed their position having read every word of the battle myself in the morning i did not stay to listen further but if the gentleman who expected his paper at the usual hour that day experienced delay and a little disappointment i shall not be surprised  i am not going to expatiate on the battle i have read in the correspondents letter of a northern newspaper that in the midst of the company assembled the readers humble servant was present and in a very polite society too of poets clergymen men of letters and members of both houses of parliament if so i must have walked to the station in my sleep paid three guineas in a profound fit of mental abstraction and returned to bed unconscious for i certainly woke there about the time when history relates that the fight was over i do not know whose colors i worethe benicians or those of the irish champion nor remember where the fight took place which indeed no somnambulist is bound to recollect ought mr sayers to be honored for being brave or punished for being naughty by the shade of brutus the elder i dont know  in george iis time there was a turbulent navy lieutenant handsome smith he was calledhis picture is at greenwich now in brown velvet and gold and scarlet his coat handsome his waistcoat exceedingly handsome but his face by no means the beautythere was i say a turbulent young lieutenant who was broke on a complaint of the french ambassador for obliging a french ship of war to lower her topsails to his ship at spithead but by the kings orders tom was next day made captain smith well if i were absolute king i would send tom sayers to the mill for a month and make him sir thomas on coming out of clerkenwell you are a naughty boy tom but then you know we ought to love our brethren though ever so naughty we are moralists and reprimand you and you are hereby reprimanded accordingly but in case england should ever have need of a few score thousand champions who laugh at danger who cope with giants who stricken to the ground jump up and gayly rally and fall and rise again and strike and die rather than yieldin case the country should need such men and you should know them be pleased to send lists of the misguided persons to the principal police stations where means may some day be found to utilize their wretched powers and give their deplorable energies a right direction suppose tom that you and your friends are pitted against an immense invadersuppose you are bent on holding the ground and dying there if need besuppose it is life freedom honor home you are fighting for and there is a deathdealing sword or rifle in your hand with which you are going to resist some tremendous enemy who challenges your championship on your native shore then sir thomas resist him to the death and it is all right kill him and heaven bless you drive him into the sea and there destroy smash and drown him and let us sing laudamus in these national cases you see we override the indisputable first laws of morals loving your neighbor is very well but suppose your neighbor comes over from calais and boulogne to rob you of your laws your liberties your newspapers your parliament all of which some dear neighbors of ours have given up in the most selfdenying manner suppose any neighbor were to cross the water and propose this kind of thing to us should we not be justified in humbly trying to pitch him into the water if it were the king of belgium himself we must do so i mean that fighting of course is wrong but that there are occasions when ci suppose i mean that that onehanded fight of sayers is one of the most spiritstirring little stories ever told and with every love and respect for moralitymy spirit says to her do for goodness sake my dear madam keep your true and pure and womanly and gentle remarks for another day have the great kindness to stand a leetle aside and just let us see one or two more rounds between the men that little man with the one hand powerless on his breast facing yonder giant for hours and felling him too every now and then it is the little java and the constitution over again  i think it is a most fortunate event for the brave heenan who has acted and written since the battle with a true warriors courtesy and with a great deal of good logic too that the battle was a drawn one the advantage was all on mr sayerss side say a young lad of sixteen insults me in the street and i try and thrash him and do it well i have thrashed a young lad you great big tyrant couldnt you hit one of your own size but say the lad thrashes me in either case i walk away discomfited but in the latter i am positively put to shame now when the ropes were cut from that deathgrip and sir thomas released the gentleman of benicia was confessedly blind of one eye and speedily afterwards was blind of both could mr savers have held out for three minutes for five minutes for ten minutes more he says he could so we say we could have held out and did and had beaten off the enemy at waterloo even if the prussians hadnt come up the opinions differ pretty much according to the nature of the opinants i say the duke and tom could have held out that they meant to hold out that they did hold out and that there has been fistifying enough that crowd which came in and stopped the fight ought to be considered like one of those divine clouds which the gods send in homer                             apollo shrouds           the godlike trojan in a veil of clouds  it is the best way of getting the godlike trojan out of the scrape dont you see the nodus is cut tom is out of chancery the benicia boy not a bit the worse nay better than if he had beaten the little man he has not the humiliation of conquest he is greater and will be loved more hereafter by the gentle sex suppose he had overcome the godlike trojan suppose he had tied toms corpse to his cabwheels and driven to farnham smoking the pipe of triumph faugh the great hulking conqueror why did you not hold your hand from yonder hero everybody i say was relieved by that opportune appearance of the british gods protectors of native valor who interfered and withdrew their champion  now suppose sixfeettwo conqueror and fivefeeteight beaten would sayers have been a whit the less gallant and meritorious if sancho had been allowed really to reign in barataria i make no doubt that with his good sense and kindness of heart he would have devised some means of rewarding the brave vanquished as well as the brave victors in the baratarian army and that a champion who had fought a good fight would have been a knight of king don sanchos orders whatever the upshot of the combat had been suppose wellington overwhelmed on the plateau of mont st john suppose washington attacked and beaten at valley forgeand either supposition is quite easyand what becomes of the heroes they would have been as brave honest heroic wise but their glory where would it have been should we have had their portraits hanging in our chambers have been familiar with their histories have pondered over their letters common lives and daily sayings there is not only merit but luck which goes to making a hero out of a gentleman mind please you i am not saying that the hero is after all not so very heroic and have not the least desire to grudge him his merit because of his good fortune  have you any idea whither this roundabout essay on some late great victories is tending do you suppose that by those words i mean trenton brandywine salamanca vittoria and so forth by a great victory i cant mean that affair at farnham for it was a drawn fight where then are the victories pray and when are we coming to them  my good sir you will perceive that in this nicaean discourse i have only as yet advanced as far as thisthat a hero whether he wins or loses is a hero and that if a fellow will but be honest and courageous and do his best we are for paying all honor to him furthermore it has been asserted that fortune has a good deal to do with the making of heroes and thus hinted for the consolation of those who dont happen to be engaged in any stupendous victories that had opportunity so served they might have been heroes too if you are not friend it is not your fault whilst i dont wish to detract from any gentlemans reputation who is there my worst enemy cant take objection to that the point might have been put more briefly perhaps but if you please we will not argue that question  well then the victories which i wish especially to commemorate in this paper are the six great complete prodigious and undeniable victories achieved by the corps which the editor of the cornhill magazine has the honor to command when i seemed to speak disparagingly but now of generals it was that chief i had in my i if you will permit me the expression i wished him not to be elated by too much prosperity i warned him against assuming heroic imperatorial airs and cocking his laurels too jauntily over his ear i was his conscience and stood on the splashboard of his triumphcar whispering hominem memento te as we rolled along the way and passed the weathercocks on the temples i saluted the symbol of the goddess fortune with a reverent awe we have done our little endeavor i said bowing my head and mortals can do no more but we might have fought bravely and not won we might have cast the coin calling head and lo tail might have come uppermost o thou ruler of victoriesthou awarder of famethou giver of crowns and shillingsif thou hast smiled upon us shall we not be thankful there is a saturnine philosopher standing at the door of his bookshop who i fancy has a poohpooh expression as the triumph passes i cant see quite clearly for the laurels which have fallen down over my nose one hand is reining in the two white elephants that draw the car i raise the other hand up toto the laurels and pass on waving him a graceful recognition up the hill of ludgatearound the pauline squareby the side of chepeuntil it reaches our own hill of cornthe procession passes the imperator is bowing to the people the captains of the legions are riding round the car their gallant minds struck by the thought have we not fought as well as yonder fellow swaggering in the chariot and are we not as good as he granted with all my heart my dear lads when your consulship arrives may you be as fortunate when these hands now growing old shall lay down sword and truncheon may you mount the car and ride to the temple of jupiter be yours the laurel then neque me myrtus dedecet looking cosily down from the arbor where i sit under the arched vine  i fancy the imperator standing on the steps of the temple erected by titus on the mons frumentarius and addressing the citizens quirites he says in our campaign of six months we have been engaged six times and in each action have taken near upon a hundred thousand prisoners go to what are other magazines compared to our magazine sound trumpeter what banner is there like that of cornhill you philosopher yonder he shirks under his mantle do you know what it is to have a hundred and ten thousand readers a hundred thousand readers a hundred thousand buyers cries of nopooh yes upon my honor oh come and murmurs of applause and derisioni say more than a hundred thousand purchasersand i believe as much as a million readers immense sensation to these have we said an unkind word we have enemies have we hit them an unkind blow have we sought to pursue party aims to forward private jobs to advance selfish schemes the only persons to whom wittingly we have given pain are some who have volunteered for our corpsand of these volunteers we have had thousands murmurs and grumbles what commander citizens could place all these mencould make officers of all these men cries of nono and laughtercould say i accept this recruit though he is too short for our standard because he is poor and has a mother at home who wants bread could enroll this other who is too weak to bear arms because he says look sir i shall be stronger anon the leader of such an army as ours must select his men not because they are good and virtuous but because they are strong and capable to these our ranks are ever open and in addition to the warriors who surround methe generals look proudly consciousi tell you citizens that i am in treaty with other and most tremendous champions who will march by the side of our veterans to the achievement of fresh victories now blow trumpets bang ye gongs and drummers drub the thundering skins generals and chiefs we go to sacrifice to the gods  crowned with flowers the captains enter the temple the other magazines walking modestly behind them the people huzza and in some instances kneel and kiss the fringes of the robes of the warriors the philosopher puts up his shutters and retires into his shop deeply moved in ancient times pliny apud smith relates it was the custom of the imperator to paint his whole body a bright red and also on ascending the hill to have some of the hostile chiefs led aside to the adjoining prison and put to death we propose to dispense with both these ceremonies     thorns in the cushion   in the essay with which this volume commences the cornhill magazine was likened to a ship sailing forth on her voyage and the captain uttered a very sincere prayer for her prosperity the dangers of storm and rock the vast outlay upon ship and cargo and the certain risk of the venture gave the chief officer a feeling of no small anxiety for who could say from what quarter danger might arise and how his owners property might be imperilled after a six months voyage we with very thankful hearts could acknowledge our good fortune and taking up the apologue in the roundabout manner we composed a triumphal procession in honor of the magazine and imagined the imperator thereof riding in a sublime car to return thanks in the temple of victory cornhill is accustomed to grandeur and greatness and has witnessed every ninth of november for i dont know how many centuries a prodigious annual pageant chariot progress and flourish of trumpetry and being so very near the mansion house i am sure the reader will understand how the idea of pageant and procession came naturally to my mind the imagination easily supplied a gold coach eight creamcolored horses of your true pegasus breed huzzaing multitudes running footmen and clanking knights in armor a chaplain and a swordbearer with a muff on his head scowling out of the coachwindow and a lord mayor all crimson fur gold chain and white ribbons solemnly occupying the place of state a playful fancy could have carried the matter farther could have depicted the feast in the egyptian hall the ministers chief justices and right reverend prelates taking their seats round about his lordship the turtle and other delicious viands and mr toole behind the central throne bawling out to the assembled guests and dignitaries my lord soandso my lord whatdyecallim my lord etcaetera the lord mayor pledges you all in a lovingcup then the noble proceedings come to an end lord simper proposes the ladies the company rises from table and adjourns to coffee and muffins the carriages of the nobility and guests roll back to the west the egyptian hall so bright just now appears in a twilight glimmer in which waiters are seen ransacking the dessert and rescuing the spoons his lordship and the lady mayoress go into their private apartments the robes are doffed the collar and white ribbons are removed the mayor becomes a man and is pretty surely in a fluster about the speeches which he has just uttered remembering too well now wretched creature the principal points which he didnt make when he rose to speak he goes to bed to headache to care to repentance and i dare say to a dose of something which his bodyphysician has prescribed for him and there are ever so many men in the city who fancy that man happy  now suppose that all through that 9th of november his lordship has had a racking rheumatism or a toothache let us say during all dinnertimethrough which he has been obliged to grin and mumble his poor old speeches is he enviable would you like to change with his lordship suppose that bumper which his golden footman brings him instead ifackins of ypocras or canary contains some abomination of senna away remove the golden goblet insidious cupbearer you now begin to perceive the gloomy moral which i am about to draw  last month we sang the song of glorification and rode in the chariot of triumph it was all very well it was right to huzza and be thankful and cry bravo our side and besides you know there was the enjoyment of thinking how pleased brown and jones and robinson our dear friends would be at this announcement of success but now that the performance is over my good sir just step into my private room and see that it is not all pleasurethis winning of successes cast your eye over those newspapers over those letters see what the critics say of your harmless jokes neat little trim sentences and pet waggeries why you are no better than an idiot you are drivelling your powers have left you this always overrated writer is rapidly sinking to c  this is not pleasant but neither is this the point it may be the critic is right and the author wrong it may be that the archbishops sermon is not so fine as some of those discourses twenty years ago which used to delight the faithful in granada or it may be pleasing thought that the critic is a dullard and does not understand what he is writing about everybody who has been to an exhibition has heard visitors discoursing about the pictures before their faces one says this is very well another says this is stuff and rubbish another cries bravo this is a masterpiece and each has a right to his opinion for example one of the pictures i admired most at the royal academy is by a gentleman on whom i never to my knowledge set eyes this picture is no 346 moses by mr s solomon i thought it had a great intention i thought it finely drawn and composed it nobly represented to my mind the dark children of the egyptian bondage and suggested the touching story my newspaper says two ludicrously ugly women looking at a dingy baby do not form a pleasing object and so goodby mr solomon are not most of our babies served so in life and doesnt mr robinson consider mr browns cherub an ugly squalling little brat so cheer up mr s s it may be the critic who discoursed on your baby is a bad judge of babies when pharaohs kind daughter found the child and cherished and loved it and took it home and found a nurse for it too i dare say there were grim brickdust colored chamberlains or some of the tough old meagre yellow princesses at court who never had children themselves who cried out faugh the horrid little squalling wretch and knew he would never come to good and said didnt i tell you so when he assaulted the egyptian  never mind then mr s solomon i say because a critic poohpoohs your work of artyour mosesyour childyour foundling why did not a wiseacre in blackwoods magazine lately fall foul of tom jones o hypercritic so to be sure did good old mr richardson who could write novels himselfbut you and i and mr gibbon my dear sir agree in giving our respect and wonder and admiration to the brave old master  in these last words i am supposing the respected reader to be endowed with a sense of humor which he may or may not possess indeed dont we know many an honest man who can no more comprehend a joke than he can turn a tune but i take for granted my dear sir that you are brimming over with funyou maynt make jokes but you could if you wouldyou know you could and in your quiet way you enjoy them extremely now many people neither make them nor understand them when made nor like them when understood and are suspicious testy and angry with jokers have you ever watched an elderly male or femalean elderly party so to speak who begins to find out that some young wag of the company is chaffing him have you ever tried the sarcastic or socratic method with a child little simple he or she in the innocence of the simple heart plays some silly freak or makes some absurd remark which you turn to ridicule the little creature dimly perceives that you are making fun of him writhes blushes grows uneasy bursts into tearsupon my word it is not fair to try the weapon of ridicule upon that innocent young victim the awful objurgatory practice he is accustomed to point out his fault and lay bare the dire consequences thereof expose it roundly and give him a proper solemn moral whippingbut do not attempt to castigare ridendo do not laugh at him writhing and cause all the other boys in the school to laugh remember your own young days at school my friendthe tingling cheeks burning ears bursting heart and passion of desperate tears with which you looked up after having performed some blunder whilst the doctor held you to public scorn before the class and cracked his great clumsy jokes upon youhelpless and a prisoner better the block itself and the lictors with their fasces of birchtwigs than the maddening torture of those jokes  now with respect to jokesand the present company of course exceptedmany people perhaps most people are as infants they have little sense of humor they dont like jokes raillery in writing annoys and offends them the coarseness apart i think i have met very very few women who liked the banter of swift and fielding their simple tender natures revolt at laughter is the satyr always a wicked brute at heart and are they rightly shocked at his grin his leer his horns hoofs and ears fi donc le vilain monstre with his shrieks and his capering crooked legs let him go and get a pair of wellwadded black silk stockings and pull them over those horrid shanks put a large gown and bands over beard and hide and pour a dozen of lavenderwater into his lawn handkerchief and cry and never make a joke again it shall all be highlydistilled poesy and perfumed sentiment and gushing eloquence and the foot shant peep out and a plague take it cover it up with the surplice out with your cambric dear ladies and let us all whimper together  now then hand on heart we declare that it is not the fire of adverse critics which afflicts or frightens the editorial bosom they may be right they may be rogues who have a personal spite they may be dullards who kick and bray as their nature is to do and prefer thistles to pineapples they may be conscientious acute deeply learned delightful judges who see your joke in a moment and the profound wisdom lying underneath wise or dull laudatory or otherwise we put their opinions aside if they applaud we are pleased if they shake their quick pens and fly off with a hiss we resign their favors and put on all the fortitude we can muster i would rather have the lowest mans good word than his bad one to be sure but as for coaxing a compliment or wheedling him into goodhumor or stopping his angry mouth with a good dinner or accepting his contributions for a certain magazine for fear of his barking or snapping elsewhereallons donc these shall not be our acts bowwow cerberus here shall be no sop for thee unlessunless cerberus is an uncommonly good dog when we shall bear no malice because he flew at us from our neighbors gate  what then is the main grief you spoke of as annoying youthe toothache in the lord mayors jaw the thorn in the cushion of the editorial chair it is there ah it stings me now as i write it comes with almost every mornings post at night i come home and take my letters up to bed not daring to open them and in the morning i find one two three thorns on my pillow three i extracted yesterday two i found this morning they dont sting quite so sharply as they did but a skin is a skin and they bite after all most wickedly it is all very fine to advertise on the magazine contributions are only to be sent to messrs smith elder and co and not to the editors private residence my dear sir how little you know man or womankind if you fancy they will take that sort of warning how am i to know though to be sure i begin to know now as i take the letters off the tray which of those envelopes contains a real bona fide letter and which a thorn one of the best invitations this year i mistook for a thornletter and kept it without opening this is what i call a thornletter   camberwell june 4  sirmay i hope may i entreat that you will favor me by perusing the enclosed lines and that they may be found worthy of insertion in the cornhill magazine we have known better days sir i have a sick and widowed mother to maintain and little brothers and sisters who look to me i do my utmost as a governess to support them i toil at night when they are at rest and my own hand and brain are alike tired if i could add but a little to our means by my pen many of my poor invalids wants might be supplied and i could procure for her comforts to which she is now a stranger heaven knows it is not for want of will or for want of energy on my part that she is now in illhealth and our little household almost without bread dodo cast a kind glance over my poem and if you can help us the widow the orphans will bless you i remain sir in anxious expectancy  your faithful servant  s s s   and enclosed is a little poem or two and an envelope with its penny stampheaven help usand the writers name and address  now you see what i mean by a thorn here is the case put with true female logic i am poor i am good i am ill i work hard i have a sick mother and hungry brothers and sisters dependent on me you can help us if you will and then i look at the paper with the thousandth part of a faint hope that it may be suitable and i find it wont do and i knew it wouldnt do and why is this poor lady to appeal to my pity and bring her poor little ones kneeling to my bedside and calling for bread which i can give them if i choose no day passes but that argument ad misericordiam is used day and night that sad voice is crying out for help thrice it appealed to me yesterday twice this morning it cried to me and i have no doubt when i go to get my hat i shall find it with its piteous face and its pale family about it waiting for me in the hall one of the immense advantages which women have over our sex is that they actually like to read these letters like letters o mercy on us before i was an editor i did not like the postman muchbut now  a very common way with these petitioners is to begin with a fine flummery about the merits and eminent genius of the person whom they are addressing but this artifice i state publicly is of no avail when i see that kind of herb i know the snake within it and fling it away before it has time to sting away reptile to the wastepaper basket and thence to the flames  but of these disappointed people some take their disappointment and meekly bear it some hate and hold you their enemy because you could not be their friend some furious and envious say who is this man who refuses what i offer and how dares he the conceited coxcomb to deny my merit  sometimes my letters contain not mere thorns but bludgeons how are two choice slips from that noble irish oak which has more than once supplied alpeens for this meek and unoffending skull   theatre royal donnybrook  siri have just finished reading the first portion of your tale lovel the widower and am much surprised at the unwarrantable strictures you pass therein on the corps de ballet  i have been for more than ten years connected with the theatrical profession and i beg to assure you that the majority of the corps de ballet are virtuous wellconducted girls and consequently that snug cottages are not taken for them in the regents park  i also have to inform you that theatrical managers are in the habit of speaking good english possibly better english than authors  you either know nothing of the subject in question or you assert a wilful falsehood  i am happy to say that the characters of the corps de ballet as also those of actors and actresses are superior to the snarlings of dyspeptic libellers or the spiteful attacks and brutum fulmen of ephemeral authors  i am sir your obedient servant  a b c  the editor of the cornhill magazine   theatre royal donnybrook  siri have just read in the cornhill magazine for january the first portion of a tale written by you and entitled lovel the widower  in the production in question you employ all your malicious spite and you have great capabilities that way in trying to degrade the character of the corps de ballet when you imply that the majority of balletgirls have villas taken for them in the regents park i say you tell a deliberate falsehood  haveing been brought up to the stage from infancy and though now an actress haveing been seven years principal dancer at the opera i am competent to speak on the subject i am only surprised that so vile a libeller as yourself should be allowed to preside at the dramatic fund dinner on the 22nd instant i think it would be much better if you were to reform your own life instead of telling lies of those who are immeasurably your superiors  yours in supreme disgust  a d   the signatures of the respected writers are altered and for the site of their theatre royal an adjacent place is named which as i may have been falsely informed used to be famous for quarrels thumps and broken heads but i say is this an easy chair to sit on when you are liable to have a pair of such shillelaghs flung at it and prithee what was all the quarrel about in the little history of lovel the widower i described and brought to condign punishment a certain wretch of a balletdancer who lived splendidly for a while on illgotten gains had an accident and lost her beauty and died poor deserted ugly and every way odious in the same page other little balletdancers are described wearing homely clothing doing their duty and carrying their humble savings to the family at home but nothing will content my dear correspondents but to have me declare that the majority of balletdancers have villas in the regents park and to convict me of deliberate falsehood suppose for instance i had chosen to introduce a redhaired washerwoman into a story i might get an expostulatory letter saying sir in stating that the majority of washerwomen are redhaired you are a liar and you had best not speak of ladies who are immeasurably your superiors or suppose i had ventured to describe an illiterate haberdasher one of the craft might write to me sir in describing haberdashers as illiterate you utter a wilful falsehood haberdashers use much better english than authors it is a mistake to be sure i have never said what my correspondents say i say there is the text under their noses but what if they choose to read it their own way hurroo lads heres for a fight theres a bald head peeping out of the hut theres a bald head it must be tim malones and whack come down both the bludgeons at once  ah me we wound where we never intended to strike we create anger where we never meant harm and these thoughts are the thorns in our cushion out of mere malignity i suppose there is no man who would like to make enemies but here in this editorial business you cant do otherwise and a queer sad strange bitter thought it is that must cross the mind of many a public man do what i will be innocent or spiteful be generous or cruel there are a and b and c and d who will hate me to the end of the chapterto the chapters endto the finis of the pagewhen hate and envy and fortune and disappointment shall be over     on screens in diningrooms   a grandson of the late rev dr primrose of wakefield vicar wrote me a little note from his country living this morning and the kind fellow had the precaution to write no thorn upon the envelope so that ere i broke the seal my mind might be relieved of any anxiety lest the letter should contain one of those lurking stabs which are so painful to the present gentle writer your epigraph my dear p shows your kind and artless nature but dont you see it is of no use people who are bent upon assassinating you in the manner mentioned will write no thorn upon their envelopes too and you open the case and presently out flies a poisoned stiletto which springs into a mans bosom and makes the wretch howl with anguish when the bailiffs are after a man they adopt all sorts of disguises pop out on him from all conceivable corners and tap his miserable shoulders his wife is taken ill his sweetheart who remarked his brilliant too brilliant appearance at the hyde park review will meet him at cremorne or where you will the old friend who has owed him that money these five years will meet him at soandso and pay by one bait or other the victim is hooked netted landed and down goes the basketlid it is not your wife your sweetheart your friend who is going to pay you it is mr nab the bailiff you knowyou are caught you are off in a cab to chancery lane  you know i say why should you know i make no manner of doubt you never were taken by a bailiff in your life i never was i have been in two or three debtors prisons but not on my own account goodness be praised i mean you cant escape your lot and nab only stands here metaphorically as the watchful certain and untiring officer of mr sheriff fate why my dear primrose this morning along with your letter comes another bearing the wellknown superscription of another old friend which i open without the least suspicion and what do i find a few lines from my friend johnson it is true but they are written on a page covered with feminine handwriting dear mr johnson says the writer i have just been perusing with delight a most charming tale by the archbishop of cambray it is called telemachus and i think it would be admirably suited to the cornhill magazine as you know the editor will you have the great kindness dear mr johnson to communicate with him personally as that is much better than writing in a roundabout way to the publishers and waiting goodness knows how long for an answer and state my readiness to translate this excellent and instructive story i do not wish to breathe a word against lovel parsonage framley the widower or any of the novels which have appeared in the cornhill magazine but i am sure telemachus is as good as new to english readers and in point of interest and morality far c c c  there it is i am stabbed through johnson he has lent himself to this attack on me he is weak about women other strong men are he submits to the common lot poor fellow in my reply i do not use a word of unkindness i write him back gently that i fear telemachus wont suit us he can send the letter on to his fair correspondent but however soft the answer i question whether the wrath will be turned away will there not be a coolness between him and the lady and is it not possible that henceforth her fine eyes will look with darkling glances upon the pretty orange cover of our magazine  certain writers they say have a bad opinion of women now am i very whimsical in supposing that this disappointed candidate will be hurt at her rejection and angry or cast down according to her nature angry indeed says juno gathering up her purple robes and royal raiment sorry indeed cries minerva lacing on her corselet again and scowling under her helmet i imagine the wellknown apple case has just been argued and decided hurt forsooth do you suppose we care for the opinion of that hobnailed lout of a paris do you suppose that i the goddess of wisdom cant make allowances for mortal ignorance and am so base as to bear malice against a poor creature who knows no better you little know the goddess nature when you dare to insinuate that our divine minds are actuated by motives so base a love of justice influences us we are above mean revenge we are too magnanimous to be angry at the award of such a judge in favor of such a creature and rustling out their skirts the ladies walk away together this is all very well you are bound to believe them they are actuated by no hostility not they they bear no maliceof course not but when the trojan war occurs presently which side will they take many brave souls will be sent to hades hector will perish poor old priams bald numskull will be cracked and troy town will burn because paris prefers goldenhaired venus to oxeyed juno and grayeyed minerva  the last essay of this roundabout series describing the griefs and miseries of the editorial chair was written as the kind reader will acknowledge in a mild and gentle not in a warlike or satirical spirit i showed how cudgels were applied but surely the meek object of persecution hit no blows in return the beating did not hurt much and the person assaulted could afford to keep his goodhumor indeed i admired that brave though illogical little actress of the t r dbln for her fiery vindication of her professions honor i assure her i had no intention to tell lswell let us say monosyllablesabout my superiors and i wish her nothing but well and when macmahon or shall it be mulligan roi dirlande ascends his throne i hope she may be appointed professor of english to the princesses of the royal house nuperin former daysi too have militated sometimes as i now think unjustly but always i vow without personal rancor which of us has not idle words to recall flippant jokes to regret have you never committed an imprudence have you never had a dispute and found out that you were wrong so much the worse for you woe be to the man qui croit toujours avoir raison his anger is not a brief madness but a permanent mania his rage is not a feverfit but a black poison inflaming him distorting his judgment disturbing his rest embittering his cup gnawing at his pleasures causing him more cruel suffering than ever he can inflict on his enemy o la belle morale as i write it i think about one or two little affairs of my own there is old dr squaretoso he certainly was very rude to me and thats the fact there is madame pomposa and certainly her ladyships behavior was about as cool as cool could be never mind old squaretoso never mind madame pomposa here is a hand let us be friends as we once were and have no more of this rancor  i had hardly sent that last roundabout paper to the printer which i submit was written in a pacable and not unchristian frame of mind when saturday came and with it of course my saturday review i remember at new york coming down to breakfast at the hotel one morning after a criticism had appeared in the new york herald in which an irish writer had given me a dressing for a certain lecture on swift ah my dear little enemy of the t r d what were the cudgels in your little billetdoux compared to those noble new york shillelaghs all through the union the literary sons of erin have marched alpeenstock in hand and in every city of the states they call each other and everybody else the finest names having come to breakfast then in the public room i sit down and seethat the nine people opposite have all got new york heralds in their hands one dear little lady whom i knew and who sat opposite gave a pretty blush and popped her paper under the tablecloth i told her i had had my whipping already in my own private room and begged her to continue her reading i may have undergone agonies you see but every man who has been bred at an english public school comes away from a private interview with dr birch with a calm even a smiling face and this is not impossible when you are prepared you screw your courage upyou go through the business you come back and take your seat on the form showing not the least symptom of uneasiness or of previous unpleasantries but to be caught suddenly up and whipped in the bosom of your familyto sit down to breakfast and cast your innocent eye on a paper and find before you are aware that the saturday monitor or black monday instructor has hoisted you and is laying onthat is indeed a trial or perhaps the family has looked at the dreadful paper beforehand and weakly tries to hide it where is the instructor or the monitor say you where is that paper says mamma to one of the young ladies lucy hasnt it fanny hasnt seen it emily thinks that the governess has it at last out it is brought that awful paper papa is amazingly tickled with the article on thomson thinks that show up of johnson is very lively and nowheaven be good to ushe has come to the critique on himselfof all the rubbish which we have had from mr tomkins we do protest and vow that this last cartload is c ah poor tomkinsbut most of all ah poor mrs tomkins and poor emily and fanny and lucy who have to sit by and see paterfamilias put to the torture  now on this eventful saturday i did not cry because it was not so much the editor as the publisher of the cornhill magazine who was brought out for a dressing and it is wonderful how gallantly one bears the misfortunes of ones friends that a writer should be taken to task about his books is fair and he must abide the praise or the censure but that a publisher should be criticised for his dinners and for the conversation which did not take place thereis this tolerable press practice legitimate joking or honorable warfare i have not the honor to know my nextdoor neighbor but i make no doubt that he receives his friends at dinner i see his wife and children pass constantly i even know the carriages of some of the people who call upon him and could tell their names now suppose his servants were to tell mine what the doings are next door who comes to dinner what is eaten and said and i were to publish an account of these transactions in a newspaper i could assuredly get money for the report but ought i to write it and what would you think of me for doing so  and suppose mr saturday revieweryou censor morum you who pique yourself and justly and honorably in the main upon your character of gentleman as well as of writer suppose not that you yourself invent and indite absurd twaddle about gentlemens private meetings and transactions but pick this wretched garbage out of a new york street and hold it up for your readers amusementdont you think my friend that you might have been better employed here in my saturday review and in an american paper subsequently sent to me i light astonished on an account of the dinners of my friend and publisher which are described as tremendously heavy of the conversation which does not take place and of the guests assembled at the table i am informed that the proprietor of the cornhill and the host on these occasions is a very good man but totally unread and that on my asking him whether dr johnson was dining behind the screen he said god bless my soul my dear sir theres no person by the name of johnson here nor any one behind the screen and that a roar of laughter cut him short i am informed by the same new york correspondent that i have touched up a contributors article that i once said to a literary gentleman who was proudly pointing to an anonymous article as his writing ah i thought i recognized your hoof in it i am told by the same authority that the cornhill magazine shows symptoms of being on the wane and having sold nearly a hundred thousand copies he the correspondent should think forty thousand was now about the mark then the graceful writer passes on to the dinners at which it appears the editor of the magazine is the great gun and comes out with all the geniality in his power  now suppose this charming intelligence is untrue suppose the publisher to recall the words of my friend the dublin actor of last month is a gentleman to the full as well informed as those whom he invites to his table suppose he never made the remark beginninggod bless my soul my dear sir nor anything resembling it suppose nobody roared with laughing suppose the editor of the cornhill magazine never touched up one single line of the contribution which bears marks of his hand suppose he never said to any literary gentleman i recognized your hoof in any periodical whatever suppose the 40000 subscribers which the writer to new york considered to be about the mark should be between 90000 and 100000 and as he will have figures there they are suppose this backdoor gossip should be utterly blundering and untrue would any one wonder ah if we had only enjoyed the happiness to number this writer among the contributors to our magazine what a cheerfulness and easy confidence his presence would impart to our meetings he would find that poor mr smith had heard that recondite anecdote of dr johnson behind the screen and as for the great gun of those banquets with what geniality should not i come out if i had an amiable companion close by me dotting down my conversation for the new york times  attack our books mr correspondent and welcome they are fair subjects for just censure or praise but woe be to you if you allow private rancors or animosities to influence you in the discharge of your public duty in the little court where you are paid to sit as judge as critic you owe it to your employers to your conscience to the honor of your calling to deliver just sentences and you shall have to answer to heaven for your dealings as surely as my lord chief justice on the bench the dignity of letters the honor of the literary calling the slights put by haughty and unthinking people upon literary mendont we hear outcries upon these subjects raised daily as dear sam johnson sits behind the screen too proud to show his threadbare coat and patches among the more prosperous brethren of his trade there is no want of dignity in him in that homely image of labor illrewarded genius as yet unrecognized independence sturdy and uncomplaining but mr nameless behind the publishers screen uninvited peering at the company and the meal catching up scraps of the jokes and noting down the guests behavior and conversationwhat a figure his is allons mr nameless put up your notebook walk out of the hall and leave gentlemen alone who would be private and wish you no harm     tunbridge toys   i wonder whether those little silver pencilcases with a movable almanac at the buttend are still favorite implements with boys and whether pedlers still hawk them about the country are there pedlers and hawkers still or are rustics and children grown too sharp to deal with them those pencilcases as far as my memory serves me were not of much use the screw upon which the movable almanac turned was constantly getting loose the 1 of the table would work from its moorings under tuesday or wednesday as the case might be and you would find on examination that th or w was the 23 12 of the month which was absurd on the face of the thing and in a word your cherished pencilcase an utterly unreliable timekeeper nor was this a matter of wonder consider the position of a pencilcase in a boys pocket you had hardbake in it marbles kept in your purse when the money was all gone your mothers purse knitted so fondly and supplied with a little bit of gold long sinceprodigal little sonscattered amongst the swinei mean amongst brandyballs open tarts threecornered puffs and similar abominations you had a top and string a knife a piece of cobblers wax two or three bullets a little warbler and i for my part remember for a considerable period a brassbarrelled pocketpistol which would fire beautifully for with it i shot off a button from butt majors jacketwith all these things and ever so many more clinking and rattling in your pockets and your hands of course keeping them in perpetual movement how could you expect your movable almanac not to be twisted out of its place now and againyour pencilcase to be bentyour liquorice water not to leak out of your bottle over the cobblers wax your bullseyes not to ram up the lock and barrel of your pistol and so forth  in the month of june thirtyseven years ago i bought one of those pencilcases from a boy whom i shall call hawker and who was in my form is he dead is he a millionnaire is he a bankrupt now he was an immense screw at school and i believe to this day that the value of the thing for which i owed and eventually paid threeandsixpence was in reality not oneandnine  i certainly enjoyed the case at first a good deal and amused myself with twiddling round the movable calendar but this pleasure wore off the jewel as i said was not paid for and hawker a large and violent boy was exceedingly unpleasant as a creditor his constant remark was when are you going to pay me that threeandsixpence what sneaks your relations must be they come to see you you go out to them on saturdays and sundays and they never give you anything dont tell me you little humbug and so forth the truth is that my relations were respectable but my parents were making a tour in scotland and my friends in london whom i used to go and see were most kind to me certainly but somehow never tipped me that term of may to august 1823 passed in agonies then in consequence of my debt to hawker what was the pleasure of a calendar pencilcase in comparison with the doubt and torture of mind occasioned by the sense of the debt and the constant reproach of that fellows scowling eyes and gloomy coarse reminders how was i to pay off such a debt out of sixpence a week ludicrous why did not some one come to see me and tip me ah my dear sir if you have any little friends at school go and see them and do the natural thing by them you wont miss the sovereign you dont know what a blessing it will be to them dont fancy they are too oldtry em and they will remember you and bless you in future days and their gratitude shall accompany your dreary after life and they shall meet you kindly when thanks for kindness are scant o mercy shall i ever forget that sovereign you gave me captain bob or the agonies of being in debt to hawker in that very term a relation of mine was going to india i actually was fetched from school in order to take leave of him i am afraid i told hawker of this circumstance i own i speculated upon my friends giving me a pound a pound pooh a relation going to india and deeply affected at parting from his darling kinsman might give five pounds to the dear fellow    there was hawker when i came backof course there he was as he looked in my scared face his turned livid with rage he muttered curses terrible from the lips of so young a boy my relation about to cross the ocean to fill a lucrative appointment asked me with much interest about my progress at school heard me construe a passage of eutropius the pleasing latin work on which i was then engaged gave me a god bless you and sent me back to school upon my word of honor without so much as a halfcrown it is all very well my dear sir to say that boys contract habits of expecting tips from their parents friends that they become avaricious and so forth avaricious fudge boys contract habits of tart and toffee eating which they do not carry into after life on the contrary i wish i did like em what raptures of pleasure one could have now for five shillings if one could but pick it off the pastrycooks tray no if you have any little friends at school out with your halfcrowns my friend and impart to those little ones the little fleeting joys of their age  well then at the beginning of august 1823 bartlemytide holidays came and i was to go to my parents who were at tunbridge wells my place in the coach was taken by my tutors servantsboltintun fleet street seven oclock in the morning was the word my tutor the rev edward p to whom i hereby present my best compliments had a parting interview with me gave me my little account for my governor the remaining part of the coachhire five shillings for my own expenses and some fiveandtwenty shillings on an old account which had been overpaid and was to be restored to my family  away i ran and paid hawker his threeandsix ouf what a weight it was off my mind he was a norfolk boy and used to go home from mrs nelsons bell inn aldgatebut that is not to the point the next morning of course we were an hour before the time i and another boy shared a hackneycoach twoandsix porter for putting luggage on coach threepence i had no more money of my own left rasherwell my companion went into the boltintun coffeeroom and had a good breakfast i couldnt because though i had fiveandtwenty shillings of my parents money i had none of my own you see  i certainly intended to go without breakfast and still remember how strongly i had that resolution in my mind but there was that hour to wait a beautiful august morningi am very hungry there is rasherwell tucking away in the coffeeroom i pace the street as sadly almost as if i had been coming to school not going thence i turn into a court by mere chancei vow it was by mere chanceand there i see a coffeeshop with a placard in the window coffee twopence round of buttered toast twopence and here am i hungry penniless with fiveandtwenty shillings of my parents money in my pocket  what would you have done you see i had had my money and spent it in that pencilcase affair the fiveandtwenty shillings were a trustby me to be handed over  but then would my parents wish their only child to be actually without breakfast having this money and being so hungry so very hungry mightnt i take ever so little mightnt i at home eat as much as i chose  well i went into the coffeeshop and spent fourpence i remember the taste of the coffee and toast to this daya peculiar muddy notsweetenough most fragrant coffeea rich rancid yet notbutteredenough delicious toast the waiter had nothing at any rate fourpence i know was the sum i spent and the hunger appeased i got on the coach a guilty being  at the last stagewhat is its name i have forgotten in sevenandthirty yearsthere is an inn with a little green and trees before it and by the trees there is an open carriage it is our carriage yes there are prince and blucher the horses and my parents in the carriage oh how i had been counting the days until this one came oh how happy had i been to see them yesterday but there was that fourpence all the journey down the toast had choked me and the coffee poisoned me  i was in such a state of remorse about the fourpence that i forgot the maternal joy and caresses the tender paternal voice i pull out the twentyfour shillings and eightpence with a trembling hand  heres your money i gasp out which mr p owes you all but fourpence i owed threeandsixpence to hawker out of my money for a pencilcase and i had none left and i took fourpence of yours and had some coffee at a shop  i suppose i must have been choking whilst uttering this confession  my dear boy says the governor why didnt you go and breakfast at the hotel  he must be starved says my mother  i had confessed i had been a prodigal i had been taken back to my parents arms again it was not a very great crime as yet or a very long career of prodigality but dont we know that a boy who takes a pin which is not his own will take a thousand pounds when occasion serves bring his parents gray heads with sorrow to the grave and carry his own to the gallows witness the career of dick idle upon whom our friend mr sala has been discoursing dick only began by playing pitchandtoss on a tombstone playing fair for what we know and even for that sin he was promptly caned by the beadle the bamboo was ineffectual to cane that reprobates bad courses out of him from pitchandtoss he proceeded to manslaughter if necessary to highway robbery to tyburn and the rope there ah heaven be thanked my parents heads are still above the grass and mine still out of the noose  as i look up from my desk i see tunbridge wells common and the rocks the strange familiar place which i remember forty years ago boys saunter over the green with stumps and cricketbats other boys gallop by on the ridingmasters hacks i protest it is cramp riding master as it used to be in the reign of george iv and that centaur cramp must be at least a hundred years old yonder comes a footman with a bundle of novels from the library are they as good as our novels oh how delightful they were shades of valancour awful ghost of manfroni how i shudder at your appearance sweet image of thaddeus of warsaw how often has this almost infantile hand tried to depict you in a polish cap and richly embroidered tights and as for corinthian tom in light blue pantaloons and hessians and jerry hawthorn from the country can all the fashion can all the splendor of real life which these eyes have subsequently beheld can all the wit i have heard or read in later times compare with your fashion with your brilliancy with your delightful grace and sparkling vivacious rattle  who knows they may have kept those very books at the library stillat the wellremembered library on the pantiles where they sell that delightful useful tunbridge ware i will go and see i went my way to the pantiles the queer little oldworld pantiles where a hundred years since so much good company came to take its pleasure is it possible that in the past century gentlefolks of the first rank as i read lately in a lecture on george ii in the cornhill magazine assembled here and entertained each other with gaming dancing fiddling and tea there are fiddlers harpers and trumpeters performing at this moment in a weak little old balcony but where is the fine company where are the earls duchesses bishops and magnificent embroidered gamesters a halfdozen of children and their nurses are listening to the musicians an old lady or two in a poke bonnet passes and for the rest i see but an uninteresting population of native tradesmen as for the library its window is full of pictures of burly theologians and their works sermons apologues and so forth can i go in and ask the young ladies at the counters for manfroni or the onehanded monk and life in london or the adventures of corinthian tom jeremiah hawthorn esq and their friend bob logicabsurd i turn away abashed from the casementfrom the pantilesno longer pantiles but parade i stroll over the common and survey the beautiful purple hills around twinkling with a thousand bright villas which have sprung up over this charming ground since first i saw it what an admirable scene of peace and plenty what a delicious air breathes over the heath blows the cloud shadows across it and murmurs through the fullclad trees can the world show a land fairer richer more cheerful i see a portion of it when i look up from the window at which i write but fair scene green woods bright terraces gleaming in sunshine and purple clouds swollen with summer rainnay the very pages over which my head bendsdisappear from before my eyes they are looking backwards back into forty years off into a dark room into a little house hard by on the common here in the bartlemytide holidays the parents have gone to town for two days the house is all his own his own and a grim old maidservants and a little boy is seated at night in the lonely drawingroom poring over manfroni or the onehanded monk so frightened that he scarcely dares to turn round     de juventute   our last paper of this veracious and roundabout series related to a period which can only be historical to a great number of readers of this magazine four i saw at the station today with orangecovered books in their hands who can but have known george iv by books and statues and pictures elderly gentlemen were in their prime old men in their middle age when he reigned over us his image remains on coins on a picture or two hanging here and there in a club or oldfashioned diningroom on horseback as at trafalgar square for example where i defy any monarch to look more uncomfortable he turns up in sundry memoirs and histories which have been published of late days in mr masseys history in the buckingham and grenville correspondence and gentlemen who have accused a certain writer of disloyalty are referred to those volumes to see whether the picture drawn of george is overcharged charon has paddled him off he has mingled with the crowded republic of the dead his effigy smiles from a canvas or two breechless he bestrides his steed in trafalgar square i believe he still wears his robes at madame tussauds madame herself having quitted baker street and life and found him she modelled tother side the stygian stream on the head of a fiveshilling piece we still occasionally come upon him with st george the dragonslayer on the other side of the coin ah me did this george slay many dragons was he a brave heroic champion and rescuer of virgins well well have you and i overcome all the dragons that assail us come alive and victorious out of all the caverns which we have entered in life and succored at risk of life and limb all poor distressed persons in whose naked limbs the dragon poverty is about to fasten his fangs whom the dragon crime is poisoning with his horrible breath and about to crunch up and devour o my royal liege o my gracious prince and warrior you a champion to fight that monster your feeble spear ever pierce that slimy paunch or plated back see how the flames come gurgling out of his redhot brazen throat what a roar nearer and nearer he trails with eyes flaming like the lamps of a railroad engine how he squeals rushing out through the darkness of his tunnel now he is near now he is here and nowwhatlance shield knight feathers horse and all o horror horror next day round the monsters cave there lie a few bones more you who wish to keep yours in your skins be thankful that you are not called upon to go out and fight dragons be grateful that they dont sally out and swallow you keep a wise distance from their caves lest you pay too dearly for approaching them remember that years passed and whole districts were ravaged before the warrior came who was able to cope with the devouring monster when that knight does make his appearance with all my heart let us go out and welcome him with our best songs huzzas and laurel wreaths and eagerly recognize his valor and victory but he comes only seldom countless knights were slain before st george won the battle in the battle of life are we all going to try for the honors of championship if we can do our duty if we can keep our place pretty honorably through the combat let us say laus deo at the end of it as the firing ceases and the night falls over the field  the old were middleaged the elderly were in their prime then thirty years since when yon royal george was still fighting the dragon as for you my pretty lass with your saucy hat and golden tresses tumbled in your net and you my spruce young gentleman in your mandarins cap the young folks at the countryplace where i am staying are so attired your parents were unknown to each other and wore short frocks and short jackets at the date of this fiveshilling piece only today i met a dogcart crammed with childrenchildren with moustaches and mandarin capschildren with saucy hats and hairnetschildren in short frocks and knickerbockers surely the prettiest boys dress that has appeared these hundred yearschildren from twenty years of age to six and father with mother by his side driving in frontand on fathers countenance i saw that very laugh which i remember perfectly in the time when this crownpiece was coinedin his time in king georges time when we were schoolboys seated on the same form the smile was just as broad as bright as jolly as i remember it in the pastunforgotten though not seen or thought of for how many decades of years and quite and instantly familiar though so long out of sight  any contemporary of that coin who takes it up and reads the inscription round the laurelled head georgius iv britanniarum rex fid def 1823 if he will but look steadily enough at the round and utter the proper incantation i dare say may conjure back his life there look well my elderly friend and tell me what you see first i see a sultan with hair beautiful hair and a crown of laurels round his head and his name is georgius rex fid def and so on now the sultan has disappeared and what is that i see a boya boy in a jacket he is at a desk he has great books before him latin and greek books and dictionaries yes but behind the great books which he pretends to read is a little one with pictures which he is really reading it isyes i can read nowit is the heart of mid lothian by the author of waverleyor no it is life in london or the adventures of corinthian tom jeremiah hawthorn and their friend bob logic by pierce egan and it has picturesoh such funny pictures as he reads there comes behind the boy a man a dervish in a black gown like a woman and a black square cap and he has a book in each hand and he seizes the boy who is reading the picturebook and lays his head upon one of his books and smacks it with the other the boy makes faces and so that picture disappears  now the boy has grown bigger he has got on a black gown and cap something like the dervish he is at a table with ever so many bottles on it and fruit and tobacco and other young dervishes come in they seem as if they were singing to them enters an old moollah he takes down their names and orders them all to go to bed what is this a carriage with four beautiful horses all gallopinga man in red is blowing a trumpet many young men are on the carriageone of them is driving the horses surely they wont drive into thatah they have all disappeared and now i see one of the young men alone he is walking in a streeta dark streetpresently a light comes to a window there is the shadow of a lady who passes he stands there till the light goes out now he is in a room scribbling on a piece of paper and kissing a miniature every now and then they seem to be lines each pretty much of a length i can read heart smart dart mary fairy cupid stupid true you and never mind what more bah it is bosh now see he has got a gown on again and a wig of white hair on his head and he is sitting with other dervishes in a great room full of them and on a throne in the middle is an old sultan in scarlet sitting before a desk and he wears a wig tooand the young man gets up and speaks to him and now what is here he is in a room with ever so many children and the miniature hanging up can it be a likeness of that woman who is sitting before that copper urn with a silver vase in her hand from which she is pouring hot liquor into cups was she ever a fairy she is as fat as a hippopotamus now he is sitting on a divan by the fire he has a paper on his knees read the name of the paper it is the superfine review it inclines to think that mr dickens is not a true gentleman that mr thackeray is not a true gentleman and that when the one is pert and the other is arch we the gentlemen of the superfine review think and think rightly that we have some cause to be indignant the great cause why modern humor and modern sentimentalism repel us is that they are unwarrantably familiar now mr sterne the superfine reviewer thinks was a true sentimentalist because he was above all things a true gentleman the flattering inference is obvious let us be thankful for having an elegant moralist watching over us and learn if not too old to imitate his highbred politeness and catch his unobtrusive grace if we are unwarrantably familiar we know who is not if we repel by pertness we know who never does if our language offends we know whose is always modest o pity the vision has disappeared off the silver the images of youth and the past are vanishing away we who have lived before railways were made belong to another world in how many hours could the prince of wales drive from brighton to london with a light carriage built expressly and relays of horses longing to gallop the next stage do you remember sir somebody the coachman of the age who took our halfcrown so affably it was only yesterday but what a gulf between now and then then was the old world stagecoaches more or less swift ridinghorses packhorses highwaymen knights in armor norman invaders roman legions druids ancient britons painted blue and so forthall these belong to the old period i will concede a halt in the midst of it and allow that gunpowder and printing tended to modernize the world but your railroad starts the new era and we of a certain age belong to the new time and the old one we are of the time of chivalry as well as the black prince or sir walter manny we are of the age of steam we have stepped out of the old world on to brunels vast deck and across the waters ingens patet tellus towards what new continent are we wending to what new laws new manners new politics vast new expanses of liberties unknown as yet or only surmised i used to know a man who had invented a flyingmachine sir he would say give me but five hundred pounds and i will make it it is so simple of construction that i tremble daily lest some other person should light upon and patent my discovery perhaps faith was wanting perhaps the five hundred pounds he is dead and somebody else must make the flyingmachine but that will only be a step forward on the journey already begun since we quitted the old world there it lies on the other side of yonder embankments you young folks have never seen it and waterloo is to you no more than agincourt and george iv than sardanapalus we elderly people have lived in that praerailroad world which has passed into limbo and vanished from under us i tell you it was firm under our feet once and not long ago they have raised those railroad embankments up and shut off the old world that was behind them climb up that bank on which the irons are laid and look to the other sideit is gone there is no other side try and catch yesterday where is it here is a times newspaper dated monday 26th and this is tuesday 27th suppose you deny there was such a day as yesterday  we who lived before railways and survive out of the ancient world are like father noah and his family out of the ark the children will gather round and say to us patriarchs tell us grandpapa about the old world and we shall mumble our old stories and we shall drop off one by one and there will be fewer and fewer of us and these very old and feeble there will be but ten praerailroadites left then three then twothen onethen 0 if the hippopotamus had the least sensibility of which i cannot trace any signs either in his hide or his face i think he would go down to the bottom of his tank and never come up again does he not see that he belongs to bygone ages and that his great hulking barrel of a body is out of place in these times what has he in common with the brisk young life surrounding him in the watches of the night when the keepers are asleep when the birds are on one leg when even the little armadillo is quiet and the monkeys have ceased their chatterhe i mean the hippopotamus and the elephant and the longnecked giraffe perhaps may lay their heads together and have a colloquy about the great silent antediluvian world which they remember where mighty monsters floundered through the ooze crocodiles basked on the banks and dragons darted out of the caves and waters before men were made to slay them we who lived before railways are antediluvianswe must pass away we are growing scarcer every day and oldoldvery old relicts of the times when george was still fighting the dragon  not long since a company of horseriders paid a visit to our wateringplace we went to see them and i bethought me that young walter juvenis who was in the place might like also to witness the performance a pantomime is not always amusing to persons who have attained a certain age but a boy at a pantomime is always amused and amusing and to see his pleasure is good for most hypochondriacs  we sent to walters mother requesting that he might join us and the kind lady replied that the boy had already been at the morning performance of the equestrians but was most eager to go in the evening likewise and go he did and laughed at all mr merrymans remarks though he remembered them with remarkable accuracy and insisted upon waiting to the very end of the fun and was only induced to retire just before its conclusion by representations that the ladies of the party would be incommoded if they were to wait and undergo the rush and trample of the crowd round about when this fact was pointed out to him he yielded at once though with a heavy heart his eyes looking longingly towards the ring as we retreated out of the booth we were scarcely clear of the place when we heard god save the queen played by the equestrian band the signal that all was over our companion entertained us with scraps of the dialogue on our way homeprecious crumbs of wit which he had brought away from that feast he laughed over them again as we walked under the stars he has them now and takes them out of the pocket of his memory and crunches a bit and relishes it with a sentimental tenderness too for he is no doubt back at school by this time the holidays are over and doctor birchs young friends have reassembled  queer jokes which caused a thousand simple mouths to grin as the jaded merryman uttered them to the old gentleman with the whip some of the old folks in the audience i dare say indulged in reflections of their own there was one jokei utterly forget itbut it began with merryman saying what he had for dinner he had mutton for dinner at one oclock after which he had to come to business and then came the point walter juvenis esq rev doctor birchs market rodborough if you read this will you please send me a line and let me know what was the joke mr merryman made about having his dinner you remember well enough but do i want to know suppose a boy takes a favorite longcherished lump of cake out of his pocket and offers you a bite merci the fact is i dont care much about knowing that joke of mr merrymans  but whilst he was talking about his dinner and his mutton and his landlord and his business i felt a great interest about mr m in private lifeabout his wife lodgings earnings and general history and i dare say was forming a picture of those in my mindwife cooking the mutton children waiting for it merryman in his plain clothes and so forth during which contemplation the joke was uttered and laughed at and mr m resuming his professional duties was tumbling over head and heels do not suppose i am going sicut est mos to indulge in moralities about buffoons paint motley and mountebanking nay prime ministers rehearse their jokes opposition leaders prepare and polish them tabernacle preachers must arrange them in their minds before they utter them all i mean is that i would like to know any one of these performers thoroughly and out of his uniform that preacher and why in his travels this and that point struck him wherein lies his power of pathos humor eloquencethat minister of state and what moves him and how his private heart is workingi would only say that at a certain time of life certain things cease to interest but about some things when we cease to care what will be the use of life sight hearing poems are written and we cease to admire lady jones invites us and we yawn she ceases to invite us and we are resigned the last time i saw a ballet at the operaoh it is many years agoi fell asleep in the stalls wagging my head in insane dreams and i hope affording amusement to the company while the feet of five hundred nymphs were cutting flicflacs on the stage at a few paces distance ah i remember a different state of things credite posteri to see those nymphsgracious powers how beautiful they were that leering painted shrivelled thinarmed thickankled old thing cutting dreary capers coming thumping down on her board out of timethat an operadancer pooh my dear walter the great difference between my time and yours who will enter life some two or three years hence is that now the dancing women and singing women are ludicrously old out of time and out of tune the paint is so visible and the dinge and wrinkles of their wretched old cotton stockings that i am surprised how anybody can like to look at them and as for laughing at me for falling asleep i cant understand a man of sense doing otherwise in my time a la bonne heure in the reign of george iv i give you my honor all the dancers at the opera were as beautiful as houris even in william ivs time when i think of duvernay prancing in as the bayaderei say it was a vision of loveliness such as mortal eyes cant see nowadays how well i remember the tune to which she used to appear kaled used to say to the sultan my lord a troop of those dancing and singing gurls called bayaderes approaches and to the clash of cymbals and the thumping of my heart in she used to dance there has never been anything like itnever there never will bei laugh to scorn old people who tell me about your noblet your montessu your vestris your parisotpshaw the senile twaddlers and the impudence of the young men with their music and their dancers of today i tell you the women are dreary old creatures i tell you one air in an opera is just like another and they send all rational creatures to sleep ah ronzi de begnis thou lovely one ah caradoni thou smiling angel ah malibran nay i will come to modern times and acknowledge that lablache was a very good singer thirty years ago though porto was the boy for me and then we had ambrogetti and curioni and donzelli a rising young singer  but what is most certain and lamentable is the decay of stage beauty since the days of george iv think of sontag i remember her in otello and the donna del lago in 28 i remember being behind the scenes at the opera where numbers of us young fellows of fashion used to go and seeing sontag let her hair fall down over her shoulders previous to her murder by donzelli young fellows have never seen beauty like that heard such a voice seen such hair such eyes dont tell me a man who has been about town since the reign of george iv ought he not to know better than you young lads who have seen nothing the deterioration of women is lamentable and the conceit of the young fellows more lamentable still that they wont see this fact but persist in thinking their time as good as ours  bless me when i was a lad the stage was covered with angels who sang acted and danced when i remember the adelphi and the actresses there when i think of miss chester and miss love and mrs serle at sadlers wells and her forty glorious pupilsof the opera and noblet and the exquisite young taglioni and pauline leroux and a host more one muchadmired being of those days i confess i never cared for and that was the chief male dancera very important personage then with a bare neck bare arms a tunic and a hat and feathers who used to divide the applause with the ladies and who has now sunk down a trapdoor for ever and this frank admission ought to show that i am not your mere twaddling laudator temporis actiyour old fogy who can see no good except in his own time  they say that claret is better nowadays and cookery much improved since the days of my monarchof george iv pastry cookery is certainly not so good i have often eaten half a crowns worth including i trust gingerbeer at our school pastrycooks and that is a proof that the pastry must have been very good for could i do as much now i passed by the pastrycooks shop lately having occasion to visit my old school it looked a very dingy old bakers misfortunes may have come over himthose penny tarts certainly did not look so nice as i remember them but he may have grown careless as he has grown old i should judge him to be now about ninetysix years of age and his hand may have lost its cunning  not that we were not great epicures i remember how we constantly grumbled at the quantity of the food in our masters housewhich on my conscience i believe was excellent and plentifuland how we tried once or twice to eat him out of house and home at the pastrycooks we may have overeaten ourselves i have admitted half a crowns worth for my own part but i dont like to mention the real figure for fear of perverting the present generation of boys by my monstrous confessionwe may have eaten too much i say we did but what then the school apothecary was sent for a couple of small globules at night a trifling preparation of senna in the morning and we had not to go to school so that the draught was an actual pleasure  for our amusements besides the games in vogue which were pretty much in old times as they are now except cricket par exempleand i wish the present youth joy of their bowling and suppose armstrong and whitworth will bowl at them with light fieldpieces next there were novelsah i trouble you to find such novels in the present day o scottish chiefs didnt we weep over you o mysteries of udolpho didnt i and briggs minor draw pictures out of you as i have said efforts feeble indeed but still giving pleasure to us and our friends i say old boy draw us vivaldi tortured in the inquisition or draw us don quixote and the windmills you know amateurs would say to boys who had a love of drawing peregrine pickle we liked our fathers admiring it and telling us the sly old boys it was capital fun but i think i was rather bewildered by it though roderick random was and remains delightful i dont remember having sterne in the school library no doubt because the works of that divine were not considered decent for young people ah not against thy genius o father of uncle toby and trim would i say a word in disrespect but i am thankful to live in times when men no longer have the temptation to write so as to call blushes on womens cheeks and would shame to whisper wicked allusions to honest boys then above all we had walter scott the kindly the generous the purethe companion of what countless delightful hours the purveyor of how much happiness the friend whom we recall as the constant benefactor of our youth how well i remember the type and the brownish paper of the old duodecimo tales of my landlord i have never dared to read the pirate and the bride of lammermoor or kenilworth from that day to this because the finale is unhappy and people die and are murdered at the end but ivanhoe and quentin durward oh for a halfholiday and a quiet corner and one of those books again those books and perhaps those eyes with which we read them and it may be the brains behind the eyes it may be the tart was good but how fresh the appetite was if the gods would give me the desire of my heart i should be able to write a story which boys would relish for the next few dozen of centuries the boycritic loves the story grown up he loves the author who wrote the story hence the kindly tie is established between writer and reader and lasts pretty nearly for life i meet people now who dont care for walter scott or the arabian nights i am sorry for them unless they in their time have found their romancertheir charming scheherazade by the way walter when you are writing tell me who is the favorite novelist in the fourth form now have you got anything so good and kindly as dear miss edgeworths frank it used to belong to a fellows sisters generally but though he pretended to despise it and said oh stuff for girls he read it and i think there were one or two passages which would try my eyes now were i to meet with the little book  as for thomas and jeremiah it is only my witty way of calling tom and jerry i went to the british museum the other day on purpose to get it but somehow if you will press the question so closely on reperusal tom and jerry is not so brilliant as i had supposed it to be the pictures are just as fine as ever and i shook hands with broadbacked jerry hawthorn and corinthian tom with delight after many years absence but the style of the writing i own was not pleasing to me i even thought it a little vulgarwell well other writers have been considered vulgarand as a description of the sports and amusements of london in the ancient times more curious than amusing  but the picturesoh the pictures are noble still first there is jerry arriving from the country in a green coat and leather gaiters and being measured for a fashionable suit at corinthian house by corinthian toms tailor then away for the career of pleasure and fashion the park delicious excitement the theatre the saloon the greenroom rapturous blissthe opera itself and then perhaps to temple bar to knock down a charley there there are jerry and tom with their tights and little cocked hats coming from the operavery much as gentlemen in waiting on royalty are habited now there they are at almacks itself amidst a crowd of highbred personages with the duke of clarence himself looking at them dancing now strange change they are in tom cribbs parlor where they dont seem to be a whit less at home than in fashions gilded halls and now they are at newgate seeing the irons knocked off the malefactors legs previous to execution what hardened ferocity in the countenance of the desperado in yellow breeches what compunction in the face of the gentleman in black who i suppose has been forging and who clasps his hands and listens to the chaplain now we haste away to merrier scenes to tattersalls ah gracious powers what a funny fellow that actor was who performed dicky green in that scene at the play and now we are at a private party at which corinthian tom is waltzing and very gracefully too as you must confess with corinthian kate whilst bob logic the oxonian is playing on the piano  after the text says the oxonian had played several pieces of lively music he requested as a favor that kate and his friend tom would perform a waltz kate without any hesitation immediately stood up tom offered his hand to his fascinating partner and the dance took place the plate conveys a correct representation of the gay scene at that precise moment the anxiety of the oxonian to witness the attitudes of the elegant pair had nearly put a stop to their movements on turning round from the pianoforte and presenting his comical mug kate could scarcely suppress a laugh  and no wonder just look at it now as i have copied it to the best of my humble ability and compare master logics countenance and attitude with the splendid elegance of tom now every london man is weary and blase there is an enjoyment of life in these young bucks of 1823 which contrasts strangely with our feelings of 1860 here for instance is a specimen of their talk and walk if says logicif enjoyment is your motto you may make the most of an evening at vauxhall more than at any other place in the metropolis it is all free and easy stay as long as you like and depart when you think properyour description is so flattering replied jerry that i do not care how soon the time arrives for us to start logic proposed a bit of a stroll in order to get rid of an hour or two which was immediately accepted by tom and jerry a turn or two in bond street a stroll through piccadilly a look in at tattersalls a ramble through pall mall and a strut on the corinthian path fully occupied the time of our heroes until the hour for dinner arrived when a few glasses of toms rich wines soon put them on the qui vive vauxhall was then the object in view and the trio started bent upon enjoying the pleasures which this place so amply affords        this refers to an illustrated edition of the work  how nobly those inverted commas those italics those capitals bring out the writers wit and relieve the eye they are as good as jokes though you maynt quite perceive the point mark the varieties of lounge in which the young men indulgenow a stroll then a look in then a ramble and presently a strut when george prince of wales was twenty i have read in an old magazine the princes lounge was a peculiar manner of walking which the young bucks imitated at windsor george iii had a cats patha sly early walk which the good old king took in the gray morning before his household was astir what was the corinthian path here recorded does any antiquary know and what were the rich wines which our friends took and which enabled them to enjoy vauxhall vauxhall is gone but the wines which could occasion such a delightful perversion of the intellect as to enable it to enjoy ample pleasures there what were they  so the game of life proceeds until jerry hawthorn the rustic is fairly knocked up by all this excitement and is forced to go home and the last picture represents him getting into the coach at the white horse cellar he being one of six inside whilst his friends shake him by the hand whilst the sailor mounts on the roof whilst the jews hang round with oranges knives and sealingwax whilst the guard is closing the door where are they now those sealingwax venders where are the guards where are the jolly teams where are the coaches and where the youth that climbed inside and out of them that heard the merry horn which sounds no more that saw the sun rise over stonehenge that rubbed away the bitter tears at night after parting as the coach sped on the journey to school and london that looked out with beating heart as the milestones flew by for the welcome corner where began home and holidays  it is night now and here is home gathered under the quiet roof elders and children lie alike at rest in the midst of a great peace and calm the stars look out from the heavens the silence is peopled with the past sorrowful remorses for sins and shortcomingsmemories of passionate joys and griefs rise out of their graves both now alike calm and sad eyes as i shut mine look at me that have long ceased to shine the town and the fair landscape sleep under the starlight wreathed in the autumn mists twinkling among the houses a light keeps watch here and there in what may be a sick chamber or two the clock tolls sweetly in the silent air here is night and rest an awful sense of thanks makes the heart swell and the head bow as i pass to my room through the sleeping house and feel as though a hushed blessing were upon it     on a joke i once heard from the late thomas hood   the goodnatured reader who has perused some of these rambling papers has long since seen if to see has been worth his trouble that the writer belongs to the oldfashioned classes of this world loves to remember very much more than to prophesy and though he cant help being carried onward and downward perhaps on the hill of life the swift milestones marking their forties fiftieshow many tens or lustres shall we sayhe sits under time the whitewigged charioteer with his back to the horses and his face to the past looking at the receding landscape and the hills fading into the gray distance ah me those gray distant hills were green once and here and covered with smiling people as we came up the hill there was difficulty and here and there a hard pull to be sure but strength and spirits and all sorts of cheery incident and companionship on the road there were the tough struggles by heavens merciful will overcome the pauses the faintings the weakness the lost way perhaps the bitter weather the dreadful partings the lonely night the passionate grieftowards these i turn my thoughts as i sit and think in my hobbycoach under time the silverwigged charioteer the young folks in the same carriage meanwhile are looking forwards nothing escapes their keen eyesnot a flower at the side of a cottage garden nor a bunch of rosyfaced children at the gate the landscape is all bright the air brisk and jolly the town yonder looks beautiful and do you think they have learned to be difficult about the dishes at the inn  now suppose paterfamilias on his journey with his wife and children in the sociable and he passes an ordinary brick house on the road with an ordinary little garden in the front we will say and quite an ordinary knocker to the door and as many sashed windows as you please quite common and square and tiles windows chimneypots quite like others or suppose in driving over such and such a common he sees an ordinary tree and an ordinary donkey browsing under it if you likewife and daughter look at these objects without the slightest particle of curiosity or interest what is a brass knocker to them but a lions head or what not and a thorntree with pool beside it but a pool in which a thorn and a jackass are reflected  but you remember how once upon a time your heart used to beat as you beat on that brass knocker and whose eyes looked from the window above you remember how by that thorntree and pool where the geese were performing a prodigious evening concert there might be seen at a certain hour somebody in a certain cloak and bonnet who happened to be coming from a village yonder and whose image has flickered in that pool in that pool near the thorn yes in that goosepool never mind how long ago when there were reflected the images of the geeseand two geese more here at least an oldster may have the advantage of his young fellowtravellers and so putney heath or the new road may be invested with a halo of brightness invisible to them because it only beams out of his own soul  i have been reading the memorials of hood by his children and wonder whether the book will have the same interest for others and for younger people as for persons of my own age and calling books of travel to any country become interesting to us who have been there men revisit the old school though hateful to them with ever so much kindliness and sentimental affection there was the tree under which the bully licked you here the ground where you had to fag out on holidays and so forth in a word my dear sir you are the most interesting subject to yourself of any that can occupy your worships thoughts i have no doubt a crimean soldier reading a history of that siege and how jones and the gallant 99th were ordered to charge or what not thinks ah yes we of the 100th were placed so and so i perfectly remember so with this memorial of poor hood it may have no doubt a greater interest for me than for others for i was fighting so to speak in a different part of the field and engaged a young subaltern in the battle of life in which hood fell young still and covered with glory the bridge of sighs was his corunna his heights of abrahamsickly weak wounded he fell in the full blaze and fame of that great victory        memorials of thomas hood  moxon 1860 2 vols  what manner of man was the genius who penned that famous song what like was wolfe who climbed and conquered on those famous heights of abraham we all want to know details regarding men who have achieved famous feats whether of war or wit or eloquence or endurance or knowledge his one or two happy and heroic actions take a mans name and memory out of a crowd of names and memories henceforth he stands eminent we scan him we want to know all about him we walk round and examine him are curious perhaps and think are we not as strong and tall and capable as yonder champion were we not bred as well and could we not endure the winters cold as well as he or we look up with all our eyes of admiration will find no fault in our hero declare his beauty and proportions perfect his critics envious detractors and so forth yesterday before he performed his feat he was nobody who cared about his birthplace his parentage or the color of his hair today by some single achievement or by a series of great actions to which his genius accustoms us he is famous and antiquarians are busy finding out under what schoolmasters ferule he was educated where his grandmother was vaccinated and so forth if half a dozen washingbills of goldsmiths were to be found tomorrow would they not inspire a general interest and be printed in a hundred papers i lighted upon oliver not very long since in an old town and country magazine at the pantheon masquerade in an old english habit straightway my imagination ran out to meet him to look at him to follow him about i forgot the names of scores of fine gentlemen of the past age who were mentioned besides we want to see this man who has amused and charmed us who has been our friend and given us hours of pleasant companionship and kindly thought i protest when i came in the midst of those names of people of fashion and beaux and demireps upon those names sir j rynlds in a domino mr crdck and dr gldsmth in two old english dresses i had so to speak my heart in my mouth what you here my dear sir joshua ah what an honor and privilege it is to see you this is mr goldsmith and very much sir the ruff and the slashed doublet become you o doctor what a pleasure i had and have in reading the animated nature how did you learn the secret of writing the decasyllable line and whence that sweet wailing note of tenderness that accompanies your song was beau tibbs a real man and will you do me the honor of allowing me to sit at your table at supper dont you think you know how he would have talked would you not have liked to hear him prattle over the champagne  now hood is passed awaypassed off the earth as much as goldsmith or horace the times in which he lived and in which very many of us lived and were young are changing or changed i saw hood once as a young man at a dinner which seems almost as ghostly now as that masquerade at the pantheon 1772 of which we were speaking anon it was at a dinner of the literary fund in that vast apartment which is hung round with the portraits of very large royal freemasons now unsubstantial ghosts there at the end of the room was hood some publishers i think were our companions i quite remember his pale face he was thin and deaf and very silent he scarcely opened his lips during the dinner and he made one pun some gentleman missed his snuffbox and hood saidthe freemasons tavern was kept you must remember by mr cuff in those days not by its present proprietors well the box being lost and asked for and cuff remember that name being the name of the landlord hood opened his silent jaws and said    shall i tell you what he said it was not a very good pun which the great punster then made choose your favorite pun out of whims and oddities and fancy that was the joke which he contributed to the hilarity of our little table  where those asterisks are drawn on the page you must know a pause occurred during which i was engaged with hoods own having been referred to the book by this life of the author which i have just been reading i am not going to dissert on hoods humor i am not a fair judge have i not said elsewhere that there are one or two wonderfully old gentlemen still alive who used to give me tips when i was a boy i cant be a fair critic about them i always think of that sovereign that rapture of raspberrytarts which made my young days happy those old sovereigncontributors may tell stories ever so old and i shall laugh they may commit murder and i shall believe it was justifiable homicide there is my friend baggs who goes about abusing me and of course our dear mutual friends tell me abuse away mon bon you were so kind to me when i wanted kindness that you may take the change out of that gold now and say i am a cannibal and negro if you will ha baggs dost thou wince as thou readest this line does guilty conscience throbbing at thy breast tell thee of whom the fable is narrated puff out thy wrath and when it has ceased to blow my baggs shall be to me as the baggs of oldthe generous the gentle the friendly  no on second thoughts i am determined i will not repeat that joke which i heard hood make he says he wrote these jokes with such ease that he sent manuscripts to the publishers faster than they could acknowledge the receipt thereof i wont say that they were all good jokes or that to read a great book full of them is a work at present altogether jocular writing to a friend respecting some memoir of him which had been published hood says you will judge how well the author knows me when he says my mind is rather serious than comic at the time when he wrote these words he evidently undervalued his own serious power and thought that in punning and broadgrinning lay his chief strength is not there something touching in that simplicity and humility of faith to make laugh is my calling says he i must jump i must grin i must tumble i must turn language head over heels and leap through grammar and he goes to his work humbly and courageously and what he has to do that does he with all his might through sickness through sorrow through exile poverty fever depressionthere he is always ready to his work and with a jewel of genius in his pocket why when he laid down his puns and pranks put the motley off and spoke out of his heart all england and america listened with tears and wonder other men have delusions of conceit and fancy themselves greater than they are and that the world slights them have we not heard how liston always thought he ought to play hamlet here is a man with a power to touch the heart almost unequalled and he passes days and years in writing young ben he was a nice young man and so forth to say truth i have been reading in a book of hoods own until i am perfectly angry you great man you good man you true genius and poet i cry out as i turn page after page do do make no more of these jokes but be yourself and take your station  when hood was on his deathbed sir robert peel who only knew of his illness not of his imminent danger wrote to him a noble and touching letter announcing that a pension was conferred on him   i am more than repaid writes peel by the personal satisfaction which i have had in doing that for which you return me warm and characteristic acknowledgments  you perhaps think that you are known to one with such multifarious occupations as myself merely by general reputation as an author but i assure you that there can be little which you have written and acknowledged which i have not read and that there are few who can appreciate and admire more than myself the good sense and good feeling which have taught you to infuse so much fun and merriment into writings correcting folly and exposing absurdities and yet never trespassing beyond those limits within which wit and facetiousness are not very often confined you may write on with the consciousness of independence as free and unfettered as if no communication had ever passed between us i am not conferring a private obligation upon you but am fulfilling the intentions of the legislature which has placed at the disposal of the crown a certain sum miserable indeed in amount to be applied to the recognition of public claims on the bounty of the crown if you will review the names of those whose claims have been admitted on account of their literary or scientific eminence you will find an ample confirmation of the truth of my statement  one return indeed i shall ask of youthat you will give me the opportunity of making your personal acquaintance   and hood writing to a friend enclosing a copy of peels letter says sir r peel came from burleigh on tuesday night and went down to brighton on saturday if he had written by post i should not have it till today so he sent his servant with the enclosed on saturday night another mark of considerate attention he is frightfully unwell he continues his wife says he looks quite green but ill as he is poor fellow his well is not dry he has pumped out a sheet of christmas fun is drawing some cuts and shall write a sheet more of his novel  oh sad marvellous picture of courage of honesty of patient endurance of duty struggling against pain how noble peels figure is standing by that sickbed how generous his words how dignified and sincere his compassion and the poor dying man with a heart full of natural gratitude towards his noble benefactor must turn to him and sayif it be well to be remembered by a minister it is better still not to be forgotten by him in a hurly burleigh can you laugh is not the joke horribly pathetic from the poor dying lips as dying robin hood must fire a last shot with his bowas one reads of catholics on their deathbeds putting on a capuchin dress to go out of the worldhere is poor hood at his last hour putting on his ghastly motley and uttering one joke more  he dies however in dearest love and peace with his children wife friends to the former especially his whole life had been devoted and every day showed his fidelity simplicity and affection in going through the record of his most pure modest honorable life and living along with him you come to trust him thoroughly and feel that here is a most loyal affectionate and upright soul with whom you have been brought into communion can we say as much of the lives of all men of letters here is one at least without guile without pretension without scheming of a pure life to his family and little modest circle of friends tenderly devoted  and what a hard work and what a slender reward in the little domestic details with which the book abounds what a simple life is shown to us the most simple little pleasures and amusements delight and occupy him you have revels on shrimps the good wife making the pie details about the maid and criticisms on her conduct wonderful tricks played with the plumpuddingall the pleasures centring round the little humble home one of the first men of his time he is appointed editor of a magazine at a salary of 300l per annum signs himself exultingly ed n m m and the family rejoice over the income as over a fortune he goes to a greenwich dinnerwhat a feast and a rejoicing afterwards   well we drank the boz with a delectable clatter which drew from him a good warmhearted speech    he looked very well and had a younger brother along with him    then we had songs barham chanted a robin hood ballad and cruikshank sang a burlesque ballad of lord h and somebody unknown to me gave a capital imitation of a french showman then we toasted mrs boz and the chairman and vice and the traditional priest sang the deep deep sea in his deep deep voice and then we drank to procter who wrote the said song also sir j wilsons good health and cruikshanks and ainsworths and a manchester friend of the latter sang a manchester ditty so full of trading stuff that it really seemed to have been not composed but manufactured jerdan as jerdanish as usual on such occasionsyou know how paradoxically he is quite at home in dining out as to myself i had to make my second maiden speech for mr monckton milnes proposed my health in terms my modesty might allow me to repeat to you but my memory wont however i ascribed the toast to my notoriously bad health and assured them that their wishes had already improved itthat i felt a brisker circulationa more genial warmth about the heart and explained that a certain trembling of my hand was not from palsy or my old ague but an inclination in my hand to shake itself with every one present whereupon i had to go through the friendly ceremony with as many of the company as were within reach besides a few more who came express from the other end of the table very gratifying wasnt it though i cannot go quite so far as jane who wants me to have that hand chopped off bottled and preserved in spirits she was sitting up for me very anxiously as usual when i go out because i am so domestic and steady and was down at the door before i could ring at the gate to which boz kindly sent me in his own carriage poor girl what would she do if she had a wild husband instead of a tame one   and the poor anxious wife is sitting up and fondles the hand which has been shaken by so many illustrious men the little feast dates back only eighteen years and yet somehow it seems as distant as a dinner at mr thrales or a meeting at wills  poor little gleam of sunshine very little good cheer enlivens that sad simple life we have the triumph of the magazine then a new magazine projected and produced then illness and the last scene and the kind peel by the dying mans bedside speaking noble words of respect and sympathy and soothing the last throbs of the tender honest heart  i like i say hoods life even better than his books and i wish with all my heart monsieur et cher confrere the same could be said for both of us when the inkstream of our life hath ceased to run yes if i drop first dear baggs i trust you may find reason to modify some of the unfavorable views of my character which you are freely imparting to our mutual friends what ought to be the literary mans point of honor nowadays suppose friendly reader you are one of the craft what legacy would you like to leave to your children first of all and by heavens gracious help you would pray and strive to give them such an endowment of love as should last certainly for all their lives and perhaps be transmitted to their children you would by the same aid and blessing keep your honor pure and transmit a name unstained to those who have a right to bear it you wouldthough this faculty of giving is one of the easiest of the literary mans qualitiesyou would out of your earnings small or great be able to help a poor brother in need to dress his wounds and if it were but twopence to give him succor is the money which the noble macaulay gave to the poor lost to his family god forbid to the loving hearts of his kindred is it not rather the most precious part of their inheritance it was invested in love and righteous doing and it bears interest in heaven you will if letters be your vocation find saving harder than giving and spending to save be your endeavor too against the nights coming when no man may work when the arm is weary with the long days labor when the brain perhaps grows dark when the old who can labor no more want warmth and rest and the young ones call for supper   i copied the little galleyslave who is made to figure in the initial letter of this paper from a quaint old silver spoon which we purchased in a curiosityshop at the hague it is one of the gift spoons so common in holland and which have multiplied so astonishingly of late years at our dealers in old silverware along the stem of the spoon are written the words anno 1609 bin ick aldus ghekledt gheghaenin the year 1609 i went thus clad the good dutchman was released from his algerine captivity i imagine his figure looks like that of a slave amongst the moors and in his thankoffering to some godchild at home he thus piously records his escape        this refers to an illustrated edition of the work  was not poor cervantes also a captive amongst the moors did not fielding and goldsmith and smollett too die at the chain as well as poor hood think of fielding going on board his wretched ship in the thames with scarce a hand to bid him farewell of brave tobias smollett and his life how hard and how poorly rewarded of goldsmith and the physician whispering have you something on your mind and the wild dying eyes answering yes notice how boswell speaks of goldsmith and the splendid contempt with which he regards him read hawkins on fielding and the scorn with which dandy walpole and bishop hurd speak of him galleyslaves doomed to tug the oar and wear the chain whilst my lords and dandies take their pleasure and hear fine music and disport with fine ladies in the cabin  but stay was there any cause for this scorn had some of these great men weaknesses which gave inferiors advantage over them men of letters cannot lay their hands on their hearts and say no the fault was fortunes and the indifferent worlds not goldsmiths nor fieldings there was no reason why oliver should always be thriftless why fielding and steele should sponge upon their friends why sterne should make love to his neighbors wives swift for a long time was as poor as any wag that ever laughed but he owed no penny to his neighbors addison when he wore his most threadbare coat could hold his head up and maintain his dignity and i dare vouch neither of those gentlemen when they were ever so poor asked any man alive to pity their condition and have a regard to the weaknesses incidental to the literary profession galleyslave forsooth if you are sent to prison for some error for which the law awards that sort of laborious seclusion so much the more shame for you if you are chained to the oar a prisoner of war like cervantes you have the pain but not the shame and the friendly compassion of mankind to reward you galleyslaves indeed what man has not his oar to pull there is that wonderful old strokeoar in the queens galley how many years has he pulled day and night in rough water or smooth with what invincible vigor and surprising gayety he plies his arms there is in the same galere capitaine that wellknown trim figure the bowoar how he tugs and with what a will how both of them have been abused in their time take the lawyers galley and that dauntless octogenarian in command when has he ever complained or repined about his slavery there is the priests galleyblack and lawn sailsdo any mariners out of thames work harder when lawyer and statesman and divine and writer are snug in bed there is a ring at the poor doctors bell forth he must go in rheumatism or snow a galleyslave bearing his galleypots to quench the flames of fever to succor mothers and young children in their hour of peril and as gently and soothingly as may be to carry the hopeless patient over to the silent shore and have we not just read of the actions of the queens galleys and their brave crews in the chinese waters men not more worthy of human renown and honor today in their victory than last year in their glorious hour of disaster so with stout hearts may we ply the oar messmates all till the voyage is over and the harbor of rest is found     round about the christmas tree   the kindly christmas tree from which i trust every gentle reader has pulled a bonbon or two is yet all aflame whilst i am writing and sparkles with the sweet fruits of its season you young ladies may you have plucked pretty giftlings from it and out of the cracker sugarplum which you have split with the captain or the sweet young curate may you have read one of those delicious conundrums which the confectioners introduce into the sweetmeats and which apply to the cunning passion of love those riddles are to be read at your age when i dare say they are amusing as for dolly merry and bell who are standing at the tree they dont care about the loveriddle part but understand the sweetalmond portion very well they are four five six years old patience little people a dozen merry christmases more and you will be reading those wonderful loveconundrums too as for us elderly folks we watch the babies at their sport and the young people pulling at the branches and instead of finding bonbons or sweeties in the packets which we pluck off the boughs we find enclosed mr carnifexs review of the quarters meat mr sartors compliments and little statement for self and the young gentlemen and madame de saintecrinolines respects to the young ladies who encloses her account and will send on saturday please or we stretch our hand out to the educational branch of the christmas tree and there find a lively and amusing article from the rev henry holyshade containing our dear tommys exceedingly moderate account for the last terms school expenses  the tree yet sparkles i say i am writing on the day before twelfth day if you must know but already ever so many of the fruits have been pulled and the christmas lights have gone out bobby miseltow who has been staying with us for a week and who has been sleeping mysteriously in the bathroom comes to say he is going away to spend the rest of the holidays with his grandmotherand i brush away the manly tear of regret as i part with the dear child well bob goodby since you will go compliments to grandmamma thank her for the turkey heres a slight pecuniary transaction takes place at this juncture and bob nods and winks and puts his hand in his waistcoat pocket you have had a pleasant week  bobhavent i and exit anxious to know the amount of the coin which has just changed hands  he is gone and as the dear boy vanishes through the door behind which i see him perfectly i too cast up a little account of our past christmas week when bobs holidays are over and the printer has sent me back this manuscript i know christmas will be an old story all the fruit will be off the christmas tree then the crackers will have cracked off the almonds will have been crunched and the sweetbitter riddles will have been read the lights will have perished off the dark green boughs the toys growing on them will have been distributed fought for cherished neglected broken ferdinand and fidelia will each keep out of it be still my gushing heart the remembrance of a riddle read together of a doublealmond munched together and the moiety of an exploded cracker    the maids i say will have taken down all that holly stuff and nonsense about the clocks lamps and lookingglasses the dear boys will be back at school fondly thinking of the pantomimefairies whom they have seen whose gaudy gossamer wings are battered by this time and whose pink cotton or silk is it lower extremities are all dingy and dusty yet but a few days bob and flakes of paint will have cracked off the fairy flowerbowers and the revolving temples of adamantine lustre will be as shabby as the city of pekin when you read this will clown still be going on lolling his tongue out of his month and saying how are you tomorrow tomorrow indeed he must be almost ashamed of himself if that cheek is still capable of the blush of shame for asking the absurd question tomorrow indeed tomorrow the diffugient snows will give place to spring the snowdrops will lift their heads ladyday may be expected and the pecuniary duties peculiar to that feast in place of bonbons trees will have an eruption of light green knobs the whitebait season will bloom    as if one need go on describing these vernal phenomena when christmas is still here though ending and the subject of my discourse  we have all admired the illustrated papers and noted how boisterously jolly they become at christmas time what wassailbowls robinredbreasts waits snow landscapes bursts of christmas song and then to think that these festivities are prepared months beforethat these christmas pieces are prophetic how kind of artists and poets to devise the festivities beforehand and serve them pat at the proper time we ought to be grateful to them as to the cook who gets up at midnight and sets the pudding aboiling which is to feast us at six oclock i often think with gratitude of the famous mr nelson leethe author of i dont know how many hundred glorious pantomimeswalking by the summer wave at margate or brighton perhaps revolving in his mind the idea of some new gorgeous spectacle of faery which the winter shall see complete he is like cook at midnight si parva licet he watches and thinks he pounds the sparkling sugar of benevolence the plums of fancy the sweetmeats of fun the figs ofwell the figs of fairy fiction let us say and pops the whole in the seething caldron of imagination and at due season serves up the pantomime  very few men in the course of nature can expect to see all the pantomimes in one season but i hope to the end of my life i shall never forego reading about them in that delicious sheet of the times which appears on the morning after boxingday perhaps reading is even better than seeing the best way i think is to say you are ill lie in bed and have the paper for two hours reading all the way down from drury lane to the britannia at hoxton bob and i went to two pantomimes one was at the theatre of fancy and the other at the fairy opera and i dont know which we liked the best  at the fancy we saw harlequin hamlet or daddys ghost and nunkys pison which is all very wellbut gentlemen if you dont respect shakspeare to whom will you be civil the palace and ramparts of elsinore by moon and snowlight is one of loutherbourgs finest efforts the banqueting hall of the palace is illuminated the peaks and gables glitter with the snow the sentinels march blowing their fingers with the coldthe freezing of the nose of one of them is very neatly and dexterously arranged the snowstorm rises the winds howl awfully along the battlements the waves come curling leaping foaming to shore hamlets umbrella is whirled away in the storm he and his two friends stamp on each others toes to keep them warm the stormspirits rise in the air and are whirled howling round the palace and the rocks my eyes what tiles and chimneypots fly hurtling through the air as the storm reaches its height here the wind instruments come in with prodigious effect and i compliment mr brumby and the violoncellosas the snowstorm rises queek queek queek go the fiddles and then thrumpty thrump comes a pizzicato movement in bob major which sends a shiver into your very bootsoles the thunderclouds deepen bong bong bong from the violoncellos the forked lightning quivers through the clouds in a zigzag scream of violinsand look look look as the frothing roaring waves come rushing up the battlements and over the reeling parapet each hissing wave becomes a ghost sends the guncarriages rolling over the platform and plunges howling into the water again  hamlets mother comes on to the battlements to look for her son the storm whips her umbrella out of her hands and she retires screaming in pattens  the cabs on the stand in the great marketplace at elsinore are seen to drive off and several people are drowned the gaslamps along the street are wrenched from their foundations and shoot through the troubled air whist rush hish how the rain roars and pours the darkness becomes awful always deepened by the power of the musicand seein the midst of a rush and whirl and scream of spirits of air and wavewhat is that ghastly figure moving hither it becomes bigger bigger as it advances down the platformmore ghastly more horrible enormous it is as tall as the whole stage it seems to be advancing on the stalls and pit and the whole house screams with terror as the ghost of the late hamlet comes in and begins to speak several people faint and the lightfingered gentry pick pockets furiously in the darkness  in the pitchy darkness this awful figure throwing his eyes about the gas in the boxes shuddering out of sight and the windinstruments bugling the most horrible wails the boldest spectator must have felt frightened but hark what is that silver shimmer of the fiddles is itcan it bethe gray dawn peeping in the stormy east the ghosts eyes look blankly towards it and roll a ghastly agony quicker quicker ply the violins of phoebus apollo redder redder grow the orient clouds cockadoodledoo crows that great cock which has just come out on the roof of the palace and now the round sun himself pops up from behind the waves of night where is the ghost he is gone purple shadows of morn slant oer the snowy sward the city wakes up in life and sunshine and we confess we are very much relieved at the disappearance of the ghost we dont like those dark scenes in pantomimes  after the usual business that ophelia should be turned into columbine was to be expected but i confess i was a little shocked when hamlets mother became pantaloon and was instantly knocked down by clown claudius grimaldi is getting a little old now but for real humor there are few clowns like him mr shuter as the gravedigger was chaste and comic as he always is and the scenepainters surpassed themselves  harlequin conqueror and the field of hastings at the other house is very pleasant too the irascible william is acted with great vigor by snoxall and the battle of hastings is a good piece of burlesque some trifling liberties are taken with history but what liberties will not the merry genius of pantomime permit himself at the battle of hastings william is on the point of being defeated by the sussex volunteers very elegantly led by the always pretty miss waddy as haco sharpshooter when a shot from the normans kills harold the fairy edith hereupon comes forward and finds his body which straightway leaps up a live harlequin whilst the conqueror makes an excellent clown and the archbishop of bayeux a diverting pantaloon c c c  perhaps these are not the pantomimes we really saw but one description will do as well as another the plots you see are a little intricate and difficult to understand in pantomimes and i may have mixed up one with another that i was at the theatre on boxingnight is certainbut the pit was so full that i could only see fairy legs glittering in the distance as i stood at the door and if i was badly off i think there was a young gentleman behind me worse off still i own that he has good reason though others have not to speak ill of me behind my back and hereby beg his pardon  likewise to the gentleman who picked up a party in piccadilly who had slipped and fallen in the snow and was there on his back uttering energetic expressions that party begs to offer thanks and compliments of the season  bobs behavior on new years day i can assure dr holyshade was highly creditable to the boy he had expressed a determination to partake of every dish which was put on the table but after soup fish roastbeef and roastgoose he retired from active business until the pudding and mincepies made their appearance of which he partook liberally but not too freely and he greatly advanced in my good opinion by praising the punch which was of my own manufacture and which some gentlemen present mr omgn amongst others pronounced to be too weak too weak a bottle of rum a bottle of madeira half a bottle of brandy and two bottles and a half of watercan this mixture be said to be too weak for any mortal our young friend amused the company during the evening by exhibiting a twoshilling magiclantern which he had purchased and likewise by singing sally come up a quaint but rather monotonous melody which i am told is sung by the poor negro on the banks of the broad mississippi  what other enjoyments did we proffer for the childs amusement during the christmas week a great philosopher was giving a lecture to young folks at the british institution but when this diversion was proposed to our young friend bob he said lecture no thank you not as i knows on and made sarcastic signals on his nose perhaps he is of dr johnsons opinion about lectures lectures sir what man would go to hear that imperfectly at a lecture which he can read at leisure in a book i never went of my own choice to a lecture that i can vow as for sermons they are different i delight in them and they cannot of course be too long  well we partook of yet other christmas delights besides pantomime pudding and pie one glorious one delightful one most unlucky and pleasant day we drove in a brougham with a famous horse which carried us more quickly and briskly than any of your vulgar railways over battersea bridge on which the horses hoofs rung as if it had been iron through suburban villages plumcaked with snow under a leaden sky in which the sun hung like a redhot warmingpan by pond after pond where not only men and boys but scores after scores of women and girls were sliding and roaring and clapping their lean old sides with laughter as they tumbled down and their hobnailed shoes flew up in the air the air frosty with a lilac haze through which villas and commons and churches and plantations glimmered we drive up the hill bob and i we make the last two miles in eleven minutes we pass that poor armless man who sits there in the cold following you with his eyes i dont give anything and bob looks disappointed we are set down neatly at the gate and a horseholder opens the brougham door i dont give anything again disappointment on bobs part i pay a shilling apiece and we enter into the glorious building which is decorated for christmas and straightway forgetfulness on bobs part of everything but that magnificent scene the enormous edifice is all decorated for bob and christmas the stalls the columns the fountains courts statues splendors are all crowned for christmas the delicious negro is singing his alabama choruses for christmas and bob he has scarcely done when tootarootatoo mr punch is performing his surprising actions and hanging the beadle the stalls are decorated the refreshmenttables are piled with good things at many fountains mulled claret is written up in appetizing capitals mulled claretoh jolly how cold it is says bob i pass on its only three oclock says bob no only three i say meekly we dine at seven sighs bob and its sooo cooold i still would take no hints no claret no refreshment no sandwiches no sausagerolls for bob at last i am obliged to tell him all just before we left home a little christmas bill popped in at the door and emptied my purse at the threshold i forgot all about the transaction and had to borrow half a crown from john coachman to pay for our entrance into the palace of delight now you see bob why i could not treat you on that second of january when we drove to the palace together when the girls and boys were sliding on the ponds at dulwich when the darkling river was full of floating ice and the sun was like a warmingpan in the leaden sky  one more christmas sight we had of course and that sight i think i like as well as bob himself at christmas and at all seasons we went to a certain garden of delight where whatever your cares are i think you can manage to forget some of them and muse and be not unhappy to a garden beginning with a z which is as lively as noahs ark where the fox has brought his brush and the cock has brought his comb and the elephant has brought his trunk and the kangaroo has brought his bag and the condor his old white wig and black satin hood on this day it was so cold that the white bears winked their pink eyes as they plapped up and down by their pool and seemed to say aha this weather reminds us of our dear home cold bah i have got such a warm coat says brother bruin i dont mind and he laughs on his pole and clucks down a bun the squealing hyaenas gnashed their teeth and laughed at us quite refreshingly at their window and cold as it was tiger tiger burning bright glared at us redhot through his bars and snorted blasts of hell the woolly camel leered at us quite kindly as he paced round his ring on his silent pads we went to our favorite places our dear wambat came up and had himself scratched very affably our fellowcreatures in the monkeyroom held out their little black hands and piteously asked us for christmas alms those darling alligators on their rock winked at us in the most friendly way the solemn eagles sat alone and scowled at us from their peaks whilst little tom ratel tumbled over head and heels for us in his usual diverting manner if i have cares in my mind i come to the zoo and fancy they dont pass the gate i recognize my friends my enemies in countless cages i entertained the eagle the vulture the old billygoat and the blackpated crimsonnecked bleareyed baggy hookbeaked old marabou stork yesterday at dinner and when bobs aunt came to tea in the evening and asked him what he had seen he stepped up to her gravely and said       first i saw the white bear then i saw the black      then i saw the camel with a hump upon his back  chorus of children       then i saw the camel with a hump upon his back       then i saw the gray wolf with mutton in his maw      then i saw the wambat waddle in the straw      then i saw the elephant with his waving trunk      then i saw the monkeysmercy how unpleasantly theysmelt  there no one can beat that piece of wit can he bob and so it is all over but we had a jolly time whilst you were with us hadnt we present my respects to the doctor and i hope my boy we may spend another merry christmas next year     on a chalkmark on the door   on the doorpost of the house of a friend of mine a few inches above the lock is a little chalkmark which some sportive boy in passing has probably scratched on the pillar the doorsteps the lock handle and so forth are kept decently enough but this chalkmark i suppose some three inches out of the housemaids beat has already been on the door for more than a fortnight and i wonder whether it will be there whilst this paper is being written whilst it is at the printers and in fine until the month passes over i wonder whether the servants in that house will read these remarks about the chalkmark that the cornhill magazine is taken in in that house i know in fact i have seen it there in fact i have read it there in fact i have written it there in a word the house to which i allude is minethe editors private residence to which in spite of prayers entreaties commands and threats authors and ladies especially will send their communications although they wont understand that they injure their own interests by so doing for how is a man who has his own work to do his own exquisite inventions to form and perfectmaria to rescue from the unprincipled earlthe atrocious general to confound in his own machinationsthe angelic dean to promote to a bishopric and so forthhow is a man to do all this under a hundred interruptions and keep his nerves and temper in that just and equable state in which they ought to be when he comes to assume the critical office as you will send here ladies i must tell you you have a much worse chance than if you forward your valuable articles to cornhill here your papers arrive at dinnertime we will say do you suppose that is a pleasant period and that we are to criticise you between the ovum and malum between the soup and the dessert i have touched i think on this subject before i say again if you want real justice shown you dont send your papers to the private residence at home for instance yesterday having given strict orders that i was to receive nobody except on business do you suppose a smiling young scottish gentleman who forced himself into my study and there announced himself as agent of a cattlefood company was received with pleasure there as i sat in my armchair suppose he had proposed to draw a couple of my teeth would i have been pleased i could have throttled that agent i dare say the whole of that days work will be found tinged with a ferocious misanthropy occasioned by my clever young friends intrusion cattlefood indeed as if beans oats warm mashes and a ball are to be pushed down a mans throat just as he is meditating on the great social problem or for i think it was my epic i was going to touch up just as he was about to soar to the height of the empyrean  having got my cattleagent out of the door i resume my consideration of that little mark on the doorpost which is scored up as the text of the present little sermon and which i hope will relate not to chalk nor to any of its special uses or abuses such as milk neckpowder and the like but to servants surely ours might remove that unseemly little mark suppose it were on my coat might i not request its removal i remember when i was at school a little careless boy upon whose forehead an inkmark remained and was perfectly recognizable for three weeks after its first appearance may i take any notice of this chalkstain on the forehead of my house whose business is it to wash that forehead and ought i to fetch a brush and a little hot water and wash it off myself  yes but that spot removed why not come down at six and wash the doorsteps i dare say the early rising and exercise would do me a great deal of good the housemaid in that case might lie in bed a little later and have her tea and the morning paper brought to her in bed then of course thomas would expect to be helped about the boots and knives cook about the saucepans dishes and what not the ladysmaid would want somebody to take the curlpapers out of her hair and get her bath ready you should have a set of servants for the servants and these under servants should have slaves to wait on them the king commands the first lord in waiting to desire the second lord to intimate to the gentleman usher to request the page of the antechamber to entreat the groom of the stairs to implore john to ask the captain of the buttons to desire the maid of the stillroom to beg the housekeeper to give out a few more lumps of sugar as his majesty has none for his coffee which probably is getting cold during the negotiation in our little brentfords we are all kings more or less there are orders gradations hierarchies everywhere in your house and mine there are mysteries unknown to us i am not going in to the horrid old question of followers i dont mean cousins from the country lovestricken policemen or gentlemen in mufti from knightsbridge barracks but people who have an occult right on the premises the uncovenanted servants of the house gray women who are seen at evening with baskets flitting about arearailings dingy shawls which drop you furtive curtsies in your neighborhood demure little jacks who start up from behind boxes in the pantry those outsiders wear thomass crest and livery and call him sir those silent women address the female servants as mum and curtsy before them squaring their arms over their wretched lean aprons then again those servi servorum have dependants in the vast silent povertystricken world outside your comfortable kitchen fire in the world of darkness and hunger and miserable cold and dank flagged cellars and huddled straw and rags in which pale children are swarming it may be your beer which runs with great volubility has a pipe or two which communicates with those dark caverns where hopeless anguish pours the groan and would scarce see light but for a scrap or two of candle which has been whipped away from your worships kitchen not many years agoi dont know whether before or since that white mark was drawn on the doora lady occupied the confidential place of housemaid in this private residence who brought a good character who seemed to have a cheerful temper whom i used to hear clattering and bumping overhead or on the stairs long before daylightthere i say was poor camilla scouring the plain trundling and brushing and clattering with her pans and brooms and humming at her work well she had established a smuggling communication of beer over the area frontier this neathanded phyllis used to pack up the nicest baskets of my provender and convey them to somebody outsidei believe on my conscience to some poor friend in distress camilla was consigned to her doom she was sent back to her friends in the country and when she was gone we heard of many of her faults she expressed herself when displeased in language that i shall not repeat as for the beer and meat there was no mistake about them but apres can i have the heart to be very angry with that poor jade for helping another poorer jade out of my larder on your honor and conscience when you were a boy and the apples looked temptingly over farmer quarringdons hedge did you never when there was a grand dinner at home and you were sliding with master bacon up and down the stairs and the dishes came out did you ever do such a thing as just to well in many and many a respect servants are like children they are under domination they are subject to reproof to ill temper to petty exactions and stupid tyrannies not seldom they scheme conspire fawn and are hypocrites little boys should not loll on chairs little girls should be seen and not heard and so forth have we not almost all learnt these expressions of old foozles and uttered them ourselves when in the squaretoed state the eton master who was breaking a lance with our paterfamilias of late turned on paterfamilias saying he knows not the nature and exquisite candor of wellbred english boys exquisite fiddlesticks end mr master do you mean for to go for to tell us that the relations between young gentlemen and their schoolmasters are entirely frank and cordial that the lad is familiar with the man who can have him flogged never shirks his exercise never gets other boys to do his verses never does other boys verses never breaks bounds never tells fibsi mean the fibs permitted by scholastic honor did i know of a boy who pretended to such a character i would forbid my scapegraces to keep company with him did i know a schoolmaster who pretended to believe in the existence of many hundred such boys in one school at one time i would set that man down as a baby in knowledge of the world who was making that noise i dont know sirand he knows it was the boy next him in school who was climbing over that wall i dont know sirand it is in the speakers own trousers very likely the glass bottletops have left their cruel scars and so with servants who ate up the three pigeons which went down in the pigeonpie at breakfast this morning o dear me sir it was john who went away last monthor i think it was miss marys canarybird which got out of the cage and is so fond of pigeons it never can have enough of them yes it was the canarybird and eliza saw it and eliza is ready to vow she did these statements are not true but please dont call them lies this is not lying this is voting with your party you must back your own side the servantshall stands by the servantshall against the diningroom the schoolboys dont tell tales of each other they agree not to choose to know who has made the noise who has broken the window who has eaten up the pigeons who has picked all the ploverseggs out of the aspic how it is that liqueur brandy of gledstanes is in such porous glass bottlesand so forth suppose brutus had a footman who came and told him that the butler drank the curacoa which of these servants would you dismissthe butler perhaps but the footman certainly  no if your plate and glass are beautifully bright your bell quickly answered and thomas ready neat and goodhumored you are not to expect absolute truth from him the very obsequiousness and perfection of his service prevents truth he may be ever so unwell in mind or body and he must go through his servicehand the shining plate replenish the spotless glass lay the glittering forknever laugh when you yourself or your guests jokebe profoundly attentive and yet look utterly impassiveexchange a few hurried curses at the door with that unseen slavey who ministers without and with you be perfectly calm and polite if you are ill he will come twenty times in an hour to your bell or leave the girl of his hearthis mother who is going to americahis dearest friend who has come to say farewellhis lunch and his glass of beer just freshly poured outany or all of these if the doorbell rings or the master calls out thomas from the hall do you suppose you can expect absolute candor from a man whom you may order to powder his hair as between the rev henry holyshade and his pupil the idea of entire unreserve is utter bosh so the truth as between you and jeames or thomas or mary the housemaid or betty the cook is relative and not to be demanded on one side or the other why respectful civility is itself a lie which poor jeames often has to utter or perform to many a swaggering vulgarian who should black jeamess boots did jeames wear them and not shoes there is your little tom just ten ordering the great large quiet orderly young man aboutshrieking calls for hot waterbullying jeames because the boots are not varnished enough or ordering him to go to the stables and ask jenkins why the deuce tomkins hasnt brought his pony roundor what you will there is mamma rapping the knuckles of pincot the ladysmaid and little miss scolding martha who waits up five pair of stairs in the nursery little miss tommy papa mamma you all expect from martha from pincot from jenkins from jeames obsequious civility and willing service my dear good people you cant have truth too suppose you ask for your newspaper and jeames says im reading it and jest beg not to be disturbed or suppose you ask for a can of water and he remarks you great big ulking fellar aint you big enough to bring it hup yoursulf what would your feelings be now if you made similar proposals or requests to mr jones next door this is the kind of answer jones would give you you get truth habitually from equals only so my good mr holyshade dont talk to me about the habitual candor of the young etonian of high birth or i have my own opinion of your candor or discernment when you do no tom bowling is the soul of honor and has been true to blackeyed syousan since the last time they parted at wapping old stairs but do you suppose tom is perfectly frank familiar and aboveboard in his conversation with admiral nelson kcb there are secrets prevarications fibs if you will between tom and the admiralbetween your crew and their captain i know i hire a worthy clean agreeable and conscientious male or female hypocrite at so many guineas a year to do so and so for me were he other than hypocrite i would send him about his business dont let my displeasure be too fierce with him for a fib or two on his own account  some dozen years ago my family being absent in a distant part of the country and my business detaining me in london i remained in my own house with three servants on board wages i used only to breakfast at home and future ages will be interested to know that this meal used to consist at that period of tea a penny roll a pat of butter and perhaps an egg my weekly bill used invariably to be about fifty shillings so that as i never dined in the house you see my breakfast consisting of the delicacies before mentioned cost about seven shillings and threepence per diem i must therefore have consumed daily       s d      a quarter of a pound of tea say   1  3      a penny roll say                  1  0      one pound of butter say           1  3      one pound of lump sugar             1  0      a newlaid egg                      2  9  which is the only possible way i have for making out the sum  well i fell ill while under this regimen and had an illness which but for a certain doctor who was brought to me by a certain kind friend i had in those days would i think have prevented the possibility of my telling this interesting anecdote now a dozen years after dont be frightened my dear madam it is not a horrid sentimental account of a malady you are coming toonly a question of grocery this illness i say lasted some seventeen days during which the servants were admirably attentive and kind and poor john especially was up at all hours watching night after nightamiable cheerful untiring respectful the very best of johns and nurses  twice or thrice in the seventeen days i may have had a glass of eau sucreesay a dozen glasses of eau sucreecertainly not more well this admirable watchful cheerful tender affectionate john brought me in a little bill for seventeen pounds of sugar consumed during the illnessoften ad sugar and water always was a callin for it says john wagging his head quite gravely you are dead years and years ago poor johnso patient so friendly so kind so cheerful to the invalid in the fever but confess now wherever you are that seventeen pounds of sugar to make six glasses of eau sucree was a little too strong wasnt it john ah how frankly how trustily how bravely he lied poor john one evening being at brighton in the convalescence i remember johns step was unsteady his voice thick his laugh queerand having some quinine to give me john brought the glass to menot to my mouth but struck me with it pretty smartly in the eye which was not the way in which dr elliotson had intended his prescription should be taken turning that eye upon him i ventured to hint that my attendant had been drinking drinking i never was more humiliated at the thought of my own injustice than at johns reply drinking sulp me i have had only one pint of beer with my dinner at one oclockand he retreats holding on by a chair these are fibs you see appertaining to the situation john is drunk sulp him he has only had an alfpint of beer with his dinner six hours ago and none of his fellowservants will say other wise polly is smuggled on board ship who tells the lieutenant when he comes his rounds boys are playing cards in the bedroom the outlying fag announces master comingout go candlescards popped into bedboys sound asleep who had that light in the dormitory law bless you the poor dear innocents are every one snoring every one snoring and every snore is a lie told through the nose suppose one of your boys or mine is engaged in that awful crime are we going to break our hearts about it come come we pull a long face waggle a grave head and chuckle within our waistcoats  between me and those fellowcreatures of mine who are sitting in the room below how strange and wonderful is the partition we meet at every hour of the daylight and are indebted to each other for a hundred offices of duty and comfort of life and we live together for years and dont know each other johns voice to me is quite different from johns voice when it addresses his mates below if i met hannah in the street with a bonnet on i doubt whether i should know her and all these good people with whom i may live for years and years have cares interests dear friends and relatives mayhap schemes passions longing hopes tragedies of their own from which a carpet and a few planks and beams utterly separate me when we were at the seaside and poor ellen used to look so pale and run after the postmans bell and seize a letter in a great scrawling hand and read it and cry in a corner how should we know that the poor little things heart was breaking she fetched the water and she smoothed the ribbons and she laid out the dresses and brought the early cup of tea in the morning just as if she had had no cares to keep her awake henry who lived out of the house was the servant of a friend of mine who lived in chambers there was a dinner one day and harry waited all through the dinner the champagne was properly iced the dinner was excellently served every guest was attended to the dinner disappeared the dessert was set the claret was in perfect order carefully decanted and more ready and then henry said if you please sir may i go home he had received word that his house was on fire and having seen through his dinner he wished to go and look after his children and little sticks of furniture why such a mans livery is a uniform of honor the crest on his button is a badge of bravery  do you seei imagine i do myselfin these little instances a tinge of humor ellens heart is breaking for handsome jeames of buckley square whose great legs are kneeling and who has given a lock of his precious powdered head to some other than ellen henry is preparing the sauce for his masters wildducks while the engines are squirting over his own little nest and brood lift these figures up but a story from the basement to the groundfloor and the fun is gone we may be en pleine tragedie ellen may breathe her last sigh in blank verse calling down blessings upon james the profligate who deserts her henry is a hero and epaulettes are on his shoulders atqui sciebat c whatever tortures are in store for him he will be at his post of duty  you concede however that there is a touch of humor in the two tragedies here mentioned why is it that the idea of persons at service is somehow ludicrous perhaps it is made more so in this country by the splendid appearance of the liveried domestics of great people when you think that we dress in black ourselves and put our fellowcreatures in green pink or canarycolored breeches that we order them to plaster their hair with flour having brushed that nonsense out of our own heads fifty years ago that some of the most genteel and stately among us cause the men who drive their carriages to put on little albino wigs and sit behind great nosegaysi say i suppose it is this heaping of gold lace gaudy colors blooming plushes on honest john trot which makes the man absurd in our eyes who need be nothing but a simple reputable citizen and indoor laborer suppose my dear sir that you yourself were suddenly desired to put on a full dress or even undress domestic uniform with our friend joness crest repeated in varied combinations of button on your front and back suppose madam your son were told that he could not get out except in lower garments of carnation or ambercolored plushwould you let him    but as you justly say this is not the question and besides it is a question fraught with danger sir and radicalism sir and subversion of the very foundations of the social fabric sir    well john we wont enter on your great domestic question dont let us disport with jeamess dangerous strength and the edgetools about his knifeboard but with betty and susan who wield the playful mop and set on the simmering kettle surely you have heard mrs toddles talking to mrs doddles about their mutual maids miss susan must have a silk gown and miss betty must wear flowers under her bonnet when she goes to church if you please and did you ever hear such impudence the servant in many small establishments is a constant and endless theme of talk what small wage sleep meal what endless scouring scolding tramping on messages fall to that poor susans lot what indignation at the little kindly passing word with the grocers young man the potboy the chubby butcher where such things will end my dear mrs toddles i dont know what wages they will want next my dear mrs doddles c  here dear ladies is an advertisement which i cut out of the times a few days since expressly for you   a lady is desirous of obtaining a situation for a very respectable young woman as head kitchenmaid under a mancook she has lived four years under a very good cook and housekeeper can make ice and is an excellent baker she will only take a place in a very good family where she can have the opportunity of improving herself and if possible staying for two years apply by letter to c c   there mrs toddles what do you think of that and did you ever well no mrs doddles upon my word now mrs t i dont think i ever did a respectable young womanas head kitchenmaidunder a mancook will only take a place in a very good family where she can improve and stay two years just note up the conditions mrs toddles mum if you please mum and then let us see   1 this young woman is to be head kitchenmaid that is to say there is to be a chorus of kitchenmaids of which y w is to be chief  2 she will only be situated under a mancook a ought he to be a french cook and b if so would the lady desire him to be a protestant  3 she will only take a place in a very good family how old ought the family to be and what do you call good that is the question how long after the conquest will do would a bankers family do or is a baronets good enough best say what rank in the peerage would be sufficiently high but the lady does not say whether she would like a high church or a low church family ought there to be unmarried sons and may they follow a profession and please say how many daughters and would the lady like them to be musical and how many company dinners a week not too many for fear of fatiguing the upper kitchenmaid but sufficient so as to keep the upper kitchenmaids hand in nbi think i can see a rather bewildered expression on the countenances of mesdames doddles and toddles as i am prattling on in this easy bantering way  4 the head kitchenmaid wishes to stay for two years and improve herself under the mancook and having of course sucked the brains as the phrase is from under the chefs nightcap then the head kitchenmaid wishes to go   and upon my word mrs toddles mum i will go and fetch the cab for her the cab why not her ladyships own carriage and pair and the head coachman to drive away the head kitchenmaid you see she stipulates for everythingthe time to come the time to stay the family she will be with and as soon as she has improved herself enough of course the upper kitchenmaid will step into the carriage and drive off  well upon my word and conscience if things are coming to this pass mrs toddles and mrs doddles mum i think i will go up stairs and get a basin and a sponge and then down stairs and get some hot water and then i will go and scrub that chalkmark off my own door with my own hands  it is wiped off i declare after ever so many weeks who has done it it was just a little roundabout mark you know and it was there for days and weeks before i ever thought it would be the text of a roundabout paper     on being found out   at the close let us say of queen annes reign when i was a boy at a private and preparatory school for young gentlemen i remember the wiseacre of a master ordering us all one night to march into a little garden at the back of the house and thence to proceed one by one into a tool or hen house i was but a tender little thing just put into short clothes and cant exactly say whether the house was for tools or hens and in that house to put our hands into a sack which stood on a bench a candle burning beside it i put my hand into the sack my hand came out quite black i went and joined the other boys in the schoolroom and all their hands were black too  by reason of my tender age and there are some critics who i hope will be satisfied by my acknowledging that i am a hundred and fiftysix next birthday i could not understand what was the meaning of this night excursionthis candle this toolhouse this bag of soot i think we little boys were taken out of our sleep to be brought to the ordeal we came then and showed our little hands to the master washed them or notmost probably i should say notand so went bewildered back to bed  something had been stolen in the school that day and mr wiseacre having read in a book of an ingenious method of finding out a thief by making him put his hand into a sack which if guilty the rogue would shirk from doing all we boys were subjected to the trial goodness knows what the lost object was or who stole it we all had black hands to show the master and the thief whoever he was was not found out that time  i wonder if the rascal is alivean elderly scoundrel he must be by this time and a hoary old hypocrite to whom an old schoolfellow presents his kindest regardsparenthetically remarking what a dreadful place that private school was cold chilblains bad dinners not enough victuals and caning awfulare you alive still i say you nameless villain who escaped discovery on that day of crime i hope you have escaped often since old sinner ah what a lucky thing it is for you and me my man that we are not found out in all our peccadilloes and that our backs can slip away from the master and the cane  just consider what life would be if every rogue was found out and flogged coram populo what a butchery what an indecency what an endless swishing of the rod dont cry out about my misanthropy my good friend mealymouth i will trouble you to tell me do you go to church when there do you say or do you not that you are a miserable sinner and saying so do you believe or disbelieve it if you are a m s dont you deserve correction and arent you grateful if you are to be let off i say again what a blessed thing it is that we are not all found out  just picture to yourself everybody who does wrong being found out and punished accordingly fancy all the boys in all the school being whipped and then the assistants and then the head master dr badford let us call him fancy the provostmarshal being tied up having previously superintended the correction of the whole army after the young gentlemen have had their turn for the faulty exercises fancy dr lincolnsinn being taken up for certain faults in his essay and review after the clergyman has cried his peccavi suppose we hoist up a bishop and give him a couple of dozen i see my lord bishop of doublegloucester sitting in a very uneasy posture on his right reverend bench after we have cast off the bishop what are we to say to the minister who appointed him my lord cinqwarden it is painful to have to use personal correction to a boy of your age but really    siste tandem carnifex the butchery is too horrible the hand drops powerless appalled at the quantity of birch which it must cut and brandish i am glad we are not all found out i say again and protest my dear brethren against our having our deserts  to fancy all men found out and punished is bad enough but imagine all women found out in the distinguished social circle in which you and i have the honor to move is it not a mercy that a many of these fair criminals remain unpunished and undiscovered there is mrs longbow who is for ever practising and who shoots poisoned arrows too when you meet her you dont call her liar and charge her with the wickedness she has done and is doing there is mrs painter who passes for a most respectable woman and a model in society there is no use in saying what you really know regarding her and her goings on there is diana hunterwhat a little haughty prude it is and yet we know stories about her which are not altogether edifying i say it is best for the sake of the good that the bad should not all be found out you dont want your children to know the history of that lady in the next box who is so handsome and whom they admire so ah me what would life be if we were all found out and punished for all our faults jack ketch would be in permanence and then who would hang jack ketch  they talk of murderers being pretty certainly found out psha i have heard an authority awfully competent vow and declare that scores and hundreds of murders are committed and nobody is the wiser that terrible man mentioned one or two ways of committing murder which he maintained were quite common and were scarcely ever found out a man for instance comes home to his wife and    but i pausei know that this magazine has a very large circulation hundreds and hundreds of thousandswhy not say a million of people at oncewell say a million read it and amongst these countless readers i might be teaching some monster how to make away with his wife without being found out some fiend of a woman how to destroy her dear husband i will not then tell this easy and simple way of murder as communicated to me by a most respectable party in the confidence of private intercourse suppose some gentle reader were to try this most simple and easy receiptit seems to me almost infallibleand come to grief in consequence and be found out and hanged should i ever pardon myself for having been the means of doing injury to a single one of our esteemed subscribers the prescription whereof i speakthat is to say whereof i dont speakshall be buried in this bosom no i am a humane man i am not one of your bluebeards to go and say to my wife my dear i am going away for a few days to brighton here are all the keys of the house you may open every door and closet except the one at the end of the oakroom opposite the fireplace with the little bronze shakespeare on the mantelpiece or what not i dont say this to a womanunless to be sure i want to get rid of herbecause after such a caution i know shell peep into the closet i say nothing about the closet at all i keep the key in my pocket and a being whom i love but who as i know has many weaknesses out of harms way you toss up your head dear angel drub on the ground with your lovely little feet on the table with your sweet rosy fingers and cry oh sneerer you dont know the depth of womans feeling the lofty scorn of all deceit the entire absence of mean curiosity in the sex or never never would you libel us so ah delia dear dear delia it is because i fancy i do know something about you not all mindno no no man knows thatah my bride my ringdove my rose my poppetchoose in fact whatever name you likebulbul of my grove fountain of my desert sunshine of my darkling life and joy of my dungeoned existence it is because i do know a little about you that i conclude to say nothing of that private closet and keep my key in my pocket you take away that closetkey then and the housekey you lock delia in you keep her out of harms way and gadding and so she never can be found out  and yet by little strange accidents and coincidents how we are being found out every day you remember that old story of the abbe kakatoes who told the company at supper one night how the first confession he ever received wasfrom a murderer let us say presently enters to supper the marquis de croquemitaine palsambleu abbe says the brilliant marquis taking a pinch of snuff are you here gentlemen and ladies i was the abbes first penitent and i made him a confession which i promise you astonished him  to be sure how queerly things are found out here is an instance only the other day i was writing in these roundabout papers about a certain man whom i facetiously called baggs and who had abused me to my friends who of course told me shortly after that paper was published another friendsacks let us call himscowls fiercely at me as i am sitting in perfect goodhumor at the club and passes on without speaking a cut a quarrel sacks thinks it is about him that i was writing whereas upon my honor and conscience i never had him once in my mind and was pointing my moral from quite another man but dont you see by this wrath of the guiltyconscienced sacks that he had been abusing me too he has owned himself guilty never having been accused he has winced when nobody thought of hitting him i did but put the cap out and madly butting and chafing behold my friend rushes out to put his head into it never mind sacks you are found out but i bear you no malice my man  and yet to be found out i know from my own experience must be painful and odious and cruelly mortifying to the inward vanity suppose i am a poltroon let us say with fierce moustache loud talk plentiful oaths and an immense stick i keep up nevertheless a character for courage i swear fearfully at cabmen and women brandish my bludgeon and perhaps knock down a little man or two with it brag of the images which i break at the shootinggallery and pass amongst my friends for a whiskery fireeater afraid of neither man nor dragon ah me suppose some brisk little chap steps up and gives me a caning in st jamess street with all the heads of my friends looking out of all the club windows my reputation is gone i frighten no man more my nose is pulled by whippersnappers who jump up on a chair to reach it i am found out and in the days of my triumphs when people were yet afraid of me and were taken in by my swagger i always knew that i was a lilyliver and expected that i should be found out some day  that certainty of being found out must haunt and depress many a bold braggadocio spirit let us say it is a clergyman who can pump copious floods of tears out of his own eyes and those of his audience he thinks to himself i am but a poor swindling chattering rogue my bills are unpaid i have jilted several women whom i have promised to marry i dont know whether i believe what i preach and i know i have stolen the very sermon over which i have been snivelling have they found me out says he as his head drops down on the cushion  then your writer poet historian novelist or what not the beacon says that joness work is one of the first order the lamp declares that joness tragedy surpasses every work since the days of him of avon the comet asserts that js life of goody twoshoes is a greek text omitted a noble and enduring monument to the fame of that admirable englishwoman and so forth but then jones knows that he has lent the critic of the beacon five pounds that his publisher has a halfshare in the lamp and that the comet comes repeatedly to dine with him it is all very well jones is immortal until he is found out and then down comes the extinguisher and the immortal is dead and buried the idea dies irae of discovery must haunt many a man and make him uneasy as the trumpets are puffing in his triumph brown who has a higher place than he deserves cowers before smith who has found him out what is a chorus of critics shouting bravoa public clapping hands and flinging garlands brown knows that smith has found him out puff trumpets wave banners huzza boys for the immortal brown this is all very well b thinks bowing the while smiling laying his hand to his heart but there stands smith at the window he has measured me and some day the others will find me out too it is a very curious sensation to sit by a man who has found you out and who as you know has found you out or vice versa to sit with a man whom you have found out his talent bah his virtue we know a little story or two about his virtue and he knows we know it we are thinking over friend robinsons antecedents as we grin bow and talk and we are both humbugs together robinson a good fellow is he you know how he behaved to hicks a goodnatured man is he pray do you remember that little story of mrs robinsons black eye how men have to work to talk to smile to go to bed and try and sleep with this dread of being found out on their consciences bardolph who has robbed a church and nym who has taken a purse go to their usual haunts and smoke their pipes with their companions mr detective bullseye appeals and says oh bardolph i want you about that there pyx business mr bardolph knocks the ashes out of his pipe puts out his hands to the little steel cuffs and walks away quite meekly he is found out he must go goodby doll tearsheet goodby mrs quickly maam the other gentlemen and ladies de la societe look on and exchange mute adieux with the departing friends and an assured time will come when the other gentlemen and ladies will be found out too  what a wonderful and beautiful provision of nature it has been that for the most part our womankind are not endowed with the faculty of finding us out they dont doubt and probe and weigh and take your measure lay down this paper my benevolent friend and reader go into your drawingroom now and utter a joke ever so old and i wager sixpence the ladies there will all begin to laugh go to browns house and tell mrs brown and the young ladies what you think of him and see what a welcome you will get in like manner let him come to your house and tell your good lady his candid opinion of you and fancy how she will receive him would you have your wife and children know you exactly for what you are and esteem you precisely at your worth if so my friend you will live in a dreary house and you will have but a chilly fireside do you suppose the people round it dont see your homely face as under a glamour and as it were with a halo of love round it you dont fancy you are as you seem to them no such thing my man put away that monstrous conceit and be thankful that they have not found you out     on a hundred years hence   where have i just read of a game played at a country house the party assembles round a table with pens ink and paper some one narrates a tale containing more or less incidents and personages each person of the company then writes down to the best of his memory and ability the anecdote just narrated and finally the papers are to be read out i do not say i should like to play often at this game which might possibly be a tedious and lengthy pastime not by any means so amusing as smoking a cigar in the conservatory or even listening to the young ladies playing their pianopieces or to hobbs and nobbs lingering round the bottle and talking over the mornings run with the hounds but surely it is a moral and ingenious sport they say the variety of narratives is often very odd and amusing the original story becomes so changed and distorted that at the end of all the statements you are puzzled to know where the truth is at all as time is of small importance to the cheerful persons engaged in this sport perhaps a good way of playing it would be to spread it over a couple of years let the people who played the game in 60 all meet and play it once more in 61 and each write his story over again then bring out your original and compare notes not only will the stories differ from each other but the writers will probably differ from themselves in the course of the year the incidents will grow or will dwindle strangely the least authentic of the statements will be so lively or so malicious or so neatly put that it will appear most like the truth i like these tales and sportive exercises i had begun a little print collection once i had addison in his nightgown in bed at holland house requesting young lord warwick to remark how a christian should die i had cambronne clutching his cocked hat and uttering the immortal la garde meurt et ne se rend pas i had the vengeur going down and all the crew hurraying like madmen i had alfred toasting the muffin curtius haydon jumping into the gulf with extracts from napoleons bulletins and a fine authentic portrait of baron munchausen  what man who has been before the public at all has not heard similar wonderful anecdotes regarding himself and his own history in these humble essaykins i have taken leave to egotize i cry out about the shoes which pinch me and as i fancy more naturally and pathetically than if my neighbors corns were trodden under foot i prattle about the dish which i love the wine which i like the talk i heard yesterdayabout browns absurd airsjoness ridiculous elation when he thinks he has caught me in a blunder a part of the fun you see is that jones will read this and will perfectly well know that i mean him and that we shall meet and grin at each other with entire politeness this is not the highest kind of speculation i confess but it is a gossip which amuses some folks a brisk and honest smallbeer will refresh those who do not care for the frothy outpourings of heavier taps a two of clubs may be a good handy little card sometimes and able to tackle a king of diamonds if it is a little trump some philosophers get their wisdom with deep thought and out of ponderous libraries i pick up my small crumbs of cogitation at a dinnertable or from mrs mary and miss louisa as they are prattling over their fiveoclock tea  well yesterday at dinner jucundus was good enough to tell me a story about myself which he had heard from a lady of his acquaintance to whom i send my best compliments the tale is this at nine oclock on the evening of the 31st of november last just before sunset i was seen leaving no 96 abbey road st johns wood leading two little children by the hand one of them in a nankeen pelisse and the other having a mole on the third finger of his left hand she thinks it was the third finger but is quite sure it was the left hand thence i walked with them to charles boroughbridges pork and sausage man no 29 upper theresa road here whilst i left the little girl innocently eating a polony in the front shop i and boroughbridge retired with the boy into the back parlor where mrs boroughbridge was playing cribbage she put up the cards and boxes took out a chopper and a napkin and we cut the little boys little throat which he bore with great pluck and resolution and made him into sausagemeat by the aid of purkiss excellent sausagemachine the little girl at first could not understand her brothers absence but under the pretence of taking her to see mr fechter in hamlet i led her down to the new river at sadlers wells where a body of a child in a nankeen pelisse was subsequently found and has never been recognized to the present day and this mrs lynx can aver because she saw the whole transaction with her own eyes as she told mr jucundus  i have altered the little details of the anecdote somewhat but this story is i vow and declare as true as mrs lynxs gracious goodness how do lies begin what are the averages of lying is the same amount of lies told about every man and do we pretty much all tell the same amount of lies is the average greater in ireland than in scotland or vice versaamong women than among men is this a lie i am telling now if i am talking about you the odds are perhaps that it is i look back at some which have been told about me and speculate on them with thanks and wonder dear friends have told them of me have told them to me of myself have they not to and of you dear friend a friend of mine was dining at a large dinner of clergymen and a story as true as the sausage story above given was told regarding me by one of those reverend divines in whose frock sits some anile chatterboxes as any man who knows this world knows they take the privilege of their gown they cabal and tattle and hiss and cackle comminations under their breath i say the old women of the other sex are not more talkative or more mischievous than some of these such a man ought not to be spoken to says gobemouche narrating the storyand such a story and i am surprised he is admitted into society at all yes dear gobemouche but the story wasnt true and i had no more done the wicked deed in question than i had run away with the queen of sheba  i have always longed to know what that story was or what collection of histories which a lady had in her mind to whom a servant of mine applied for a place when i was breaking up my establishment once and going abroad brown went with a very good character from us which indeed she fully deserved after several years faithful service but when mrs jones read the name of the person out of whose employment brown came that is quite sufficient says mrs jones you may go i will never take a servant out of that house ah mrs jones how i should like to know what that crime was or what that series of villanies which made you determine never to take a servant out of my house do you believe in the story of the little boy and the sausages have you swallowed that little minced infant have you devoured that young polonius upon my word you have maw enough we somehow greedily gobble down all stories in which the characters of our friends are chopped up and believe wrong of them without inquiry in a late serial work written by this hand i remember making some pathetic remarks about our propensity to believe ill of our neighborsand i remember the remarks not because they were valuable or novel or ingenious but because within three days after they had appeared in print the moralist who wrote them walking home with a friend heard a story about another friend which story he straightway believed and which story was scarcely more true than that sausage fable which is here set down o mea culpa mea maxima culpa but though the preacher trips shall not the doctrine be good yea brethren here be the rods look you here are the scourges choose me a nice long swishing buddy one light and wellpoised in the handle thick and bushy at the tail pick me out a whipcord thong with some dainty knots in itand nowwe all deserve itwhish whish whish let us cut into each other all round  a favorite liar and servant of mine was a man i once had to drive a brougham he never came to my house except for orders and once when he helped to wait at dinner so clumsily that it was agreed we would dispense with his further efforts the job brougham horse used to look dreadfully lean and tired and the liverystable keeper complained that we worked him too hard now it turned out that there was a neighboring butchers lady who liked to ride in a brougham and tomkins lent her ours drove her cheerfully to richmond and putney and i suppose took out a payment in muttonchops we gave this good tomkins wine and medicine for his family when sickwe supplied him with little comforts and extras which need not now be rememberedand the grateful creature rewarded us by informing some of our tradesmen whom he honored with his custom mr roundabout lor bless you i carry him up to bed drunk every night in the week he tomkins being a man of seven stone weight and five feet high whereas his employer wasbut here modesty interferes and i decline to enter into the avoirdupois question  now what was tomkinss motive for the utterance and dissemination of these lies they could further no conceivable end or interest of his own had they been true stories tomkinss master would still and reasonably have been more angry than at the fables it was but suicidal slander on the part of tomkinsmust come to a discoverymust end in a punishment the poor wretch had got his place under as it turned out a fictitious character he might have stayed in it for of course tomkins had a wife and poor innocent children he might have had bread beer bed character coats coals he might have nestled in our little island comfortably sheltered from the storms of life but we were compelled to cast him out and send him driving lonely perishing tossing starving to seato drown to drown there be other modes of death whereby rogues die goodby tomkins and so the nightcap is put on and the bolt is drawn for poor t  suppose we were to invite volunteers amongst our respected readers to send in little statements of the lies which they know have been told about themselves what a heap of correspondence what an exaggeration of malignities what a crackling bonfire of incendiary falsehoods might we not gather together and a lie once set going having the breath of life breathed into it by the father of lying and ordered to run its diabolical little course lives with a prodigious vitality you say magna est veritas et praevalebit psha great lies are as great as great truths and prevail constantly and day after day take an instance or two out of my own little budget i sit near a gentleman at dinner and the conversation turns upon a certain anonymous literary performance which at the time is amusing the town oh says the gentleman everybody knows who wrote that paper it is momuss i was a young author at the time perhaps proud of my bantling i beg your pardon i say it was written by your humble servant indeed was all that the man replied and he shrugged his shoulders turned his back and talked to his other neighbor i never heard sarcastic incredulity more finely conveyed than by that indeed impudent liar the gentlemans face said as clear as face could speak where was magna veritas and how did she prevail then she lifted up her voice she made her appeal and she was kicked out of court in new york i read a newspaper criticism one day by an exile from our shores who has taken up his abode in the western republic commenting upon a letter of mine which had appeared in a contemporary volume and wherein it was stated that the writer was a lad in such and such a year and in point of fact i was at the period spoken of nineteen years of age falsehood mr roundabout says the noble critic you were then not a lad you were then sixandtwenty years of age you see he knew better than papa and mamma and parish register it was easier for him to think and say i lied on a twopenny matter connected with my own affairs than to imagine he was mistaken years ago in a time when we were very mad wags arcturus and myself met a gentleman from china who knew the language we began to speak chinese against him we said we were born in china we were two to one we spoke the mandarin dialect with perfect fluency we had the company with us as in the old old days the squeak of the real pig was voted not to be so natural as the squeak of the sham pig o arcturus the sham pig squeaks in our streets now to the applause of multitudes and the real porker grunts unheeded in his sty  i once talked for some little time with an amiable lady it was for the first time and i saw an expression of surprise on her kind face which said as plainly as face could say sir do you know that up to this moment i have had a certain opinion of you and that i begin to think i have been mistaken or misled i not only know that she had heard evil reports of me but i know who told herone of those acute fellows my dear brethren of whom we spoke in a previous sermon who has found me outfound out actions which i never did found out thoughts and sayings which i never spoke and judged me accordingly ah my lad have i found you out o risum teneatis perhaps the person i am accusing is no more guilty than i  how comes it that the evil which men say spreads so widely and lasts so long whilst our good kind words dont seem somehow to take root and bear blossom is it that in the stony hearts of mankind these pretty flowers cant find a place to grow certain it is that scandal is good brisk talk whereas praise of ones neighbor is by no means lively hearing an acquaintance grilled scored devilled and served with mustard and cayenne pepper excites the appetite whereas a slice of cold friend with currant jelly is but a sickly unrelishing meat  now such being the case my dear worthy mrs candor in whom i know there are a hundred good and generous qualities it being perfectly clear that the good things which we say of our neighbors dont fructify but somehow perish in the ground where they are dropped whilst the evil words are wafted by all the winds of scandal take root in all sods and flourish amazinglyseeing i say that this conversation does not give us a fair chance suppose we give up censoriousness altogether and decline uttering our opinions about brown jones and robinson and mesdames b j and r at all we may be mistaken about every one of them as please goodness those anecdotemongers against whom i have uttered my meek protest have been mistaken about me we need not go to the extent of saying that mrs manning was an amiable creature much misunderstood and jack thurtell a gallant unfortunate fellow not near so black as he was painted but we will try and avoid personalities altogether in talk wont we we will range the fields of science dear madam and communicate to each other the pleasing results of our studies we will if you please examine the infinitesimal wonders of nature through the microscope we will cultivate entomology we will sit with our arms round each others waists on the pons asinorum and see the stream of mathematics flow beneath we will take refuge in cards and play at beggar my neighbor not abuse my neighbor we will go to the zoological gardens and talk freely about the gorilla and his kindred but not talk about people who can talk in their turn suppose we praise the high church we offend the low church the broad church high and low are both offended what do you think of lord derby as a politician and what is your opinion of lord palmerston if you please will you play me those lovely variations of in my cottage near a wood it is a charming air you know it in french i suppose ah te diraije maman and was a favorite with poor marie antoinette i say poor because i have a right to speak with pity of a sovereign who was renowned for so much beauty and so much misfortune but as for giving any opinion on her conduct saying that she was good or bad or indifferent goodness forbid we have agreed we will not be censorious let us have a game at cardsat ecarte if you please you deal i ask for cards i lead the deuce of clubs     what there is no deuce deuce take it what people will go on talking about their neighbors and wont have their mouths stopped by cards or ever so much microscopes and aquariums ah my poor dear mrs candor i agree with you by the way did you ever see anything like lady godiva trotters dress last night people will go on chattering although we hold our tongues and after all my good soul what will their scandal matter a hundred years hence     smallbeer chronicle   not long since at a certain banquet i had the good fortune to sit by doctor polymathesis who knows everything and who about the time when the claret made its appearance mentioned that old dictum of the grumbling oxford don that all claret would be port if it could imbibing a bumper of one or the other not ungratefully i thought to myself here surely mr roundabout is a good text for one of your reverences sermons let us apply to the human race dear brethren what is here said of the vintages of portugal and gascony and we shall have no difficulty in perceiving how many clarets aspire to be ports in their way how most men and women of our acquaintance how we ourselves are aquitanians giving ourselves lusitanian airs how we wish to have credit for being stronger braver more beautiful more worthy than we really are  nay the beginning of this hypocrisya desire to excel a desire to be hearty fruity generous strengthimpartingis a virtuous and noble ambition and it is most difficult for a man in his own case or his neighbors to say at what point this ambition transgresses the boundary of virtue and becomes vanity pretence and selfseeking you are a poor man let us say showing a bold face to adverse fortune and wearing a confident aspect your purse is very narrow but you owe no man a penny your means are scanty but your wifes gown is decent your old coat well brushed your children at a good school you grumble to no one ask favors of no one truckle to no neighbors on account of their superior rank or a worse and a meaner and a more common crime still envy none for their better fortune to all outward appearances you are as well to do as your neighbors who have thrice your income there may be in this case some little mixture of pretension in your life and behavior you certainly do put on a smiling face whilst fortune is pinching you your wife and girls so smart and neat at evening parties are cutting patching and cobbling all day to make both ends of lifes haberdashery meet you give a friend a bottle of wine on occasion but are content yourself with a glass of whiskeyandwater you avoid a cab saying that of all things you like to walk home after dinner which you know my good friend is a fib i grant you that in this scheme of life there does enter ever so little hypocrisy that this claret is loaded as it were but your desire to portify yourself is amiable is pardonable is perhaps honorable and were there no other hypocrisies than yours in the world we should be a set of worthy fellows and sermonizers moralizers satirizers would have to hold their tongues and go to some other trade to get a living  but you know you will step over that boundary line of virtue and modesty into the district where humbug and vanity begin and there the moralizer catches you and makes an example of you for instance in a certain novel in another place my friend mr talbot twysden is mentioneda man whom you and i know to be a wretched ordinaire but who persists in treating himself as if he was the finest 20 port in our britain there are hundreds of men like him for ever striving to swell beyond their natural size to strain beyond their natural strength to step beyond their natural stride search search within your own waistcoats dear brethrenyou know in your hearts which of your ordinaire qualities you would pass off and fain consider as firstrate port and why not you yourself mr preacher says the congregation dearly beloved neither in or out of this pulpit do i profess to be bigger or cleverer or wiser or better than any of you a short while since a certain reviewer announced that i gave myself great pretensions as a philosopher i a philosopher i advance pretensions my dear saturday friend and you dont you teach everything to everybody and punish the naughty boys if they dont learn as you bid them you teach politics to lord john and mr gladstone you teach poets how to write painters how to paint gentlemen manners and operadancers how to pirouette i was not a little amused of late by an instance of the modesty of our saturday friend who more athenian than the athenians and apropos of a greek book by a greek author sat down and gravely showed the greek gentleman how to write his own language  no i do not as far as i know try to be port at all but offer in these presents a sound genuine ordinaire at 18s per doz let us say grown on my own hillside and offered de bon coeur to those who will sit down under my tonnelle and have a halfhours drink and gossip it is none of your hot porto my friend i know there is much better and stronger liquor elsewhere some pronounce it sour some say it is thin some that it has wofully lost its flavor this may or may not be true there are good and bad years years that surprise everybody years of which the produce is small and bad or rich and plentiful but if my tap is not genuine it is naught and no man should give himself the trouble to drink it i do not even say that i would be port if i could knowing that port by which i would imply much stronger deeper richer and more durable liquor than my vineyard can furnish is not relished by all palates or suitable to all heads we will assume then dear brother that you and i are tolerably modest people and ourselves being thus out of the question proceed to show how pretentious our neighbors are and how very many of them would be port if they could  have you never seen a small man from college placed amongst great folk and giving himself the airs of a man of fashion he goes back to his common room with fond reminiscences of ermine castle or strawberry hall he writes to the dear countess to say that dear lord lollypop is getting on very well at st boniface and that the accident which he met with in a scuffle with an inebriated bargeman only showed his spirit and honor and will not permanently disfigure his lordships nose he gets his clothes from dear lollypops london tailor and wears a mauve or magenta tie when he rides out to see the hounds a love of fashionable people is a weakness i do not say of all but of some tutors witness that eton tutor tother day who intimated that in cornhill we could not understand the perfect purity delicacy and refinement of those genteel families who sent their sons to eton o usher mon ami old sam johnson who too had been an usher in his early life kept a little of that weakness always suppose goldsmith had knocked him up at three in the morning and proposed a boat to greenwich as topham beauclerc and his friend did would he have said what my boy are you for a frolic im with you and gone and put on his clothes rather he would have pitched poor goldsmith down stairs he would have liked to be port if he could of course we wouldnt our opinion of the portugal grape is known it grows very high and is very sour and we dont go for that kind of grape at all  i was walking with mr foxand sure this anecdote comes very pat after the grapesi was walking with mr fox in the louvre says benjamin west apud some paper i have just been reading and i remarked how many people turned round to look at me this shows the respect of the french for the fine arts this is a curious instance of a very small claret indeed which imagined itself to be port of the strongest body there are not many instances of a faith so deep so simple so satisfactory as this i have met many who would like to be port but with few of the gascon sort who absolutely believed they were port george iii believed in wests port and thought reynoldss overrated stuff when i saw wests pictures at philadelphia i looked at them with astonishment and awe hide blushing glory hide your head under your old nightcap o immortality is this the end of you did any of you my dear brethren ever try and read blackmores poems or the epics of baourlormian or the henriade orwhat shall we saypolloks course of time they were thought to be more lasting than brass by some people and where are they now and our masterpieces of literatureour poetsthat if not immortal at any rate are to last their fifty their hundred yearsoh sirs dont you think a very small cellar will hold them  those poor people in brass on pedestals hectoring about trafalgar square and that neighborhood dont you think many of themapart even from the ridiculous executioncut rather a ridiculous figure and that we are too eager to set up our ordinaire heroism and talent for port a duke of wellington or two i will grant though even of these idols a moderate supply will be sufficient some years ago a famous and witty french critic was in london with whom i walked the streets i am ashamed to say that i informed him being in hopes that he was about to write some papers regarding the manners and customs of this country that all the statues he saw represented the duke of wellington that on the arch opposite apsley house the duke in a cloak and cocked hat on horseback that behind apsley house in an airy figleaf costume the duke again that in cockspur street the duke with a pigtailand so on i showed him an army of dukes there are many bronze heroes who after a few years look already as foolish awkward and out of place as a man say at shoolbreds or swan and edgars for example those three grenadiers in pall mall who have been up only a few months dont you pity those unhappy household troops who have to stand frowning and looking fierce there and think they would like to step down and go to barracks that they fought very bravely there is no doubt but so did the russians fight very bravely and the french fight very bravely and so did colonel jones and the 99th and colonel brown and the 100th and i say again that ordinaire should not give itself port airs and that an honest ordinaire would blush to be found swaggering so i am sure if you could consult the duke of york who is impaled on his column between the two clubs and ask his late royal highness whether he thought he ought to remain there he would say no a brave worthy man not a braggart or boaster to be put upon that heroic perch must be painful to him lord george bentinck i suppose being in the midst of the family park in cavendish square may conceive that he has a right to remain in his place but look at william of cumberland with his hat cocked over his eye prancing behind lord george on his romannosed charger he depend on it would be for getting off his horse if he had the permission he did not hesitate about trifles as we know but he was a very truthtelling and honorable soldier and as for heroic rank and statuesque dignity i would wager a dozen of 20 port against a bottle of pure and sound bordeaux at 18s per dozen bottles included that he never would think of claiming any such absurd distinction they have got a statue of thomas moore at dublin i hear is he on horseback some men should have say a fifty years lease of glory after a while some gentlemen now in brass should go to the melting furnace and reappear in some other gentlemans shape lately i saw that melville column rising over edinburgh come good men and true dont you feel a little awkward and uneasy when you walk under it who was this to stand in heroic places and is yon the man whom scotchmen most delight to honor i must own deferentially that there is a tendency in north britain to overesteem its heroes scotch ale is very good and strong but it is not stronger than all the other beer in the world as some scottish patriots would insist when there has been a war and stout old sandy sansculotte returns home from india or crimea what a bagpiping shouting hurraying and selfglorification takes place round about him you would fancy to hear mcorator after dinner that the scotch had fought all the battles killed all the russians indian rebels or what not in cuparfife theres a little inn called the battle of waterloo and what do you think the sign is i sketch from memory to be sure the battle of waterloo is one broad scotchman laying about him with a broadsword yes yes my dear mac you are wise you are good you are clever you are handsome you are brave you are rich c but so is jones over the border scotch salmon is good but there are other good fish in the sea i once heard a scotchman lecture on poetry in london of course the pieces he selected were chiefly by scottish authors and walter scott was his favorite poet i whispered to my neighbor who was a scotchman by the way the audience were almost all scotch and the room was allmacsi beg your pardon but i couldnt help it i really couldnt help itthe professor has said the best poet was a scotchman i wager that he will say the worst poet was a scotchman too and sure enough that worst poet when he made his appearance was a northern briton        this refers to an illustrated edition of the work  and as we are talking of bragging and i am on my travels can i forget one mighty republiconetwo mighty republics where people are notoriously fond of passing off their claret for port i am very glad for the sake of a kind friend that there is a great and influential party in the united and i trust in the confederate states who believe that catawba wine is better than the best champagne opposite that famous old white house at washington whereof i shall ever have a grateful memory they have set up an equestrian statue of general jackson by a selftaught american artist of no inconsiderable genius and skill at an eveningparty a member of congress seized me in a corner of the room and asked me if i did not think this was the finest equestrian statue in the world how was i to deal with this plain question put to me in a corner i was bound to reply and accordingly said that i did not think it was the finest statue in the world well sir says the member of congress but you must remember that mr m had never seen a statue when he made this i suggested that to see other statues might do mr m no harm nor was any man more willing to own his defects or more modest regarding his merits than the sculptor himself whom i met subsequently but oh what a charming article there was in a washington paper next day about the impertinence of criticism and offensive tone of arrogance which englishmen adopted towards men and works of genius in america who was this man who c c the washington writer was angry because i would not accept this american claret as the finest portwine in the world ah me it is about blood and not wine that the quarrel now is and who shall foretell its end        written in july 1861  how much claret that would be port if it could is handed about in every society in the house of commons what smallbeer orators try to pass for strong stay have i a spite against any one it is a fact that the wife of the member for bungay has left off asking me and mrs roundabout to her eveningparties now is the time to have a slap at him i will say that he was always overrated and that now he is lamentably falling off even from what he has been i will back the member for stoke poges against him and show that the dashing young member for islington is a far sounder man than either have i any little literary animosities of course not men of letters never have otherwise how i could serve out a competitor here make a face over his works and show that this wouldbe port is very meagre ordinaire indeed nonsense man why so squeamish do they spare you now you have the whip in your hand wont you lay on you used to be a pretty whip enough as a young man and liked it too is there no enemy who would be the better for a little thonging no i have militated in former times not without glory but i grow peaceable as i grow old and if i have a literary enemy why he will probably write a book ere long and then it will be his turn and my favorite review will be down upon him  my brethren these sermons are professedly short for i have that opinion of my dear congregation which leads me to think that were i to preach at great length they would yawn stamp make noises and perhaps go straightway out of church and yet with this text i protest i could go on for hours what multitudes of men what multitudes of women my dears pass off their ordinaire for port their small beer for strong in literature in politics in the army the navy the church at the bar in the world what an immense quantity of cheap liquor is made to do service for better sorts ask serjeant roland his opinion of oliver qc ordinaire my good fellow ordinaire with a portwine label ask oliver his opinion of roland never was a man so overrated by the world and by himself ask tweedledumski his opinion of tweedledeesteins performance a quack my tear sir an ignoramus i geef you my vort he gombose an opera he is not fit to make dance a bear ask paddington and buckminster those two swells of fashion what they think of each other they are notorious ordinaire you and i remember when they

try and pass off their ordinarylooking girls as beauties of the first order every man in his circle knows women who give themselves airs and to whom we can apply the portwine simile  come my friends here is enough of ordinaire and port for today my bottle has run out will anybody have any more let us go up stairs and get a cup of tea from the ladies     ogres   i dare say the reader has remarked that the upright and independent vowel which stands in the vowellist between e and o has formed the subject of the main part of these essays how does that vowel feel this morningfresh goodhumored and lively the roundabout lines which fall from this pen are correspondingly brisk and cheerful has anything on the contrary disagreed with the vowel has its rest been disturbed or was yesterdays dinner too good or yesterdays wine not good enough under such circumstances a darkling misanthropic tinge no doubt is cast upon the paper the jokes if attempted are elaborate and dreary the bitter temper breaks out that sneering manner is adopted which you know and which exhibits itself so especially when the writer is speaking about women a moody carelessness comes over him he sees no good in anybody or thing and treats gentlemen ladies history and things in general with a like gloomy flippancy agreed when the vowel in question is in that mood if you like airy gayety and tender gushing benevolenceif you want to be satisfied with yourself and the rest of your fellowbeings i recommend you my dear creature to go to some other shop in cornhill or turn to some other article there are moods in the mind of the vowel of which we are speaking when it is illconditioned and captious who always keeps good health and good humor do not philosophers grumble are not sages sometimes out of temper and do not angelwomen go off in tantrums today my mood is dark i scowl as i dip my pen in the inkstand  here is the day come roundfor everything here is done with the utmost regularityintellectual labor sixteen hours meals thirtytwo minutes exercise a hundred and fortyeight minutes conversation with the family chiefly literary and about the housekeeping one hour and four minutes sleep three hours and fifteen minutes at the end of the month when the magazine is complete i own i take eight minutes more and the rest for the toilette and the world well i say the roundabout paper day being come and the subject long since settled in my mind an excellent subjecta most telling lively and popular subjecti go to breakfast determined to finish that meal in 9 34 minutes as usual and then retire to my desk and work whenoh provokinghere in the paper is the very subject treated on which i was going to write yesterday another paper which i saw treated itand of course as i need not tell you spoiled it last saturday another paper had an article on the subject perhaps you may guess what it wasbut i wont tell you only this is true my favorite subject which was about to make the best paper we have had for a long time my bird my game that i was going to shoot and serve up with such a delicate sauce has been found by other sportsmen and pop pop pop a halfdozen of guns have banged at it mangled it and brought it down  and cant you take some other text say you all this is mighty well but if you have set your heart on a certain dish for dinner be it cold boiled veal or what you will and they bring you turtle and venison dont you feel disappointed during your walk you have been making up your mind that that cold meat with moderation and a pickle will be a very sufficient dinner you have accustomed your thoughts to it and here in place of it is a turkey surrounded by coarse sausages or a reeking pigeonpie or a fulsome roastpig i have known many a good and kind man made furiously angry by such a contretemps i have known him lose his temper call his wife and servants names and a whole household made miserable if then as is notoriously the case it is too dangerous to balk a man about his dinner how much more about his article i came to my meal with an ogrelike appetite and gusto fee faw fum wife where is that tender little princekin have you trussed him and did you stuff him nicely and have you taken care to baste him and do him not too brown as i told you quick i am hungry i begin to whet my knife to roll my eyes about and roar and clap my huge chest like a gorilla and then my poor ogrina has to tell me that the little princes have all run away whilst she was in the kitchen making the paste to bake them in i pause in the description i wont condescend to report the bad language which you know must ensue when an ogre whose mind is ill regulated and whose habits of selfindulgence are notorious finds himself disappointed of his greedy hopes what treatment of his wife what abuse and brutal behavior to his children who though ogrillons are children my dears you may fancy and need not ask my delicate pen to describe the language and behavior of a vulgar coarse greedy large man with an immense mouth and teeth which are too frequently employed in the gobbling and crunching of raw mans meat  and in this circuitous way you see i have reached my present subject which is ogres you fancy they are dead or only fictitious charactersmythical representatives of strength cruelty stupidity and lust for blood though they had sevenleagued boots you remember all sorts of little whippingsnapping tom thumbs used to elude and outrun them they were so stupid that they gave into the most shallow ambuscades and artifices witness that wellknown ogre who because jack cut open the hastypudding instantly ripped open his own stupid waistcoat and interior they were cruel brutal disgusting with their sharpened teeth immense knives and roaring voices but they always ended by being overcome by little tom thumbkins or some other smart little champion  yes they were conquered in the end there is no doubt they plunged headlong and uttering the most frightful bad language into some pit where jack came with his smart couteau de chasse and whipped their brutal heads off they would be going to devour maidens           but ever when it seemed             their need was at the sorest           a knight in armor bright             came riding through the forest  and down after a combat would go the brutal persecutor with a lance through his midriff yes i say this is very true and well but you remember that round the ogres cave the ground was covered for hundreds and hundreds of yards with the bones of the victims whom he had lured into the castle many knights and maids came to him and perished under his knife and teeth were dragons the same as ogres monsters dwelling in caverns whence they rushed attired in plate armor wielding pikes and torches and destroying stray passengers who passed by their lair monsters brutes rapacious tyrants ruffians as they were doubtless they ended by being overcome but before they were destroyed they did a deal of mischief the bones round their caves were countless they had sent many brave souls to hades before their own fled howling out of their rascal carcasses to the same place of gloom  there is no greater mistake than to suppose that fairies champions distressed damsels and by consequence ogres have ceased to exist it may not be ogreable to them pardon the horrible pleasantry but as i am writing in the solitude of my chamber i am grinding my teethyelling roaring and cursingbrandishing my scissors and papercutter and as it were have become an ogre i say there is no greater mistake than to suppose that ogres have ceased to exist we all know ogres their caverns are round us and about us there are the castles of several ogres within a mile of the spot where i write i think some of them suspect i am an ogre myself i am not but i know they are i visit them i dont mean to say that they take a cold roast prince out of the cupboard and have a cannibal feast before me but i see the bones lying about the roads to their houses and in the areas and gardens politeness of course prevents me from making any remarks but i know them well enough one of the ways to know em is to watch the scared looks of the ogres wives and children they lead an awful life they are present at dreadful cruelties in their excesses those ogres will stab about and kill not only strangers who happen to call in and ask a nights lodging but they will outrage murder and chop up their own kin we all know ogres i say and have been in their dens often it is not necessary that ogres who ask you to dine should offer their guests the peculiar dish which they like they cannot always get a tom thumb family they eat mutton and beef too and i dare say even go out to tea and invite you to drink it but i tell you there are numbers of them going about in the world and now you have my word for it and this little hint it is quite curious what an interest society may be made to have for you by your determining to find out the ogres you meet there  what does the man mean says mrs downright to whom a joke is a very grave thing i mean madam that in the company assembled in your genteel drawingroom who bow here and there and smirk in white neckcloths you receive men who elbow through life successfully enough but who are ogres in private men wicked false rapacious flattering cruel hectors at home smiling courtiers abroad causing wives children servants parents to tremble before them and smiling and bowing as they bid strangers welcome into their castles i say there are men who have crunched the bones of victim after victim in whose closets lie skeletons picked frightfully clean when these ogres come out into the world you dont suppose they show their knives and their great teeth a neat simple white neckcloth a merry rather obsequious manner a cadaverous look perhaps now and again and a rather dreadful grin but i know ogres very considerably respected and when you hint to such and such a man my dear sir mr sharpus whom you appear to like is i assure you a most dreadful cannibal the gentleman cries oh psha nonsense dare say not so black as he is painted dare say not worse than his neighbors we condone everything in this countryprivate treason falsehood flattery cruelty at home roguery and double dealing what do you mean to say in your acquaintance you dont know ogres guilty of countless crimes of fraud and force and that knowing them you dont shake hands with them dine with them at your table and meet them at their own depend upon it in the time when there were real live ogres in real caverns or castles gobbling up real knights and virgins when they went into the worldthe neighboring markettown let us say or earls castlethough their nature and reputation were pretty well known their notorious foibles were never alluded to you would say what blunderbore my boy how do you do how well and fresh you look whats the receipt you have for keeping so young and rosy and your wife would softly ask after mrs blunderbore and the dear children or it would be my dear humguffin try that pork it is homebred homefed and i promise you tender tell me if you think it is as good as yours john a glass of burgundy to colonel humguffin you dont suppose there would be any unpleasant allusions to disagreeable homereports regarding humguffins manner of furnishing his larder i say we all of us know ogres we shake hands and dine with ogres and if inconvenient moralists tell us we are cowards for our pains we turn round with a tu quoque or say that we dont meddle with other folks affairs that people are much less black than they are painted and so on what wont half the county go to ogreham castle wont some of the clergy say grace at dinner wont the mothers bring their daughters to dance with the young rawheads and if lady ogreham happens to diei wont say to go the way of all flesh that is too revoltingi say if ogreham is a widower do you aver on your conscience and honor that mothers will not be found to offer their young girls to supply the lamented ladys place how stale this misanthropy is something must have disagreed with this cynic yes my good woman i dare say you would like to call another subject yes my fine fellow ogre at home supple as a dancingmaster abroad and shaking in thy pumps and wearing a horrible grin of sham gayety to conceal thy terror lest i should point thee outthou art prosperous and honored art thou i say thou hast been a tyrant and a robber thou hast plundered the poor thou hast bullied the weak thou hast laid violent hands on the goods of the innocent and confiding thou hast made a prey of the meek and gentle who asked for thy protection thou hast been hard to thy kinsfolk and cruel to thy family go monster ah when shall little jack come and drill daylight through thy wicked cannibal carcass i see the ogre pass on bowing right and left to the company and he gives a dreadful sidelong glance of suspicion as he is talking to my lord bishop in the corner there  ogres in our days need not be giants at all in former times and in childrens books where it is necessary to paint your moral in such large letters that there can be no mistake about it ogres are made with that enormous mouth and ratelier which you know of and with which they can swallow down a baby almost without using that great knife which they always carry they are too cunning nowadays they go about in society slim small quietly dressed and showing no especially great appetite in my own young days there used to be play ogresmen who would devour a young fellow in one sitting and leave him without a bit of flesh on his bones they were quiet gentlemanlikelooking people they got the young fellow into their cave champagne patedefoiegras and numberless good things were handed about and then having eaten the young man was devoured in his turn i believe these card and dice ogres have died away almost as entirely as the hastypudding giants whom tom thumb overcame now there are ogres in city courts who lure you into their dens about our cornish mines i am told there are many most plausible ogres who tempt you into their caverns and pick your bones there in a certain newspaper there used to be lately a whole column of advertisements from ogres who would put on the most plausible nay piteous appearance in order to inveigle their victims you would read a tradesman established for seventy years in the city and known and much respected by messrs n m rothschild and baring brothers has pressing need for three pounds until next saturday he can give security for half a million and forty thousand pounds will be given for the use of the loan and so on or an influential body of capitalists are about to establish a company of which the business will be enormous and the profits proportionately prodigious they will require a secretary of good address and appearance at a salary of two thousand per annum he need not be able to write but address and manners are absolutely necessary as a mark of confidence in the company he will have to deposit c or a young widow of pleasing manners and appearance who has a pressing necessity for four pounds ten for three weeks offers her erards grand piano valued at three hundred guineas a diamond cross of eight hundred pounds and board and lodging in her elegant villa near banbury cross with the best references and society in return for the loan i suspect these people are ogres there are ogres and ogres polyphemus was a great tall oneeyed notorious ogre fetching his victims out of a hole and gobbling them one after another there could be no mistake about him but so were the sirens ogrespretty blueeyed things peeping at you coaxingly from out of the water and singing their melodious wheedles and the bones round their caves were more numerous than the ribs skulls and thighbones round the cavern of hulking polypheme  to the castlegates of some of these monsters up rides the dapper champion of the pen puffs boldly upon the horn which hangs by the chain enters the hall resolutely and challenges the big tyrant sulking within we defy him to combat the enormous roaring ruffian we give him a meeting on the green plain before his castle green no wonder it should be green it is manured with human bones after a few graceful wheels and curvets we take our ground we stoop over our saddle tis but to kiss the locket of our ladyloves hair and now the vizor is up the lance is in rest gillotts iron is the point for me a touch of the spur in the gallant sides of pegasus and we gallop at the great brute  cut off his ugly head flibbertygibbet my squire and who are these who pour out of the castle the imprisoned maidens the maltreated widows the poor old hoary grandfathers who have been locked up in the dungeons these scores and scores of years writhing under the tyranny of that ruffian ah ye knights of the pen may honor be your shield and truth tip your lances be gentle to all gentle people be modest to women be tender to children and as for the ogre humbug out sword and have at him     on two roundabout papers which i intended to write        the following paper was written in 1861 after the      extraordinary affray between major murray and the money      lender in a house in northumberland street strand and      subsequent to the appearance of m du chaillus book on      gorillas  we have all heard of a place paved with good intentionsa place which i take to be a very dismal useless and unsatisfactory terminus for many pleasant thoughts kindly fancies gentle wishes merry little quips and pranks harmless jokes which die as it were the moment of their birth poor little children of the brain he was a dreary theologian who huddled you under such a melancholy cenotaph and laid you in the vaults under the flagstones of hades i trust that some of the best actions we have all of us committed in our lives have been committed in fancy it is not all wickedness we are thinking que diable some of our thoughts are bad enough i grant you many a one you and i have had here below ah mercy what a monster what crooked horns what leering eyes what a flaming mouth what cloven feet and what a hideous writhing tail oh let us fall down on our knees repeat our most potent exorcisms and overcome the brute spread your black pinions flyfly to the dusky realms of eblis and bury thyself under the pavingstones of his hall dark genie but all thoughts are not so nono there are the pure there are the kind there are the gentle there are sweet unspoken thanks before a fair scene of nature at a sunsetting below a glorious sea or a moon and a host of stars shining over it at a bunch of children playing in the street or a group of flowers by the hedgeside or a bird singing there at a hundred moments or occurrences of the day good thoughts pass through the mind let us trust which never are spoken prayers are made which never are said and te deum is sung without church clerk choristers parson or organ why theres my enemy who got the place i wanted who maligned me to the woman i wanted to be well with who supplanted me in the good graces of my patron i dont say anything about the matter but my poor old enemy in my secret mind i have movements of as tender charity towards you you old scoundrel as ever i had when we were boys together at school you ruffian do you fancy i forget that we were fond of each other we are still we share our toffy go halves at the tuckshop do each others exercises prompt each other with the word in construing or repetition and tell the most frightful fibs to prevent each other from being found out we meet each other in public ware a fight get them into different parts of the room our friends hustle round us capulet and montague are not more at odds than the houses of roundabout and wrightabout let us say it is my dear mrs buffer do kindly put yourself in the chair between those two men or my dear wrightabout will you take that charming lady blancmange down to supper she adores your poems and gave five shillings for your autograph at the fancy fair in like manner the peacemakers gather round roundabout on his part he is carried to a distant corner and coaxed out of the way of the enemy with whom he is at feud  when we meet in the square at verona out flash rapiers and we fall to but in his private mind tybalt owns that mercutio has a rare wit and mercutio is sure that his adversary is a gallant gentleman look at the amphitheatre yonder you do not suppose those gladiators who fought and perished as hundreds of spectators in that grim circus held thumbs down and cried kill killyou do not suppose the combatants of necessity hated each other no more than the celebrated trained bands of literary swordandbuckler men hate the adversaries whom they meet in the arena they engage at the given signal feint and parry slash poke rip each other open dismember limbs and hew off noses but in the way of business and i trust with mutual private esteem for instance i salute the warriors of the superfine company with the honors due among warriors heres at you spartacus my lad a hit i acknowledge a palpable hit ha how do you like that poke in the eye in return when the trumpets sing truce or the spectators are tired we bow to the noble company withdraw and get a cool glass of wine in our rendezvous des braves gladiateurs  by the way i saw that amphitheatre of verona under the strange light of a lurid eclipse some years ago and i have been there in spirit for these twenty lines past under a vast gusty awning now with twenty thousand fellowcitizens looking on from the benches now in the circus itself a grim gladiator with sword and net or a meek martyrwas ibrought out to be gobbled up by the lions or a huge shaggy tawny lion myself on whom the dogs were going to be set what a day of excitement i have had to be sure but i must get away from verona or who knows how much farther the roundabout pegasus may carry me  we were saying my muse before we dropped and perched on earth for a couple of sentences that our unsaid words were in some limbo or other as real as those we have uttered that the thoughts which have passed through our brains are as actual as any to which our tongues and pens have given currency for instance besides what is here hinted at i have thought ever so much more about verona about an early christian church i saw there about a great dish of rice we had at the inn about the bugs there about ever so many more details of that days journey from milan to venice about lake garda which lay on the way from milan and so forth i say what fine things we have thought of havent we all of us ah what a fine tragedy that was i thought of and never wrote on the day of the dinner of the oystermongers company what a noble speech i thought of in the cab and broke downi dont mean the cab but the speech ah if you could but read some of the unwritten roundabout papers how you would be amused aha my friend i catch you saying well then i wish this was unwritten with all my heart very good i owe you one i do confess a hit a palpable hit  one day in the past month as i was reclining on the bench of thought with that ocean the times newspaper spread before me the ocean cast up on the shore at my feet two famous subjects for roundabout papers and i picked up those waifs and treasured them away until i could polish them and bring them to market that scheme is not to be carried out i cant write about those subjects and though i cannot write about them i may surely tell what are the subjects i am going not to write about  the first was that northumberland street encounter which all the papers have narrated have any novelists of our days a scene and catastrophe more strange and terrible than this which occurs at noonday within a few yards of the greatest thoroughfare in europe at the theatres they have a new name for their melodramatic pieces and call them sensation dramas what a sensation drama this is what have people been flocking to see at the adelphi theatre for the last hundred and fifty nights a woman pitched overboard out of a boat and a certain miles taking a tremendous header and bringing her to shore bagatelle what is this compared to the real lifedrama of which a midday representation takes place just opposite the adelphi in northumberland street the brave dumas the intrepid ainsworth the terrible eugene sue the coldshudderinspiring woman in white the astounding author of the mysteries of the court of london never invented anything more tremendous than this it might have happened to you and me we want to borrow a little money we are directed to an agent we propose a pecuniary transaction at a short date he goes into the next room as we fancy to get the banknotes and returns with two very pretty delicate little ivoryhandled pistols and blows a portion of our heads off after this what is the use of being squeamish about the probabilities and possibilities in the writing of fiction years ago i remember making merry over a play of dumas called kean in which the coalhole tavern was represented on the thames with a fleet of pirateships moored alongside pirateships why not what a cavern of terror was this in northumberland street with its splendid furniture covered with dust its empty bottles in the midst of which sits a grim agent amusing himself by firing pistols aiming at the unconscious mantelpiece or at the heads of his customers  after this what is not possible it is possible hungerford market is mined and will explode some day mind how you go in for a penny ice unawares pray step this way says a quiet person at the door you enterinto a back rooma quiet room rather a dark room pray take your place in a chair and she goes to fetch the penny ice malheureux the chair sinks down with yousinks and sinks and sinksa large wet flannel suddenly envelopes your face and throttles you need we say any more after northumberland street what is improbable surely there is no difficulty in crediting bluebeard i withdraw my last months opinions about ogres ogres why not i protest i have seldom contemplated anything more terribly ludicrous than this agent in the dingy splendor of his den surrounded by dusty ormolu and piles of empty bottles firing pistols for his diversion at the mantelpiece until his clients come in is pistolpractice so common in northumberland street that it passes without notice in the lodginghouses there  we spake anon of good thoughts about bad thoughts is there some northumberland street chamber in your heart and mine friend close to the everyday street of life visited by daily friends visited by people on business in which affairs are transacted jokes are uttered wine is drunk through which people come and go wives and children pass and in which murder sits unseen until the terrible moment when he rises up and kills a farmer say has a gun over the mantelpiece in his room where he sits at his daily meals and rest caressing his children joking with his friends smoking his pipe in his calm one night the gun is taken down the farmer goes out and it is a murderer who comes back and puts the piece up and drinks by that fireside was he a murderer yesterday when he was tossing the baby on his knee and when his hands were playing with his little girls yellow hair yesterday there was no blood on them at all they were shaken by honest men have done many a kind act in their time very likely he leans his head on one of them the wife comes in with her anxious looks of welcome the children are prattling as they did yesterday round the fathers knee at the fire and cain is sitting by the embers and abel lies dead on the moor think of the gulf between now and yesterday oh yesterday oh the days when those two loved each other and said their prayers side by side he goes to sleep perhaps and dreams that his brother is alive be true o dream let him live in dreams and wake no more be undone o crime o crime but the sun rises and the officers of conscience come and yonder lies the body on the moor i happened to pass and looked at the northumberland street house the other day a few loiterers were gazing up at the dingy windows a plain ordinary face of a house enoughand in a chamber in it one man suddenly rose up pistol in hand to slaughter another have you ever killed any one in your thoughts has your heart compassed any mans death in your mind have you ever taken a brand from the altar and slain your brother how many plain ordinary faces of men do we look at unknowing of murder behind those eyes lucky for you and me brother that we have good thoughts unspoken but the bad ones i tell you that the sight of those blank windows in northumberland streetthrough which as it were my mind could picture the awful tragedy glimmering behindset me thinking mr streetpreacher here is a text for one of your pavement sermons but it is too glum and serious you eschew dark thoughts and desire to be cheerful and merry in the main and such being the case you see we must have no roundabout essay on this subject  well i had another arrow in my quiver so you know had william tell a bolt for his son the apple of his eye and a shaft for gessler in case william came to any trouble with the first poor little target and this i must tell you was to have been a rare roundabout performanceone of the very best that has ever appeared in this series it was to have contained all the deep pathos of addison the logical precision of rabelais the childlike playfulness of swift the manly stoicism of sterne the metaphysical depth of goldsmith the blushing modesty of fielding the epigrammatic terseness of walter scott the uproarious humor of sam richardson and the gay simplicity of sam johnsonit was to have combined all these qualities with some excellences of modern writers whom i could namebut circumstances have occurred which have rendered this roundabout essay also impossible  i have not the least objection to tell you what was to have been the subject of that other admirable roundabout paper gracious powers the dean of st patricks never had a better theme the paper was to have been on the gorillas to be sure i was going to imagine myself to be a young surgeonapprentice from charleston in south carolina who ran away to cuba on account of unhappy family circumstances with which nobody has the least concern who sailed thence to africa in a large roomy schooner with an extraordinary vacant space between decks i was subject to dreadful ill treatment from the first mate of the ship who when i found she was a slaver altogether declined to put me on shore i was chasedwe were chasedby three british frigates and a seventyfour which we engaged and captured but were obliged to scuttle and sink as we could sell them in no african port and i never shall forget the look of manly resignation combined with considerable disgust of the british admiral as he walked the plank after cutting off his pigtail which he handed to me and which i still have in charge for his family at boston lincolnshire england  we made the port of bpoopoo at the confluence of the bungo and sgglolo rivers which you may see in swammerdahls map on the 31st april last year our passage had been so extraordinarily rapid owing to the continued drunkenness of the captain and chief officers by which i was obliged to work the ship and take her in command that we reached bpoopoo six weeks before we were expected and five before the coffres from the interior and from the great slave depot at zbabblo were expected their delay caused us not a little discomfort because though we had taken the four english ships we knew that sir byam martins ironcased squadron with the warrior the impregnable the sanconiathon and the berosus were cruising in the neighborhood and might prove too much for us  it not only became necessary to quit bpoopoo before the arrival of the british fleet or the rainy season but to get our people on board as soon as might be while the chief mate with a detachment of seamen hurried forward to the pgogo lake where we expected a considerable part of our cargo the second mate with six men four chiefs king fbumbo an obi man and myself went nw by w towards king mtobystown where we knew many hundreds of our betweendeck passengers were to be got together we went down the pdodo river shooting snipes ostriches and rhinoceros in plenty and i think a few elephants until by the advice of a guide who i now believe was treacherous we were induced to leave the pdodo and march ne by nn here lieutenant larkins who had persisted in drinking rum from morning to night and thrashing me in his sober moments during the whole journey died and i have too good reason to know was eaten with much relish by the natives at mgoo where there are barracoons and a depot for our cargo we had no news of our expected freight accordingly as time pressed exceedingly parties were despatched in advance towards the great washaboo lake by which the caravans usually come towards the coast here we found no caravan but only four negroes down with the ague whom i treated i am bound to say unsuccessfully whilst we waited for our friends we used to take watch and watch in front of the place both to guard ourselves from attack and get early news of the approaching caravan  at last on the 23rd september as i was in advance with charles rogers second mate and two natives with bows and arrows we were crossing a great plain skirted by a forest when we saw emerging from a ravine what i took to be three negroesa very tall one one of a moderate size and one quite little  our native guide shrieked out some words in their language of which charles rogers knew something i thought it was the advance of the negroes whom we expected no said rogers who swore dreadfully in conversation it is the gorillas and he fired both barrels of his gun bringing down the little one first and the female afterwards  the male who was untouched gave a howl that you might have heard a league off advanced towards us as if he would attack us and then turned and ran away with inconceivable celerity towards the wood  we went up towards the fallen brutes the little one by the female appeared to be about two years old it lay bleating and moaning on the ground stretching out its little hands with movements and looks so strangely resembling human that my heart sickened with pity the female who had been shot through both legs could not move she howled most hideously when i approached the little one  we must be off said rogers or the whole gorilla race may be down upon us the little one is only shot in the leg i said ill bind the limb up and we will carry the beast with us on board  the poor little wretch held up its leg to show it was wounded and looked to me with appealing eyes it lay quite still whilst i looked for and found the bullet and tearing off a piece of my shirt bandaged up the wound i was so occupied in this business that i hardly heard rogers cry run run and when i looked up  when i looked up with a roar the most horrible i ever hearda roar ten thousand roarsa whirling army of dark beings rushed by me rogers who had bullied me so frightfully during the voyage and who had encouraged my fatal passion for play so that i own i owed him 1500 dollars was overtaken felled brained and torn into ten thousand pieces and i dare say the same fate would have fallen on me but that the little gorilla whose wound i had dressed flung its arms round my neck their arms you know are much longer than ours and when an immense gray gorilla with hardly any teeth brandishing the trunk of a gollyboshtree about sixteen feet long came up to me roaring the little one squeaked out something plaintive which of course i could not understand on which suddenly the monster flung down his tree squatted down on his huge hams by the side of the little patient and began to bellow and weep  and now do you see whom i had rescued i had rescued the young prince of the gorillas who was out walking with his nurse and footman the footman had run off to alarm his master and certainly i never saw a footman run quicker the whole army of gorillas rushed forward to rescue their prince and punish his enemies if the king gorillas emotion was great fancy what the queens must have been when she came up she arrived on a litter neatly enough made with wattled branches on which she lay with her youngest child a prince of three weeks old  my little protege with the wounded leg still persisted in hugging me with its arms i think i mentioned that they are longer than those of men in general and as the poor little brute was immensely heavy and the gorillas go at a prodigious pace a litter was made for us likewise and my thirst much refreshed by a footman the same domestic who had given the alarm running hand over hand up a cocoanuttree tearing the rinds off breaking the shell on his head and handing me the fresh milk in its cup my little patient partook of a little stretching out its dear little unwounded foot with which or with its hand a gorilla can help itself indiscriminately relays of large gorillas relieved each other at the litters at intervals of twenty minutes as i calculated by my watch one of jones and batess of boston mass though i have been unable to this day to ascertain how these animals calculate time with such surprising accuracy we slept for that night under  and now you see we arrive at really the most interesting part of my travels in the country which i intended to visit viz the manners and habits of the gorillas chez eux i give the heads of this narrative only the full account being suppressed for a reason which shall presently be given the heads then of the chapters are briefly as follows   the authors arrival in the gorilla country its geographical position lodgings assigned to him up a gumtree constant attachment of the little prince his royal highnesss gratitude anecdotes of his wit playfulness and extraordinary precocity am offered a portion of poor larkins for my supper but decline with horror footman brings me a young crocodile fishy but very palatable old crocodiles too tough ditto rhinoceros visit the queen motheran enormous old gorilla quite white prescribe for her majesty meeting of gorillas at what appears a parliament amongst them presided over by old gorilla in cocoanutfibre wig their sports their customs a privileged class amongst them extraordinary likeness of gorillas to people at home both at charleston s c my native place and london england which i have visited flatnosed gorillas and bluenosed gorillas their hatred and wars between them in a part of the country its geographical position described i see several negroes under gorilla domination well treated by their masters frogeating gorillas across the salt lake bullheaded gorillastheir mutual hostility green island gorillas more quarrelsome than the bullheads and howl much louder i am called to attend one of the princesses evident partiality of h r h for me jealousy and rage of large redheaded gorilla how shall i escape   ay how indeed do you wish to know is your curiosity excited well i do know how i escaped i could tell the most extraordinary adventures that happened to me i could show you resemblances to people at home that would make them blue with rage and you crack your sides with laughter    and what is the reason i cannot write this paper having all the facts before me the reason is that walking down st james street yesterday i met a friend who says to me roundabout my boy have you seen your picture here it is and he pulls out a portrait executed in photography of your humble servant as an immense and most unpleasantfeatured baboon with long hairy hands and called by the waggish artist a literary gorilla o horror and now you see why i cant play off this joke myself and moralize on the fable as it has been narrated already de me     a mississippi bubble   this group of dusky children of the captivity is copied out of a little sketchbook which i carried in many a roundabout journey and will point a moral as well as any other sketch in the volume yonder drawing was made in a country where there was such hospitality friendship kindness shown to the humble designer that his eyes do not care to look out for faults or his pen to note them how they sang how they laughed and grinned how they scraped bowed and complimented you and each other those negroes of the cities of the southern parts of the then united states my business kept me in the towns i was but in one negroplantation village and there were only women and little children the men being out afield but there was plenty of cheerfulness in the huts under the great treesi speak of what i sawand amidst the dusky bondsmen of the cities i witnessed a curious gayety heard amongst the black folk endless singing shouting and laughter and saw on holidays black gentlemen and ladies arrayed in such splendor and comfort as freeborn workmen in our towns seldom exhibit what a grin and bow that dark gentleman performed who was the porter at the colonels when he said you write your name masr else i will forgot i am not going into the slavery question i am not an advocate for the institution as i know madam by that angry toss of your head you are about to declare me to be for domestic purposes my dear lady it seemed to me about the dearest institution that can be devised in a house in a southern city you will find fifteen negroes doing the work which john the cook the housemaid and the help do perfectly in your own comfortable london house and these fifteen negroes are the pick of a family of some eighty or ninety twenty are too sick or too old for work let us say twenty too clumsy twenty are too young and have to be nursed and watched by ten more and master has to maintain the immense crew to do the work of half a dozen willing hands no no let mitchell the exile from poor dear enslaved ireland wish for a gang of fat niggers i would as soon you should make me a present of a score of bengal elephants when i need but a single stout horse to pull my brougham        this refers to an illustrated edition of the work        this was an account given by a gentleman at richmond of      his establishment  six european servants would have kept      his house and stables well  his farm he said barely      sufficed to maintain the negroes residing on it  how hospitable they were those southern men in the north itself the welcome was not kinder as i who have eaten northern and southern salt can testify as for new orleans in springtimejust when the orchards were flushing over with peachblossoms and the sweet herbs came to flavor the julepsit seemed to me the city of the world where you can eat and drink the most and suffer the least at bordeaux itself claret is not better to drink than at new orleans it was all goodbelieve an expert robertfrom the halfdollar medoc of the public hotel table to the private gentlemans choicest wine claret is somehow good in that gifted place at dinner at supper and at breakfast in the morning it is good it is superabundantand there is nothing to pay find me speaking ill of such a country when i do pone me pigris campis smother me in a desert or let mississippi or garonne drown me at that comfortable tavern on pontchartrain we had a bouillabaisse than which a better was never eaten at marseilles and not the least headache in the morning i give you my word on the contrary you only wake with a sweet refreshing thirst for claret and water they say there is fever there in the autumn but not in the springtime when the peachblossoms blush over the orchards and the sweet herbs come to flavor the juleps  i was bound from new orleans to saint louis and our walk was constantly on the levee whence we could see a hundred of those huge white mississippi steamers at their moorings in the river look said my friend lochlomond to me as we stood one day on the quaylook at that post look at that coffeehouse behind it sir last year a steamer blew up in the river yonder just where you see those men pulling off in the boat by that post where you are standing a mule was cut in two by a fragment of the burst machinery and a bit of the chimneystove in that firstfloor window of the coffeehouse killed a negro who was cleaning knives in the toproom i looked at the post at the coffeehouse window at the steamer in which i was going to embark at my friend with a pleasing interest not divested of melancholy yesterday it was the mule thinks i who was cut in two it may be cras mihi why in the same little sketchbook there is a drawing of an alabama river steamer which blew up on the very next voyage after that in which your humble servant was on board had i but waited another week i might have    these incidents give a queer zest to the voyage down the lifestream in america when our huge tall white pasteboard castle of a steamer began to work up stream every limb in her creaked and groaned and quivered so that you might fancy she would burst right off would she hold together or would she split into ten million of shivers o my home and children would your humble servants body be cut in two across yonder chain on the levee or be precipitated into yonder firstfloor so as to damage the chest of a black man cleaning boots at the window the black man is safe for me thank goodness but you see the little accident might have happened it has happened and if to a mule why not to a more docile animal on our journey up the mississippi i give you my honor we were on fire three times and burned our cookroom down the deck at night was a great fireworkthe chimney spouted myriads of stars which fell blackening on our garments sparkling on to the deck or gleaming into the mighty stream through which we laboredthe mighty yellow stream with all its snags  how i kept up my courage through these dangers shall now be narrated the excellent landlord of the saint charles hotel when i was going away begged me to accept two bottles of the very finest cognac with his compliments and i found them in my stateroom with my luggage lochlomond came to see me off and as he squeezed my hand at parting roundabout says he the wine maynt be very good on board so i have brought a dozencase of the medoc which you liked and we grasped together the hands of friendship and farewell whose boat is this pulling up to the ship it is our friend glenlivat who gave us the dinner on lake pontchartrain roundabout says he we have tried to do what we could for you my boy and it has been done de bon coeur i detect a kind tremulousness in the good fellows voice as he speaks i sayhemthe athe wine isnt too good on board so ive brought you a dozen of medoc for your voyage you know and god bless you and when i come to london in may i shall come and see you hallo heres johnson come to see you off too  as i am a miserable sinner when johnson grasped my hand he said mr roundabout you cant be sure of the wine on board these steamers so i thought i would bring you a little case of that light claret which you liked at my house et de trois no wonder i could face the mississippi with so much courage supplied to me where are you honest friends who gave me of your kindness and your cheer may i be considerably boiled blown up and snagged if i speak hard words of you may claret turn sour ere i do  mounting the stream it chanced that we had very few passengers how far is the famous city of memphis from new orleans i do not mean the egyptian memphis but the american memphis from which to the american cairo we slowly toiled up the riverto the american cairo at the confluence of the ohio and mississippi rivers and at cairo we parted company from the boat and from some famous and gifted fellowpassengers who joined us at memphis and whose pictures we had seen in many cities of the south i do not give the names of these remarkable people unless by some wondrous chance in inventing a name i should light upon that real one which some of them bore but if you please i will say that our fellowpassengers whom we took in at memphis were no less personages than the vermont giant and the famous bearded lady of kentucky and her son their pictures i had seen in many cities through which i travelled with my own little performance i think the vermont giant was a trifle taller in his pictures than he was in life being represented in the former as at least some two stories high but the ladys prodigious beard received no more than justice at the hands of the painter that portion of it which i saw being really most black rich and curlyi say the portion of beard for this modest or prudent woman kept i dont know how much of the beard covered up with a red handkerchief from which i suppose it only emerged when she went to bed or when she exhibited it professionally  the giant i must think was an overrated giant i have known gentlemen not in the profession better made and i should say taller than the vermont gentleman a strange feeling i used to have at meals when on looking round our little society i saw the giant the bearded lady of kentucky the little bearded boy of three years old the captain this i think but at this distance of time i would not like to make the statement on affidavit and the three other passengers all with their knives in their mouths making play at the dinnera strange feeling i say it was and as though i was in a castle of ogres but after all why so squeamish a few scores of years back the finest gentlemen and ladies of europe did the like belinda ate with her knife and saccharissa had only that weapon or a twopronged fork or a spoon for her pease have you ever looked at gilrays print of the prince of wales a languid voluptuary retiring after his meal and noted the toothpick which he uses    you are right madam i own that the subject is revolting and terrible i will not pursue it onlyallow that a gentleman in a shaky steamboat on a dangerous river in a faroff country which caught fire three times during the voyageof course i mean the steamboat not the countryseeing a giant a voracious supercargo a bearded lady and a little boy not three years of age with a chin already quite black and curly all plying their victuals down their throats with their knivesallow madam that in such a company a man had a right to feel a little nervous i dont know whether you have ever remarked the indian jugglers swallowing their knives or seen as i have a whole table of people performing the same trick but if you look at their eyes when they do it i assure you there is a roll in them which is dreadful  apart from this usage which they practise in common with many thousand most estimable citizens the vermont gentleman and the kentucky whiskered ladyor did i say the reversewhichever you like my dear sirwere quite quiet modest unassuming people she sat working with her needle if i remember right he i suppose slept in the great cabin which was seventy feet long at the least nor i am bound to say did i hear in the night any snores or roars such as you would fancy ought to accompany the sleep of ogres nay this giant had quite a small appetite unless to be sure he went forward and ate a sheep or two in private with his horrid knifeoh the dreadful thoughtbut in public i say he had quite a delicate appetite and was also a teatotaler i dont remember to have heard the ladys voice though i might not unnaturally have been curious to hear it was her voice a deep rich magnificent bass or was it soft fluty and mild i shall never know now even if she comes to this country i shall never go and see her i have seen her and for nothing  you would have fancied that as after all we were only some halfdozen on board she might have dispensed with her red handkerchief and talked and eaten her dinner in comfort but in covering her chin there was a kind of modesty that beard was her profession that beard brought the public to see her out of her business she wished to put that beard aside as it were as a barrister would wish to put off his wig i know some who carry theirs into private life and who mistake you and me for juryboxes when they address us but these are not your modest barristers not your true gentlemen  well i own i respected the lady for the modesty with which her public business over she retired into private life she respected her life and her beard that beard having done its days work she puts it away in her handkerchief and becomes as far as in her lies a private ordinary person all public men and women of good sense i should think have this modesty when for instance in my small way poor mrs brown comes simpering up to me with her album in one hand a pen in the other and says ho ho dear mr roundabout write us one of your amusing c c my beard drops behind my handkerchief instantly why am i to wag my chin and grin for mrs browns good pleasure my dear madam i have been making faces all day it is my profession i do my comic business with the greatest pains seriousness and trouble and with it make i hope a not dishonest livelihood if you ask mons blondin to tea you dont have a rope stretched from your garret window to the opposite side of the square and request monsieur to take his tea out on the centre of the rope i lay my hand on this waistcoat and declare that not once in the course of our voyage together did i allow the kentucky giant to suppose i was speculating on his stature or the bearded lady to surmise that i wished to peep under the handkerchief which muffled the lower part of her face and the more fool you says some cynic faugh those cynics i hate em dont you know sir that a man of genius is pleased to have his genius recognized that a beauty likes to be admired that an actor likes to be applauded that stout old wellington himself was pleased and smiled when the people cheered him as he passed suppose you had paid some respectful compliment to that lady suppose you had asked that giant if for once he would take anything at the liquorbar you might have learned a great deal of curious knowledge regarding giants and bearded ladies about whom you evidently now know very little there was that little boy of three years old with a fine beard already and his little legs and arms as seen out of his little frock covered with a dark down what a queer little capering satyr he was quite goodnatured childish rather solemn he had a little norval dress i remember the drollest little norval  i have said the b l had another child now this was a little girl of some six years old as fair and as smooth of skin dear madam as your own darling cherubs she wandered about the great cabin quite melancholy no one seemed to care for her all the family affections were centred on master esau yonder his little beard was beginning to be a little fortune already whereas miss rosalba was of no good to the family no one would pay a cent to see her little fair face no wonder the poor little maid was melancholy as i looked at her i seemed to walk more and more in a fairy tale and more and more in a cavern of ogres was this a little fondling whom they had picked up in some forest where lie the picked bones of the queen her tender mother and the tough old defunct monarch her father no doubtless they were quite goodnatured people these i dont believe they were unkind to the little girl without the moustaches it may have been only my fancy that she repined because she had a cheek no more bearded than a roses  would you wish your own daughter madam to have a smooth cheek a modest air and a gentle feminine behavior or to bei wont say a whiskered prodigy like this bearded lady of kentuckybut a masculine wonder a virago a female personage of more than female strength courage wisdom some authors who shall be nameless are i know accused of depicting the most feeble brainless nambypamby heroines for ever whimpering tears and prattling commonplaces you would have the heroine of your novel so beautiful that she should charm the captain or hero whoever he may be with her appearance surprise and confound the bishop with her learning outride the squire and get the brush and when he fell from his horse whip out a lancet and bleed him rescue from fever and death the poor cottagers family whom the doctor had given up make 21 at the butts with the rifle when the poor captain only scored 18 give him twenty in fifty at billiards and beat him and draw tears from the professional italian people by her exquisite performance of voice and violoncello in the eveningi say if a novelist would be popular with ladiesthe great novelreaders of the worldthis is the sort of heroine who would carry him through half a dozen editions suppose i had asked that bearded lady to sing confess now miss you would not have been displeased if i had told you that she had a voice like lablache only ever so much lower  my dear you would like to be a heroine you would like to travel in triumphal caravans to see your effigy placarded on city walls to have your levees attended by admiring crowds all crying out was there ever such a wonder of a woman you would like admiration consider the tax you pay for it you would be alone were you eminent were you so distinguished from your neighbors i will not say by a beard and whiskers that were odiousbut by a great and remarkable intellectual superioritywould you do you think be any the happier consider envy consider solitude consider the jealousy and torture of mind which this kentucky lady must feel suppose she should hear that there is let us say a missouri prodigy with a beard larger than hers consider how she is separated from her kind by the possession of that wonder of a beard when that beard grows gray how lonely she will be the poor old thing if it falls off the public admiration falls off too and how she will miss itthe compliments of the trumpeters the admiration of the crowd the gilded progress of the car i see an old woman alone in a decrepit old caravan with cobwebs on the knocker with a blistered ensign flapping idly over the door would you like to be that deserted person ah chloe to be good to be simple to be modest to be loved be thy lot be thankful thou art not taller nor stronger nor richer nor wiser than the rest of the world     on lettss diary   mine is one of your no 12 diaries three shillings cloth boards silk limp gilt edges threeandsix french morocco tuck ditto fourandsix it has two pages ruled with faint lines for memoranda for every week and a ruled account at the end for the twelve months from january to december where you may set down your incomings and your expenses i hope yours my respected reader are large that there are many fine round sums of figures on each side of the page liberal on the expenditure side greater still on the receipt i hope sir you will be a better man as they say in 62 than in this moribund 61 whose career of life is just coming to its terminus a better man in purse in body in souls health amen good sir in all who is there so good in mind body or estate but bettering wont still be good for him o unknown fate presiding over next year if you will give me better health a better appetite a better digestion a better income a better temper in 62 than you have bestowed in 61 i think your servant will be the better for the changes for instance i should be the better for a new coat this one i acknowledge is very old the family says so my good friend who amongst us would not be the better if he would give up some old habits yes yes you agree with me you take the allegory alas at our time of life we dont like to give up those old habits do we it is ill to change there is the good old loose easy slovenly bedgown laziness for example what man of sense likes to fling it off and put on a tight guinde prim dresscoat that pinches him there is the cozy wraprascal selfindulgencehow easy it is how warm how it always seems to fit you can walk out in it you can go down to dinner in it you can say of such what tully says of his books pernoctat nobiscum peregrinatur rusticatur it is a little slatternlyit is a good deal stainedit isnt becomingit smells of cigarsmoke but allons donc let the world call me idle and sloven i love my ease better than my neighbors opinion i live to please myself not you mr dandy with your supercilious airs i am a philosopher perhaps i live in my tub and dont make any other use of it we wont pursue further this unsavory metaphor but with regard to some of your old habits let us say  1 the habit of being censorious and speaking ill of your neighbors  2 the habit of getting into a passion with your manservant your maidservant your daughter wife c  3 the habit of indulging too much at table  4 the habit of smoking in the diningroom after dinner  5 the habit of spending insane sums of money in bricabrac tall copies binding elzevirs c 20 port outrageously fine horses ostentatious entertainments and what not or  6 the habit of screwing meanly when rich and chuckling over the saving of half a crown whilst you are poisoning your friends and family with bad wine  7 the habit of going to sleep immediately after dinner instead of cheerfully entertaining mrs jones and the family or  8 ladies the habit of running up bills with the milliners and swindling paterfamilias on the house bills  9 the habit of keeping him waiting for breakfast  10 the habit of sneering at mrs brown and the miss browns because they are not quite du monde or quite so genteel as lady smith  11 the habit of keeping your wretched father up at balls till five oclock in the morning when he has to be at his office at eleven  12 the habit of fighting with each other dear louisa jane arabella amelia  13 the habit of always ordering john coachman threequarters of an hour before you want him  such habits i say sir or madam if you have had to note in your diary of 61 i have not the slightest doubt you will enter in your pocketbook of 62 there are habits nos 4 and 7 for example i am morally sure that some of us will not give up those bad customs though the women cry out and grumble and scold ever so justly there are habits nos 9 and 13 i feel perfectly certain my dear young ladies that you will continue to keep john coachman waiting that you will continue to give the most satisfactory reasons for keeping him waiting and as for 9 you will show that you once on the 1st of april last let us say came to breakfast first and that you are always first in consequence  yes in our 62 diaries i fear we may all of us make some of the 61 entries there is my friend freehand for instance aha master freehand how you will laugh to find yourself here f is in the habit of spending a little ever so little more than his income he shows you how mrs freehand works and works and indeed jack freehand if you say she is an angel you dont say too much of her how they toil and how they mend and patch and pinch and how they cant live on their means and i very much fearnay i will bet him half a bottle of gladstone 14s per dozen claretthat the account which is a little on the wrong side this year will be a little on the wrong side in the next ensuing year of grace  a diary dies hodie how queer to read are some of the entries in the journal here are the records of dinners eaten and gone the way of flesh the lights burn blue somehow and we sit before the ghosts of victuals hark at the dead jokes resurging memory greets them with the ghost of a smile here are the lists of the individuals who have dined at your own humble table the agonies endured before and during those entertainments are renewed and smart again what a failure that special grand dinner was how those dreadful occasional waiters did break the old china what a dismal hash poor mary the cook made of the french dish which she would try out of francatelli how angry mrs pope was at not going down to dinner before mrs bishop how trimalchio sneered at your absurd attempt to give a feast and harpagon cried out at your extravagance and ostentation how lady almack bullied the other ladies in the drawingroom when no gentlemen were present never asked you back to dinner again left her card by her footman and took not the slightest notice of your wife and daughters at lady hustlebys assembly on the other hand how easy cozy merry comfortable those little dinners were got up at one or two days notice when everybody was contented the soup as clear as amber the wine as good as trimalchios own and the people kept their carriages waiting and would not go away until midnight  along with the catalogue of bygone pleasures balls banquets and the like which the pages record comes a list of much more important occurrences and remembrances of graver import on two days of divess diary are printed notices that dividends are due at the bank let us hope dear sir that this announcement considerably interests you in which case probably you have no need of the almanacmakers printed reminder if you look over poor jack recklesss notebook amongst his memoranda of racing odds given and taken perhaps you may readnabbams bill due 29th september 142l 15s 6d let us trust as the day has passed that the little transaction here noted has been satisfactorily terminated if you are paterfamilias and a worthy kind gentleman no doubt you have marked down on your register 17th december say boys come home ah how carefully that blessed day is marked in their little calendars in my time it used to be wednesday 13th november 5 weeks from the holidays wednesday 20th november 4 weeks from the holidays until sluggish time sped on and we came to wednesday 18th december o rapture do you remember peashooters i think we only had them on going home for holidays from private schoolsat public schools men are too dignified and then came that glorious announcement wednesday 27th papa took us to the pantomime or if not papa perhaps you condescended to go to the pit under charge of the footman  that was near the end of the yearand mamma gave you a new pocketbook perhaps with a little coin god bless her in the pocket and that pocketbook was for next year you know and in that pocketbook you had to write down that sad day wednesday january 24th eighteen hundred and never mind whatwhen dr birchs young friends were expected to reassemble  ah me every person who turns this page over has his own little diary in paper or ruled in his memory tablets and in which are set down the transactions of the now dying year boys and men we have our calendar mothers and maidens for example in your calendar pocketbook my good eliza what a sad sad day that ishow fondly and bitterly rememberedwhen your boy went off to his regiment to india to danger to battle perhaps what a day was that last day at home when the tall brother sat yet amongst the family the little ones round about him wondering at saddleboxes uniforms swordcases guncases and other wondrous apparatus of war and travel which poured in and filled the hall the new dressingcase for the beard not yet grown the great swordcase at which little brother tom looks so admiringly what a dinner that was that last dinner when little and grown children assembled together and all tried to be cheerful what a night was that last night when the young ones were at roost for the last time together under the same roof and the mother lay alone in her chamber counting the fatal hours as they tolled one after another amidst her tears her watching her fond prayers what a night that was and yet how quickly the melancholy dawn came only too soon the sun rose over the houses and now in a moment more the city seemed to wake the house began to stir the family gathers together for the last meal for the last time in the midst of them the widow kneels amongst her kneeling children and falters a prayer in which she commits her dearest her eldest born to the care of the father of all o night what tears you hidewhat prayers you hear and so the nights pass and the days succeed until that one comes when tears and parting shall be no more  in your diary as in mine there are days marked with sadness not for this year only but for all on a certain dayand the sun perhaps shining ever so brightlythe housemother comes down to her family with a sad face which scares the children round about in the midst of their laughter and prattle they may have forgottenbut she has nota day which came twenty years ago it may be and which she remembers only too well the long nightwatch the dreadful dawning and the rain beating at the pane the infant speechless but moaning in its little crib and then the awful calm the awful smile on the sweet cherub face when the cries have ceased and the little suffering breast heaves no more then the children as they see their mothers face remember this was the day on which their little brother died it was before they were born but she remembers it and as they pray together it seems almost as if the spirit of the little lost one was hovering round the group so they pass away friends kindred the dearestloved grown people aged infants as we go on the downhill journey the milestones are gravestones and on each more and more names are written unless haply you live beyond mans common age when friends have dropped off and tottering and feeble and unpitied you reach the terminus alone  in this past years diary is there any precious day noted on which you have made a new friend this is a piece of good fortune bestowed but grudgingly on the old after a certain age a new friend is a wonder like sarahs child aged persons are seldom capable of bearing friendships do you remember how warmly you loved jack and tom when you were at school what a passionate regard you had for ned when you were at college and the immense letters you wrote to each other how often do you write now that postage costs nothing there is the age of blossoms and sweet budding green the age of generous summer the autumn when the leaves drop and then winter shivering and bare quick children and sit at my feet for they are cold very cold and it seems as if neither wine nor worsted will warm em  in this past years diary is there any dismal day noted in which you have lost a friend in mine there is i do not mean by death those who are gone you have those who departed loving you love you still and you love them always they are not really gone those dear hearts and true they are only gone into the next room and you will presently get up and follow them and yonder door will close upon you and you will be no more seen as i am in this cheerful mood i will tell you a fine and touching story of a doctor which i heard lately about two years since there was in our or some other city a famous doctor into whose consultingroom crowds came daily so that they might be healed now this doctor had a suspicion that there was something vitally wrong with himself and he went to consult another famous physician at dublin or it may be at edinburgh and he of edinburgh punched his comrades sides and listened at his heart and lungs and felt his pulse i suppose and looked at his tongue and when he had done doctor london said to doctor edinburgh doctor how long have i to live and doctor edinburgh said to doctor london doctor you may last a year  then doctor london came home knowing that what doctor edinburgh said was true and he made up his accounts with man and heaven i trust and he visited his patients as usual and he went about healing and cheering and soothing and doctoring and thousands of sick people were benefited by him and he said not a word to his family at home but lived amongst them cheerful and tender and calm and loving though he knew the night was at hand when he should see them and work no more  and it was winter time and they came and told him that some man at a distancevery sick but very richwanted him and though doctor london knew that he was himself at deaths door he went to the sick man for he knew the large fee would be good for his children after him and he died and his family never knew until he was gone that he had been long aware of the inevitable doom  this is a cheerful carol for christmas is it not you see in regard to these roundabout discourses i never know whether they are to be merry or dismal my hobby has the bit in his mouth goes his own way and sometimes trots through a park and sometimes paces by a cemetery two days since came the printers little emissary with a note saying we are waiting for the roundabout paper a roundabout paper about what or whom how stale it has become that printed jollity about christmas carols and wassailbowls and holly and mistletoe and yulelogs de commandewhat heaps of these have we not had for years past well year after year the season comes come frost come thaw come snow come rain year after year my neighbor the parson has to make his sermons they are getting together the bonbons iced cakes christmas trees at fortnum and masons now the genii of the theatres are composing the christmas pantomime which our young folks will see and note anon in their little diaries  and now brethren may i conclude this discourse with an extract out of that great diary the newspaper i read it but yesterday and it has mingled with all my thoughts since then here are the two paragraphs which appeared following each other  mr r the advocategeneral of calcutta has been appointed to the post of legislative member of the council of the governorgeneral  sir r s agent to the governorgeneral for central india died on the 29th of october of bronchitis  these two men whose different fates are recorded in two paragraphs and half a dozen lines of the same newspaper were sisters sons in one of the stories by the present writer a man is described tottering up the steps of the ghaut having just parted with his child whom he is despatching to england from india i wrote this remembering in long long distant days such a ghaut or riverstair at calcutta and a day when down those steps to a boat which was in waiting came two children whose mothers remained on the shore one of those ladies was never to see her boy more and he too is just dead in india of bronchitis on the 29th october we were firstcousins had been little playmates and friends from the time of our birth and the first house in london to which i was taken was that of our aunt the mother of his honor the member of council his honor was even then a gentleman of the long robe being in truth a baby in arms we indian children were consigned to a school of which our deluded parents had heard a favorable report but which was governed by a horrible little tyrant who made our young lives so miserable that i remember kneeling by my little bed of a night and saying pray god i may dream of my mother thence we went to a public school and my cousin to addiscombe and to india  for thirtytwo years the paper says sir richmond shakespear faithfully and devotedly served the government of india and during that period but once visited england for a few months and on public duty in his military capacity he saw much service was present in eight general engagements and was badly wounded in the last in 1840 when a young lieutenant he had the rare good fortune to be the means of rescuing from almost hopeless slavery in khiva 416 subjects of the emperor of russia and but two years later greatly contributed to the happy recovery of our own prisoners from a similar fate in cabul throughout his career this officer was ever ready and zealous for the public service and freely risked life and liberty in the discharge of his duties lord canning to mark his high sense of sir richmond shakespears public services had lately offered him the chief commissionership of mysore which he had accepted and was about to undertake when death terminated his career  when he came to london the cousins and playfellows of early indian days met once again and shook hands can i do anything for you i remember the kind fellow asking he was always asking that question of all kinsmen of all widows and orphans of all the poor of young men who might need his purse or his service i saw a young officer yesterday to whom the first words sir richmond shakespear wrote on his arrival in india were can i do anything for you his purse was at the command of all his kind hand was always open it was a gracious fate which sent him to rescue widows and captives where could they have had a champion more chivalrous a protector more loving and tender  i write down his name in my little book among those of others dearly loved who too have been summoned hence and so we meet and part we struggle and succeed or we fail and drop unknown on the way as we leave the fond mothers knee the rough trials of childhood and boyhood begin and then manhood is upon us and the battle of life with its chances perils wounds defeats distinctions and fort william guns are saluting in one mans honor while the troops are firing the last volleys over the others graveover the grave of the brave the gentle the faithful christian soldier        w r obiit march 22 1862     notes of a weeks holiday   most of us tell old stories in our families the wife and children laugh for the hundredth time at the joke the old servants though old servants are fewer every day nod and smile a recognition at the wellknown anecdote dont tell that story of grouse in the gunroom says diggory to mr hardcastle in the play or i must laugh as we twaddle and grow old and forgetful we may tell an old story or out of mere benevolence and a wish to amuse a friend when conversation is flagging disinter a joe miller now and then but the practice is not quite honest and entails a certain necessity of hypocrisy on story hearers and tellers it is a sad thing to think that a man with what you call a fund of anecdote is a humbug more or less amiable and pleasant what right have i to tell my grouse in the gunroom over and over in the presence of my wife mother motherinlaw sons daughters old footman or parlormaid confidential clerk curate or what not i smirk and go through the history giving my admirable imitations of the characters introduced i mimic joness grin hobbss squint browns stammer gradys brogue sandys scotch accent to the best of my power and the family part of my audience laughs goodhumoredly perhaps the stranger for whose amusement the performance is given is amused by it and laughs too but this practice continued is not moral this selfindulgence on your part my dear paterfamilias is weak vainnot to say culpable i can imagine many a worthy man who begins unguardedly to read this page and comes to the present sentence lying back in his chair thinking of that story which he has told innocently for fifty years and rather piteously owning to himself well well it is wrong i have no right to call on my poor wife to laugh my daughters to affect to be amused by that old old jest of mine and they would have gone on laughing and they would have pretended to be amused to their dying day if this man had not flung his damper over our hilarity    i lay down the pen and think are there any old stories which i still tell myself in the bosom of my family have i any grouse in my gunroom if there are such it is because my memory fails not because i want applause and wantonly repeat myself you see men with the socalled fund of anecdote will not repeat the same story to the same individual but they do think that on a new party the repetition of a joke ever so old may be honorably tried i meet men walking the london street bearing the best reputation men of anecdotal powersi know such who very likely will read this and say hang the fellow he means me and so i do nono man ought to tell an anecdote more than thrice let us say unless he is sure he is speaking only to give pleasure to his hearersunless he feels that it is not a mere desire for praise which makes him open his jaws  and is it not with writers as with raconteurs ought they not to have their ingenuous modesty may authors tell old stories and how many times over when i come to look at a place which i have visited any time these twenty or thirty years i recall not the place merely but the sensations i had at first seeing it and which are quite different to my feelings today that first day at calais the voices of the women crying out at night as the vessel came alongside the pier the supper at quillacqs and the flavor of the cutlets and wine the redcalico canopy under which i slept the tiled floor and the fresh smell of the sheets the wonderful postilion in his jackboots and pigtailall return with perfect clearness to my mind and i am seeing them and not the objects which are actually under my eyes here is calais yonder is that commissioner i have known this score of years here are the women screaming and hustling over the baggage the people at the passportbarrier who take your papers my good people i hardly see you you no more interest me than a dozen orangewomen in coventgarden or a shop bookkeeper in oxford street but you make me think of a time when you were indeed wonderful to beholdwhen the little french soldiers wore white cockades in their shakoswhen the diligence was forty hours going to paris and the greatbooted postilion as surveyed by youthful eyes from the coupe with his jurons his ends of rope for the harness and his clubbed pigtail was a wonderful being and productive of endless amusement you young folks dont remember the applegirls who used to follow the diligence up the hill beyond boulogne and the delights of the jolly road in making continental journeys with young folks an oldster may be very quiet and to outward appearance melancholy but really he has gone back to the days of his youth and he is seventeen or eighteen years of age as the case may be and is amusing himself with all his might he is noting the horses as they come squealing out of the posthouse yard at midnight he is enjoying the delicious meals at beauvais and amiens and quaffing ad libitum the rich tabledhote wine he is hailfellow with the conductor and alive to all the incidents of the road a man can be alive in 1860 and 1830 at the same time dont you see bodily i may be in 1860 inert silent torpid but in the spirit i am walking about in 1828 let us sayin a blue dresscoat and brass buttons a sweet figured silk waistcoat which i button round a slim waist with perfect ease looking at beautiful beings with gigot sleeves and teatray hats under the golden chestnuts of the tuileries or round the place vendome where the drapeau blanc is floating from the statueless column shall we go and dine at bombardas near the hotel breteuil or at the cafe virginieaway bombardas and the hotel breteuil have been pulled down ever so long they knocked down the poor old virginia coffeehouse last year my spirit goes and dines there my body perhaps is seated with ever so many people in a railwaycarriage and no wonder my companions find me dull and silent have you read mr dale owens footfalls on the boundary of another worldmy dear sir it will make your hair stand quite refreshingly on end in that work you will read that when gentlemens or ladies spirits travel off a few score or thousand miles to visit a friend their bodies lie quiet and in a torpid state in their beds or in their armchairs at home so in this way i am absent my soul whisks away thirty years back into the past i am looking out anxiously for a beard i am getting past the age of loving byrons poems and pretend that i like wordsworth and shelley much better nothing i eat or drink in reason disagrees with me and i know whom i think to be the most lovely creature in the world ah dear maid of that remote but wellremembered period are you a wife or widow noware you deadare you thin and withered and oldor are you grown much stouter with a false front and so forth  o eliza elizastay was she eliza well i protest i have forgotten what your christian name was you know i only met you for two days but your sweet face is before me now and the roses blooming on it are as fresh as in that time of may ah dear miss x my timid youth and ingenuous modesty would never have allowed me even in my private thoughts to address you otherwise than by your paternal name but that though i conceal it i remember perfectly well and that your dear and respected father was a brewer   carilloni was awakened this morning with the chime which antwerp cathedral clock plays at halfhours the tune has been haunting me ever since as tunes will you dress eat drink walk and talk to yourself to their tune their inaudible jingle accompanies you all day you read the sentences of the paper to their rhythm i tried uncouthly to imitate the tune to the ladies of the family at breakfast and they say it is the shadow dance of dinorah it may be so i dimly remember that my body was once present during the performance of that opera whilst my eyes were closed and my intellectual faculties dormant at the back of the box howbeit i have learned that shadow dance from hearing it pealing up ever so high in the air at night morn noon  how pleasant to lie awake and listen to the cheery peal whilst the old city is asleep at midnight or waking up rosy at sunrise or basking in noon or swept by the scudding rain which drives in gusts over the broad places and the great shining river or sparkling in snow which dresses up a hundred thousand masts peaks and towers or wrapped round with thundercloud canopies before which the white gables shine whiter day and night the kind little carillon plays its fantastic melodies overhead the bells go on ringing quot vivos vocant mortuos plangunt fulgara frangunt so on to the past and future tenses and for how many nights days and years whilst the french were pitching their fulgara into chasses citadel the bells went on ringing quite cheerfully whilst the scaffolds were up and guarded by alvas soldiery and regiments of penitents blue black and gray poured out of churches and convents droning their dirges and marching to the place of the hotel de ville where heretics and rebels were to meet their doom the bells up yonder were chanting at their appointed halfhours and quarters and rang the mauvais quart dheure for many a poor soul this bell can see as far away as the towers and dykes of rotterdam that one can call a greeting to st ursulas at brussels and toss a recognition to that one at the townhall of oudenarde and remember how after a great struggle there a hundred and fifty years ago the whole plain was covered with the flying french cavalryburgundy and bern and the chevalier of st george flying like the rest what is your clamor about oudenarde says another bell bob major this one must be be still thou querulous old clapper i can see over to hougoumont and st john and about fortyfive years since i rang all through one sunday in june when there was such a battle going on in the cornfields there as none of you others ever heard tolled of yes from morning service until after vespers the french and english were all at it dingdong and then calls of business intervening the bells have to give up their private jangle resume their professional duty and sing their hourly chorus out of dinorah  what a prodigious distance those bells can be heard i was awakened this morning to their tune i say i have been hearing it constantly ever since and this house whence i write murray says is two hundred and ten miles from antwerp and it is a week off and there is the bell still jangling its shadow dance out of dinorah an audible shadow you understand and an invisible sound but quite distinct and a plague take the tune   under the bellswho has not seen the church under the bells those lofty aisles those twilight chapels that cumbersome pulpit with its huge carvings that wide gray pavement flecked with various light from the jewelled windows those famous pictures between the voluminous columns over the altars which twinkle with their ornaments their votive little silver hearts legs limbs their little guttering tapers cups of sham roses and what not i saw two regiments of little scholars creeping in and forming square each in its appointed place under the vast roof and teachers presently coming to them a stream of light from the jewelled windows beams slanting down upon each little squad of children and the tall background of the church retires into a grayer gloom pattering little feet of laggards arriving echo through the great nave they trot in and join their regiments gathered under the slanting sunbeams what are they learning is it truth those two gray ladies with their books in their hands in the midst of these little people have no doubt of the truth of every word they have printed under their eyes look through the windows jewelled all over with saints the light comes streaming down from the sky and heavens own illuminations paint the book a sweet touching picture indeed it is that of the little children assembled in this immense temple which has endured for ages and grave teachers bending over them yes the picture is very pretty of the children and their teachers and their bookbut the text is it the truth the only truth nothing but the truth if i thought so i would go and sit down on the form cum parvulis and learn the precious lesson with all my heart   beadlebut i submit an obstacle to conversions is the intrusion and impertinence of that swiss fellow with the baldricthe officer who answers to the beadle of the british islands and is pacing about the church with an eye on the congregation now the boast of catholics is that their churches are open to all but in certain places and churches there are exceptions at rome i have been into st peters at all hours the doors are always open the lamps are always burning the faithful are for ever kneeling at one shrine or the other but at antwerp not so in the afternoon you can go to the church and be civilly treated but you must pay a franc at the side gate in the forenoon the doors are open to be sure and there is no one to levy an entrance fee i was standing ever so still looking through the great gates of the choir at the twinkling lights and listening to the distant chants of the priests performing the service when a sweet chorus from the organloft broke out behind me overhead and i turned round my friend the drummajor ecclesiastic was down upon me in a moment do not turn your back to the altar during divine service says he in very intelligible english i take the rebuke and turn a soft rightabout face and listen awhile as the service continues see it i cannot nor the altar and its ministrants we are separated from these by a great screen and closed gates of iron through which the lamps glitter and the chant comes by gusts only seeing a score of children trotting down a side aisle i think i may follow them i am tired of looking at that hideous old pulpit with its grotesque monsters and decorations i slip off to the side aisle but my friend the drummajor is instantly after mealmost i thought he was going to lay hands on me you mustnt go there says he you mustnt disturb the service i was moving as quietly as might be and ten paces off there were twenty children kicking and clattering at their ease i point them out to the swiss they come to pray says he you dont come to pray you when i come to pay says i i am welcome and with this withering sarcasm i walk out of church in a huff i dont envy the feelings of that beadle after receiving point blank such a stroke of wit   leo belgicusperhaps you will say after this i am a prejudiced critic i see the pictures in the cathedral fuming under the rudeness of that beadle or at the lawful hours and prices pestered by a swarm of shabby touters who come behind me chattering in bad english and who would have me see the sights through their mean greedy eyes better see rubens any where than in a church at the academy for example where you may study him at your leisure but at churchi would as soon ask alexandre dumas for a sermon either would paint you a martyrdom very fiercely and picturesquelywrithing muscles flaming coals scowling captains and executioners swarming groups and light shade color most dexterously brilliant or dark but in rubens i am admiring the performer rather than the piece with what astonishing rapidity he travels over his canvas how tellingly the cool lights and warm shadows are made to contrast and relieve each other how that blazing blowsy penitent in yellow satin and glittering hair carries down the stream of light across the picture this is the way to work my boys and earn a hundred florins a day see i am as sure of my line as a skater of making his figure of eight and down with a sweep goes a brawny arm or a flowing curl of drapery the figures arrange themselves as if by magic the paintpots are exhausted in furnishing brown shadows the pupils look wondering on as the master careers over the canvas isabel or helena wife no 1 or no 2 are sitting by buxom exuberant ready to be painted and the children are boxing in the corner waiting till they are wanted to figure as cherubs in the picture grave burghers and gentlefolks come in on a visit there are oysters and rhenish always ready on yonder table was there ever such a painter he has been an ambassador an actual excellency and what better man could be chosen he speaks all the languages he earns a hundred florins a day prodigious thirtysix thousand five hundred florins a year enormous he rides out to his castle with a score of gentlemen after him like the governor that is his own portrait as st george you know he is an english knight those are his two wives as the two maries he chooses the handsomest wives he rides the handsomest horses he paints the handsomest pictures he gets the handsomest prices for them that slim young van dyck who was his pupil has genius too and is painting all the noble ladies in england and turning the heads of some of them and jordaenswhat a droll dog and clever fellow have you seen his fat silenus the master himself could not paint better and his altarpiece at st bavons he can paint you anything that jordaens cana drunken jollification of boors and doxies or a martyr howling with half his skin off what a knowledge of anatomy but there is nothing like the masternothing he can paint you his thirtysix thousand five hundred florins worth a year have you heard of what he has done for the french court prodigious i cant look at rubenss pictures without fancying i see that handsome figure swaggering before the canvas and hans hemmelinck at bruges have you never seen that dear old hospital of st john on passing the gate of which you enter into the fifteenth century i see the wounded soldier still lingering in the house and tended by the kind gray sisters his little panel on its easel is placed at the light he covers his board with the most wondrous beautiful little figures in robes as bright as rubies and amethysts i think he must have a magic glass in which he catches the reflection of little cherubs with manycolored wings very little and bright angels in long crisp robes of white surrounded with halos of gold come and flutter across the mirror and he draws them he hears mass every day he fasts through lent no monk is more austere and holy than hans which do you love best to behold the lamb or the lion the eagle rushing through the storm and pouncing mayhap on carrion or the linnet warbling on the spray  by much the most delightful of the christopher set of rubens to my mind and ego is introduced on these occasions so that the opinion may pass only for my own at the readers humble service to be received or declined is the presentation in the temple splendid in color in sentiment sweet and tender finely conveying the story to be sure all the others tell their tale unmistakablywitness that coarse salutation that magnificent adoration of the kings at the museum by the same strong downright hands that wonderful communion of st francis which i think gives the key to the artists faire better than any of his performances i have passed hours before that picture in my time trying and sometimes fancying i could understand by what masses and contrasts the artist arrived at his effect in many others of the pictures parts of his method are painfully obvious and you see how grief and agony are produced by blue lips and eyes rolling blood shot with dabs of vermilion there is something simple in the practice contort the eyebrow sufficiently and place the eyeball near itby a few lines you have anger or fierceness depicted give me a mouth with no special expression and pop a dab of carmine at each extremityand there are the lips smiling this is art if you will but a very naive kind of art and now you know the trick dont you see how easy it is   tu quoquenow you know the trick suppose you take a canvas and see whether you can do it there are brushes palettes and gallipots full of paint and varnish have you tried my dear siryou who set up to be a connoisseur have you tried i haveand many a day and the end of the days labor o dismal conclusion is this puerile niggling this feeble scrawl this impotent rubbish all you can produceyou who but now found rubens commonplace and vulgar and were pointing out the tricks of his mystery pardon o great chief magnificent master and poet you can do we critics who sneer and are wise can but pry and measure and doubt and carp look at the lion did you ever see such a gross shaggy mangy roaring brute look at him eating lumps of raw meatpositively bleeding and raw and toughtill faugh it turns ones stomach to see himo the coarse wretch yes but he is a lion rubens has lifted his great hand and the mark he has made has endured for two centuries and we still continue wondering at him and admiring him what a strength in that arm what splendor of will hidden behind that tawny beard and those honest eyes sharpen your pen my good critic shoot a feather into him hit him and make him wince yes you may hit him fair and make him bleed too but for all that he is a liona mighty conquering generous rampageous leo belgicusmonarch of his wood and he is not dead yet and i will not kick at him   sir antonyin that pieta of van dyck in the museum have you ever looked at the yellowrobed angel with the black scarf thrown over her wings and robe what a charming figure of grief and beauty what a pretty compassion it inspires it soothes and pleases me like a sweet rhythmic chant see how delicately the yellow robe contrasts with the blue sky behind and the scarf binds the two if rubens lacked grace van dyck abounded in it what a consummate elegance what a perfect cavalier no wonder the fine ladies in england admired sir antony look at  here the clock strikes three and the three gendarmes who keep the musee cry out allons sortons il est trois heures allez sortez and they skip out of the gallery as happy as boys running from school and we must go too for though many stay behindmany britons with murrays handbooks in their handsome handsthey have paid a franc for entrancefee you see and we knew nothing about the franc for entrance until those gendarmes with sheathed sabres had driven us out of this paradise  but it was good to go and drive on the great quays and see the ships unlading and by the citadel and wonder howabouts and whereabouts it was so strong we expect a citadel to look like gibraltar or ehrenbreitstein at least but in this one there is nothing to see but a flat plain and some ditches and some trees and mounds of uninteresting green and then i remember how there was a boy at school a little dumpy fellow of no personal appearance whatever who couldnt be overcome except by a much bigger champion and the immensest quantity of thrashing a perfect citadel of a boy with a general chasse sitting in that bombproof casemate his heart letting blow after blow come thumping about his head and never thinking of giving in  and we go home and we dine in the company of britons at the comfortable hotel du parc and we have bought a novel apiece for a shilling and every halfhour the sweet carillon plays the waltz from dinorah in the air and we have been happy and it seems about a month since we left london yesterday and nobody knows where we are and we defy care and the postman   spoorwegvast green flats speckled by spotted cows and bound by a gray frontier of windmills shining canals stretching through the green odors like those exhaled from the thames in the dogdays and a fine pervading smell of cheese little trim houses with tall roofs and great windows of many panes gazebos or summerhouses hanging over peagreen canals kindlooking dumplingfaced farmers women with laced caps and golden frontlets and earrings about the houses and towns which we pass a great air of comfort and neatness a queer feeling of wonder that you cant understand what your fellowpassengers are saying the tone of whose voices and a certain comfortable dowdiness of dress are so like our ownwhilst we are remarking on these sights sounds smells the little railway journey from rotterdam to the hague comes to an end i speak to the railway porters and hackney coachmen in english and they reply in their own language and it seems somehow as if we understood each other perfectly the carriage drives to the handsome comfortable cheerful hotel we sit down a score at the table and there is one foreigner and his wifei mean every other man and woman at dinner are english as we are close to the sea and in the midst of endless canals we have no fish we are reminded of dear england by the noble prices which we pay for wines i confess i lost my temper yesterday at rotterdam where i had to pay a florin for a bottle of ale the water not being drinkable and country or bavarian beer not being genteel enough for the hoteli confess i say that my fine temper was ruffled when the bottle of pale ale turned out to be a pint bottle and i meekly told the waiter that i had bought beer at jerusalem at a less price but then rotterdam is eighteen hours from london and the steamer with the passengers and beer comes up to the hotel windows whilst to jerusalem they have to carry the ale on camels backs from beyrout or jaffa and through hordes of marauding arabs who evidently dont care for pale ale though i am told it is not forbidden in the koran mine would have been very good but i choked with rage whilst drinking it a florin for a bottle and that bottle having the words imperial pint in bold relief on the surface it was too much i intended not to say anything about it but i must speak a florin a bottle and that bottle a pint oh for shame for shame i cant cork down my indignation i froth up with fury i am pale with wrath and bitter with scorn  as we drove through the old city at night how it swarmed and hummed with life what a special clatter crowd and outcry there was in the jewish quarter where myriads of young ones were trotting about the fishy street why dont they have lamps we passed by canals seeming so full that a pailful of water more would overflow the place the laquaisdeplace calls out the names of the buildings the townhall the cathedral the arsenal the synagogue the statue of erasmus get along we know the statue of erasmus well enough we pass over drawbridges by canals where thousands of barges are at roost at roostat rest shall we have rest in those bedrooms those ancient lofty bedrooms in that inn where we have to pay a florin for a pint of papsha at the new bath hotel on the boompjes if this dreary edifice is the new bath what must the old bath be like as i feared to go to bed i sat in the coffeeroom as long as i might but three young men were imparting their private adventures to each other with such freedom and liveliness that i felt i ought not to listen to their artless prattle as i put the light out and felt the bedclothes and darkness overwhelm me it was with an awful sense of terrorthat sort of sensation which i should think going down in a divingbell would give suppose the apparatus goes wrong and they dont understand your signal to mount suppose your matches miss fire when you wake when you want them when you will have to rise in half an hour and do battle with the horrid enemy who crawls on you in the darkness i protest i never was more surprised than when i woke and beheld the light of dawn indian birds and strange trees were visible on the ancient gilt hangings of the lofty chamber and through the windows the boompjes and the ships along the quay we have all read of deserters being brought out and made to kneel with their eyes bandaged and hearing the word to fire given i declare i underwent all the terrors of execution that night and wonder how i ever escaped unwounded  but if ever i go to the bath hotel rotterdam again i am a dutchman a guilder for a bottle of pale ale and that bottle a pint ah for shamefor shame   mine ease in mine inndo you object to talk about inns it always seems to me to be very good talk walter scott is full of inns in don quixote and gil blas there is plenty of inntalk sterne fielding and smollett constantly speak about them and in their travels the last two tot up the bill and describe the dinner quite honestly whilst mr sterne becomes sentimental over a cab and weeps generous tears over a donkey  how i admire and wonder at the information in murrays handbookswonder how it is got and admire the travellers who get it for instance you read amiens please select your towns 60000 inhabitants hotels clion dor good and clean le lion dargent so so le lion noir bad dirty and dear now say there are three travellersthree inninspectors who are sent forth by mr murray on a great commission and who stop at every inn in the world the eldest goes to the lion dorcapital house good tabledhote excellent wine moderate charges the second commissioner tries the silver liontolerable house bed dinner bill and so forth but fancy commissioner no 3the poor fag doubtless and boots of the party he has to go to the lion noir he knows he is to have a bad dinnerhe eats it uncomplainingly he is to have bad wine he swallows it grinding his wretched teeth and aware that he will he unwell in consequence he knows he is to have a dirty bed and what he is to expect there he pops out the candle he sinks into those dingy sheets he delivers over his body to the nightly tormentors he pays an exorbitant bill and he writes down lion noir bad dirty dear next day the commission sets out for arras we will say and they begin again le cochon dor le cochon dargent le cochon noirand that is poor bootss inn of course what a life that poor man must lead what horrors of dinners he has to go through what a hide he must have and yet not impervious for unless he is bitten how is he to be able to warn others no on second thoughts you will perceive that he ought to have a very delicate skin the monsters ought to troop to him eagerly and bite him instantaneously and freely so that he may be able to warn all future handbook buyers of their danger i fancy this man devoting himself to danger to dirt to bad dinners to sour wine to damp beds to midnight agonies to extortionate bills i admire him i thank him think of this champion who devotes his body for usthis dauntless gladiator going to do battle alone in the darkness with no other armor than a light helmet of cotton and a lorica of calico i pity and honor him go spartacus go devoted manto bleed to groan to sufferand smile in silence as the wild beasts assail thee  how did i come into this talk i protest it was the word inn set me offand here is one the hotel de belle vue at the hague as comfortable as handsome as cheerful as any i ever took mine ease in and the bavarian beer my dear friend how good and brisk and light it is take another glassit refreshes and does not stupefyand then we will sally out and see the town and the park and the pictures  the prettiest little brick city the pleasantest little park to ride in the neatest comfortable people walking about the canals not unsweet and busy and picturesque with oldworld life rows upon rows of houses built with the neatest little bricks with windows fresh painted and tall doors polished and carved to a nicety what a pleasant spacious garden our inn has all sparkling with autumn flowers and bedizened with statues at the end is a row of trees and a summerhouse over the canal where you might go and smoke a pipe with mynheer van dunck and quite cheerfully catch the ague yesterday as we passed they were making hay and stacking it in a barge which was lying by the meadow handy round about kensington palace there are houses roofs chimneys and bricks like these i feel that a dutchman is a man and a brother it is very funny to read the newspaper one can understand it somehow sure it is the neatest gayest little cityscores and hundreds of mansions looking like cheyne walk or the ladies schools about chiswick and hackney   le gros lotto a few lucky men the chance befalls of reaching fame at once and if it is of any profit morituro retaining the admiration of the world did poor oliver when he was at leyden yonder ever think that he should paint a little picture which should secure him the applause and pity of all europe for a century after he and sterne drew the twenty thousand prize of fame the latter had splendid instalments during his lifetime the ladies pressed round him the wits admired him the fashion hailed the successor of rabelais goldsmiths little gem was hardly so valued until later days their works still form the wonder and delight of the lovers of english art and the pictures of the vicar and uncle toby are among the masterpieces of our english school here in the hague gallery is paul potters pale eager face and yonder is the magnificent work by which the young fellow achieved his fame how did you so young come to paint so well what hidden power lay in that weakly lad that enabled him to achieve such a wonderful victory could little mozart when he was five years old tell you how he came to play those wonderful sonatas potter was gone out of the world before he was thirty but left this prodigy and i know not how many more specimens of his genius and skill behind him the details of this admirable picture are as curious as the effect is admirable and complete the weather being unsettled and clouds and sunshine in the gusty sky we saw in our little tour numberless paul pottersthe meadows streaked with sunshine and spotted with the cattle the city twinkling in the distance the thunderclouds glooming overhead napoleon carried off the picture vide murray amongst the spoils of his bow and spear to decorate his triumph of the louvre if i were a conquering prince i would have this picture certainly and the raphael madonna from dresden and the titian assumption from venice and that matchless rembrandt of the dissection the prostrate nations would howl with rage as my gendarmes took off the pictures nicely packed and addressed to mr the director of my imperial palace of the louvre at paris this side uppermost the austrians prussians saxons italians c should be free to come and visit my capital and bleat with tears before the pictures torn from their native cities their ambassadors would meekly remonstrate and with faded grins make allusions to the feeling of despair occasioned by the absence of the beloved works of art bah i would offer them a pinch of snuff out of my box as i walked along my gallery with their excellencies cringing after me zenobia was a fine woman and a queen but she had to walk in aurelians triumph the procede was peu delicat en usez vous mon cher monsieur the marquis says the macaba is delicious what a splendor of color there is in that cloud what a richness what a freedom of handling and what a marvellous

claim upon these virgin altarpieces i am your humble servant tom moore painted altarpieces as well as milton and warbled sacred songs and loves of the angels after his fashion i wonder did watteau ever try historical subjects and as for greuze you know that his heads will fetch 1000l 1500l 2000las much as a sevres cabaret of rose du barri if cost price is to be your criterion of worth what shall we say to that little receipt for 10l for the copyright of paradise lost which used to hang in old mr rogerss room when living painters as frequently happens in our days see their pictures sold at auctions for four or five times the sums which they originally received are they enraged or elated a hundred years ago the state of the picturemarket was different that dreary old italian stock was much higher than at present rembrandt himself a close man was known to be in difficulties if ghosts are fond of money still what a wrath his must be at the present value of his works  the hague rembrandt is the greatest and grandest of all his pieces to my mind some of the heads are as sweetly and lightly painted as gainsborough the faces not ugly but delicate and highbred the exquisite gray tones are charming to mark and study the heads not plastered but painted with a free liquid brush the result one of the great victories won by this consummate chief and left for the wonder and delight of succeeding ages  the humblest volunteer in the ranks of art who has served a campaign or two ever so ingloriously has at least this good fortune of understanding or fancying he is able to understand how the battle has been fought and how the engaged general won it this is the rhinelanders most brilliant achievementvictory along the whole line the nightwatch at amsterdam is magnificent in parts but on the side to the spectators right smoky and dim the five masters of the drapers is wonderful for depth strength brightness massive power what words are these to express a picture to describe a description i once saw a moon riding in the sky serenely attended by her sparkling maids of honor and a little lady said with an air of great satisfaction i must sketch it ah my dear lady if with an hb a bristol board and a bit of indiarubber you can sketch the starry firmament on high and the moon in her glory i make you my compliment i cant sketch the five drapers with any ink or pen at present at commandbut can look with all my eyes and be thankful to have seen such a masterpiece  they say he was a moody illconditioned man the old tenant of the mill what does he think of the vander helst which hangs opposite his nightwatch and which is one of the great pictures of the world it is not painted by so great a man as rembrandt but there it isto see it is an event of your life having beheld it you have lived in the year 1648 and celebrated the treaty of munster you have shaken the hands of the dutch guardsmen eaten from their platters drunk their rhenish heard their jokes as they wagged their jolly beards the amsterdam catalogue discourses thus about ita model catalogue it gives you the prices paid the signatures of the painters a succinct description of the work  this masterpiece represents a banquet of the civic guard which took place on the 18th june 1648 in time great hall of the st joris doele on the singel at amsterdam to celebrate the conclusion of the peace at munster the thirtyfive figures composing the picture are all portraits  the captain witse is placed at the head of the table and attracts our attention first he is dressed in black velvet his breast covered with a cuirass on his head a broadbrimmed black hat with white plumes he is comfortably seated on a chair of black oak with a velvet cushion and holds in his left hand supported on his knee a magnificent drinkinghorn surrounded by a st george destroying the dragon and ornamented with oliveleaves the captains features express cordiality and goodhumor he is grasping the hand of lieutenant van wavern seated near him in a habit of dark gray with lace and buttons of gold lacecollar and wristbands his feet crossed with boots of yellow leather with large tops and gold spurs on his head a black hat and darkbrown plumes behind him at the centre of the picture is the standardbearer jacob banning in an easy martial attitude hat in hand his right hand on his chair his right leg on his left knee he holds the flag of blue silk in which the virgin is embroidered such a silk such a flag such a piece of painting emblematic of the town of amsterdam the banner covers his shoulder and he looks towards the spectator frankly and complacently  the man behind him is probably one of the sergeants his head is bare he wears a cuirass and yellow gloves gray stockings and boots with large tops and kneecaps of cloth he has a napkin on his knees and in his hand a piece of ham a slice of bread and a knife the old man behind is probably william the drummer he has his hat in his right hand and in his left a goldfooted wineglass filled with white wine he wears a red scarf and a black satin doublet with little slashes of yellow silk behind the drummer two matchlockmen are seated at the end of the table one in a large black habit a napkin on his knee a haussecol of iron and a linen scarf and collar he is eating with his knife the other holds a long glass of white wine four musketeers with different shaped hats are behind these one holding a glass the three others with their guns on their shoulders other guests are placed between the personage who is giving the toast and the standardbearer one with his hat off and his hand uplifted is talking to another the second is carving a fowl a third holds a silver plate and another in the background a silver flagon from which he fills a cup the corner behind the captain is filled by two seated personages one of whom is peeling an orange two others are standing armed with halberts of whom one holds a plumed hat behind him are other three individuals one of them holding a pewter pot on which the name poock the landlord of the hotel doele is engraved at the back a maidservant is coming in with a pasty crowned with a turkey most of the guests are listening to the captain from an open window in the distance the facades of two houses are seen surmounted by stone figures of sheep  there now you know all about it now you can go home and paint just such another if you do do pray remember to paint the hands of the figures as they are here depicted they are as wonderful portraits as the faces none of your slim van dyck elegancies which have done duty at the cuffs of so many doublets but each man with a hand for himself as with a face for himself i blushed for the coarseness of one of the chiefs in this great company that fellow behind william the drummer splendidly attired sitting full in the face of the public and holding a porkbone in his hand suppose the saturday review critic were to come suddenly on this picture ah what a shock it would give that noble nature why is that knuckle of pork not painted out at any rate why is not a little fringe of lace painted round it or a cut pink paper or couldnt a smellingbottle be painted in instead with a crest and a gold top or a cambric pockethandkerchief in lieu of the horrid pig with a pink coronet in the corner or suppose you covered the mans hand which is very coarse and strong and gave him the decency of a kid glove but a piece of pork in a naked hand o nerves and eau de cologne hide it hide it  in spite of this lamentable coarseness my noble sergeant give me thy hand as nature made it a great and famous and noble handiwork i have seen here not the greatest picture in the worldnot a work of the highest geniusbut a performance so great various and admirable so shrewd of humor so wise of observation so honest and complete of expression that to have seen it has been a delight and to remember it will be a pleasure for days to come well done bartholomeus vander helst brave meritorious victorious happy bartholomew to whom it has been given to produce a masterpiece  may i take off my hat and pay a respectful compliment to jan steen esq he is a glorious composer his humor is as frank as fieldings look at his own figure sitting in the windowsill yonder and roaring with laughter what a twinkle in the eyes what a mouth it is for a song or a joke or a noggin i think the composition in some of jans pictures amounts to the sublime and look at them with the same delight and admiration which i have felt before works of the very highest style this gallery is admirableand the city in which the gallery is is perhaps even more wonderful and curious to behold than the gallery  the first landing at calais or i suppose on any foreign shorethe first sight of an eastern citythe first view of veniceand this of amsterdam are among the delightful shocks which i have had as a traveller amsterdam is as good as venice with a superadded humor and grotesqueness which gives the sightseer the most singular zest and pleasure a run through pekin i could hardly fancy to be more odd strange and yet familiar this rush and crowd and prodigious vitality this immense swarm of life these busy waters crowding barges swinging drawbridges piled ancient gables spacious markets teeming with people that everwonderful jews quarter that dear old world of painting and the past yet alive and throbbing and palpableactual and yet passing before you swiftly and strangely as a dream of the many journeys of this roundabout life that drive through amsterdam is to be specially and gratefully remembered you have never seen the palace of amsterdam my dear sir why theres a marble hall in that palace that will frighten you as much as any hall in vathek or a nightmare at one end of that old cold glassy glittering ghostly marble hall there stands a throne on which a white marble king ought to sit with his white legs gleaming down into the white marble below and his white eyes looking at a great white marble atlas who bears on his icy shoulders a blue globe as big as the full moon if he were not a genie and enchanted and with a strength altogether hyperatlantean he would drop the moon with a shriek on to the white marble floor and it would splitter into perdition and the palace would rock and heave and tumble and the waters would rise rise rise and the gables sink sink sink and the barges would rise up to the chimneys and the watersouchee fishes would flap over the boompjes where the pigeons and storks used to perch and the amster and the rotter and the saar and the op and all the dams of holland would burst and the zuyder zee roll over the dykes and you would wake out of your dream and find yourself sitting in your armchair  was it a dream it seems like one have we been to holland have we heard the chimes at midnight at antwerp were we really away for a week or have i been sitting up in the room dozing before this stale old desk heres the desk yes but if it has been a dream how could i have learned to hum that tune out of dinorah ah is it that tune or myself that i am humming if it was a dream how comes this yellow notice des tableaux du musee damsterdam avec facsimile des monogrammes before me and this signature of the gallant   bartholomeus vander helst fecit ao 1648   yes indeed it was a delightful little holiday it lasted a whole week with the exception of that little pint of amari aliquid at rotterdam we were all very happy we might have gone on being happy for whoever knows how many days more a week more ten days more who knows how long that dear teetotum happiness can be made to spin without toppling over  but one of the party had desired letters to be sent poste restante amsterdam the postoffice is hard by that awful palace where the atlas is and which we really saw  there was only one letter you see only one chance of finding us there it was the post has only this moment come in says the smirking commissioner and he hands over the paper thinking he has done something clever  before the letter had been opened i could read come back as clearly as if it had been painted on the wall it was all over the spell was broken the sprightly little holiday fairy that had frisked and gambolled so kindly beside us for eight days of sunshineor rain which was as cheerful as sunshinegave a parting piteous look and whisked away and vanished and yonder scuds the postman and here is the old desk     nil nisi bonum   almost the last words which sir walter spoke to lockhart his biographer were be a good man my dear and with the last flicker of breath on his dying lips he sighed a farewell to his family and passed away blessing them  two men famous admired beloved have just left us the goldsmith and the gibbon of our time ere a few weeks are over many a critics pen will be at work reviewing their lives and passing judgment on their works this is no review or history or criticism only a word in testimony of respect and regard from a man of letters who owes to his own professional labor the honor of becoming acquainted with these two eminent literary men one was the first ambassador whom the new world of letters sent to the old he was born almost with the republic the pater patriae had laid his hand on the childs head he bore washingtons name he came amongst us bringing the kindest sympathy the most artless smiling goodwill his new country which some people here might be disposed to regard rather superciliously could send us as he showed in his own person a gentleman who though himself born in no very high sphere was most finished polished easy witty quiet and socially the equal of the most refined europeans if irvings welcome in england was a kind one was it not also gratefully remembered if he ate our salt did he not pay us with a thankful heart who can calculate the amount of friendliness and good feeling for our country which this writers generous and untiring regard for us disseminated in his own his books are read by millions of his countrymen whom he has taught to love england and why to love her it would have been easy to speak otherwise than he did to inflame national rancors which at the time when he first became known as a public writer war had just renewed to cry down the old civilization at the expense of the new to point out our faults arrogance shortcomings and give the republic to infer how much she was the parent states superior there are writers enough in the united states honest and otherwise who preach that kind of doctrine but the good irving the peaceful the friendly had no place for bitterness in his heart and no scheme but kindness received in england with extraordinary tenderness and friendship scott southey byron a hundred others have borne witness to their liking for him he was a messenger of goodwill and peace between his country and ours see friends he seems to say these english are not so wicked rapacious callous proud as you have been taught to believe them i went amongst them a humble man won my way by my pen and when known found every hand held out to me with kindliness and welcome scott is a great man you acknowledge did not scotts king of england give a gold medal to him and another to me your countryman and a stranger        washington irving died november 28 1859 lord macaulay      died december 28 1859        see his life in the most remarkable dictionary of      authors published lately at philadelphia by mr allibone  tradition in the united states still fondly retains the history of the feasts and rejoicings which awaited irving on his return to his native country from europe he had a national welcome he stammered in his speeches hid himself in confusion and the people loved him all the better he had worthily represented america in europe in that young community a man who brings home with him abundant european testimonials is still treated with respect i have found american writers of wideworld reputation strangely solicitous about the opinions of quite obscure british critics and elated or depressed by their judgments and irving went home medalled by the king diplomatized by the university crowned and honored and admired he had not in any way intrigued for his honors he had fairly won them and in irvings instance as in others the old country was glad and eager to pay them  in america the love and regard for irving was a national sentiment party wars are perpetually raging there and are carried on by the press with a rancor and fierceness against individuals which exceed british almost irish virulence it seemed to me during a years travel in the country as if no one ever aimed a blow at irving all men held their hand from that harmless friendly peacemaker i had the good fortune to see him at new york philadelphia baltimore and washington and remarked how in every place he was honored and welcome every large city has its irving house the country takes pride in the fame of its men of letters the gate of his own charming little domain on the beautiful hudson river was for ever swinging before visitors who came to him he shut out no one i had seen many pictures of his house and read descriptions of it in both of which it was treated with a not unusual american exaggeration it was but a pretty little cabin of a place the gentleman of the press who took notes of the place whilst his kind old host was sleeping might have visited the whole house in a couple of minutes        at washington mr irving came to a lecture given by the      writer which mr filmore and general pierce the president      and president elect were also kind enough to attend      together  two kings of brentford smelling at one rose      says irving looking up with his goodhumored smile        mr irving described to me with that humor and good      humor which he always kept how amongst other visitors a      member of the british press who had carried his      distinguished pen to america where he employed it in      vilifying his own country came to sunnyside introduced      himself to irving partook of his wine and luncheon and in      two days described mr irving his house his nieces his      meal and his manner of dozing afterwards in a new york      paper  on another occasion irving said laughing two      persons came to me and one held me in conversation whilst      the other miscreant took my portrait  and how came it that this house was so small when mr irvings books were sold by hundreds of thousands nay millions when his profits were known to be large and the habits of life of the good old bachelor were notoriously modest and simple he had loved once in his life the lady he loved died and he whom all the world loved never sought to replace her i cant say how much the thought of that fidelity has touched me does not the very cheerfulness of his after life add to the pathos of that untold story to grieve always was not in his nature or when he had his sorrow to bring all the world in to condole with him and bemoan it deep and quiet he lays the love of his heart and buries it and grass and flowers grow over the scarred ground in due time  irving had such a small house and such narrow rooms because there was a great number of people to occupy them he could only afford to keep one old horse which lazy and aged as it was managed once or twice to run away with that careless old horseman he could only afford to give plain sherry to that amiable british paragraphmonger from new york who saw the patriarch asleep over his modest blameless cup and fetched the public into his private chamber to look at him irving could only live very modestly because the wifeless childless man had a number of children to whom he was as a father he had as many as nine nieces i am toldi saw two of these ladies at his housewith all of whom the dear old man had shared the produce of his labor and genius  be a good man my dear one cant but think of these last words of the veteran chief of letters who had tasted and tested the value of worldly success admiration prosperity was irving not good and of his works was not his life the best part in his family gentle generous goodhumored affectionate selfdenying in society a delightful example of complete gentlemanhood quite unspoiled by prosperity never obsequious to the great or worse still to the base and mean as some public men are forced to be in his and other countries eager to acknowledge every contemporarys merit always kind and affable to the young members of his calling in his professional bargains and mercantile dealings delicately honest and grateful one of the most charming masters of our lighter language the constant friend to us and our nation to men of letters doubly dear not for his wit and genius merely but as an exemplar of goodness probity and pure lifei dont know what sort of testimonial will be raised to him in his own country where generous and enthusiastic acknowledgment of american merit is never wanting but irving was in our service as well as theirs and as they have placed a stone at greenwich yonder in memory of that gallant young bellot who shared the perils and fate of some of our arctic seamen i would like to hear of some memorial raised by english writers and friends of letters in affectionate remembrance of the dear and good washington irving  as for the other writer whose departure many friends some few most dearlyloved relatives and multitudes of admiring readers deplore our republic has already decreed his statue and he must have known that he had earned this posthumous honor he is not a poet and man of letters merely but citizen statesman a great british worthy almost from the first moment when he appears amongst boys amongst college students amongst men he is marked and takes rank as a great englishman all sorts of successes are easy to him as a lad he goes down into the arena with others and wins all the prizes to which he has a mind a place in the senate is straightway offered to the young man he takes his seat there he speaks when so minded without party anger or intrigue but not without party faith and a sort of heroic enthusiasm for his cause still he is poet and philosopher even more than orator that he may have leisure and means to pursue his darling studies he absents himself for a while and accepts a richlyremunerative post in the east as learned a man may live in a cottage or a college commonroom but it always seemed to me that ample means and recognized rank were macaulays as of right years ago there was a wretched outcry raised because mr macaulay dated a letter from windsor castle where he was staying immortal gods was this man not a fit guest for any palace in the world or a fit companion for any man or woman in it i dare say after austerlitz the old k k court officials and footmen sneered at napoleon for dating from schonbrunn but that miserable windsor castle outcry is an echo out of fastretreating oldworld remembrances the place of such a natural chief was amongst the first of the land and that country is best according to our british notion at least where the man of eminence has the best chance of investing his genius and intellect  if a company of giants were got together very likely one or two of the mere sixfeetsix people might be angry at the incontestable superiority of the very tallest of the party and so i have heard some london wits rather peevish at macaulays superiority complain that he occupied too much of the talk and so forth now that wonderful tongue is to speak no more will not many a man grieve that he no longer has the chance to listen to remember the talk is to wonder to think not only of the treasures he had in his memory but of the trifles he had stored there and could produce with equal readiness almost on the last day i had the fortune to see him a conversation happened suddenly to spring up about senior wranglers and what they had done in after life to the almost terror of the persons present macaulay began with the senior wrangler of 18012 34 and so on giving the name of each and relating his subsequent career and rise every man who has known him has his story regarding that astonishing memory it may be that he was not ill pleased that you should recognize it but to those prodigious intellectual feats which were so easy to him who would grudge his tribute of homage his talk was in a word admirable and we admired it  of the notices which have appeared regarding lord macaulay up to the day when the present lines are written the 9th of january the reader should not deny himself the pleasure of looking especially at two it is a good sign of the times when such articles as these i mean the articles in the times and saturday review appear in our public prints about our public men they educate us as it were to admire rightly an uninstructed person in a museum or at a concert may pass by without recognizing a picture or a passage of music which the connoisseur by his side may show him is a masterpiece of harmony or a wonder of artistic skill after reading these papers you like and respect more the person you have admired so much already and so with regard to macaulays style there may be faults of coursewhat critic cant point them out but for the nonce we are not talking about faults we want to say nil nisi bonum welltake at hazard any three pages of the essays or historyand glimmering below the stream of the narrative as it were you an average reader see one two three a halfscore of allusions to other historic facts characters literature poetry with which you are acquainted why is this epithet used whence is that simile drawn how does he manage in two or three words to paint an individual or to indicate a landscape your neighbor who has his reading and his little stock of literature stowed away in his mind shall detect more points allusions happy touches indicating not only the prodigious memory and vast learning of this master but the wonderful industry the honest humble previous toil of this great scholar he reads twenty books to write a sentence he travels a hundred miles to make a line of description  many londonersnot allhave seen the british museum library i speak a coeur ouvert and pray the kindly reader to bear with me i have seen all sorts of domes of peters and pauls sophia pantheonwhat notand have been struck by none of them so much as by that catholic dome in bloomsbury under which our million volumes are housed what peace what love what truth what beauty what happiness for all what generous kindness for you and me are here spread out it seems to me one cannot sit down in that place without a heart full of grateful reverence i own to have said my grace at the table and to have thanked heaven for this my english birthright freely to partake of these bountiful books and to speak the truth i find there under the dome which held macaulays brain and from which his solemn eyes looked out on the world but a fortnight since what a vast brilliant and wonderful store of learning was ranged what strange lore would he not fetch for you at your bidding a volume of law or history a book of poetry familiar or forgotten except by himself who forgot nothing a novel ever so old and he had it at hand i spoke to him once about clarissa not read clarissa he cried out if you have once thoroughly entered on clarissa and are infected by it you cant leave it when i was in india i passed one hot season at the hills and there were the governorgeneral and the secretary of government and the commanderinchief and their wives i had clarissa with me and as soon as they began to read the whole station was in a passion of excitement about miss harlowe and her misfortunes and her scoundrelly lovelace the governors wife seized the book and the secretary waited for it and the chief justice could not read it for tears he acted the whole scene he paced up and down the athenaeum library i dare say he could have spoken pages of the bookof that book and of what countless piles of others  in this little paper let us keep to the text of nil nisi bonum one paper i have read regarding lord macaulay says he had no heart why a mans books may not always speak the truth but they speak his mind in spite of himself and it seems to me this mans heart is beating through every page he penned he is always in a storm of revolt and indignation against wrong craft tyranny how he cheers heroic resistance how he backs and applauds freedom struggling for its own how he hates scoundrels ever so victorious and successful how he recognizes genius though selfish villains possess it the critic who says macaulay had no heart might say that johnson had none and two men more generous and more loving and more hating and more partial and more noble do not live in our history those who knew lord macaulay knew how admirably tender and generous and affectionate he was it was not his business to bring his family before the theatre footlights and call for bouquets from the gallery as he wept over them        since the above was written i have been informed that it      has been found on examining lord macaulays papers that he      was in the habit of giving away more than a fourth part of      his annual income  if any young man of letters reads this little sermonand to him indeed it is addressedi would say to him bear scotts words in your mind and be good my dear here are two literary men gone to their account and laus deo as far as we know it is fair and open and clean here is no need of apologies for shortcomings or explanations of vices which would have been virtues but for unavoidable c here are two examples of men most differently gifted each pursuing his calling each speaking his truth as god bade him each honest in his life just and irreproachable in his dealings dear to his friends honored by his country beloved at his fireside it has been the fortunate lot of both to give incalculable happiness and delight to the world which thanks them in return with an immense kindliness respect affection it may not be our chance brother scribe to be endowed with such merit or rewarded with such fame but the rewards of these men are rewards paid to our service we may not win the baton or epaulettes but god give us strength to guard the honor of the flag     on half a loaf  a letter to messrs broadway battery and co of new york bankers   is it all over may we lock up the case of instruments have we signed our wills settled up our affairs pretended to talk and rattle quite cheerfully to the women at dinner so that they should not be alarmed sneaked away under some pretext and looked at the children sleeping in their beds with their little unconscious thumbs in their months and a flush on the softpillowed cheek made every arrangement with colonel macturk who acts as our second and knows the other principal a great deal too well to think he will ever give in invented a monstrous figment about going to shoot pheasants with mac in the morning so as to soothe the anxious fears of the dear mistress of the house early as the hour appointed for thethe little affairwas have we been awake hours and hours sooner risen before daylight with a faint hope perhaps that macturk might have come to some arrangement with the other side at seven oclock confound his punctuality heard his cabwheel at the door and let him in looking perfectly trim fresh jolly and well shaved driven off with him in the cold morning after a very unsatisfactory breakfast of coffee and stale breadandbutter which choke somehow in the swallowing driven off to wormwood scrubs in the cold muddy misty moonshiny morning stepped out of the cab where mac has bid the man to halt on a retired spot in the common in one minute more seen another cab arrive from which descend two gentlemen one of whom has a case like macturks under his armlooked round and round the solitude and seen not one single sign of a policemanno no more than in a row in londondeprecated the horrible necessity which drives civilized men to the use of powder and bullettaken ground as firmly as may be and looked on whilst mac is neatly loading his weapons and when all ready and one looked for the decisive one two threehave we even heard captain otoole the second of the other principal walk up and say colonel macturk i am desired by my principal to declare at this elevenththis twelfth hour that he is willing to own that he sees he has been wrong in the dispute which has arisen between him and your friend that he apologizes for offensive expressions which he has used in the heat of the quarrel and regrets the course he has taken if something like this has happened to you however great your courage you have been glad not to fighthowever accurate your aim you have been pleased not to fire  on the sixth day of january in this year sixtytwo what hundreds of thousandsi may say what millions of englishmen were in the position of the personage here sketchedchristian men i hope shocked at the dreadful necessity of battle aware of the horrors which the conflict must produce and yet feeling that the moment was come and that there was no arbitrament left but that of steel and cannon my reader perhaps has been in america if he has he knows what good people are to be found there how polished how generous how gentle how courteous but it is not the voices of these you hear in the roar of hate defiance folly falsehood which comes to us across the atlantic you cant hear gentle voices very many who could speak are afraid men must go forward or be crushed by the maddened crowd behind them i suppose after the perpetration of that act ofwhat shall we call itof sudden war which wilkes did and everett approved most of us believed that battle was inevitable who has not read the american papers for six weeks past did you ever think the united states government would give up those commissioners i never did for my part it seems to me the united states government have done the most courageous act of the war before that act was done what an excitement prevailed in london in every club there was a parliament sitting in permanence in every domestic gathering this subject was sure to form a main part of the talk of course i have seen many people who have travelled in america and heard them on this matterfriends of the south friends of the north friends of peace and american stockholders in plentythey will never give up the men sir that was the opinion on all sides and if they would not we knew what was to happen  for weeks past this nightmare of war has been riding us the city was already gloomy enough when a great domestic grief and misfortune visits the chief person of the state the heart of the people too is sad and awestricken it might be this sorrow and trial were but presages of greater trials and sorrow to come what if the sorrow of war is to be added to the other calamity such forebodings have formed the theme of many a mans talk and darkened many a fireside then came the rapid orders for ships to arm and troops to depart how many of us have had to say farewell to friends whom duty called away with their regiments on whom we strove to look cheerfully as we shook their hands it might be for the last time and whom our thoughts depicted treading the snows of the immense canadian frontier where their intrepid little band might have to face the assaults of other enemies than winter and rough weather i went to a play one night and protest i hardly know what was the entertainment which passed before my eyes in the next stall was an american gentleman who knew me good heavens sir i thought is it decreed that you and i are to be authorized to murder each other next week that my people shall be bombarding your cities destroying your navies making a hideous desolation of your coast that our peaceful frontier shall be subject to fire rapine and murder they will never give up the men said the englishman they will never give up the men said the american and the christmas piece which the actors were playing proceeded like a piece in a dream to make the grand comic performance doubly comic my neighbor presently informed me how one of the best friends i had in americathe most hospitable kindly amiable of men from whom i had twice received the warmest welcome and the most delightful hospitalitywas a prisoner in fort warren on charges by which his life perhaps might be risked i think that was the most dismal christmas fun which these eyes ever looked on  carry out that notion a little farther and depict ten thousand a hundred thousand homes in england saddened by the thought of the coming calamity and oppressed by the pervading gloom my nextdoor neighbor perhaps has parted with her son now the ship in which he is with a thousand brave comrades is ploughing through the stormy midnight ocean presently under the flag we know of the thin red line in which her boy forms a speck is winding its way through the vast canadian snows another neighbors boy is not gone but is expecting orders to sail and some one else besides the circle at home maybe is in prayer and terror thinking of the summons which calls the young sailor away by firesides modest and splendid all over the three kingdoms that sorrow is keeping watch and myriads of hearts beating with that thought will they give up the men  i dont know how on the first day after the capture of the southern commissioners was announced a rumor got abroad in london that the taking of the men was an act according to law of which our nation could take no notice it was said that the law authorities had so declared and a very noble testimony to the loyalty of englishmen i think was shown by the instant submission of highspirited gentlemen most keenly feeling that the nation had been subject to a coarse outrage who were silent when told that the law was with the aggressor the relief which presently came when after a pause of a day we found that law was on our side was indescribable the nation might then take notice of this insult to its honor never were people more eager than ours when they found they had a right to reparation  i have talked during the last week with many english holders of american securities who of course have been aware of the threat held over them england says the new york herald cannot afford to go to war with us for six hundred millions worth of american stock is owned by british subjects which in event of hostilities would be confiscated and we now call upon the companies not to take it off their hands on any terms let its forfeiture be held over england as a weapon in terrorem british subjects have two or three hundred millions of dollars invested in shipping and other property in the united states all this property together with the stocks would be seized amounting to nine hundred millions of dollars will england incur this tremendous loss for a mere abstraction  whether a mere abstraction here means the abstraction of the two southern commissioners from under our flag or the abstract idea of injured honor which seems ridiculous to the herald is it needless to ask i have spoken with many men who have money invested in the states but i declare i have not met one english gentleman whom the publication of this threat has influenced for a moment our people have nine hundred millions of dollars invested in the united states have they and the herald calls upon the companies not to take any of this debt off our hands let us on our side entreat the english press to give this announcement every publicity let us do everything in our power to make this call upon the americans well known in england i hope english newspaper editors will print it and print it again and again it is not we who say this of american citizens but american citizens who say this of themselves bull is odious we cant bear bull he is haughty arrogant a braggart and a blusterer and we cant bear brag and bluster in our modest and decorous country we hate bull and if he quarrels with us on a point in which we are in the wrong we have goods of his in our custody and we will rob him suppose your london banker saying to you sir i have always thought your manners disgusting and your arrogance insupportable you dare to complain of my conduct because i have wrongfully imprisoned jones my answer to your vulgar interference is that i confiscate your balance  what would be an english merchants character after a few such transactions it is not improbable that the moralists of the herald would call him a rascal why have the united states been paying seven eight ten per cent for money for years past when the same commodity can be got elsewhere at half that rate of interest why because though among the richest proprietors in the world creditors were not sure of them so the states have had to pay eighty millions yearly for the use of money which would cost other borrowers but thirty add up this item of extra interest alone for a dozen years and see what a prodigious penalty the states have been paying for repudiation here and there for sharp practice for doubtful credit suppose the peace is kept between us the remembrance of this last threat alone will cost the states millions and millions more if they must have money we must have a greater interest to insure our jeopardized capital do american companies want to borrow moneyas want to borrow they will mr brown show the gentleman that extract from the new york herald which declares that the united states will confiscate private property in the event of a war as the country newspapers say please country papers copy this paragraph and gentlemen in america when the honor of your nation is called in question please to remember that it is the american press which glories in announcing that you are prepared to be rogues  and when this war has drained uncounted hundreds of millions more out of the united states exchequer will they be richer or more inclined to pay debts or less willing to evade them or more popular with their creditors or more likely to get money from men whom they deliberately announce that they will cheat i have not followed the herald on the stoneship questionthat great naval victory appears to me not less horrible and wicked than suicidal block the harbors for ever destroy the inlets of the commerce of the world perish citiesso that we may wreak an injury on them it is the talk of madmen but not the less wicked the act injures the whole republic but it is perpetrated it is to deal harm to ages hence but it is done the indians of old used to burn women and their unborn children this stoneship business is indian warfare and it is performed by men who tell us every week that they are at the head of civilization and that the old world is decrepit and cruel and barbarous as compared to theirs  the same politicians who throttle commerce at its neck and threaten to confiscate trustmoney say that when the war is over and the south is subdued then the turn of the old country will come and a direful retribution shall be taken for our conduct this has been the cry all through the war we should have conquered the south says an american paper which i read this very day but for england was there ever such puling heard from men who have an army of a million and who turn and revile a people who have stood as aloof from their contest as we have from the war of troy or is it an outcry made with malice prepense and is the song of the new york times a variation of the herald tunethe conduct of the british in folding their arms and taking no part in the fight has been so base that it has caused the prolongation of the war and occasioned a prodigious expense on our part therefore as we have british property in our hands we c c the lamb troubled the water dreadfully and the wolf in a righteous indignation confiscated him of course we have heard that at an undisturbed time great britain would never have dared to press its claim for redress did the united states wait until we were at peace with france before they went to war with us last did mr seward yield the claim which he confesses to be just until he himself was menaced with war how long were the southern gentlemen kept in prison what caused them to be set free and did the cabinet of washington see its error before or after the demand for redress the captor was feasted at boston and the captives in prison hard by if the wrongdoer was to be punished it was captain wilkes who ought to have gone into limbo at any rate as the cabinet of washington could not give its approbation to the commander of the san jacinto why were the men not sooner set free to sit at the tremont house and hear the captain after dinner give his opinion on international law would have been better sport for the prisoners than the grim salleamanger at fort warren        at the beginning of december the british fleet on the      west indian station mounted 850 guns and comprised five      liners ten firstclass frigates and seventeen powerful      corvettes     in little more than a month the fleet      available for operations on the american shore had been more      than doubled  the reinforcements prepared at the various      dockyards included two lineofbattle ships twentynine      magnificent frigatessuch as the shannon the sutlej      the euryalus the orlando the galatea eight      corvettes armed like the frigates in part with 100 and 40      pounder armstrong guns and the two tremendous ironcased      ships the warrior and the black prince and their      smaller sisters the resistance and the defence  there      was work to be done which might have delayed the commission      of a few of these ships for some weeks longer but if the      united states had chosen war instead of peace the blockade      of their coasts would have been supported by a steam fleet      of more than sixty splendid ships armed with 1800 guns      many of them of the heaviest and most effective kind      saturday review jan 11  i read in the commercial news brought by the teutonia and published in london on the present 13th january that the pork market was generally quiet on the 29th december last that lard though with more activity was heavy and decidedly lower and at philadelphia whiskey is steady and stocks firm stocks are firm that is a comfort for the english holders and the confiscating process recommended by the herald is at least deferred but presently comes an announcement which is not quite so cheeringthe saginaw central railway company let us call it has postponed its january dividend on account of the disturbed condition of public affairs  a la bonne heure the bond and shareholders of the saginaw must look for loss and depression in times of war this is one of wars dreadful taxes and necessities and all sorts of innocent people must suffer by the misfortune the corn was high at waterloo when a hundred and fifty thousand men came and trampled it down on a sabbath morning there was no help for that calamity and the belgian farmers lost their crops for the year perhaps i am a farmer myselfan innocent colonus and instead of being able to get to church with my family have to see squadrons of french dragoons thundering upon my barley and squares of english infantry forming and trampling all over my oats by the way in writing of panics an ingenious writer in the atlantic magazine says that the british panics at waterloo were frequent and notorious well i am a belgian peasant and i see the british running away and the french cutting the fugitives down what have i done that these men should be kicking down my peaceful harvest for me on which i counted to pay my rent to feed my horses my household my children it is hard but it is the fortune of war but suppose the battle over the frenchman says you scoundrel why did you not take a part with me and why did you stand like a doublefaced traitor looking on i should have won the battle but for you and i hereby confiscate the farm you stand on and you and your family may go to the workhouse  the new york press holds this argument over english people in terrorem we americans may be ever so wrong in the matter in dispute but if you push us to a war we will confiscate your english property very good it is peace now confidence of course is restored between us our eighteen hundred peace commissioners have no occasion to open their mouths and the little question of confiscation is postponed messrs battery broadway and co of new york have the kindness to sell my saginaws for what they will fetch i shall lose half my loaf very likely but for the sake of a quiet life let us give up a certain quantity of farinaceous food and half a loaf you know is better than no bread at all     the notch on the axea story a la mode  part i   every one remembers in the fourth book of the immortal poem of your blind bard to whose sightless orbs no doubt glorious shapes were apparent and visions celestial how adam discourses to eve of the bright visitors who hovered round their eden       millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth      unseen both when we wake and when we sleep  how often says father adam from the steep of echoing hill or thicket have we heard celestial voices to the midnight air sole or responsive to each others notes singing after the act of disobedience when the erring pair from eden took their solitary way and went forth to toil and trouble on common earththough the glorious ones no longer were visible you cannot say they were gone it was not that the bright ones were absent but that the dim eyes of rebel man no longer could see them in your chamber hangs a picture of one whom you never knew but whom you have long held in tenderest regard and who was painted for you by a friend of mine the knight of plympton she communes with you she smiles on you when your spirits are low her bright eyes shine on you and cheer you her innocent sweet smile is a caress to you she never fails to soothe you with her speechless prattle you love her she is alive with you as you extinguish your candle and turn to sleep though your eyes see her not is she not there still smiling as you lie in the night awake and thinking of your duties and the morrows inevitable toil oppressing the busy weary wakeful brain as with a remorse the crackling fire flashes up for a moment in the grate and she is there your little beauteous maiden smiling with her sweet eyes when moon is down when fire is out when curtains are drawn when lids are closed is she not there the little beautiful one though invisible present and smiling still friend the unseen ones are round about us does it not seem as if the time were drawing near when it shall be given to men to behold them  the print of which my friend spoke and which indeed hangs in my room though he has never been there is that charming little winter piece of sir joshua representing the little lady caroline montague afterwards duchess of buccleuch she is represented as standing in the midst of a winter landscape wrapped in muff and cloak and she looks out of her picture with a smile so exquisite that a herod could not see her without being charmed  i beg your pardon mr pinto i said to the person with whom i was conversing i wonder by the way that i was not surprised at his knowing how fond i am of this print you spoke of the knight of plympton sir joshua died 1792 and you say he was your dear friend  as i spoke i chanced to look at mr pinto and then it suddenly struck me gracious powers perhaps you are a hundred years old now i think of it you look more than a hundred yes you may be a thousand years old for what i know your teeth are false one eye is evidently false can i say that the other is not if a mans age may be calculated by the rings round his eyes this man may be as old as methuselah he has no beard he wears a large curly glossy brown wig and his eyebrows are painted a deep olivegreen it was odd to hear this man this walking mummy talking sentiment in these queer old chambers in shepherds inn  pinto passed a yellow bandanna handkerchief over his awful white teeth and kept his glass eye steadily fixed on me sir joshuas friend said he you perceive eluding my direct question is not every one that knows his pictures reynoldss friend suppose i tell you that i have been in his painting room scores of times and that his sister the has made me tea and his sister toffy has made coffee for me you will only say i am an old ombog mr pinto i remarked spoke all languages with an accent equally foreign suppose i tell you that i knew mr sam johnson and did not like him that i was at that very ball at madame cornelis which you have mentioned in one of your littlewhat do you call thembah my memory begins to fail mein one of your little whirligig papers suppose i tell you that sir joshua has been here in this very room  have you then had these apartments formorethanseventy years i asked  they look as if they had not been swept for that timedont they hey i did not say that i had them for seventy years but that sir joshua has visited me here  when i asked eying the man sternly for i began to think he was an impostor  he answered me with a glance still more stern sir joshua reynolds was here this very morning with angelica kaufmann and mr oliver goldschmidt he is still very much attached to angelica who still does not care for him because he is dead and i was in the fourth mourning coach at his funeral is that any reason why he should not come back to earth again my good sir you are laughing at me he has sat many a time on that very chair which you are occupying there are several spirits in the room now whom you cannot see excuse me here he turned round as if he was addressing somebody and began rapidly speaking a language unknown to me it is arabic he said a bad patois i own i learned it in barbary when i was a prisoner amongst the moors in anno 1609 bin ick aldus ghekledt gheghaen ha you doubt me look at me well at least i am like  perhaps some of my readers remember a paper of which the figure of a man carrying a barrel formed the initial letter and which i copied from an old spoon now in my possession as i looked at mr pinto i do declare he looked so like the figure on that old piece of plate that i started and felt very uneasy ha said he laughing through his false teeth i declare they were falsei could see utterly toothless gums working up and down behind the pink coral you see i wore a beard den i am shafed now perhaps you tink i am a spoon ha ha and as he laughed he gave a cough which i thought would have coughed his teeth out his glass eye out his wig off his very head off but he stopped this convulsion by stumping across the room and seizing a little bottle of bright pink medicine which being opened spread a singular acrid aromatic odor through the apartment and i thought i sawbut of this i cannot take an affirmationa light green and violet flame flickering round the neck of the phial as he opened it by the way from the peculiar stumping noise which he made in crossing the bareboarded apartment i knew at once that my strange entertainer had a wooden leg over the dust which lay quite thick on the boards you could see the mark of one foot very neat and pretty and then a round o which was naturally the impression made by the wooden stump i own i had a queer thrill as i saw that mark and felt a secret comfort that it was not cloven        this refers to an illustrated edition of the work  in this desolate apartment in which mr pinto had invited me to see him there were three chairs one bottomless a little table on which you might put a breakfasttray and not a single other article of furniture in the next room the door of which was open i could see a magnificent gilt dressingcase with some splendid diamond and ruby shirtstuds lying by it and a chest of drawers and a cupboard apparently full of clothes  remembering him in badenbaden in great magnificence i wondered at his present denuded state you have a house elsewhere mr pinto i said  many says he i have apartments in many cities i lock dem up and do not carry mosh logish  i then remembered that his apartment at baden where i first met him was bare and had no bed in it  there is then a sleepingroom beyond  this is the sleepingroom he pronounces it dis can this by the way give any clue to the nationality of this singular man  if you sleep on these two old chairs you have a rickety couch if on the floor a dusty one  suppose i sleep up dere said this strange man and he actually pointed up to the ceiling i thought him mad or what he himself called an ombog i know you do not believe me for why should i deceive you i came but to propose a matter of business to you i told you i could give you the clue to the mystery of the two children in black whom you met at baden and you came to see me if i told you you would not believe me what for try and convinz you ha hey and he shook his hand once twice thrice at me and glared at me out of his eye in a peculiar way  of what happened now i protest i cannot give an accurate account it seemed to me that there shot a flame from his eye into my brain whilst behind his glass eye there was a green illumination as if a candle had been lit in it it seemed to me that from his long fingers two quivering flames issued sputtering as it were which penetrated me and forced me back into one of the chairsthe broken oneout of which i had much difficulty in scrambling when the strange glamour was ended it seemed to me that when i was so fixed so transfixed in the broken chair the man floated up to the ceiling crossed his legs folded his arms as if he was lying on a sofa and grinned down at me when i came to myself he was down from the ceiling and taking me out of the broken canebottomed chair kindly enoughbah said he it is the smell of my medicine it often gives the vertigo i thought you would have had a little fit come into the open air and we went down the steps and into shepherds inn where the setting sun was just shining on the statue of shepherd the laundresses were traipsing about the porters were leaning against the railings and the clerks were playing at marbles to my inexpressible consolation  you said you were going to dine at the graysinn coffeehouse he said i was i often dine there there is excellent wine at the graysinn coffeehouse but i declare i never said so i was not astonished at his remark no more astonished than if i was in a dream perhaps i was in a dream is life a dream are dreams facts is sleeping being really awake i dont know i tell you i am puzzled i have read the woman in white the strange storynot to mention that story stranger than fiction in the cornhill magazinethat story for which three credible witnesses are ready to vouch i have had messages from the dead and not only from the dead but from people who never existed at all i own i am in a state of much bewilderment but if you please will proceed with my simple my artless story  well then we passed from shepherds inn into holborn and looked for a while at woodgates bricabrac shop which i never can pass without delaying at the windowsindeed if i were going to be hung i would beg the cart to stop and let me have one look more at that delightful omnium gatherum and passing woodgates we come to gales little shop no 47 which is also a favorite haunt of mine  mr gale happened to be at his door and as we exchanged salutations mr pinto i said will you like to see a real curiosity in this curiosity shop step into mr gales little back room  in that little back parlor there are chinese gongs there are old saxe and sevres plates there is furstenberg carl theodor worcester amstel nankin and other jimcrockery and in the corner what do you think there is there is an actual guillotine if you doubt me go and seegale high holborn no 47 it is a slim instrument much slighter than those which they make nowsome nine feet high narrow a pretty piece of upholstery enough there is the hook over which the rope used to play which unloosened the dreadful axe above and look dropped into the orifice where the head used to gothere is the axe itself all rusty with a great notch in the blade  as pinto looked at itmr gale was not in the room i recollect happening to have been just called out by a customer who offered him three pound fourteen and sixpence for a blue shepherd in pate tendremr pinto gave a little start and seemed crispe for a moment then he looked steadily towards one of those great porcelain stools which you see in gardensandit seemed to mei tell you i wont take my affidaviti may have been maddened by the six glasses i took of that pink elixiri may have been sleepwalking perhaps am as i write nowi may have been under the influence of that astounding medium into whose hands i had fallenbut i vow i heard pinto say with rather a ghastly grin at the porcelain stool       nay nefer shague your gory locks at me      dou canst not say i did it  he pronounced it by the way i dit it by which i know that pinto was a german  i heard pinto say those very words and sitting on the porcelain stool i saw dimly at first then with an awful distinctnessa ghostan eidolona forma headless man seated with his head in his lap which wore an expression of piteous surprise  at this minute mr gale entered from the front shop to show a customer some delf plates and he did not seebut we didthe figure rise up from the porcelain stool shake its head which it held in its hand and which kept its eyes fixed sadly on us and disappear behind the guillotine  come to the graysinn coffeehouse pinto said and i will tell you how the notch came to the axe and we walked down holborn at about thirtyseven minutes past six oclock  if there is anything in the above statement which astonishes the reader i promise him that in the next chapter of this little story he will be astonished still more   part ii   you will excuse me i said to my companion for remarking that when you addressed the individual sitting on the porcelain stool with his head in his lap your ordinarily benevolent featuresthis i confess was a bouncer for between ourselves a more sinister and illlooking rascal than mons p i have seldom set eyes onyour ordinarily handsome face wore an expression that was by no means pleasing you grinned at the individual just as you did at me when you went up to the cei pardon me as i thought you did when i fell down in a fit in your chambers and i qualified my words in a great flutter and tremble i did not care to offend the mani did not dare to offend the man i thought once or twice of jumping into a cab and flying of taking refuge in day and martins blacking warehouse of speaking to a policeman but not one would come i was this mans slave i followed him like his dog i could not get away from him so you see i went on meanly conversing with him and affecting a simpering confidence i remember when i was a little boy at school going up fawning and smiling in this way to some great hulking bully of a sixthform boy so i said in a word your ordinarily handsome face wore a disagreeable expression c  it is ordinarily very handsome said he with such a leer at a couple of passersby that one of them cried oh crikey heres a precious guy and a child in its nurses arms screamed itself into convulsions oh oui che suis trescholi garcon bien peau cerdainement continued mr pinto but you were right thatthat person was not very well pleased when he saw me there was no love lost between us as you say and the world never knew a more worthless miscreant i hate him voyezvous i hated him alife i hate him dead i hate him man i hate him ghost and he know it and tremble before me if i see him twenty tausend years henceand why noti shall hate him still you remarked how he was dressed  in black satin breeches and striped stockings a white pique waistcoat a gray coat with large metal buttons and his hair in powder he must have worn a pigtailonly  only it was cut off ha ha ha mr pinto cried yelling a laugh which i observed made the policeman stare very much yes it was cut off by the same blow which took off the scoundrels headho ho ho and he made a circle with his hooknailed finger round his own yellow neck and grinned with a horrible triumph i promise you that fellow was surprised when he found his head in the pannier ha ha do you ever cease to hate those whom you hatefire flashed terrifically from his glass eye as he spokeor to love dose whom you once loved oh never never and here his natural eye was bedewed with tears but here we are at the graysinn coffeehouse james what is the joint  that very respectful and efficient waiter brought in the bill of fare and i for my part chose boiled leg of pork and peasepudding which my acquaintance said would do as well as anything else though i remarked he only trifled with the peasepudding and left all the pork on the plate in fact he scarcely ate anything but he drank a prodigious quantity of wine and i must say that my friend mr harts portwine is so good that i myself tookwell i should think i took three glasses yes three certainly hei mean mr pthe old rogue was insatiable for we had to call for a second bottle in no time when that was gone my companion wanted another a little red mounted up to his yellow cheeks as he drank the wine and he winked at it in a strange manner i remember said he musing when portwine was scarcely drunk in this countrythough the queen liked it and so did harley but bolingbroke didnthe drank florence and champagne dr swift put water to his wine jonathan i once said to himbut bah autres temps autres moeurs another magnum james  this was all very well my good sir i said it may suit you to order bottles of 20 port at a guinea a bottle but that kind of price does not suit me i only happen to have thirtyfour and sixpence in my pocket of which i want a shilling for the waiter and eighteenpence for my cab you rich foreigners and swells may spend what you like i had him there for my friends dress was as shabby as an oldclothesmans but a man with a family mr whatdyoucallim cannot afford to spend seven or eight hundred a year on his dinner alone  bah he said nunkey pays for all as you say i will what you call stant the dinner if you are so poor and again he gave that disagreeable grin and placed an odious crookednailed and by no means clean finger to his nose but i was not so afraid of him now for we were in a public place and the three glasses of portwine had you see given me courage  what a pretty snuffbox he remarked as i handed him mine which i am still oldfashioned enough to carry it is a pretty old gold box enough but valuable to me especially as a relic of an old old relative whom i can just remember as a child when she was very kind to me yes a pretty box i can remember when many ladiesmost ladies carried a boxnay two boxestabatiere and bonbonniere what lady carries snuffbox now hey suppose your astonishment if a lady in an assembly were to offer you a prise i can remember a lady with such a box as this with a tour as we used to call it then with paniers with a tortoiseshell cane with the prettiest little highheeled velvet shoes in the worldah that was a time that was a time ah eliza eliza i have thee now in my minds eye at bungay on the waveney did i not walk with thee eliza aha did i not love thee did i not walk with thee then do i not see thee still  this was passing strange my ancestressbut there is no need to publish her revered namedid indeed live at bungay st marys where she lies buried she used to walk with a tortoiseshell cane she used to wear little black velvet shoes with the prettiest high heels in the world  did youdid youknow then my great grndmther i said  he pulled up his coatsleeveis that her name he said  eliza   there i declare was the very name of the kind old creature written in red on his arm  you knew her old he said divining my thoughts with his strange knack i knew her young and lovely i danced with her at the bury ball did i not dear dear miss   as i live he here mentioned dear grnnys maiden name her maiden name was  her honored married name was   she married your great grndfthr the year poseidon won the newmarket plate mr pinto dryly remarked  merciful powers i remember over the old shagreen knife and spoon case on the sideboard in my grnnys parlor a print by stubbs of that very horse my grandsire in a red coat and his fair hair flowing over his shoulders was over the mantelpiece and poseidon won the newmarket cup in the year 1783  yes you are right i danced a minuet with her at bury that very night before i lost my poor leg and i quarrelled with your grandf ha  as he said ha there came three quiet little taps on the tableit is the middle table in the graysinn coffeehouse under the bust of the late duke of wllngtn  i fired in the air he continued did i not tap tap tap your grandfather hit me in the leg he married three months afterwards captain brown i said who could see miss smth without loving her she is there she is there tap tap tap yes my first love  but here there came tap tap which everybody knows means no  i forgot he said with a faint blush stealing over his wan features she was not my first love in germ in my own countrythere was a young woman  tap tap tap there was here quite a lively little treble knock and when the old man said but i loved thee better than all the world eliza the affirmative signal was briskly repeated  and this i declare upon my honor there was i have said a bottle of portwine before usi should say a decanter that decanter was lifted up and out of it into our respective glasses two bumpers of wine were poured i appeal to mr hart the landlordi appeal to james the respectful and intelligent waiter if this statement is not true and when we had finished that magnum and i saidfor i did not now in the least doubt of her presencedear grnny may we have another magnum the table distinctly rapped no  now my good sir mr pinto said who really began to be affected by the wine you understand the interest i have taken in you i loved eliza  of course i dont mention family names i knew you had that box which belonged to heri will give you what you like for that box name your price at once and i pay you on the spot  why when we came out you said you had not sixpence in your pocket  bah give you anything you likefiftya hundreda tausend pound  come come said i the gold of the box may be worth nine guineas and the facon we will put at six more  one tausend guineas he screeched one tausend and fifty pound dere and he sank back in his chairno by the way on his bench for he was sitting with his back to one of the partitions of the boxes as i dare say james remembers  dont go on in this way i continued rather weakly for i did not know whether i was in a dream if you offer me a thousand guineas for this box i must take it mustnt i dear grnny  the table most distinctly said yes and putting out his claws to seize the box mr pinto plunged his hooked nose into it and eagerly inhaled some of my 47 with a dash of hardman  but stay you old harpy i exclaimed being now in a sort of rage and quite familiar with him where is the money where is the check  james a piece of notepaper and a receipt stamp  this is all mighty well sir i said but i dont know you i never saw you before i will trouble you to hand me that box back again or give me a check with some known signature  whose ha ha ha  the room happened to be very dark indeed all the waiters were gone to supper and there were only two gentlemen snoring in their respective boxes i saw a hand come quivering down from the ceilinga very pretty hand on which was a ring with a coronet with a lion rampant gules for a crest i saw that hand take a dip of ink and write across the paper mr pinto then taking a gray receiptstamp out of his blue leather pocketbook fastened it on to the paper by the usual process and the hand then wrote across the receiptstamp went across the table and shook hands with pinto and then as if waving him an adieu vanished in the direction of the ceiling  there was the paper before me wet with the ink there was the pen which the hand had used does anybody doubt me i have that pen now a cedarstick of a not uncommon sort and holding one of gillotts pens it is in my inkstand now i tell you anybody may see it the handwriting on the check for such the document was was the writing of a female it ran thuslondon midnight march 31 1862 pay the bearer one thousand and fitty pounds rachel sidonia to messrs sidonia pozzosanto and co london  noblest and best of women said pinto kissing the sheet of paper with much reverence my good mr roundabout i suppose you do not question that signature  indeed the house of sidonia pozzosanto and co is known to be one of the richest in europe and as for the countess rachel she was known to be the chief manager of that enormously wealthy establishment there was only one little difficulty the countess rachel died last october  i pointed out this circumstance and tossed over the paper to pinto with a sneer  cest a brendre ou a laisser he said with some heat you literary men are all imbrudent but i did not tink you such a fool wie dis your box is not worth twenty pound and i offer you a tausend because i know you want money to pay dat rascal toms college bills this strange man actually knew that my scapegrace tom has been a source of great expense and annoyance to me you see money costs me nothing and you refuse to take it once twice will you take this check in exchange for your trumpery snuffbox  what could i do my poor grannys legacy was valuable and dear to me but after all a thousand guineas are not to be had every day be it a bargain said i shall we have a glass of wine on it says pinto and to this proposal i also unwillingly acceded reminding him by the way that he had not yet told me the story of the headless man   your poor grndmther was right just now when she said she was not my first love twas one of those banale expressions here mr p blushed once more which we use to women we tell each she is our first passion they reply with a similar illusory formula no man is any womans first love no woman any mans we are in love in our nurses arms and women coquette with their eyes before their tongue can form a word how could your lovely relative love me i was far far too old for her i am older than i look i am so old that you would not believe my age were i to tell you i have loved many and many a woman before your relative it has not always been fortunate for them to love me ah sophronia round the dreadful circus where you fell and whence i was dragged corpselike by the heels there sat multitudes more savage than the lions which mangled your sweet form ah tenez when we marched to the terrible stake together at valladolidthe protestant and the j but away with memory boy it was happy for thy grandam that she loved me not  during that strange period he went on when the teeming time was great with the revolution that was speedily to be born i was on a mission in paris with my excellent my maligned friend cagliostro mesmer was one of our band i seemed to occupy but an obscure rank in it though as you know in secret societies the humble man may be a chief and directorthe ostensible leader but a puppet moved by unseen hands never mind who was chief or who was second never mind my age it boots not to tell it why shall i expose myself to your scornful incredulityor reply to your questions in words that are familiar to you but which yet you cannot understand words are symbols of things which you know or of things which you dont know if you dont know them to speak is idle here i confess mr p spoke for exactly thirtyeight minutes about physics metaphysics language the origin and destiny of man during which time i was rather bored and to relieve my ennui drank a half glass or so of wine love friend is the fountain of youth it may not happen to me onceonce in an age but when i love then i am young i loved when i was in paris bathilde bathilde i loved theeah how fondly wine i say more wine love is ever young i was a boy at the little feet of bathilde de bechamelthe fair the fond the fickle ah the false the strange old mans agony was here really terrific and he showed himself much more agitated than he had been when speaking about my grndmthr  i thought blanche might love me i could speak to her in the language of all countries and tell her the lore of all ages i could trace the nursery legends which she loved up to their sanscrit source and whisper to her the darkling mysteries of egyptian magi i could chant for her the wild chorus that rang in the dishevelled eleusinian revel i could tell her and i would the watchword never known but to one woman the saban queen which hiram breathed in the abysmal ear of solomonyou dont attend psha you have drunk too much wine perhaps i may as well own that i was not attending for he had been carrying on for about fiftyseven minutes and i dont like a man to have all the talk to himself  blanche de bechamel was wild then about this secret of masonry in early early days i loved i married a girl fair as blanche who too was tormented by curiosity who too would peep into my closetinto the only secret i guarded from her a dreadful fate befell poor fatima an accident shortened her life poor thing she had a foolish sister who urged her on i always told her to beware of ann she died they said her brothers killed me a gross falsehood am i dead if i were could i pledge you in this wine  was your name i asked quite bewildered was your name pray then ever blueb  hush the waiter will overhear you methought we were speaking of blanche de bechamel i loved her young man my pearls and diamonds and treasure my wit my wisdom my passion i flung them all into the childs lap i was a fool was strong samson not as weak as i was solomon the wise much better when balkis wheedled him i said to the kingbut enough of that i spake of blanche de bechamel  curiosity was the poor childs foible i could see as i talked to her that her thoughts were elsewhere as yours my friend have been absent once or twice tonight to know the secret of masonry was the wretched childs mad desire with a thousand wiles smiles caresses she strove to coax it from mefrom meha ha  i had an apprenticethe son of a dear friend who died by my side at rossbach when soubise with whose army i happened to be suffered a dreadful defeat for neglecting my advice the young chevalier goby de mouchy was glad enough to serve as my clerk and help in some chemical experiments in which i was engaged with my friend dr mesmer bathilde saw this young man since women were has it not been their business to smile and deceive to fondle and lure away from the very first it has been so and as my companion spoke he looked as wicked as the serpent that coiled round the tree and hissed a poisoned counsel to the first woman  one evening i went as was my wont to see blanche she was radiant she was wild with spirits a saucy triumph blazed in her blue eyes she talked she rattled in her childish way she uttered in the course of her rhapsody a hintan intimationso terrible that the truth flashed across me in a moment did i ask her she would lie to me but i know how to make falsehood impossible add i ordered her to go to sleep  at this moment the clock after its previous convulsions sounded twelve and as the new editor of the cornhill magazineand he i promise you wont stand any nonsensewill only allow seven pages i am obliged to leave off at the very most interesting point of the story        mr thackeray retired from the editorship of the cornhill      magazine in march 1862   part iii   are you of our fraternity i see you are not the secret which mademoiselle de bechamel confided to me in her mad triumph and wild hoyden spiritsshe was but a child poor thing poor thing scarce fifteenbut i love them younga folly not unusual with the old here mr pinto thrust his knuckles into his hollow eyes and i am sorry to say so little regardful was he of personal cleanliness that his tears made streaks of white over his gnarled dark hands ah at fifteen poor child thy fate was terrible go to it is not good to love me friend they prosper not who do i divine you you need not say what you are thinking  in truth i was thinking if girls fall in love with this sallow hooknosed glasseyed woodenlegged dirty hideous old man with the sham teeth they have a queer taste that is what i was thinking  jack wilkes said the handsomest man in london had but half an hours start of him and without vanity i am scarcely uglier than jack wilkes we were members of the same club at medenham abbey jack and i and had many a merry night together well sir imary of scotland knew me but as a little hunchbacked musicmaster and yet and yet i think she was not indifferent to her david rizand she came to misfortune they all dothey all do  sir you are wandering from your point i said with some severity for really for this old humbug to hint that he had been the baboon who frightened the club at medenham that he had been in the inquisition at valladolidthat under the name of d riz as he called it he had known the lovely queen of scotswas a little too much sir then i said you were speaking about a miss de bechamel i really have not time to hear all your biography  faith the good wine gets into my head i should think so the old toper four bottles all but two glasses to return to poor blanche as i sat laughing joking with her she let slip a word a little word which filled me with dismay some one had told her a part of the secretthe secret which has been divulged scarce thrice in three thousand yearsthe secret of the freemasons do you know what happens to those uninitiate who learn that secret to those wretched men the initiate who reveal it  as pinto spoke to me he looked through and through me with his horrible piercing glance so that i sat quite uneasily on my bench he continued did i question her awake i knew she would lie to me poor child i loved her no less because i did not believe a word she said i loved her blue eye her golden hair her delicious voice that was true in song though when she spoke false as eblis you are aware that i possess in rather a remarkable degree what we have agreed to call the mesmeric power i set the unhappy girl to sleep then she was obliged to tell me all it was as i had surmised goby de mouchy my wretched besotted miserable secretary in his visits to the chateau of the marquis de bechamel who was one of our society had seen blanche i suppose it was because she had been warned that he was worthless and poor artful and a coward she loved him she wormed out of the besotted wretch the secrets of our order did he tell you the number one i asked  she said yes  did he i further inquired tell you the  oh dont ask me dont ask me she said writhing on the sofa where she lay in the presence of the marquis de bechamel her most unhappy father poor bechamel poor bechamel how pale he looked as i spoke did he tell you i repeated with a dreadful calm the number two she said yes  the poor old marquis rose up and clasping his hands fell on his knees before count cagl bah i went by a different name then vats in a name dat vich ve call a rosicrucian by any other name vil smell as sveet monsieur he said i am oldi am rich i have five hundred thousand livres of rentes in picardy i have half as much in artois i have two hundred and eighty thousand on the grand livre i am promised by my sovereign a dukedom and his orders with a reversion to my heir i am a grandee of spain of the first class and duke of volovento take my titles my ready money my life my honor everything i have in the world but dont ask the third question  godefroid de bouillon comte de bechamel grandee of spain and prince of volovento in our assembly what was the oath you swore the old man writhed as he remembered its terrific purport  though my heart was racked with agony and i would have died ay cheerfully died indeed as if that were a penalty to spare yonder lovely child a pang i said to her calmly blanche de bechamel did goby de mouchy tell you secret number three  she whispered a oui that was quite faint faint and small but her poor father fell in convulsions at her feet  she died suddenly that night did i not tell you those i love come to no good when general bonaparte crossed the saint bernard he saw in the convent an old monk with a white beard wandering about the corridors cheerful and rather stout but madmad as a march hare general i said to him did you ever see that face before he had not he had not mingled much with the higher classes of our society before the revolution i knew the poor old man well enough he was the last of a noble race and i loved his child  and did she die by  man did i say so do i whisper the secrets of the vehmgericht i say she died that night and hehe the heartless the villain the betrayeryou saw him seated in yonder curiosityshop by yonder guillotine with his scoundrelly head in his lap  you saw how slight that instrument was it was one of the first which guillotin made and which he showed to private friends in a hangar in the rue picpus where he lived the invention created some little conversation amongst scientific men at the time though i remember a machine in edinburgh of a very similar construction two hundredwell many many years agoand at a breakfast which guillotin gave he showed us the instrument and much talk arose amongst us as to whether people suffered under it  and now i must tell you what befell the traitor who had caused all this suffering did he know that the poor childs death was a sentence he felt a cowardly satisfaction that with her was gone the secret of his treason then he began to doubt i had means to penetrate all his thoughts as well as to know his acts then he became a slave to a horrible fear he fled in abject terror to a convent they still existed in paris and behind the walls of jacobins the wretch thought himself secure poor fool i had but to set one of my somnambulists to sleep her spirit went forth and spied the shuddering wretch in his cell she described the street the gate the convent the very dress which he wore and which you saw today  and now this is what happened in his chamber in the rue st honore at paris sat a man alonea man who has been maligned a man who has been called a knave and charlatan a man who has been persecuted even to the death it is said in roman inquisitions forsooth and elsewhere ha ha a man who has a mighty will  and looking towards the jacobins convent of which from his chamber he could see the spires and trees this man willed and it was not yet dawn and he willed and one who was lying in his cell in the convent of jacobins awake and shuddering with terror for a crime which he had committed fell asleep  but though he was asleep his eyes were open  and after tossing and writhing and clinging to the pallet and saying no i will not go he rose up and donned his clothesa gray coat a vest of white pique black satin smallclothes ribbed silk stockings and a white stock with a steel buckle and he arranged his hair and he tied his queue all the while being in that strange somnolence which walks which moves which flies sometimes which sees which is indifferent to pain which obeys and he put on his hat and he went forth from his cell and though the dawn was not yet he trod the corridors as seeing them and he passed into the cloister and then into the garden where lie the ancient dead and he came to the wicket which brother jerome was opening just at the dawning and the crowd was already waiting with their cans and bowls to receive the alms of the good brethren  and he passed through the crowd and went on his way and the few people then abroad who marked him said tiens how very odd he looks he looks like a man walking in his sleep this was said by various persons  by milkwomen with their cans and carts coming into the town  by roysterers who had been drinking at the taverns of the barrier for it was midlent  by the sergeants of the watch who eyed him sternly as he passed near their halberds  but he passed on unmoved by their halberds  unmoved by the cries of the roysterers  by the marketwomen coming with their milk and eggs  he walked through the rue st honore i say  by the rue rambuteau  by the rue st antoine  by the kings chateau of the bastille  by the faubourg st antoine  and he came to no 29 in the rue picpusa house which then stood between a court and garden  that is there was a building of one story with a great coachdoor  then there was a court around which were stables coachhouses offices  then there was a housea twostoried house with a perron in front  behind the house was a gardena garden of two hundred and fifty french feet in length  and as one hundred feet of france equal one hundred and six feet of england this garden my friends equalled exactly two hundred and sixtyfive feet of british measure  in the centre of the garden was a fountain and a statueor to speak more correctly two statues one was recumbenta man over him sabre in hand stood a woman  the man was olofernes the woman was judith from the head from the trunk the water gushed it was the taste of the doctorwas it not a droll of taste  at the end of the garden was the doctors cabinet of study my faith a singular cabinet and singular pictures  decapitation of charles premier at vitehall  decapitation of montrose at edimbourg  decapitation of cinq mars when i tell you that he was a man of a taste charming  through this garden by these statues up these stairs went the pale figure of him who the porter said knew the way of the house he did turning neither right nor left he seemed to walk through the statues the obstacles the flowerbeds the stairs the door the tables the chairs  in the corner of the room was that instrument which guillotin had just invented and perfected one day he was to lay his own head under his own axe peace be to his name with him i deal not  in a frame of mahogany neatly worked was a board with a halfcircle in it over which another board fitted above was a heavy axe which fellyou know how it was held up by a rope and when this rope was untied or cut the steel fell  to the story which i now have to relate you may give credence or not as you will the sleeping man went up to that instrument  he laid his head in it asleep  asleep  he then took a little penknife out of the pocket of his white dimity waistcoat  he cut the rope asleep  the axe descended on the head of the traitor and villain the notch in it was made by the steel buckle of his stock which was cut through  a strange legend has got abroad that after the deed was done the figure rose took the head from the basket walked forth through the garden and by the screaming porters at the gate and went and laid itself down at the morgue but for this i will not vouch only of this be sure there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamed of in your philosophy more and more the light peeps through the chinks soon amidst music ravishing the curtain will rise and the glorious scene be displayed adieu remember me ha tis dawn pinto said and he was gone  i am ashamed to say that my first movement was to clutch the cheque which he had left with me and which i was determined to present the very moment the bank opened i know the importance of these things and that men change their mind sometimes i sprang through the streets to the great banking house of manasseh in duke street it seemed to me as if i actually flew as i walked as the clock struck ten i was at the counter and laid down my cheque  the gentleman who received it who was one of the hebrew persuasion as were the other two hundred clerks of the establishment having looked at the draft with terror in his countenance then looked at me then called to himself two of his fellowclerks and queer it was to see all their aquiline beaks over the paper  come come said i dont keep me here all day hand me over the money short if you please for i was you see a little alarmed and so determined to assume some extra bluster  will you have the kindness to step into the parlor to the partners the clerk said and i followed him  what again shrieked a baldheaded redwhiskered gentleman whom i knew to be mr manasseh mr salathiel this is too bad leave me with this gentleman s and the clerk disappeared  sir he said i know how you came by this the count de pinto gave it you it is too bad i honor my parents i honor their parents i honor their bills but this one of grandmas is too badit is upon my word now sheve been dead these fiveandthirty years and this last four months she has left her burialplace and took to drawing on our ouse its too bad grandma it is too bad and he appealed to me and tears actually trickled down his nose  is it the countess sidonias cheque or not i asked haughtily  but i tell you shes dead its a shameits a shameit is grandmamma and he cried and wiped his great nose in his yellow pockethandkerchief look yearwill you take pounds instead of guineas shes dead i tell you its no go take the poundsone tausend poundten nice neat crisp hundredpound notes and go away vid you do  i will have my bond sir or nothing i said and i put on an attitude of resolution which i confess surprised even myself  wery vell he shrieked with many oaths then you shall have notingha ha hanoting but a policeman mr abednego call a policeman take that you humbug and impostor and here with an abundance of frightful language which i dare not repeat the wealthy banker abused and defied me  au bout du compte what was i to do if a banker did not choose to honor a cheque drawn by his dead grandmother i began to wish i had my snuffbox back i began to think i was a fool for changing that little oldfashioned gold for this slip of strange paper  meanwhile the banker had passed from his fit of anger to a paroxysm of despair he seemed to be addressing some person invisible but in the room look here maam youve really been coming it too strong a hundred thousand in six months and now a thousand more the ouse cant stand it it wont stand it i say what oh mercy mercy  as he uttered these words a hand fluttered over the table in the air it was a female hand that which i had seen the night before that female hand took a pen from the green baize table dipped it in a silver inkstand and wrote on a quarter of a sheet of foolscap on the blottingbook how about the diamond robbery if you do not pay i will tell him where they are  what diamonds what robbery what was this mystery that will never be ascertained for the wretched mans demeanor instantly changed certainly siroh certainly he said forcing a grin how will you have the money sir all right mr abednego this way out  i hope i shall often see you again i said on which i own poor manasseh gave a dreadful grin and shot back into his parlor  i ran home clutching the ten delicious crisp hundred pounds and the dear little fifty which made up the account i flew through the streets again i got to my chambers i bolted the outer doors i sank back in my great chair and slept     my first thing on waking was to feel for my money perdition where was i haon the table before me was my grandmothers snuffbox and by its side one of those awfulthose admirablesensation novels which i had been reading and which are full of delicious wonder  but that the guillotine is still to be seen at mr gales no 47 high holborn i give you my honor i suppose i was dreaming about it i dont know what is dreaming what is life why shouldnt i sleep on the ceilingand am i sitting on it now or on the floor i am puzzled but enough if the fashion for sensation novels goes on i tell you i will write one in fifty volumes for the present dixi but between ourselves this pinto who fought at the colosseum who was nearly being roasted by the inquisition and sang duets at holyrood i am rather sorry to lose him after three little bits of roundabout papers et vous     de finibus   when swift was in love with stella and despatching her a letter from london thrice a month by the irish packet you may remember how he would begin letter no xxiii we will say on the very day when xxii had been sent away stealing out of the coffeehouse or the assembly so as to be able to prattle with his dear never letting go her kind hand as it were as some commentator or other has said in speaking of the dean and his amour when mr johnson walking to dodsleys and touching the posts in pall mall as he walked forgot to pat the head of one of them he went back and imposed his hands on itimpelled i know not by what superstition i have this i hope not dangerous mania too as soon as a piece of work is out of hand and before going to sleep i like to begin another it may be to write only half a dozen lines but that is something towards number the next the printers boy has not yet reached green arbor court with the copy those people who were alive half an hour since pendennis clive newcome and what do you call him what was the name of the last hero i remember now philip firmin have hardly drunk their glass of wine and the mammas have only this minute got the childrens cloaks on and have been bowed out of my premisesand here i come back to the study again tamen usque recurro how lonely it looks now all these people are gone my dear good friends some folks are utterly tired of you and say what a poverty of friends the man has he is always asking us to meet those pendennises newcomes and so forth why does he not introduce us to some new characters why is he not thrilling like twostars learned and profound like threestars exquisitely humorous and human like fourstars why finally is he not somebody else my good people it is not only impossible to please you all but it is absurd to try the dish which one man devours another dislikes is the dinner of today not to your taste let us hope tomorrows entertainment will be more agreeable    i resume my original subject what an odd pleasant humorous melancholy feeling it is to sit in the study alone and quiet now all these people are gone who have been boarding and lodging with me for twenty months they have interrupted my rest they have plagued me at all sorts of minutes they have thrust themselves upon me when i was ill or wished to be idle and i have growled out a be hanged to you cant you leave me alone now once or twice they have prevented my going out to dinner many and many a time they have prevented my coming home because i knew they were there waiting in the study and a plague take them and i have left home and family and gone to dine at the club and told nobody where i went they have bored me those people they have plagued me at all sorts of uncomfortable hours they have made such a disturbance in my mind and house that sometimes i have hardly known what was going on in my family and scarcely have heard what my neighbor said to me they are gone at last and you would expect me to be at ease far from it i should almost be glad if woolcomb would walk in and talk to me or twysden reappear take his place in that chair opposite me and begin one of his tremendous stories  madmen you know see visions hold conversations with even draw the likeness of people invisible to you and me is this making of people out of fancy madness and are novelwriters at all entitled to straitwaistcoats i often forget peoples names in life and in my own stories contritely own that i make dreadful blunders regarding them but i declare my dear sir with respect to the personages introduced into your humble servants fables i know the people utterlyi know the sound of their voices a gentleman came in to see me the other day who was so like the picture of philip firmin in mr walkers charming drawings in the cornhill magazine that he was quite a curiosity to me the same eyes beard shoulders just as you have seen them from month to month well he is not like the philip firmin in my mind asleep asleep in the grave lies the bold the generous the reckless the tenderhearted creature whom i have made to pass through those adventures which have just been brought to an end it is years since i heard the laughter ringing or saw the bright blue eyes when i knew him both were young i become young as i think of him and this morning he was alive again in this room ready to laugh to fight to weep as i write do you know it is the gray of evening the house is quiet everybody is out the room is getting a little dark and i look rather wistfully up from the paper with perhaps ever so little fancy that he may come inno no movement no gray shade growing more palpable out of which at last look the wellknown eyes no the printer came and took him away with the last page of the proofs and with the printers boy did the whole cortege of ghosts flit away invisible ha stay what is this angels and ministers of grace the door opens and a dark formenters bearing a blacka black suit of clothes it is john he says it is time to dress for dinner    every man who has had his german tutor and has been coached through the famous faust of goethe thou wert my instructor good old weissenborn and these eyes beheld the great master himself in dear little weimar town has read those charming verses which are prefixed to the drama in which the poet reverts to the time when his work was first composed and recalls the friends now departed who once listened to his song the dear shadows rise up around him he says he lives in the past again it is today which appears vague and visionary we humbler writers cannot create fausts or raise up monumental works that shall endure for all ages but our books are diaries in which our own feelings must of necessity be set down as we look to the page written last month or ten years ago we remember the day and its events the child ill mayhap in the adjoining room and the doubts and fears which racked the brain as it still pursued its work the dear old friend who read the commencement of the tale and whose gentle hand shall be laid in ours no more i own for my part that in reading pages which this hand penned formerly i often lose sight of the text under my eyes it is not the words i see but that past day that bygone page of lifes history that tragedy comedy it may be which our little home company was enacting that merrymaking which we shared that funeral which we followed that bitter bitter grief which we buried  and such being the state of my mind i pray gentle readers to deal kindly with their humble servants manifold shortcomings blunders and slips of memory as sure as i read a page of my own composition i find a fault or two half a dozen jones is called brown brown who is dead is brought to life aghast and months after the number was printed i saw that i had called philip firmin clive newcome now clive newcome is the hero of another story by the readers most obedient writer the two men are as different in my minds eye asas lord palmerston and mr disraeli let us say but there is that blunder at page 990 line 76 volume 84 of the cornhill magazine and it is past mending and i wish in my life i had made no worse blunders or errors than that which is hereby acknowledged  another finis written another milestone passed on this journey from birth to the next world sure it is a subject for solemn cogitation shall we continue this storytelling business and be voluble to the end of our age will it not be presently time o prattler to hold your tongue and let younger people speak i have a friend a painter who like other persons who shall be nameless is growing old he has never painted with such laborious finish as his works now show this master is still the most humble and diligent of scholars of art his mistress he is always an eager reverent pupil in his calling in yours in mine industry and humility will help and comfort us a word with you in a pretty large experience i have not found the men who write books superior in wit or learning to those who dont write at all in regard of mere information nonwriters must often be superior to writers you dont expect a lawyer in full practice to be conversant with all kinds of literature he is too busy with his law and so a writer is commonly too busy with his own books to be able to bestow attention on the works of other people after a days work in which i have been depicting let us say the agonies of louisa on parting with the captain or the atrocious behavior of the wicked marquis to lady emily i march to the club proposing to improve my mind and keep myself posted up as the americans phrase it with the literature of the day and what happens given a walk after luncheon a pleasing book and a most comfortable armchair by the fire and you know the rest a doze ensues pleasing book drops suddenly is picked up once with an air of some confusion is laid presently softly in lap head falls on comfortable armchair cushion eyes close soft nasal music is heard am i telling club secrets of afternoons after lunch i say scores of sensible fogies have a doze perhaps i have fallen asleep over that very book to which finis has just been written and if the writer sleeps what happens to the readers says jones coming down upon me with his lightning wit what you did sleep over it and a very good thing too these eyes have more than once seen a friend dozing over pages which this hand has written there is a vignette somewhere in one of my books of a friend so caught napping with pendennis or the newcomes in his lap and if a writer can give you a sweet soothing harmless sleep has he not done you a kindness so is the author who excites and interests you worthy of your thanks and benedictions i am troubled with fever and ague that seizes me at odd intervals and prostrates me for a day there is cold fit for which i am thankful to say hot brandyandwater is prescribed and this induces hot fit and so on in one or two of these fits i have read novels with the most fearful contentment of mind once on the mississippi it was my dearly beloved jacob faithful once at frankfort o m the delightful vingt ans apres of monsieur dumas once at tunbridge wells the thrilling woman in white and these books gave me amusement from morning till sunset i remember those ague fits with a great deal of pleasure and gratitude think of a whole day in bed and a good novel for a companion no cares no remorse about idleness no visitors and the woman in white or the chevalier dartagnan to tell me stories from dawn to night please maam my masters compliments and can he have the third volume this message was sent to an astonished friend and neighbor who lent me volume by volume the w in w how do you like your novels i like mine strong hot with and no mistake no lovemaking no observations about society little dialogue except where the characters are bullying each other plenty of fighting and a villain in the cupboard who is to suffer tortures just before finis i dont like your melancholy finis i never read the history of a consumptive heroine twice if i might give a short hint to an impartial writer as the examiner used to say in old days it would be to act not a la mode le pays de pole i think that was the phraseology but always to give quarter in the story of philip just come to an end i have the permission of the author to state that he was going to drown the two villains of the piecea certain doctor f and a certain mr t h on board the president or some other tragic shipbut you see i relented i pictured to myself firmins ghastly face amid the crowd of shuddering people on that reeling deck in the lonely ocean and thought thou ghastly lying wretch thou shalt not be drowned thou shalt have a fever only a knowledge of thy danger and a chanceever so small a chanceof repentance i wonder whether he did repent when he found himself in the yellowfever in virginia the probability is he fancied that his son had injured him very much and forgave him on his deathbed do you imagine there is a great deal of genuine rightdown remorse in the world dont people rather find excuses which make their minds easy endeavor to prove to themselves that they have been lamentably belied and misunderstood and try and forgive the persecutors who will present that bill when it is due and not bear malice against the cruel ruffian who takes them to the policeoffice for stealing the spoons years ago i had a quarrel with a certain wellknown person i believed a statement regarding him which his friends imparted to me and which turned out to be quite incorrect to his dying day that quarrel was never quite made up i said to his brother why is your brothers soul still dark against me it is i who ought to be angry and unforgiving for i was in the wrong in the region which they now inhabit for finis has been set to the volumes of the lives of both here below if they take any cognizance of our squabbles and tittletattles and gossips on earth here i hope they admit that my little error was not of a nature unpardonable if you have never committed a worse my good sir surely the score against you will not be heavy ha dilectissimi fratres it is in regard of sins not found out that we may say or sing in an undertone in a most penitent and lugubrious minor key miserere nobis miseris peccatoribus  among the sins of commission which novelwriters not seldom perpetrate is the sin of grandiloquence or talltalking against which for my part i will offer up a special libera me this is the sin of schoolmasters governesses critics sermoners and instructors of young or old people nay for i am making a clean breast and liberating my soul perhaps of all the novelspinners now extant the present speaker is the most addicted to preaching does he not stop perpetually in his story and begin to preach to you when he ought to be engaged with business is he not for ever taking the muse by the sleeve and plaguing her with some of his cynical sermons i cry peccavi loudly and heartily i tell you i would like to be able to write a story which should show no egotism whateverin which there should be no reflections no cynicism no vulgarity and so forth but an incident in every other page a villain a battle a mystery in every chapter i should like to be able to feed a reader so spicily as to leave him hungering and thirsting for more at the end of every monthly meal  alexandre dumas describes himself when inventing the plan of a work as lying silent on his back for two whole days on the deck of a yacht in a mediterranean port at the end of the two days he arose and called for dinner in those two days he had built his plot he had moulded a mighty clay to be cast presently in perennial brass the chapters the characters the incidents the combinations were all arranged in the artists brain ere he set a pen to paper my pegasus wont fly so as to let me survey the field below me he has no wings he is blind of one eye certainly he is restive stubborn slow crops a hedge when he ought to be galloping or gallops when he ought to be quiet he never will show off when i want him sometimes he goes at a pace which surprises me sometimes when i most wish him to make the running the brute turns restive and i am obliged to let him take his own time i wonder do other novelwriters experience this fatalism they must go a certain way in spite of themselves i have been surprised at the observations made by some of my characters it seems as if an occult power was moving the pen the personage does or says something and i ask how the dickens did he come to think of that every man has remarked in dreams the vast dramatic power which is sometimes evinced i wont say the surprising power for nothing does surprise you in dreams but those strange characters you meet make instant observations of which you never can have thought previously in like manner the imagination foretells things we spake anon of the inflated style of some writers what also if there is an afflated stylewhen a writer is like a pythoness on her oracle tripod and mighty words words which he cannot help come blowing and bellowing and whistling and moaning through the speaking pipes of his bodily organ i have told you it was a very queer shock to me the other day when with a letter of introduction in his hand the artists not my philip firmin walked into this room and sat down in the chair opposite in the novel of pendennis written ten years ago there is an account of a certain costigan whom i had invented as i suppose authors invent their personages out of scraps heeltaps odds and ends of characters i was smoking in a tavern parlor one nightand this costigan came into the room alivethe very manthe most remarkable resemblance of the printed sketches of the man of the rude drawings in which i had depicted him he had the same little coat the same battered hat cocked on one eye the same twinkle in that eye sir said i knowing him to be an old friend whom i had met in unknown regions sir i said may i offer you a glass of brandyandwater bedad ye may says he and ill sing ye a song tu of course he spoke with an irish brogue of course he had been in the army in ten minutes he pulled out an army agents account whereon his name was written a few months after we read of him in a police court how had i come to know him to divine him nothing shall convince me that i have not seen that man in the world of spirits in the world of spirits and water i know i did but that is a mere quibble of words i was not surprised when he spoke in an irish brogue i had had cognizance of him before somehow who has not felt that little shock which arises when a person a place some words in a book there is always a collocation present themselves to you and you know that you have before met the same person words scene and so forth  they used to call the good sir walter the wizard of the north what if some writer should appear who can write so enchantingly that he shall be able to call into actual life the people whom he invents what if mignon and margaret and goetz von berlichingen are alive now though i dont say they are visible and dugald dalgetty and ivanhoe were to step in at that open window by the little garden yonder suppose uncas and our noble old leather stocking were to glide silent in suppose athos porthos and aramis should enter with a noiseless swagger curling their moustaches and dearest amelia booth on uncle tobys arm and tittlebat titmouse with his hair dyed green and all the crummles company of comedians with the gil blas troop and sir roger de coverley and the greatest of all crazy gentlemen the knight of la mancha with his blessed squire i say to you i look rather wistfully towards the window musing upon these people were any of them to enter i think i should not be very much frightened dear old friends what pleasant hours i have had with them we do not see each other very often but when we do we are ever happy to meet i had a capital halfhour with jacob faithful last night when the last sheet was corrected when finis had been written and the printers boy with the copy was safe in green arbor court  so you are gone little printers boy with the last scratches and corrections on the proof and a fine flourish by way of finis at the storys end the last corrections i say those last corrections seem never to be finished a plague upon the weeds every day when i walk in my own little literary gardenplot i spy some and should like to have a spud and root them out those idle words neighbor are past remedy that turning back to the old pages produces anything but elation of mind would you not pay a pretty fine to be able to cancel some of them oh the sad old pages the dull old pages oh the cares the ennui the squabbles the repetitions the old conversations over and over again but now and again a kind thought is recalled and now and again a dear memory yet a few chapters more and then the last after which behold finis itself come to an end and the infinite begun     on a peal of bells   as some bells in a church hard by are making a great holiday clanging in the summer afternoon i am reminded somehow of a july day a garden and a great clanging of bells years and years ago on the very day when george iv was crowned i remember a little boy lying in that garden reading his first novel it was called the scottish chiefs the little boy who is now ancient and not little read this book in the summerhouse of his great grandmamma she was eighty years of age then a most lovely and picturesque old lady with a long tortoiseshell cane with a little puff or tour of snowwhite or was it powdered hair under her cap with the prettiest little blackvelvet slippers and high heels you ever saw she had a grandson a lieutenant in the navy son of her son a captain in the navy grandson of her husband a captain in the navy she lived for scores and scores of years in a dear little old hampshire town inhabited by the wives widows daughters of navy captains admirals lieutenants dear me dont i remember mrs duval widow of admiral duval and the miss dennets at the great house at the other end of the town admiral dennets daughters and the miss barrys the late captain barrys daughters and the good old miss maskews admiral maskews daughter and that dear little miss norval and the kind miss bookers one of whom married captain now admiral sir henry excellent kcb far far away into the past i look and see the little town with its friendly glimmer that town was so like a novel of miss austens that i wonder was she born and bred there no we should have known and the good old ladies would have pronounced her to be a little idle thing occupied with her silly books and neglecting her housekeeping there were other towns in england no doubt where dwelt the widows and wives of other navy captains where they tattled loved each other and quarrelled talked about betty the maid and her fine ribbons indeed took their dish of tea at six played at quadrille every night till ten when there was a little bit of supper after which betty came with the lanthorn and next day came and next and next and so forth until a day arrived when the lanthorn was out when betty came no more all that little company sank to rest under the daisies whither some folks will presently follow them how did they live to be so old those good people moi qui vous parle i perfectly recollect old mr gilbert who had been to sea with captain cook and captain cook as you justly observe dear miss quoting out of your mangnalls questions was murdered by the natives of owhyhee anno 1779 ah dont you remember his picture standing on the seashore in tights and gaiters with a musket in his hand pointing to his people not to fire from the boats whilst a great tattooed savage is going to stab him in the back dont you remember those houris dancing before him and the other officers at the great otaheite ball dont you know that cook was at the siege of quebec with the glorious wolfe who fought under the duke of cumberland whose royal father was a distinguished officer at ramillies before he commanded in chief at dettingen huzza give it them my lads my horse is down then i know i shall not run away do the french run then i die content stop wo quo me rapis my pegasus is galloping off goodness knows where like his majestys charger at dettingen  how do these rich historical and personal reminiscences come out of the subject at present in hand what is that subject by the way my dear friend if you look at the last essaykin though you may leave it alone and i shall not be in the least surprised or offended if you look at the last paper where the writer imagines athos and porthos dalgetty and ivanhoe amelia and sir charles grandison don quixote and sir roger walking in at the gardenwindow you will at once perceive that novels and their heroes and heroines are our present subject of discourse into which we will presently plunge are you one of us dear sir and do you love novelreading to be reminded of your first novel will surely be a pleasure to you hush i never read quite to the end of my first the scottish chiefs i couldnt i peeped in an alarmed furtive manner at some of the closing pages miss porter like a kind dear tenderhearted creature would not have wallaces head chopped off at the end of vol v she made him die in prison and if i remember right protesting i have not read the book for fortytwo or three years robert bruce made a speech to his soldiers in which he said and bannockburn shall equal cambuskenneth but i repeat i could not read the end of the fifth volume of that dear delightful book for crying good heavens it was as sad as sad as going back to school        i find on reference to the novel that sir william died      on the scaffold not in prison  his last words were my      prayer is heard lifes cord is cut by heaven  helen      helen  may heaven preserve my country and  he stopped      he fell  and with that mighty shock the scaffold shook to      its foundations        the remark of bruce which i protest i had not read for      fortytwo years i find to be as followswhen this was      uttered by the english heralds bruce turned to ruthven      with an heroic smile let him come my brave barons and he      shall find that bannockburn shall page with cambuskenneth      in the same amiable authors famous novel of thaddeus of      warsaw there is more crying than in any novel i ever      remember to have read  see for example the last page         incapable of speaking thaddeus led his wife back to her      carriage     his tears gushed out in spite of himself      and mingling with hers poured those thanks those      assurances of animated approbation through her heart which      made it even ache with excess of happiness     and a      sentence or two further kosciusko did bless him and      embalmed the benediction with a shower of tears  the glorious scott cycle of romances came to me some four or five years afterwards and i think boys of our year were specially fortunate in coming upon those delightful books at that special time when we could best enjoy them oh that sunshiny bench on halfholidays with claverhouse or ivanhoe for a companion i have remarked of very late days some little men in a great state of delectation over the romances of captain mayne reid and gustave aimards prairie and indian stories and during occasional holiday visits lurking off to bed with the volume under their arms but are those indians and warriors so terrible as our indians and warriors were i say are they young gentlemen mind i do not say they are not but as an oldster i can be heartily thankful for the novels of the 110 geo iv let us say and so downward to a period not unremote let us see there is first our dear scott whom do i love in the works of that dear old master amo  the baron of bradwardine and fergus captain waverley is certainly very mild  amo ivanhoe locksley the templar  amo quentin durward and especially quentins uncle who brought the boar to bay i forget the gentlemans name  i have never cared for the master of ravenswood or fetched his hat out of the water since he dropped it there when i last met him circa 1825  amo saladin and the scotch knight in the talisman the sultan best  amo claverhouse  amo major dalgetty delightful major to think of him is to desire to jump up run to the book and get the volume down from the shelf about all those heroes of scott what a manly bloom there is and honorable modesty they are not at all heroic they seem to blush somehow in their position of hero and as it were to say since it must be done here goes they are handsome modest upright simple courageous not too clever if i were a mother which is absurd i should like to be motherinlaw to several young men of the walterscotthero sort  much as i like those most unassuming manly unpretending gentlemen i have to own that i think the heroes of another writer viz  leatherstocking  uncas  hardheart  tom coffin  are quite the equals of scotts men perhaps leatherstocking is better than any one in scotts lot la longue carabine is one of the great prizemen of fiction he ranks with your uncle toby sir roger de coverley falstaffheroic figures allamerican or british and the artist has deserved well of his country who devised them  at school in my time there was a public day when the boys relatives an examining bigwig or two from the universities old schoolfellows and so forth came to the place the boys were all paraded prizes were administered each lad being in a new suit of clothesand magnificent dandies i promise you some of us were oh the chubby cheeks clean collars glossy new raiment beaming faces glorious in youthfit tueri coelumbright with truth and mirth and honor to see a hundred boys marshalled in a chapel or old hall to hear their sweet fresh voices when they chant and look in their brave calm faces i say does not the sight and sound of them smite you somehow with a pang of exquisite kindness    well as about boys so about novelists i fancy the boys of parnassus school all paraded i am a lower boy myself in that academy i like our fellows to look well upright gentlemanlike there is master fieldinghe with the black eye what a magnificent build of a boy there is master scott one of the heads of the school did you ever see the fellow more hearty and manly yonder lean shambling cadaverous lad who is always borrowing money telling lies leering after the housemaids is master laurence sternea bishops grandson and himself intended for the church for shame you little reprobate but what a genius the fellow has let him have a sound flogging and as soon as the young scamp is out of the whippingroom give him a gold medal such would be my practice if i were doctor birch and master of the school  let us drop this school metaphor this birch and all pertaining thereto our subject i beg leave to remind the readers humble servant is novel heroes and heroines how do you like your heroes ladies gentlemen what novel heroines do you prefer when i set this essay going i sent the above question to two of the most inveterate novelreaders of my acquaintance the gentleman refers me to miss austen the lady says athos guy livingston and pardon my rosy blushes colonel esmond and owns that in youth she was very much in love with valancourt  valancourt and who was he cry the young people valancourt my dears was the hero of one of the most famous romances which ever was published in this country the beauty and elegance of valancourt made your young grandmammas gentle hearts to beat with respectful sympathy he and his glory have passed away ah woe is me that the glory of novels should ever decay that dust should gather round them on the shelves that the annual cheques from messieurs the publishers should dwindle dwindle inquire at mudies or the london library who asks for the mysteries of udolpho now have not even the mysteries of paris ceased to frighten alas our novels are but for a season and i know characters whom a painful modesty forbids me to mention who shall go to limbo along with valancourt and doricourt and thaddeus of warsaw  a dear old sentimental friend with whom i discoursed on the subject of novels yesterday said that her favorite hero was lord orville in evelina that novel which dr johnson loved so i took down the book from a dusty old crypt at a club where mrs barbaulds novelists repose and this is the kind of thing ladies and gentlemen in which your ancestors found pleasure  and here whilst i was looking for the books i was followed by lord orville he shut the door after he came in and approaching me with a look of anxiety said is this true miss anvilleare you going  i believe so my lord said i still looking for the books  so suddenly so unexpectedly must i lose you  no great loss my lord said i endeavoring to speak cheerfully  is it possible said he gravely miss anville can doubt my sincerity  i cant imagine cried i what mrs selwyn has done with those books  would to heaven continued he i might flatter myself you would allow me to prove it  i must run up stairs cried i greatly confused and ask what she has done with them  you are going then cried he taking my hand and you give me not the smallest hope of any return will you not my too lovely friend will you not teach me with fortitude like your own to support your absence  my lord cried i endeavoring to disengage my hand pray let me go  i will cried he to my inexpressible confusion dropping on one knee if you wish me to leave you  oh my lord exclaimed i rise i beseech you rise surely your lordship is not so cruel as to mock me  mock you repeated he earnestly no i revere you i esteem and admire you above all human beings you are the friend to whom my soul is attached as to its better half you are the most amiable the most perfect of women and you are dearer to me than language has the power of telling  i attempt not to describe my sensations at that moment i scarce breathed i doubted if i existed the blood forsook my cheeks and my feet refused to sustain me lord orville hastily rising supported me to a chair upon which i sank almost lifeless  i cannot write the scene that followed though every word is engraven on my heart but his protestations his expressions were too flattering for repetition nor would he in spite of my repeated efforts to leave him suffer me to escape in short my dear sir i was not proof against his solicitations and he drew from me the most sacred secret of my heart        contrast this old perfumed powdered darblay conversation      with the present modern talk  if the two young people      wished to hide their emotions nowadays and express      themselves in modest language the story would run       whilst i was looking for the books lord orville came in      he looked uncommonly down in the mouth as he said is this      true miss anville are you going to cut       to absquatulate lord orville said i still pretending      that i was looking for the books       you are very quick about it said he       guess its no great loss i remarked as cheerfully as i      could       you dont think im chaffing said orville with much      emotion       what has mrs selwyn done with the books i went on       what going said he and going for good  i wish i was      such a goodplucked one as you miss anville c       the conversation you perceive might be easily written down      to this key and if the hero and heroine were modern they      would not be suffered to go through their dialogue on      stilts but would converse in the natural graceful way at      present customary  by the way what a strange custom that      is in modern lady novelists to make the men bully the women      in the time of miss porter and madame darblay we have      respect profound bows and curtsies graceful courtesy from      men to women  in the time of miss bronte absolute      rudeness  is it true mesdames that you like rudeness and      are pleased at being illused by men  i could point to more      than one lady novelist who so represents you  other people may not much like this extract madam from your favorite novel but when you come to read it you will like it i suspect that when you read that book which you so love you read it a deux did you not yourself pass a winter at bath when you were the belle of the assembly was there not a lord orville in your case too as you think of him eleven lustres pass away you look at him with the bright eyes of those days and your hero stands before you the brave the accomplished the simple the true gentleman and he makes the most elegant of bows to one of the most beautiful young women the world ever saw and he leads you out to the cotillon to the dear unforgotten music hark to the horns of elfand blowing blowing bonne vieille you remember their melody and your heartstrings thrill with it still  of your heroic heroes i think our friend monseigneur athos count de la fere is my favorite i have read about him from sunrise to sunset with the utmost contentment of mind he has passed through how many volumes forty fifty i wish for my part there were a hundred more and would never tire of him reselling prisoners punishing ruffians and running scoundrels through the midriff with his most graceful rapier ah athos porthos and aramis you are a magnificent trio i think i like dartagnan in his own memoirs best i bought him years and years ago price fivepence in a little parchmentcovered cologneprinted volume at a stall in grays inn lane dumas glorifies him and makes a marshal of him if i remember rightly the original dartagnan was a needy adventurer who died in exile very early in louis xivs reign did you ever read the chevalier dharmenthal did you ever read the tulipe noire as modest as a story by miss edgeworth i think of the prodigal banquets to which this lucullus of a man has invited me with thanks and wonder to what a series of splendid entertainments he has treated me where does he find the money for these prodigious feasts they say that all the works bearing dumass name are not written by him well does not the chief cook have aides under him did not rubenss pupils paint on his canvases had not lawrence assistants for his backgrounds for myself being also du metier i confess i would often like to have a competent respectable and rapid clerk for the business part of my novels and on his arrival at eleven oclock would say mr jones if you please the archbishop must die this morning in about five pages turn to article dropsy or what you will in encyclopaedia take care there are no medical blunders in his death group his daughters physicians and chaplains round him in waless london letter b third shelf you will find an account of lambeth and some prints of the place color in with local coloring the daughter will come down and speak to her lover in his wherry at lambeth stairs c c jones an intelligent young man examines the medical historical topographical books necessary his chief points out to him in jeremy taylor fol london mdclv a few remarks such as might befit a dear old archbishop departing this life when i come back to dress for dinner the archbishop is dead on my table in five pages medicine topography theology all right and jones has gone home to his family some hours sir christopher is the architect of st pauls he has not laid the stones or carried up the mortar there is a great deal of carpenters and joiners work in novels which surely a smart professional hand might supply a smart professional hand i give you my word there seem to me parts of novelslet us say the lovemaking the business the villain in the cupboard and so forth which i should like to order john footman to take in hand as i desire him to bring the coals and polish the boots ask me indeed to pop a robber under a bed to hide a will which shall be forthcoming in due season or at my time of life to write a nambypamby love conversation between emily and lord arthur i feel ashamed of myself and especially when my business obliges me to do the lovepassages i blush so though quite alone in my study that you would fancy i was going off in an apoplexy are authors affected by their own works i dont know about other gentlemen but if i make a joke myself i cry if i write a pathetic scene i am laughing wildly all the timeat least tomkins thinks so you know i am such a cynic  the editor of the cornhill magazine no soft and yielding character like his predecessor but a man of stern resolution will only allow these harmless papers to run to a certain length but for this veto i should gladly have prattled over half a sheet more and have discoursed on many heroes and heroines of novels whom fond memory brings back to me of these books i have been a diligent student from those early days which are recorded at the commencement of this little essay oh delightful novels well remembered oh novels sweet and delicious as the raspberry opentarts of budding boyhood do i forget one night after prayers when we underboys were sent to bed lingering at my cupboard to read one little halfpage more of my dear walter scottand down came the monitors dictionary upon my head rebecca daughter of isaac of york i have loved thee faithfully for forty years thou wert twenty years old say and i but twelve when i knew thee at sixty odd love most of the ladies of thy orient race have lost the bloom of youth and bulged beyond the line of beauty but to me thou art ever young and fair and i will do battle with any felon templar who assails thy fair name     on a peartree   a gracious reader no doubt has remarked that these humble sermons have for subjects some little event which happens at the preachers own gate or which falls under his peculiar cognizance once you may remember we discoursed about a chalkmark on the door this morning betsy the housemaid comes with a frightened look and says law mum theres three bricks taken out of the garden wall and the branches broke and all the pears taken off the peartree poor peaceful suburban peartree gaolbirds have hopped about thy branches and robbed them of their smoky fruit but those bricks removed that ladder evidently prepared by which unknown marauders may enter and depart from my little englishmans castle is not this a subject of thrilling interest and may it not be continued in a future numberthat is the terrible question suppose having escaladed the outer wall the miscreants take a fancy to storm the castle wellwell we are armed we are numerous we are men of tremendous courage who will defend our spoons with our lives and there are barracks close by thank goodness whence at the noise of our shouts and firing at least a thousand bayonets will bristle to our rescue  what sound is yonder a church bell i might go myself but how listen to the sermon i am thinking of those thieves who have made a ladder of my wall and a prey of my peartree they may be walking to church at this moment neatly shaved in clean linen with every outward appearance of virtue if i went i know i should be watching the congregation and thinking is that one of the fellows who came over my wall if after the reading of the eighth commandment a man sang out with particular energy incline our hearts to keep this law i should think aha master basso did you have pears for breakfast this morning crime is walking round me that is clear who is the perpetrator    what a changed aspect the world has since these last few lines were written i have been walking round about my premises and in consultation with a gentleman in a singlebreasted blue coat with pewter buttons and a tape ornament on the collar he has looked at the holes in the wall and the amputated tree we have formed our plan of defenceperhaps of attack perhaps some day you may read in the papers daring attempt at burglaryheroic victory over the villains c c rascals as yet unknown perhaps you too may read these words and may be induced to pause in your fatal intention take the advice of a sincere friend and keep off to find a man writhing in my mantrap another mayhap impaled in my ditch to pick off another from my tree scoundrel as though he were a pear will give me no pleasure but such things may happen be warned in time villains or if you must pursue your calling as cracksmen have the goodness to try some other shutters enough subside into your darkness children of night thieves we seek not to have you hangedyou are but as pegs whereon to hang others  i may have said before that if i were going to be hanged myself i think i should take an accurate note of my sensations request to stop at some publichouse on the road to tyburn and be provided with a private room and writingmaterials and give an account of my state of mind then gee up carter beg your reverence to continue your apposite though not novel remarks on my situationand so we drive up to tyburn turnpike where an expectant crowd the obliging sheriffs and the dexterous and rapid mr ketch are already in waiting  a number of laboring people are sauntering about our streets and taking their rest on this holidayfellows who have no more stolen my pears than they have robbed the crown jewels out of the towerand i say i cannot help thinking in my own mind are you the rascal who got over my wall last night is the suspicion haunting my mind written on my countenance i trust not what if one man after another were to come up to me and say how dare you sir suspect me in your mind of stealing your fruit go be hanged you and your jargonels you rascal thief it is not merely threehalfporth of sooty fruit you rob me of it is my peace of mindmy artless innocence and trust in my fellowcreatures my childlike belief that everything they say is true how can i hold out the hand of friendship in this condition when my first impression is my good sir i strongly suspect that you were up my peartree last night it is a dreadful state of mind the core is black the deathstricken fruit drops on the bough and a great worm is withinfattening and feasting and wriggling who stole the pears i say is it you brother is it you madam come are you ready to answerrespondere parati et cantare pares o shame shame  will the villains ever be discovered and punished who stole my fruit some unlucky rascals who rob orchards are caught up the tree at once some rob through life with impunity if i for my part were to try and get up the smallest tree on the darkest night in the most remote orchard i wager any money i should be found outbe caught by the leg in a mantrap or have towler fastening on me i always am found out have been shall be its my luck other men will carry off bushels of fruit and get away undetected unsuspected whereas i know woe and punishment would fall upon me were i to lay my hand on the smallest pippin so be it a man who has this precious selfknowledge will surely keep his hands from picking and stealing and his feet upon the paths of virtue  i will assume my benevolent friend and present reader that you yourself are virtuous not from a fear of punishment but from a sheer love of good but us you and i walk through life consider what hundreds of thousands of rascals we must have met who have not been found out at all in high places and low in clubs and on change at church or the balls and routs of the nobility and gentry how dreadful it is for benevolent beings like you and me to have to think these undiscovered though not unsuspected scoundrels are swarming what is the difference between you and a galleyslave is yonder poor wretch at the hulks not a man and a brother too have you ever forged my dear sir have you ever cheated your neighbor have you ever ridden to hounslow heath and robbed the mail have you ever entered a firstclass railway carriage where an old gentleman sat alone in a sweet sleep daintily murdered him taken his pocketbook and got out at the next station you know that this circumstance occurred in france a few months since if we have travelled in france this autumn we may have met the ingenious gentleman who perpetrated this daring and successful coup we may have found him a wellinformed and agreeable man i have been acquainted with two or three gentlemen who have been discovered afterafter the performance of illegal actions what that agreeable rattling fellow we met was the celebrated mr john sheppard was that amiable quiet gentleman in spectacles the wellknown mr fauntleroy in hazlitts admirable paper going to a fight he describes a dashing sporting fellow who was in the coach and who was no less a man than the eminent destroyer of mr william weare dont tell me that you would not like to have met out of business captain sheppard the reverend doctor dodd or others rendered famous by their actions and misfortunes by their lives and their deaths they are the subjects of ballads the heroes of romance a friend of mine had the house in may fair out of which poor doctor dodd was taken handcuffed there was the paved hall over which he stepped that little room at the side was no doubt the study where he composed his elegant sermons two years since i had the good fortune to partake of some admirable dinners in tyburniamagnificent dinners indeed but rendered doubly interesting from the fact that the house was that occupied by the late mr sadleir one night the late mr sadleir took tea in that diningroom and to the surprise of his butler went out having put into his pocket his own creamjug the next morning you know he was found dead on hampstead heath with the creamjug lying by him into which he had poured the poison by which he died the idea of the ghost of the late gentleman flitting about the room gave a strange interest to the banquet can you fancy him taking his tea alone in the diningroom he empties that creamjug and puts it in his pocket and then he opens yonder door through which he is never to pass again now he crosses the hall and hark the halldoor shuts upon him and his steps die away they are gone into the night they traverse the sleeping city they lead him into the fields where the gray morning is beginning to glimmer he pours something from a bottle into a little silver jug it touches his lips the lying lips do they quiver a prayer ere that awful draught is swallowed when the sun rises they are dumb  i neither knew this unhappy man nor his countrymanlaertes let us call himwho is at present in exile having been compelled to fly from remorseless creditors laertes fled to america where he earned his bread by his pen i own to having a kindly feeling towards this scapegrace because though an exile he did not abuse the country whence he fled i have heard that he went away taking no spoil with him penniless almost and on his voyage he made acquaintance with a certain jew and when he fell sick at new york this jew befriended him and gave him help and money out of his own store which was but small now after they had been awhile in the strange city it happened that the poor jew spent all his little money and he too fell ill and was in great penury and now it was laertes who befriended that ebrew jew he feed doctors he fed and tended the sick and hungry go to laertes i know thee not it may be thou art justly exul patriae but the jew shall intercede for thee thou not let us trust hopeless christian sinner  another exile to the same shore i knew who did not julius caesar hardly owed more money than cucedicus and gracious powers cucedicus how did you manage to spend and owe so much all day he was at work for his clients at night he was occupied in the public council he neither had wife nor children the rewards which he received for his orations were enough to maintain twenty rhetoricians night after night i have seen him eating his frugal meal consisting but of a fish a small portion of mutton and a small measure of iberian or trinacrian wine largely diluted with the sparkling waters of rhenish gaul and this was all he had and this man earned and paid away talents upon talents and fled owing who knows how many more does a man earn fifteen thousand pounds a year toiling by day talking by night having horrible unrest in his bed ghastly terrors at waking seeing an officer lurking at every corner a sword of justice for ever hanging over his headand have for his sole diversion a newspaper a lonely muttonchop and a little sherry and seltzerwater in the german stories we read how men sell themselves toa certain personage and that personage cheats them he gives them wealth yes but the goldpieces turn into worthless leaves he sets them before splendid banquets yes but what an awful grin that black footman has who lifts up the dishcover and dont you smell a peculiar sulphurous odor in the dish faugh take it away i cant eat he promises them splendors and triumphs the conquerors ear rolls glittering through the city the multitude shout and huzza drive on coachman yes but who is that hanging on behind the carriage is this the reward of eloquence talents industry is this the end of a lifes labor dont you remember how when the dragon was infesting the neighborhood of babylon the citizens used to walk dismally out of evenings and look at the valleys round about strewed with the bones of the victims whom the monster had devoured o insatiate brute and most disgusting brazen and scaly reptile let us be thankful children that it has not gobbled us up too quick let us turn away and pray that we may be kept out of the reach of his horrible maw jaw claw  when i first came up to london as innocent as monsieur gil blas i also fell in with some pretty acquaintances found my way into several caverns and delivered my purse to more than one gallant gentleman of the road one i remember especiallyone who never eased me personally of a single maravedione than whom i never met a bandit more gallant courteous and amiable rob me rolando feasted me treated me to his dinner and his wine kept a generous table for his friends and i know was most liberal to many of them how well i remember one of his speculations it was a great plan for smuggling tobacco revenue officers were to be bought off silent ships were to ply on the thames cunning depots were to be established and hundreds of thousands of pounds to be made by the coup how his eyes kindled as he propounded the scheme to me how easy and certain it seemed it might have succeeded i cant say but the bold and merry the hearty and kindly rolando came to griefa little matter of imitated signatures occasioned a bank persecution of rolando the brave he walked about armed and vowed he would never be taken alive but taken he was tried condemned sentenced to perpetual banishment and i heard that for some time he was universally popular in the colony which had the honor to possess him what a song he could sing twas when the cup was sparkling before us and heaven gave a portion of its blue boys blue that i remember the song of roland at the old piazza coffeehouse and now where is the old piazza coffeehouse where is thebes where is troy where is the colossus of rhodes ah rolando rolando thou wert a gallant captain a cheery a handsome a merry at me thou never presentedst pistol thou badest the bumper of burgundy fill fill for me giving those who preferred it champagne caelum non animum c do you think he has reformed now that he has crossed the sea and changed the air i have my own opinion howbeit rolando thou wert a most kind and hospitable bandit and i love not to think of thee with a chain at thy shin  do you know how all these memories of unfortunate men have come upon me when they came to frighten me this morning by speaking of my robbed pears my perforated garden wall i was reading an article in the saturday review about rupilius i have sat near that young man at a public dinner and beheld him in a gilded uniform but yesterday he lived in splendor had long hair a flowing beard a jewel at his neck and a smart surtout so attired he stood but yesterday in court and today he sits over a bowl of prison cocoa with a shaved head and in a felons jerkin  that beard and head shaved that gaudy deputylieutenants coat exchanged for felon uniform and your daily bottle of champagne for prison cocoa my poor rupilius what a comfort it must be to have the business brought to an end champagne was the honorable gentlemans drink in the house of commons diningroom as i am informed what uncommonly dry champagne that must have been when we saw him outwardly happy how miserable he must have been when we thought him prosperous how dismally poor when the great mr harker at the public dinners called outgentlemen charge your glasses and please silence for the honorable member for lambeth how that honorable member must have writhed inwardly one day when there was a talk of a gentlemans honor being questioned rupilius said if any man doubted mine i would knock him down but that speech was in the way of business the spartan boy who stole the fox smiled while the beast was gnawing him under his cloak i promise you rupilius had some sharp fangs gnashing under his we have sat at the same feast i say we have paid our contribution to the same charity ah when i ask this day for my daily bread i pray not to be led into temptation and to be delivered from evil     desseins   i arrived by the nightmail packet from dover the passage had been rough and the usual consequences had ensued i was disinclined to travel farther that night on my road to paris and knew the calais hotel of old as one of the cleanest one of the dearest one of the most comfortable hotels on the continent of europe there is no town more french than calais that charming old hotel dessein with its court its gardens its lordly kitchen its princely waitera gentleman of the old school who has welcomed the finest company in europehave long been known to me i have read complaints in the times more than once i think that the dessein bills are dear a bottle of sodawater certainly costswell never mind how much i remember as a boy at the ship at dover imperante carolo decimo when my place to london being paid i had but 12s left after a certain little paris excursion about which my benighted parents never knew anything ordering for dinner a whiting a beefsteak and a glass of negus and the bill was dinner 7s glass of negus 2s waiter 6d and only half a crown left as i was a sinner for the guard and coachman on the way to london and i was a sinner i had gone without leave what a long dreary guilty forty hours journey it was from paris to calais i remember how did i come to think of this escapade which occurred in the easter vacation of the year 1830 i always think of it when i am crossing to calais guilt sir guilt remains stamped on the memory and i feel easier in my mind now that it is liberated of this old peccadillo i met my college tutor only yesterday we were travelling and stopped at the same hotel he had the very next room to mine after he had gone into his apartment having shaken me quite kindly by the hand i felt inclined to knock at his door and say doctor bentley i beg your pardon but do you remember when i was going down at the easter vacation in 1830 you asked me where i was going to spend my vacation and i said with my friend slingsby in huntingdonshire well sir i grieve to have to confess that i told you a fib i had got 20l and was going for a lark to paris where my friend edwards was staying there it is out the doctor will read it for i did not wake him up after all to make my confession but protest he shall have a copy of this roundabout sent to him when he returns to his lodge  they gave me a bedroom there a very neat room on the first floor looking into the pretty garden the hotel must look pretty much as it did a hundred years ago when he visited it i wonder whether he paid his bill yes his journey was just begun he had borrowed or got the money somehow such a man would spend it liberally enough when he had it give generouslynay drop a tear over the fate of the poor fellow whom he relieved i dont believe a word he says but i never accused him of stinginess about money that is a fault of much more virtuous people than he mr laurence is ready enough with his purse when there are anybodys guineas in it still when i went to bed in the room in his room when i think how i admire dislike and have abused him a certain dim feeling of apprehension filled my mind at the midnight hour what if i should see his lean figure in the blacksatin breeches his sinister smile his long thin finger pointing to me in the moonlight for i am in bed and have popped my candle out and he should say you mistrust me you hate me do you and you dont you know how jack tom and harry your brother authors hate you i grin and laugh in the moonlight in the midnight in the silence o you ghost in blacksatin breeches and a wig i like to be hated by some men i say i know men whose lives are a scheme whose laughter is a conspiracy whose smile means something else whose hatred is a cloak and i had rather these men should hate me than not  my good sir says he with a ghastly grin on his lean face you have your wish  apres i say please let me go to sleep i shant sleep any the worse because  because there are insects in the bed and they sting you this is only by way of illustration my good sir the animals dont bite me now all the house at present seems to me excellently clean tis absurd to affect this indifference if you are thinskinned and the reptiles bite they keep you from sleep  there are some men who cry out at a fleabite as loud as if they were torn by a vulture i growl  men of the genus irritabile my worthy good gentlemanand you are one  yes sir i am of the profession as you say and i dare say make a great shouting and crying at a small hurt  you are ashamed of that quality by which you earn your subsistence and such reputation as you have your sensibility is your livelihood my worthy friend you feel a pang of pleasure or pain it is noted in your memory and some day or other makes its appearance in your manuscript why in your last roundabout rubbish you mention reading your first novel on the day when king george iv was crowned i remember him in his cradle at st jamess a lovely little babe a gilt chinese railing was before him and i dropped the tear of sensibility as i gazed on the sleeping cherub  a teara fiddlestick mr sterne i growled out for of course i knew my friend in the wig and satin breeches to be no other than the notorious nay celebrated mr laurence sterne  does not the sight of a beautiful infant charm and melt you mon ami if not i pity you yes he was beautiful i was in london the year he was born i used to breakfast at the mount coffeehouse i did not become the fashion until two years later when my tristram made his appearance who has held his own for a hundred years by the way mon bon monsieur how many authors of your present time will last till the next century do you think brown will  i laughed with scorn as i lay in my bed and so did the ghost give a ghastly snigger  brown i roared one of the most overrated men that ever put pen to paper  what do you think of jones  i grew indignant with this old cynic as a reasonable ghost come out of the other world you dont mean i said to ask me a serious opinion of mr jones his books may be very good reading for maidservants and schoolboys but you dont ask me to read them as a scholar yourself you must know that  well then robinson  robinson i am told has merit i dare say i never have been able to read his books and cant therefore form any opinion about mr robinson at least you will allow that i am not speaking in a prejudiced manner about him  ah i see you men of letters have your cabals and jealousies as we had in my time there was an irish fellow by the name of gouldsmith who used to abuse me but he went into no genteel companyand faith it mattered little his praise or abuse i never was more surprised than when i heard that mr irving an american gentleman of parts and elegance had wrote the fellows life to make a hero of that man my dear sir twas ridiculous you followed in the fashion i hear and chose to lay a wreath before this queer little idol preposterous a pretty writer who has turned some neat couplets bah i have no patience with master posterity that has chosen to take up this fellow and make a hero of him and there was another gentleman of my time mr thiefcatcher fielding forsooth a fellow with the strength and the tastes and the manners of a porter what madness has possessed you all to bow before that calvert butt of a mana creature without elegance or sensibility the dog had spirits certainly i remember my lord bathurst praising them but as for reading his booksma foi i would as lief go and dive for tripe in a cellar the mans vulgarity stifles me he wafts me whiffs of gin tobacco and onions are in his great coarse laugh which choke me pardi and i dont think much better of the other fellowthe scots gallipot purveyorperegrine clinker humphrey randomhow did the fellow call his rubbish neither of these men had the bel air the bon ton the je ne scais quoy pah if i meet them in my walks by our stygian river i give them a wide berth as that hybrid apothecary fellow would say an ounce of civet good apothecary horrible horrible the mere thought of the coarseness of those men gives me the chair de poule mr fielding especially has no more sensibility than a butcher in fleet market he takes his heroes out of alehouse kitchens or worse places still and this is the person whom posterity has chosen to honor along with meme faith monsieur posterity you have put me in pretty company and i see you are no wiser than we were in our time mr fielding forsooth mr tripe and onions mr cowheel and gin thank you for nothing monsieur posterity  and so thought i even among these stygians this envy and quarrelsomeness if you will permit me the word survive what a pitiful meanness to be sure i can understand this feeling to a certain extent a sense of justice will prompt it in my own case i often feel myself forced to protest against the absurd praises lavished on contemporaries yesterday for instance lady jones was good enough to praise one of my works tres bien but in the very next minute she began with quite as great enthusiasm to praise miss hobsons last romance my good creature what is that womans praise worth who absolutely admires the writings of miss hobson i offer a friend a bottle of 44 claret fit for a pontifical supper this is capital wine says he and now we have finished the bottle will you give me a bottle of that ordinaire we drank the other day very well my good man you are a good judgeof ordinaire i dare say nothing so provokes my anger and rouses my sense of justice as to hear other men undeservedly praised in a word if you wish to remain friends with me dont praise anybody you tell me that the venus de medici is beautiful or jacob omnium is tall que diable cant i judge for myself havent i eyes and a footrule i dont think the venus is so handsome since you press me she is pretty but she has no expression and as for mr omnium i can see much taller men in a fair for twopence  and so i said turning round to mr sterne you are actually jealous of mr fielding o you men of letters you men of letters is not the world your world i mean big enough for all of you  i often travel in my sleep i often of a night find myself walking in my nightgown about the gray streets it is awkward at first but somehow nobody makes any remark i glide along over the ground with my naked feet the mud does not wet them the passersby do not tread on them i am wafted over the ground down the stairs through the doors this sort of travelling dear friends i am sure you have all of you indulged  well on the night in question and if you wish to know the precise date it was the 31st of september last after having some little conversation with mr sterne in our bedroom i must have got up though i protest i dont know how and come down stairs with him into the coffeeroom of the hotel dessein where the moon was shining and a cold supper was laid out i forget what we hadvolauvent doeufs de phenixagneau aux pistaches a la barmecidewhat matters what we had  as regards supper this is certain the less you have of it the better  that is what one of the guests remarkeda shabby old man in a wig and such a dirty ragged disreputable dressinggown that i should have been quite surprised at him only one never is surprised in dr under certain circumstances  i cant eat em now said the greasy man with his false old teeth i wonder he could eat anything i remember alvanley eating three suppers once at carlton houseone night de petite comite  petit comite sir said mr sterne  dammy sir let me tell my own story my own way i say one night at carlton house playing at blind hookey with york wales tom raikes prince boothby and dutch sam the boxer alvanley ate three suppers and won three and twenty hundred pounds in ponies never saw a fellow with such an appetite except wales in his good time but he destroyed the finest digestion a man ever had with maraschino by jovealways at it  try mine said mr sterne  what a doosid queer box says mr brummell  i had it from a capuchin friar in this town the box is but a horn one but to the nose of sensibility arabys perfume is not more delicate  i call it doosid stale old rappee says mr brummellas for me i declare i could not smell anything at all in either of the boxes old boy in smockfrock take a pinch  the old boy in the smockfrock as mr brummell called him was a very old man with long white beard wearing not a smockfrock but a shirt and he had actually nothing else save a rope round his neck which hung behind his chair in the queerest way  fair sir he said turning to mr brummell when the prince of wales and his father laid siege to our town  what nonsense are you talking old cock says mr brummell wales was never here his late majesty george iv passed through on his way to hanover my good man you dont seem to know whats up at all what is he talkin about the siege of calais i lived here fifteen years ought to know whats his old name  i am master eustace of saint peters said the old gentleman in the shirt when my lord king edward laid siege to this city  laid siege to jericho cries mr brummell the old man is crackedcracked sir  laid siege to this city continued the old man i and five more promised messire gautier de mauny that we would give ourselves up as ransom for the place and we came before our lord king edward attired as you see and the fair queen begged our lives out of her gramercy  queen nonsense you mean the princess of walespretty woman petit nez retrousse grew monstrous stout suggested mr brummell whose reading was evidently not extensive sir sidney smith was a fine fellow great talker hook nose so has lord cochrane so has lord wellington she was very sweet on sir sidney  your acquaintance with the history of calais does not seem to be considerable said mr sterne to mr brummell with a shrug  dont it bishopfor i conclude you are a bishop by your wig i know calais as well as any man i lived here for years before i took that confounded consulate at caen lived in this hotel then at leleuxs people used to stop here good fellows used to ask for poor george brummell hertford did so did the duchess of devonshire not know calais indeed that is a good joke had many a good dinner here sorry i ever left it  my lord king edward chirped the queer old gentleman in the shirt colonized the place with his english after we had yielded it up to him i have heard tell they kept it for nigh three hundred years till my lord de guise took it from a fair queen mary of blessed memory a holy woman eh but sire gautier of mauny was a good knight a valiant captain gentle and courteous withal do you remember his ransoming the   what is the old fellow twaddlin about cries brummell he is talking about some knighti never spoke to a knight and very seldom to a baronet firkins my butterman was a knighta knight and alderman wales knighted him once on going into the city  i am not surprised that the gentleman should not understand messire eustace of st peters said the ghostly individual addressed as mr sterne your reading doubtless has not been very extensive  dammy sir speak for yourself cries mr brummell testily i never professed to be a reading man but i was as good as my neighbors wales wasnt a reading man york wasnt a reading man clarence wasnt a reading man sussex was but he wasnt a man in society i remember reading your sentimental journey old boy read it to the duchess at beauvoir i recollect and she cried over it doosid clever amusing book and does you great credit birron wrote doosid clever books too so did monk lewis george spencer was an elegant poet and my dear duchess of devonshire if she had not been a grande dame would have beat em all by george wales couldnt write he could sing but he couldnt spell  ah you know the great world so did i in my time mr brummell i have had the visiting tickets of half the nobility at my lodgings in bond street but they left me there no more cared for than last years calendar sighed mr sterne i wonder who is the mode in london now one of our late arrivals my lord macaulay has prodigious merit and learning and faith his histories are more amusing than any novels my own included  dont know im sure not in my line pick this bone of chicken says mr brummell trifling with a skeleton bird before him  i remember in this city of calais worse fare than you bird said old mr eustace of saint peters marry sirs when my lord king edward laid siege to us lucky was he who could get a slice of horse for his breakfast and a rat was sold at the price of a hare  hare is coarse food never tasted rat remarked the beau tabledhote poor fare enough for a man like me who has been accustomed to the best of cookery but ratstifle me i couldnt swallow that never could bear hardship at all  we had to bear enough when my lord of england pressed us twas pitiful to see the faces of our women as the siege went on and hear the little ones asking for dinner  always a bore children at dessert they are bad enough but at dinner theyre the deuce and all remarked mr brummell  messire eustace of st peters did not seem to pay much attention to the beaus remarks but continued his own train of thought as old men will do  i hear said he that there has actually been no war between us of france and you men of england for wellnigh fifty year ours has ever been a nation of warriors and besides her regular found menatarms tis said the english of the present time have more than a hundred thousand of archers with weapons that will carry for half a mile and a multitude have come amongst us of late from a great western country never so much as heard of in my timevaliant men and great drawers of the long bow and they say they have ships in armor that no shot can penetrate is it so wonderful wonderful the best armor gossips is a stout heart  and if ever manly heart beat under shirtfrill thine is that heart sir eustace cried mr sterne enthusiastically  we of france were never accused of lack of courage sir in so far as i know said messire eustace we have shown as much in a thousand wars with you english by sea and land and sometimes we conquered and sometimes as is the fortune of war we were discomfited and notably in a great seafight which befell off ushant on the first of june  our admiral messire villaret de joyeuse on board his galleon named the vengeur being sore pressed by an english bombard rather than yield the crew of his ship to mercy determined to go down with all on board of her and to the cry of vive la repubor i would say of notre dame a la rescousse he and his crew all sank to an immortal grave  sir said i looking with amazement at the old gentleman surely surely there is some mistake in your statement permit me to observe that the action of the first of june took place five hundred years after your time and  perhaps i am confusing my dates said the old gentleman with a faint blush you say i am mixing up the transactions of my time on earth with the story of my successors it may be so we take no count of a few centuries more or less in our dwelling by the darkling stygian river of late there came amongst us a good knight messire de cambronne who fought against you english in the country of flanders being captain of the guard of my lord the king of france in a famous battle where you english would have been utterly routed but for the succor of the prussian heathen this messire de cambronne when bidden to yield by you of england answered this the guard dies but never surrenders and fought a long time afterwards as became a good knight in our wars with you of england it may have pleased the fates to give you the greater success but on our side also there has been no lack of brave deeds performed by brave men  king edward may have been the victor sir as being the strongest but you are the hero of the siege of calais cried mr sterne your story is sacred and your name has been blessed for five hundred years wherever men speak of patriotism and sacrifice eustace of saint pierre shall be beloved and remembered i prostrate myself before the bare feet which stood before king edward what collar of chivalry is to be compared to that glorious order which you wear think sir how out of the myriad millions of our race you and some few more stand forth as exemplars of duty and honor fortunati nimium  sir said the old gentleman i did but my duty at a painful moment and tis matter of wonder to me that men talk still and glorify such a trifling matter by our ladys grace in the fair kingdom of france there are scores of thousands of men gentle and simple who would do as i did does not every sentinel at his post does not every archer in the front of battle brave it and die where his captain bids him who am i that i should be chosen out of all france to be an example of fortitude i braved no tortures though these i trust i would have endured with a good heart i was subject to threats only who was the roman knight of whom the latin clerk horatius tells  a latin clerk faith i forget my latin says mr brummell ask the parson here  messire regulus i remember was his name taken prisoner by the saracens he gave his knightly word and was permitted to go seek a ransom among his own people being unable to raise the sum that was a fitting ransom for such a knight he returned to afric and cheerfully submitted to the tortures which the paynims inflicted and tis said he took leave of his friends as gayly as though he were going to a vilage kermes or riding to his garden house in the suburb of the city  great good glorious man cried mr sterne very much moved let me embrace that gallant hand and bedew it with my tears as long as honor lasts thy name shall be remembered see this dewdrop twinkling on my check tis the sparkling tribute that sensibility pays to valor though in my life and practice i may turn from virtue believe me i never have ceased to honor her ah virtue ah sensibility oh  here mr sterne was interrupted by a monk of the order of st francis who stepped into the room and begged us all to take a pinch of his famous old rappee i suppose the snuff was very pungent for with a great start i woke up and now perceived that i must have been dreaming altogether desseins of nowadays is not the desseins which mr sterne and mr brummell and i recollect in the good old times the town of calais has bought the old hotel and dessein has gone over to quillacqs and i was there yesterday and i remember old diligences and old postilions in pigtails and jackboots who were once as alive as i am and whose cracking whips i have heard in the midnight many and many a time now where are they behold they have been ferried over styx and have passed away into limbo  i wonder what time does my boat go ah here comes the waiter bringing me my little bill     on some carp at sans souci   we have lately made the acquaintance of an old lady of ninety who has passed the last twentyfive years of her old life in a great metropolitan establishment the workhouse namely of the parish of saint lazarus staytwentythree or four years ago she came out once and thought to earn a little money by hoppicking but being overworked and having to lie out at night she got a palsy which has incapacitated her from all further labor and has caused her poor old limbs to shake ever since  an illustration of that dismal proverb which tells us how poverty makes us acquainted with strange bedfellows this poor old shaking body has to lay herself down every night in her workhouse bed by the side of some other old woman with whom she may or may not agree she herself cant be a very pleasant bedfellow poor thing with her shaking old limbs and cold feet she lies awake a deal of the night to be sure not thinking of happy old times for hers never were happy but sleepless with aches and agues and rheumatism of old age the gentleman gave me brandyandwater she said her old voice shaking with rapture at the thought i never had a great love for queen charlotte but i like her better now from what this old lady told me the queen who loved snuff herself has left a legacy of snuff to certain poorhouses and in her watchful nights this old woman takes a pinch of queen charlottes snuff and it do comfort me sir that it do pulveris exigui munus here is a forlorn aged creature shaking with palsy with no soul among the great struggling multitude of mankind to care for her not quite trampled out of life but past and forgotten in the rush made a little happy and soothed in her hours of unrest by this penny legacy let me think as i write the next months sermon thank goodness is safe to press this discourse will appear at the season when i have read that wassailbowls make their appearance at the season of pantomime turkey and sausages plumpuddings jollifications for schoolboys christmas bills and reminiscences more or less sad and sweet for elders if we oldsters are not merry we shall be having a semblance of merriment we shall see the young folks laughing round the hollybush we shall pass the bottle round cosily as we sit by the fire that old thing will have a sort of festival too beef beer and pudding will be served to her for that day also christmas falls on a thursday friday is the workhouse day for coming out mary remember that old goody twoshoes has her invitation for friday 26th december ninety is she poor old soul ah what a bonny face to catch under a mistletoe yes ninety sir she says and my mother was a hundred and my grandmother was a hundred and two  herself ninety her mother a hundred her grandmother a hundred and two what a queer calculation  ninety very good granny you were born then in 1772  your mother we will say was twentyseven when you were born and was born therefore in 1745  your grandmother was thirty when her daughter was born and was born therefore in 1715  we will begin with the present granny first my good old creature you cant of course remember but that little gentleman for whom your mother was laundress in the temple was the ingenious mr goldsmith author of a history of england the vicar of wakefield and many diverting pieces you were brought almost an infant to his chambers in brick court and he gave you some sugarcandy for the doctor was always good to children that gentleman who wellnigh smothered you by sitting down on you as you lay in a chair asleep was the learned mr s johnson whose history of rasselas you have never read my poor soul and whose tragedy of irene i dont believe any man in these kingdoms ever perused that tipsy scotch gentleman who used to come to the chambers sometimes and at whom everybody laughed wrote a more amusing book than any of the scholars your mr burke and your mr johnson and your doctor goldsmith your father often took him home in a chair to his lodgings and has done as much for parson sterne in bond street the famous wit of course my good creature you remember the gordon riots and crying no popery before mr langdales house the popish distillers and that bonny fire of my lord mansfields books in bloomsbury square bless us what a heap of illuminations you have seen for the glorious victory over the americans at breeds hill for the peace in 1814 and the beautiful chinese bridge in st jamess park for the coronation of his majesty whom you recollect as prince of wales goody dont you yes and you went in a procession of laundresses to pay your respects to his good lady the injured queen of england at brandenburg house and you remember your mother told you how she was taken to see the scotch lords executed at the tower and as for your grandmother she was born five years after the battle of malplaquet she was where her poor father was killed fighting like a bold briton for the queen with the help of a wades chronology i can make out ever so queer a history for you my poor old body and a pedigree as authentic as many in the peeragebooks  peeragebooks and pedigrees what does she know about them battles and victories treasons kings and beheadings literary gentlemen and the like what have they ever been to her granny did you ever hear of general wolfe your mother may have seen him embark and your father may have carried a musket under him your grandmother may have cried huzza for marlborough but what is the prince duke to you and did you ever so much as hear tell of his name how many hundred or thousand of years had that toad lived who was in the coal at the defunct exhibitionand yet he was not a bit better informed than toads seven or eight hundred years younger  dont talk to me your nonsense about exhibitions and prince dukes and toads in coals or coals in toads or what is it says granny i know there was a good queen charlotte for she left me snuff and it comforts me of a night when i lie awake  to me there is something very touching in the notion of that little pinch of comfort doled out to granny and gratefully inhaled by her in the darkness dont you remember what traditions there used to be of chests of plate bulses of diamonds laces of inestimable value sent out of the country privately by the old queen to enrich certain relations in mcklnbrg strltz not all the treasure went non omnis moritur a poor old palsied thing at midnight is made happy sometimes as she lifts her shaking old hand to her nose gliding noiselessly among the beds where lie the poor creatures huddled in their cheerless dormitory i fancy an old ghost with a snuffbox that does not creak there goody take of my rappee you will not sneeze and i shall not say god bless you but you will think kindly of old queen charlotte wont you ah i had a many troubles a many troubles i was a prisoner almost so much as you are i had to eat boiled mutton every day entre nous i abominated it but i never complained i swallowed it i made the best of a hard life we have all our burdens to bear but hark i hear the cockcrow and snuff the morning air and with this the royal ghost vanishes up the chimneyif there be a chimney in that dismal harem where poor old twoshoes and her companions pass their nightstheir dreary nights their restless nights their cold long nights shared in what glum companionship illumined by what a feeble taper  did i understand you my good twoshoes to say that your mother was sevenandtwenty years old when you were born and that she married your esteemed father when she herself was twentyfive 1745 then was the date of your dear mothers birth i dare say her father was absent in the low countries with his royal highness the duke of cumberland under whom he had the honor of carrying a halberd at the famous engagement of fontenoyor if not there he may have been at preston pans under general sir john cope when the wild highlanders broke through all the laws of discipline and the english lines and being on the spot did he see the famous ghost which didnt appear to colonel gardiner of the dragoons my good creature is it possible you dont remember that doctor swift sir robert walpole my lord orford as you justly say old sarah marlborough and little mr pope of twitnam died in the year of your birth what a wretched memory you have what havent they a library and the commonest books of reference at the old convent of saint lazarus where you dwell  convent of saint lazarus prince william dr swift atossa and mr pope of twitnam what is the gentleman talking about says old goody with a ho ho and a laugh like an old parrotyou know they live to be as old as methuselah parrots do and a parrot of a hundred is comparatively young ho ho ho yes and likewise carps live to an immense old age some which frederick the great fed at sans souci are there now with great humps of blue mould on their old backs and they could tell all sorts of queer stories if they chose to speakbut they are very silent carps areof their nature peu communicatives oh what has been thy long life old goody but a dole of bread and water and a perch on a cage a dreary swim round and round a lethe of a pond what are rossbach or jena to those mouldy ones and do they know it is a grandchild of england who brings bread to feed them  no those sans souci carps may live to be a thousand years old and have nothing to tell but that one day is like another and the history of friend goody twoshoes has not much more variety than theirs hard labor hard fare hard bed numbing cold all night and gnawing hunger most days that is her lot is it lawful in my prayers to say thank heaven i am not as one of these if i were eighty would i like to feel the hunger always gnawing gnawing to have to get up and make a bow when mr bumble the beadle entered the common room to have to listen to miss prim who came to give me her ideas of the next world if i were eighty i own i should not like to have to sleep with another gentleman of my own age gouty a bad sleeper kicking in his old dreams and snoring to march down my vale of years at word of command accommodating my tottering old steps to those of the other prisoners in my dingy hopeless old gang to hold out a trembling hand for a sicky pittance of gruel and say thank you maam to miss prim when she has done reading her sermon john when goody twoshoes comes next friday i desire she may not be disturbed by theological controversies you have a very fair voice and i heard you and the maids singing a hymn very sweetly the other night and was thankful that our humble household should be in such harmony poor old twoshoes is so old and toothless and quaky that she cant sing a bit but dont be giving yourself airs over her because she cant sing and you can make her comfortable at our kitchen hearth set that old kettle to sing by our hob warm her old stomach with nutbrown ale and a toast laid in the fire be kind to the poor old schoolgirl of ninety who has had leave to come out for a day of christmas holiday shall there be many more christmases for thee think of the ninety she has seen already the fourscore and ten cold cheerless nipping new years  if you were in her place would you like to have a remembrance of better early days when you were young and happy and loving perhaps or would you prefer to have no past on which your mind could rest about the year 1788 goody were your cheeks rosy and your eyes bright and did some young fellow in powder and a pigtail look in them we may grow old but to us some stories never are old on a sudden they rise up not dead but livingnot forgotten but freshly remembered the eyes gleam on us as they used to do the dear voice thrills in our hearts the rapture of the meeting the terrible terrible parting again and again the tragedy is acted over yesterday in the street i saw a pair of eyes so like two which used to brighten at my coming once that the whole past came back as i walked lonely in the rush of the strand and i was young again in the midst of joys and sorrows alike sweet and sad alike sacred and fondly remembered  if i tell a tale out of school will any harm come to my old schoolgirl once a lady gave her a halfsovereign which was a source of great pain and anxiety to goody twoshoes she sewed it away in her old stays somewhere thinking here at least was a safe investmentvestisa vestan investmentpardon me thou poor old thing but i cannot help the pleasantry and what do you think another pensionnaire of the establishment cut the coin out of goodys staysan old woman who went upon two crutches faugh the old witch what violence amongst these toothless tottering trembling feeble ones robbery amongst the penniless dogs coming and snatching lazaruss crumbs out of his lap ah how indignant goody was as she told the story to that pond at potsdam where the carps live for hundreds of hundreds of years with hunches of blue mould on their back i dare say the little prince and princess of preussenbritannien come sometimes with crumbs and cakes to feed the mouldy ones those eyes may have goggled from beneath the weeds at napoleons jackboots they have seen fredericks lean shanks reflected in their pool and perhaps monsieur de voltaire has fed themand now for a crumb of biscuit they will fight push hustle rob squabble gobble relapsing into their tranquillity when the ignoble struggle is over sans souci indeed it is mighty well writing sans souci over the gate but where is the gate through which care has not slipped she perches on the shoulders of the sentry in the sentrybox she whispers the porter sleeping in his armchair she glides up the staircase and lies down between the king and queen in their bedroyal this very night i dare say she will perch upon poor old goody twoshoess meagre bolster and whisper will the gentleman and those ladies ask me again no no they will forget poor old twoshoes goody for shame of yourself do not be cynical do not mistrust your fellowcreatures what has the christmas morning dawned upon thee ninety times for fourscore and ten years has it been thy lot to totter on this earth hungry and obscure peace and goodwill to thee let us say at this christmas season come drink eat rest awhile at our hearth thou poor old pilgrim and of the bread which gods bounty gives us i pray brother reader we may not forget to set aside a part for those noble and silent poor from whose innocent hands war has torn the means of labor enough as i hope for beef at christmas i vow a note shall be sent to saint lazarus union house in which mr roundabout requests the honor of mrs twoshoess company on friday 26th december     autour de mon chapeau   never have i seen a more noble tragic face in the centre of the forehead there was a great furrow of care towards which the brows rose piteously what a deep solemn grief in the eyes they looked blankly at the object before them but through it as it were and into the grief beyond in moments of pain have you not looked at some indifferent object so it mingles dumbly with your grief and remains afterwards connected with it in your mind it may be some indifferent thinga book which you were reading at the time when you received her farewell letter how well you remember the paragraph afterwardsthe shape of the words and their position on the page the words you were writing when your mother came in and said it was all overshe was marriedemily marriedto that insignificant little rival at whom you have laughed a hundred times in her company well well my friend and reader whoeer you beold man or young wife or maidenyou have had your griefpang boy you have lain awake the first night at school and thought of home worse still man you have parted from the dear ones with bursting heart and lonely boy recall the bolstering an unfeeling comrade gave you and lonely man just torn from your childrentheir little tokens of affection yet in your pocketpacing the deck at evening in the midst of the roaring ocean you can remember how you were told that supper was ready and how you went down to the cabin and had brandyandwater and biscuit you remember the taste of them yes for ever you took them whilst you and your grief were sitting together and your grief clutched you round the soul serpent how you have writhed round me and bitten me remorse remembrance c come in the night season and i feel you gnawing gnawing    i tell you that mans face was like laocoons which by the way i always think overrated the real head is at brussels at the duke darembergs not at rome  that man what man that man of whom i said that his magnificent countenance exhibited the noblest tragic woe he was not of european blood he was handsome but not of european beauty his face whitenot of a northern whiteness his eyes protruding somewhat and rolling in their grief those eyes had seen the orient sun and his beak was the eagles his lips were full the beard curling round them was unkempt and tawny the locks were of a deep deep coppery red the hands swart and powerful accustomed to the rough grasp of the wares in which he dealt seemed unused to the flimsy artifices of the bath he came from the wilderness and its sands were on his robe his cheek his tattered sandal and the hardy foot it covered  and his griefwhence came his sorrow i will tell you he bore it in his hand he had evidently just concluded the compact by which it became his his business was that of a purchaser of domestic raiment at early dawn nay at what hour when the city is alivedo we not all hear the nasal cry of clo in paris habits galons marchand dhabits is the twanging signal with which the wandering merchant makes his presence known it was in paris i saw this man where else have i not seen him in the roman ghettoat the gate of david in his fathers once imperial city the man i mean was an itinerant vender and purchaser of wardrobeswhat you call an    enough you know his name  on his left shoulder hung his bag and he held in that hand a white hat which i am sure he had just purchased and which was the cause of the grief which smote his noble features of course i cannot particularize the sum but he had given too much for that hat he felt he might have got the thing for less money it was not the amount i am sure it was the principle involved he had given fourpence let us say for that which threepence would have purchased he had been done and a manly shame was upon him that he whose energy acuteness experience point of honor should have made him the victor in any mercantile duel in which he should engage had been overcome by a porters wife who very likely sold him the old hat or by a student who was tired of it i can understand his grief do i seem to be speaking of it in a disrespectful or flippant way then you mistake me he had been outwitted he had desired coaxed schemed haggled got what he wanted and now found he had paid too much for his bargain you dont suppose i would ask you to laugh at that mans grief it is you clumsy cynic who are disposed to sneer whilst it may be tears of genuine sympathy are trickling down this nose of mine what do you mean by laughing if you saw a wounded soldier on the field of battle would you laugh if you saw a ewe robbed of her lamb would you laugh you brute it is you who are the cynic and have no feeling and you sneer because that grief is unintelligible to you which touches my finer sensibility the oldclothesman had been defeated in one of the daily battles of his most interesting chequered adventurous life  have you ever figured to yourself what such a life must be the pursuit and conquest of twopence must be the most eager and fascinating of occupations we might all engage in that business if we would do not whistplayers for example toil and think and lose their temper over sixpenny points they bring study natural genius long forethought memory and careful historical experience to bear upon their favorite labor dont tell me that it is the sixpenny points and five shillings the rub which keeps them for hours over their painted pasteboard it is the desire to conquer hours pass by night glooms dawn it may be rises unheeded and they sit calling for fresh cards at the portland or the union while waning candles splutter in the sockets and languid waiters snooze in the anteroom sol rises jones has lost four pounds brown has won two robinson lurks away to his family house and mayhap indignant mrs r hours of evening night morning have passed away whilst they have been waging this sixpenny battle what is the loss of four pounds to jones the gain of two to brown b is perhaps so rich that two pounds more or less are as naught to him j is so hopelessly involved that to win four pounds cannot benefit his creditors or alter his condition but they play for that stake they put forward their best energies they ruff finesse what are the technical words and how do i know it is but a sixpenny game if you like but they want to win it so as regards my friend yonder with the hat he stakes his money he wishes to win the game not the hat merely i am not prepared to say that he is not inspired by a noble ambition caesar wished to be first in a village if first of a hundred yokels why not first of two and my friend the oldclothesman wishes to win his game as well as to turn his little sixpence  suppose in the game of lifeand it is but a twopenny game after allyou are equally eager of winning shall you be ashamed of your ambition or glory in it there are games too which are becoming to particular periods of life i remember in the days of our youth when my friend arthur bowler was an eminent cricketer slim swift strong wellbuilt he presented a goodly appearance on the ground in his flannel uniform militasti non sine gloria bowler my boy hush we tell no tales mum is the word yonder comes chancy his son now chancy his son has taken the field and is famous among the eleven of his school bowler senior with his capacious waistcoat c waddling after a ball would present an absurd object whereas it does the eyes good to see bowler junior scouring the plaina young exemplar of joyful health vigor activity the old boy wisely contents himself with amusements more becoming his age and waist takes his sober ride visits his farm soberlybusies himself about his pigs his ploughing his peaches or what not very small routinier amusements interest him and thank goodness nature provides very kindly for kindlydisposed fogies we relish those things which we scorned in our lusty youth i see the young folks of an evening kindling and glowing over their delicious novels i look up and watch the eager eye flashing down the page being for my part perfectly contented with my twaddling old volume of howels letters or the gentlemans magazine i am actually arrived at such a calm frame of mind that i like batterpudding i never should have believed it possible but it is so yet a little while and i may relish watergruel it will be the age of mon lait de poule et mon bonnet de nuit and thenthe cotton extinguisher is pulled over the old noddle and the little flame of life is popped out  dont you know elderly people who make learned notes in army lists peerages and the like this is the batterpudding watergruel of old age the wornout old digestion does not care for stronger food formerly it could swallow twelvehours tough reading and digest an encyclopaedia  if i had children to educate i would at ten or twelve years of age have a professor or professoress of whist for them and cause them to be well grounded in that great and useful game you cannot learn it well when you are old any more than you can learn dancing or billiards in our house at home we youngsters did not play whist because we were dear obedient children and the elders said playing at cards was a waste of time a waste of time my good people allons what do elderly homekeeping people do of a night after dinner darby gets his newspaper my dear joan her missionary magazine or her volume of cummings sermonsand dont you know what ensues over the arm of darbys armchair the paper flutters to the ground unheeded and he performs the trumpet obligato que vous savez on his old nose my dear old joans head nods over her sermon awakening though the doctrine may be ding ding ding can that be ten oclock it is time to send the servants to bed my dearand to bed master and mistress go too but they have not wasted their time playing at cards oh no i belong to a club where there is whist of a night and not a little amusing is it to hear brown speak of thompsons play and vice versa but there is one mangreatorex let us call himwho is the acknowledged captain and primus of all the whistplayers we all secretly admire him i for my part watch him in private life hearken to what he says note what he orders for dinner and have that feeling of awe for him that i used to have as a boy for the cock of the school not play at whist quelle triste vieillesse vous vous preparez were the words of the great and good bishop of autun i cant it is too late now too late too late ah humiliating confession that joy might have been clutched but the lifestream has swept us by itthe swift lifestream rushing to the nearing sea too late too late twentystone my boy when you read in the papers valse a deux temps and all the fashionable dances taught to adults by miss lightfoots dont you feel that you would like to go in and learn ah it is too late you have passed the choreas master twentystone and the young people are dancing without you  i dont believe much of what my lord byron the poet says but when he wrote so for a good old gentlemanly vice i think i shall put up with avarice i think his lordship meant what he wrote and if he practised what he preached shall not quarrel with him as an occupation in declining years i declare i think saving is useful amusing and not unbecoming it must be a perpetual amusement it is a game that can be played by day by night at home and abroad and at which you must win in the long run i am tired and want a cab the fare to my house say is two shillings the cabman will naturally want half a crown i pull out my book i show him the distance is exactly three miles and fifteen hundred and ninety yards i offer him my cardmy winning card as he retires with the two shillings blaspheming inwardly every curse is a compliment to my skill i have played him and beat him and a sixpence is my spoil and just reward this is a game by the way which women play far more cleverly than we do but what an interest it imparts to life during the whole drive home i know i shall have my game at the journeys end am sure of my hand and shall beat my adversary or i can play in another way i wont have a cab at all i will wait for the omnibus i will be one of the damp fourteen in that steaming vehicle i will wait about in the rain for an hour and bus after bus shall pass but i will not be beat i will have a place and get it at length with my boots wet through and an umbrella dripping between my legs i have a rheumatism a cold a sore throat a sulky eveninga doctors bill tomorrow perhaps yes but i have won my game and am gainer of a shilling on this rubber  if you play this game all through life it is wonderful what daily interest it has and amusing occupation for instance my wife goes to sleep after dinner over her volume of sermons as soon as the dear soul is sound asleep i advance softly and puff out her candle her pure dreams will be all the happier without that light and say she sleeps an hour there is a penny gained  as for clothes parbleu there is not much money to be saved in clothes for the fact is as a man advances in lifeas he becomes an ancient briton mark the pleasantryhe goes without clothes when my tailor proposes something in the way of a change of raiment i laugh in his face my blue coat and brass buttons will last these ten years it is seedy what then i dont want to charm anybody in particular you say that my clothes are shabby what do i care when i wished to look well in somebodys eyes the matter may have been different but now when i receive my bill of 10l let us say at the years end and contrast it with old tailors reckonings i feel that i have played the game with master tailor and beat him and my old clothes are a token of the victory  i do not like to give servants boardwages though they are cheaper than household bills but i know they save out of boardwages and so beat me this shows that it is not the money but the game which interests me so about wine i have it good and dear i will trouble you to tell me where to get it good and cheap you may as well give me the address of a shop where i can buy meat for fourpence a pound or sovereigns for fifteen shillings apiece at the game of auctions docks shy winemerchants depend on it there is no winning and i would as soon think of buying jewellery at an auction in fleet street as of purchasing wine from one of your dreadful needy wineagents such as infest every mans door grudge myself good wine as soon grudge my horse corn merci that would be a very losing game indeed and your humble servant has no relish for such  but in the very pursuit of saving there must be a hundred harmless delights and pleasures which we who are careless necessarily forego what do you know about the natural history of your household upon your honor and conscience do you know the price of a pound of butter can you say what sugar costs and how much your family consumes and ought to consume how much lard do you use in your house as i think on these subjects i own i hang down the head of shame i suppose for a moment that you who are reading this are a middleaged gentleman and paterfamilias can you answer the above questions you know sir you cannot now turn round lay down the book and suddenly ask mrs jones and your daughters if they can answer they cannot they look at one another they pretend they can answer they can tell you the plot and principal characters of the last novel some of them know something about history geology and so forth but of the natural history of homenichts and for shame on you all honnis soyez for shame on you for shame on us  in the early morning i hear a sort of call or jodel under my window and know tis the matutinal milkman leaving his can at my gate o household gods have i lived all these years and dont know the price or the quantity of the milk which is delivered in that can why dont i know as i live if i live till tomorrow morning as soon as i hear the call of lactantius i will dash out upon him how many cows how much milk on an average all the year round what rent what cost of food and dairy servants what loss of animals and average cost of purchase if i interested myself properly about my pint or hogshead whatever it be of milk all this knowledge would ensue all this additional interest in life what is this talk of my friend mr lewes about objects at the seaside and so forth objects at the seaside objects at the areabell objects before my nose objects which the butcher brings me in his tray which the cook dresses and puts down before me and over which i say grace my daily life is surrounded with objects which ought to interest me the pudding i eat or refuse that is neither here nor there and between ourselves what i have said about batterpudding may be taken cum granowe are not come to that yet except for the sake of argument or illustrationthe pudding i say on my plate the eggs that made it the fire that cooked it the tablecloth on which it is laid and so forthare each and all of these objects a knowledge of which i may acquirea knowledge of the cost and production of which i might advantageously learn to the man who does know these things i say the interest of life is prodigiously increased the milkman becomes a study to him the baker a being he curiously and tenderly examines go lewes and clap a hideous seaanemone into a glass i will put a cabman under mine and make a vivisection of a butcher o lares penates and gentle household gods teach me to sympathize with all that comes within my doors give me an interest in the butchers book let me look forward to the ensuing number of the grocers account with eagerness it seems ungrateful to my kitchenchimney not to know the cost of sweeping it and i trust that many a man who reads this and muses on it will feel like the writer ashamed of himself and hang down his head humbly        seaside studies  by g h lewes  now if to this household game you could add a little money interest the amusement would be increased far beyond the mere money value as a game at cards for sixpence is better than a rubber for nothing if you can interest yourself about sixpence all life is invested with a new excitement from sunrise to sleeping you can always be playing that gamewith butcher baker coalmerchant cabman omnibus mannay diamond merchant and stockbroker you can bargain for a guinea over the price of a diamond necklace or for a sixteenth per cent in a transaction at the stock exchange we all know men who have this faculty who are not ungenerous with their money they give it on great occasions they are more able to help than you and i who spend ours and say to poor prodigal who comes to us out at elbow my dear fellow i should have been delighted but i have already anticipated my quarter and am going to ask screwby if he can do anything for me  in this delightful wholesome evernovel twopenny game there is a danger of excess as there is in every other pastime or occupation of life if you grow too eager for your twopence the acquisition or the loss of it may affect your peace of mind and peace of mind is better than any amount of twopences my friend the oldclothesman whose agonies over the hat have led to this rambling disquisition has i very much fear by a too eager pursuit of small profits disturbed the equanimity of a mind that ought to be easy and happy had i stood out he thinks i might have had the hat for threepence and he doubts whether having given fourpence for it he will ever get back his money my good shadrach if you go through life passionately deploring the irrevocable and allow yesterdays transactions to embitter the cheerfulness of today and tomorrowas lief walk down to the seine souse in hats body clothesbag and all and put an end to your sorrow and sordid cares before and since mr franklin wrote his pretty apologue of the whistle have we not all made bargains of which we repented and coveted and acquired objects for which we have paid too dearly who has not purchased his hat in some market or other there is general mclellans cocked hat for example i dare say he was eager enough to wear it and he has learned that it is by no means cheerful wear there were the military beavers of messeigneurs of orleans they wore them gallantly in the face of battle but i suspect they were glad enough to pitch them into the james river and come home in mufti ah mes amis a chacun son schakot i was looking at a bishop the other day and thinking my right reverend lord that broadbrim and rosette must bind your great broad forehead very tightly and give you many a headache a good easy wideawake were better for you and i would like to see that honest face with a cuttypipe in the middle of it there is my lord mayor my once dear lord my kind friend when your two years reign was over did not you jump for joy and fling your chapeaubras out of window and hasnt that hat cost you a pretty bit of money there in a splendid travelling chariot in the sweetest bonnet all trimmed with orangeblossoms and chantilly lace sits my lady rosa with old lord snowden by her side ah rosa what a price have you paid for that hat which you wear and is your ladyships coronet not purchased too dear enough of hats sir or madam i take off mine and salute you with profound respect        two cadets of the house of orleans who served as volunteers under      general mclellan in his campaign against richmond     on alexandrines  a letter to some country cousins        this paper it is almost needless to say was written just      after the marriage of the prince and princess of wales in      march 1863  dear cousinsbe pleased to receive herewith a packet of mayalls photographs and copies of illustrated news illustrated times london review queen and observer each containing an account of the notable festivities of the past week if besides these remembrances of home you have a mind to read a letter from an old friend behold here it is when i was at school having left my parents in india a goodnatured captain or colonel would come sometimes and see us indian boys and talk to us about papa and mamma and give us coins of the realm and write to our parents and say i drove over yesterday and saw tommy at dr birchs i took him to the george and gave him a dinner his appetite is fine he states that he is reading cornelius nepos with which he is much interested his masters report c and though dr birch wrote by the same mail a longer fuller and official statement i have no doubt the distant parents preferred the friends letter with its artless possibly ungrammatical account of their little darling  i have seen the young heir of britain these eyes have beheld him and his bride on saturday in pall mall and on tuesday in the nave of st georges chapel at windsor when the young princess alexandra of denmark passed by with her blooming procession of bridesmaids and half an hour later when the princess of wales came forth from the chapel her husband by her side robed in the purple mantle of the famous order which his forefather established here five hundred years ago we were to see her yet once again when her open carriage passed out of the castle gate to the station of the near railway which was to convey her to southampton  since womankind existed has any woman ever had such a greeting at ten hours distance there is a city far more magnificent than ours with every respect for kensington turnpike i own that the arc de letoile at paris is a much finer entrance to an imperial capital in our black orderless zigzag streets we can show nothing to compare with the magnificent array of the rue de rivoli that enormous regiment of stone stretching for five miles and presenting arms before the tuileries think of the late fleet prison and waithmans obelisk and of the place de la concorde and the luxor stone the finest site in europe as trafalgar square has been called by some obstinate british optimist is disfigured by trophies fountains columns and statues so puerile disorderly and hideous that a lover of the arts must hang the head of shame as he passes to see our dear old queen city arraying herself so absurdly but when all is said and done we can show one or two of the greatest sights in the world i doubt if any roman festival was as vast or striking as the derby day or if any imperial triumph could show such a prodigious muster of faithful people as our young princess saw on saturday when the nation turned out to greet her the calculators are squabbling about the numbers of hundreds of thousands of millions who came forth to see her and bid her welcome imagine beacons flaming rockets blazing yards manned ships and forts saluting with their thunder every steamer and vessel every town and village from ramsgate to gravesend swarming with happy gratulation young girls with flowers scattering roses before her staid citizens and aldermen pushing and squeezing and panting to make the speech and bow the knee and bid her welcome who is this who is honored with such a prodigious triumph and received with a welcome so astonishing a year ago we had never heard of her i think about her pedigree and family not a few of us are in the dark still and i own for my part to be much puzzled by the allusions of newspaper genealogists and bards and skalds to vikings berserkers and so forth but it would be interesting to know how many hundreds of thousands of photographs of the fair bright face have by this time made it beloved and familiar in british homes think of all the quiet country nooks from lands end to caithness where kind eyes have glanced at it the farmer brings it home from market the curate from his visit to the cathedral town the rustic folk peer at it in the little village shopwindow the squires children gaze on it round the drawingroom table every eye that beholds it looks tenderly on its bright beauty and sweet artless grace and young and old pray god bless her we have an elderly friend a certain goody twoshoes who inhabits with many other old ladies the union house of the parish of st lazarus in soho one of your cousins from this house went to see her and found goody and her companion crones all in a flutter of excitement about the marriage the whitewashed walls of their bleak dormitory were ornamented with prints out of the illustrated journals and hung with festoons and truelovers knots of tape and colored paper and the old bodies had had a good dinner and the old tongues were chirping and clacking away all eager interested sympathizing and one very elderly and rheumatic goody who is obliged to keep her bed and has i trust an exaggerated idea of the cares attending on royalty said pore thing pore thing i pity her yes even in that dim place there was a little brightness and a quavering huzza a contribution of a mite subscribed by those dozen poor old widows to the treasure of loyalty with which the nation endows the princes bride  three hundred years ago when our dread sovereign lady elizabeth came to take possession of her realm and capital city holingshed if you please whose pleasing history of course you carry about with you relates in his fourth volume folio thatat hir entring the citie she was of the people received maruellous intierlie as appeared by the assemblies praiers welcommings cries and all other signes which argued a woonderfull earnest loue and at various haltingplaces on the royal progress children habited like angels appeared out of allegoric edifices and spoke verses to her          welcome o queen as much as heart can think            welcome again as much as tongue can tell          welcome to joyous tongues and hearts that will not shrink            god thee preserve we pray and wish thee ever well  our new princess you may be sure has also had her alexandrines and many minstrels have gone before her singing her praises mr tupper who begins in very great force and strength and who proposes to give her no less than eight hundred thousand welcomes in the first twenty lines of his ode is not satisfied with this most liberal amount of acclamation but proposes at the end of his poem a still more magnificent subscription thus we begin a hundred thousand welcomes a hundred thousand welcomes in my copy the figures are in the wellknown arabic numerals but let us have the numbers literally accurate           a hundred thousand welcomes           a hundred thousand welcomes             and a hundred thousand more           o happy heart of england           shout aloud and sing laud           as no land sang before           and let the paeans soar           and ring from shore to shore           a hundred thousand welcomes           and a hundred thousand more             and let the cannons roar             the joystunned city oer           and let the steeples chime it           a hundred thousand welcomes           and a hundred thousand more             and let the people rhyme it             from neighbors door to door             from every mans hearts core           a hundred thousand welcomes           and a hundred thousand more  this contribution in twenty not long lines of 900000 say nine hundred thousand welcomes is handsome indeed and shows that when our bard is inclined to be liberal he does not look to the cost but what is a sum of 900000 to his further proposal           o let all these declare it           let miles of shouting swear it             in all the years of yore             unparalleled before           and thou most welcome wandrer             across the northern water           our englands alexandra             our dear adopted daughter     lay to thine heart           conned oer and oer             in future years remembered well             the magic fervor of this spell           that shakes the land from shore to shore           and makes all hearts and eyes brim oer             our hundred thousand welcomes             our fifty million welcomes           and a hundred million more  here we have besides the most liberal previous subscription a further call on the public for no less than one hundred and fifty million one hundred thousand welcomes for her royal highness how much is this per head for all of us in the three kingdoms not above five welcomes apiece and i am sure many of us have given more than five hurrahs to the fair young princess  each man sings according to his voice

assuredly our fair princess will shed many tears out of the dovelike eyes or the heart will be little worth is she to know no parting no care no anxious longing no tender watches by the sick to deplore no friends and kindred and feel no grief heaven forbid when a bard or wildered minstrel writes so best accept his own confession that he is losing his head on the day of her entrance into london who looked more bright and happy than the princess on the day of the marriage the fair face wore its marks of care already and looked out quite grave and frightened almost under the wreaths and lace and orangeflowers would you have had her feel no tremor a maiden on the bridegrooms threshold a princess led up to the steps of a throne i think her pallor and doubt became her as well as her smiles that i can tell you was our vote who sat in x compartment let us say in the nave of st georges chapel at windsor and saw a part of one of the brightest ceremonies ever performed there  my dear cousin mary you have an account of the dresses and i promise you there were princesses besides the bride whom it did the eyes good to behold around the bride sailed a bevy of young creatures so fair white and graceful that i thought of those fairytale beauties who are sometimes princesses and sometimes white swans the royal princesses and the royal knights of the garter swept by in prodigious robes and trains of purple velvet thirty shillings a yard my dear not of course including the lining which i have no doubt was of the richest satin or that costly miniver which we used to read about in poor jerrolds writings the young princes were habited in kilts and by the side of the princess royal trotted such a little wee solemn highlander he is the young heir and chief of the famous clan of brandenburg his eyrie is amongst the eagles and i pray no harm may befall the dear little chieftain  the heralds in their tabards were marvellous to behold and a nod from rouge croix gave me the keenest gratification i tried to catch garters eye but either i couldnt or he wouldnt in his robes he is like one of the three kings in old missal illuminations goldstick in waiting is even more splendid with his gold rod and robes and trappings of many colors he looks like a royal enchanter and as if he had raised up all this scene of glamour by a wave of his glittering wand the silver trumpeters wear such quaint caps as those i have humbly tried to depict on the playful heads of children behind the trumpeters came a drumbearer on whose back a goldlaced drummer drubbed his march  when the silver clarions had blown and under a clear chorus of whiterobed children chanting round the organ the noble procession passed into the chapel and was hidden from our sight for a while there was silence or from the inner chapel ever so faint a hum then hymns arose and in the lull we knew that prayers were being said and the sacred rite performed which joined albert edward to alexandra his wife i am sure hearty prayers were offered outside the gate as well as within for that princely young pair and for their mother and queen the peace the freedom the happiness the order which her rule guarantees are part of my birthright as an englishman and i bless god for my share where else shall i find such liberty of action thought speech or laws which protect me so well her part of her compact with her people what sovereign ever better performed if ours sits apart from the festivities of the day it is because she suffers from a grief so recent that the loyal heart cannot master it as yet and remains treu und fest to a beloved memory a part of the music which celebrates the days service was composed by the husband who is gone to the place where the just and pure of life meet the reward promised by the father of all of us to good and faithful servants who have well done here below as this one gives in his account surely we may remember how the prince was the friend of all peaceful arts and learning how he was true and fast always to duty home honor how through a life of complicated trials he was sagacious righteous active and selfdenying and as we trace in the young faces of his many children the fathers features and likeness what englishman will not pray that they may have inherited also some of the great qualities which won for the prince consort the love and respect of our country  the papers tell us how on the night of the marriage of the prince of wales all over england and scotland illuminations were made the poor and children were feasted and in village and city thousands of kindly schemes were devised to mark the national happiness and sympathy the bonfire on coptpoint at folkestone was seen in france the telegraph says more clearly than even the french marine lights could be seen at folkestone long may the fire continue to burn there are european coasts and inland places where the liberty light has been extinguished or is so low that you cant see to read by itthere are great atlantic shores where it flickers and smokes very gloomily let us be thankful to the honest guardians of ours and for the kind sky under which it burns bright and steady     on a medal of george the fourth   before me lies a coin bearing the image and superscription of king george iv and of the nominal value of twoandsixpence but an official friend at a neighboring turnpike says the piece is hopelessly bad and a chemist tested it returning a like unfavorable opinion a cabman who had brought me from a club left it with the club porter appealing to the gent who gave it a pore cabby at ever so much oclock of a rainy night which he hoped he would give him another i have taken that cabman at his word he has been provided with a sound coin the bad piece is on the table before me and shall have a hole drilled through it as soon as this essay is written by a loyal subject who does not desire to deface the sovereigns image but to protest against the rascal who has taken his name in vain fid def indeed is this what you call defending the faith you dare to forge your sovereigns name and pass your scoundrel pewter as his silver i wonder who you are wretch and most consummate trickster this forgery is so complete that even now i am deceived by iti cant see the difference between the base and sterling metal perhaps this piece is a little lighteri dont know a little softeris it i have not bitten it not being a connoisseur in the tasting of pewter or silver i take the word of three honest men though it goes against me and though i have given twoandsixpence worth of honest consideration for the counter i shall not attempt to implicate anybody else in my misfortune or transfer my illluck to a deluded neighbor  i say the imitation is so curiously successful the stamping milling of the edges lettering and so forth are so neat that even now when my eyes are open i cannot see the cheat how did those experts the cabman and pikeman and tradesman come to find it out how do they happen to be more familiar with pewter and silver than i am you see i put out of the question another point which i might argue without fear of defeat namely the cabmans statement that i gave him this bad piece of money suppose every cabman who took me a shilling fare were to drive away and return presently with a bad coin and an assertion that i had given it to him this would be absurd and mischievous an encouragement of vice amongst men who already are subject to temptations being homo i think if i were a cabman myself i might sometimes stretch a furlong or two in my calculation of distance but dont come twice my man and tell me i have given you a bad halfcrown no no i have paid once like a gentleman and once is enough for instance during the exhibition time i was stopped by an old countrywoman in black with a huge umbrella who bursting into tears said to me master be this the way to harlow in essex this the way to harlow this is the way to exeter my good lady and you will arrive there if you walk about 170 miles in your present direction i answered courteously replying to the old creature then she fell asobbing as though her old heart would break she had a daughter adying at harlow she had walked already vifty dree mile that day tears stopped the rest of her discourse so artless genuine and abundant thati own the truthi gave her in i believe genuine silver a piece of the exact size of that coin which forms the subject of this essay well about a month since near to the very spot where i had met my old woman i was accosted by a person in black a person in a large draggled cap a person with a huge umbrella who was beginning i say master can you tell me if this be the way to har but here she stopped her eyes goggled wildly she started from me as macbeth turned from macduff she would not engage with me it was my old friend of harlow in essex i dare say she has informed many other people of her daughters illness and her anxiety to be put upon the right way to harlow not long since a very gentlemanlike man major delamere let us call him i like the title of major very much requested to see me named a dead gentleman who he said had been our mutual friend and on the strength of this mutual acquaintance begged me to cash his cheque for five pounds  it is these things my dear sir which serve to make a man cynical i do conscientiously believe that had i cashed the majors cheque there would have been a difficulty about payment on the part of the respected bankers on whom he drew on your honor and conscience do you think that old widow who was walking from tunbridge wells to harlow had a daughter ill and was an honest woman at all the daughter couldnt always you see be being ill and her mother on her way to her dear child through hyde park in the same way some habitual sneerers may be inclined to hint that the cabmans story was an inventionor at any rate choose to ride off so to speak on the doubt no my opinion i own is unfavorable as regards the widow from tunbridge wells and major delamere but believing the cabman was honest i am glad to think he was not injured by the readers most humble servant  what a queer exciting life this rogues march must be this attempt of the bad halfcrowns to get into circulation had my distinguished friend the major knocked at many doors that morning before operating on mine the sport must be something akin to the pleasure of tiger or elephant hunting what ingenuity the sportsman must have in tracing his preywhat daring and caution in coming upon him what coolness in facing the angry animal for after all a man on whom you draw a cheque a bout portant will be angry what a delicious thrill of triumph if you can bring him down if i have money at the bankers and draw for a portion of it over the counter that is mere proseany dolt can do that but having no balance say i drive up in a cab present a cheque at couttss and receiving the amount drive off what a glorious mornings sport that has been how superior in excitement to the common transactions of everyday life    i must tell a story it is against myself i know but it will out and perhaps my mind will be the easier  more than twenty years ago in an island remarkable for its verdure i met four or five times one of the most agreeable companions with whom i have passed a night i heard that evil times had come upon this gentleman and overtaking him in a road near my own house one evening i asked him to come home to dinner in two days he was at my door again at breakfasttime was this second appearance he was in a cab of course he was in a cab they always are these unfortunate these courageous men to deny myself was absurd my friend could see me over the parlor blinds surrounded by my family and cheerfully partaking of the morning meal might he have a word with me and can you imagine its purport by the most provoking delay his uncle the admiral not being able to come to town till fridaywould i cash him a cheque i need not say it would be paid on saturday without fail i tell you that man went away with money in his pocket and i regret to add that his gallant relative has not come to town yet  laying down the pen and sinking back in my chair here perhaps i fall into a five minutes reverie and think of one two three half a dozen cases in which i have been content to accept that sham promissory coin in return for sterling money advanced not a reader whatever his age but could tell a like story i vow and believe there are men of fifty who will dine well today who have not paid their school debts yet and who have not taken up their longprotested promises to pay tom dick harry my boys i owe you no grudge and rather relish that wince with which you will read these meek lines and say he means me poor jack in hades do you remember a certain pecuniary transaction and a little sum of money you borrowed until the meeting of parliament parliament met often in your lifetime parliament has met since but i think i should scarce be more surprised if your ghost glided into the room now and laid down the amount of our little account than i should have been if you had paid me in your lifetime with the actual acceptances of the bank of england you asked to borrow but you never intended to pay i would as soon have believed that a promissory note of sir john falstaff accepted by messrs bardolph and nym and payable in aldgate would be as sure to find payment as that note of the departednay lamentedjack thriftless  he who borrows meaning to pay is quite a different person from the individual here described manymost i hopetook jacks promise for what it was worthand quite well knew that when he said lend me he meant give me twenty pounds give me change for this halfcrown said jack i know its a pewter piece and you gave him the change in honest silver and pocketed the counterfeit gravely  what a queer consciousness that must be which accompanies such a man in his sleeping in his waking in his walk through life by his fireside with his children round him for what we are going to receive che says grace before his dinner my dears shall i help you to some mutton i robbed the butcher of the meat i dont intend to pay him johnson my boy a glass of champagne very good isnt it not too sweet fortysix i get it from soandso whom i intend to cheat as eagles go forth and bring home to their eaglets the lamb or the pavid kid i say there are men who live and victual their nests by plunder we all know highway robbers in white neckcloths domestic bandits marauders passers of bad coin what was yonder cheque which major delamere proposed i should cash but a piece of bad money what was jack thriftlesss promise to pay having got his booty i fancy jack or the major returning home and wife and children gathering round about him poor wife and children they respect papa very likely they dont know he is false coin maybe the wife has a dreadful inkling of the truth and sickening tries to hide it from the daughters and sons maybe she is an accomplice herself a brazen forgery if turpin and jack sheppard were married very likely mesdames sheppard and turpin did not know at first what their husbands real profession was and fancied when the men left home in the morning they only went away to follow some regular and honorable business then a suspicion of the truth may have come then a dreadful revelation and presently we have the guilty pair robbing together or passing forged money each on his own account you know doctor dodd i wonder whether his wife knows that he is a forger and scoundrel has she had any of the plunder think you and were the darling childrens new dresses bought with it the doctors sermon last sunday was certainly charming and we all cried ah my poor dodd whilst he is preaching most beautifully pockethandkerchief in hand he is peering over the pulpit cushions looking out piteously for messrs peachum and lockit from the policeoffice by doctor dodd you understand i would typify the rogue of respectable exterior not committed to gaol yet but not undiscovered we all know one or two such this very sermon perhaps will be read by some or more likelyfor depend upon it your solemn hypocritic scoundrels dont care much for light literaturemore likely i say this discourse will be read by some of their wives who think ah mercy does that horrible cynical wretch know how my poor husband blacked my eye or abstracted mammas silver teapot or forced me to write soandsos name on that piece of stamped paper or what not my good creature i am not angry with you if your husband has broken your nose you will vow that he had authority over your person and a right to demolish any part of it if he has conveyed away your mammas teapot you will say that she gave it to him at your marriage and it was very ugly and what not if he takes your aunts watch and you love him you will carry it ere long to the pawnbrokers and perjure yourselfoh how you will perjure yourselfin the witnessbox i know this is a degrading view of womans noble nature her exalted mission and so forth and so forth i know you will say this is bad morality is it do you or do you not expect your womankind to stick by you for better or for worse say i have committed a forgery and the officers come in search of me is my wife mrs dodd to show them into the diningroom and say pray step in gentlemen my husband has just come home from church that bill with my lord chesterfields acceptance i am bound to own was never written by his lordship and the signature is in the doctors handwriting i say would any man of sense or honor or fine feeling praise his wife for telling the truth under such circumstances suppose she made a fine grimace and said most painful as my position is most deeply as i feel for my william yet truth must prevail and i deeply lament to state that the beloved partner of my life did commit the flagitious act with which he is charged and is at this present moment located in the twopair back up the chimney whither it is my duty to lead you why even dodd himself who was one of the greatest humbugs who ever lived would not have had the face to say that he approved of his wife telling the truth in such a case would you have had flora macdonald beckon the officers saying this way gentlemen you will find the young chevalier asleep in that cavern or dont you prefer her to be splendide mendax and ready at all risks to save him if ever i lead a rebellion and my women betray me may i be hanged but i will not forgive them and if ever i steal a teapot and my women dont stand up for me pass the article under their shawls whisk down the street with it outbluster the policeman and utter any amount of fibs before mr beak those beings are not what i take them to be andfor a fortunei wont give them so much as a bad halfcrown  is conscious guilt a source of unmixed pain to the bosom which harbors it has not your criminal on the contrary an excitement an enjoyment within quite unknown to you and me who never did anything wrong in our lives the housebreaker must snatch a fearful joy as he walks unchallenged by the policeman with his sack full of spoons and tankards do not cracksmen when assembled together entertain themselves with stories of glorious old burglaries which they or bygone heroes have committed but that my age is mature and my habits formed i should really just like to try a little criminality fancy passing a forged bill to your banker calling on a friend and sweeping his sideboard of plate his hall of umbrellas and coats and then going home to dress for dinner sayand to meet a bishop a judge and a police magistrate or so and talk more morally than any man at table how i should chuckle as my hosts spoons clinked softly in my pocket whilst i was uttering some noble speech about virtue duty charity i wonder do we meet garroters in society in an average teaparty now how many returned convicts are there does john footman when he asks permission to go and spend the evening with some friends pass his time in thuggee waylay and strangle an old gentleman or two let himself into your house with the housekey of course and appear as usual with the shavingwater when you ring your bell in the morning the very possibility of such a suspicion invests john with a new and romantic interest in my mind behind the grave politeness of his countenance i try and read the lurking treason full of this pleasing subject i have been talking thiefstories with a neighbor the neighbor tells me how some friends of hers used to keep a jewelbox under a bed in their room and going into the room they thought they heard a noise under the bed they had the courage to look the cook was under the bedunder the bed with the jewelbox of course she said she had come for purposes connected with her business but this was absurd a cook under a bed is not there for professional purposes a relation of mine had a box containing diamonds under her bed which diamonds she told me were to be mine mine one day at dinnertime between the entrees and the roast a cab drove away from my relatives house containing the box wherein lay the diamonds john laid the dessert brought the coffee waited all the eveningand oh how frightened he was when he came to learn that his mistresss box had been conveyed out of her own room and it contained diamondslaw bless us did it now i wonder whether johns subsequent career has been prosperous perhaps the gentlemen from bow street were all in the wrong when they agreed in suspecting john as the author of the robbery his noble nature was hurt at the suspicion you conceive he would not like to remain in a family where they were mean enough to suspect him of stealing a jewelbox out of a bedroomand the injured man and my relatives soon parted but inclining with my usual cynicism to think that he did steal the valuables think of his life for the month or two whilst he still remains in the service he shows the officers over the house agrees with them that the coup must have been made by persons familiar with it gives them every assistance pities his master and mistress with a manly compassion points out what a cruel misfortune it is to himself as an honest man with his living to get and his family to provide for that this suspicion should fall on him finally he takes leave of his place with a deep though natural melancholy that ever he had accepted it whats a thousand pounds to gentlefolks a loss certainly but they will live as well without the diamonds as with them but to john his hhhonor was worth more than diamonds his hhonor was whohever is to give him back his character who is to prevent hany one from saying ho yes this is the footman which was in the family where the diamonds was stole c  i wonder has john prospered in life subsequently if he is innocent he does not interest me in the least the interest of the case lies in johns behavior supposing him to be guilty imagine the smiling face the daily service the orderly performance of duty whilst within john is suffering pangs lest discovery should overtake him every bell of the door which he is obliged to open may bring a police officer the accomplices may peach what an exciting life johns must have been for a while and now years and years after when pursuit has long ceased and detection is impossible does he ever revert to the little transaction is it possible those diamonds cost a thousand pounds what a rogue the fence must have been who only gave him so and so and i pleasingly picture to myself an old exfootman and an ancient receiver of stolen goods meeting and talking over this matter which dates from times so early that her present majestys fair image could only just have begun to be coined or forged  i choose to take john at the time when his little peccadillo is suspected perhaps but when there is no specific charge of robbery against him he is not yet convicted he is not even on his trial how then can we venture to say he is guilty now think what scores of men and women walk the world in a like predicament and what false coin passes current pinchbeck strives to pass off his history as sound coin he knows it is only base metal washed over with a thin varnish of learning poluphloisbos puts his sermons in circulation sounding brass lacquered over with white metal and marked with the stamp and image of piety what say you to drawcansirs reputation as a military commander to tibbss pretensions to be a fine gentleman to sapphiras claims as a poetess or rodoessas as a beauty his bravery his piety high birth genius beautyeach of these deceivers would palm his falsehood on us and have us accept his forgeries as sterling coin and we talk here please to observe of weaknesses rather than crimes some of us have more serious things to hide than a yellow cheek behind a raddle of rouge or a white poll under a wig of jetty curls you know neighbor there are not only false teeth in this world but false tongues and some make up a bust and an appearance of strength with padding cotton and what not while another kind of artist tries to take you in by wearing under his waistcoat and perpetually thumping an immense sham heart dear sir may yours and mine be found at the right time of the proper size and in the right place  and what has this to do with halfcrowns good or bad ah friend may our coin battered and clipped and defaced though it be be proved to be sterling silver on the day of the great assay     strange to say on club paper   before the duke of yorks column and between the athenaeum and united service clubs i have seen more than once on the esplanade a preacher holding forth to a little congregation of badauds and streetboys whom he entertains with a discourse on the crimes of a rapacious aristocracy or warns of the imminent peril of their own souls sometimes this orator is made to move on by brutal policemen sometimes on a sunday he points to a white head or two visible in the windows of the clubs to the right and left of him and volunteers a statement that those quiet and elderly sabbathbreakers will very soon be called from this world to another where their lot will by no means be so comfortable as that which the reprobates enjoy here in their armchairs by their snug fires  at the end of last month had i been a pall mall preacher i would have liked to send a whip round to all the clubs in st jamess and convoke the few members remaining in london to hear a discourse sub dio on a text from the observer newspaper i would have taken post under the statue of fame say where she stands distributing wreaths to the three crimean guardsmen the crossingsweeper does not obstruct the path and i suppose is away at his villa on sundays and when the congregation was pretty quiet i would have begun  in the observer of the 27th september 1863 in the fifth page and the fourth column it is thus written  the codicil appended to the will of the late lord clyde executed at chatham and bearing the signature of clyde f m is written strange to say on a sheet of paper bearing the athenaeum club mark  what the codicil is my dear brethren it is not our business to inquire it conveys a benefaction to a faithful and attached friend of the good fieldmarshal the gift may be a lakh of rupees or it may be a house and its contentsfurniture plate and winecellar my friends i know the winemerchant and for the sake of the legatee hope heartily that the stock is large  am i wrong dear brethren in supposing that you expect a preacher to say a seasonable word on death here if you dont i fear you are but little familiar with the habits of preachers and are but lax hearers of sermons we might contrast the vault where the warriors remains lie shrouded and coffined with that in which his worldly provision of wine is stowed away spain and portugal and franceall the lands which supplied his storeas hardy and obedient subaltern as resolute captain as colonel daring but prudenthe has visited the fields of all in india and china he marches always unconquered or at the head of his dauntless highland brigade he treads the crimean snow or he rides from conquest to conquest in india once more succoring his countrymen in the hour of their utmost need smiting down the scared mutiny and trampling out the embers of rebellion at the head of an heroic army a consummate chief and now his glorious old sword is sheathed and his honors are won and he has bought him a house and stored it with modest cheer for his friends the good old man put water in his own wine and a glass or two sufficed himbehold the end comes and his legatee inherits these modest possessions by virtue of a codicil to his lordships will written strange to say upon a sheet of paper bearing the athenaeum club mark  it is to this part of the text my brethren that i propose to address myself particularly and if the remarks i make are offensive to any of you you know the doors of our meetinghouse are open and you can walk out when you will around us are magnificent halls and palaces frequented by such a multitude of men as not even the roman forum assembled together yonder are the martium and the palladium next to the palladium is the elegant viatorium which barry gracefully stole from rome by its side is the massive reformatorium and thethe ultratorium rears its granite columns beyond extending down the street palace after palace rises magnificent and under their lofty roofs warriors and lawyers merchants and nobles scholars and seamen the wealthy the poor the busy the idle assemble into the halls built down this little street and its neighborhood the principal men of all london come to hear or impart the news and the affairs of the state or of private individuals the quarrels of empires or of authors the movements of the court or the splendid vagaries of fashion the intrigues of statesmen or of persons of another sex yet more wily the last news of battles in the great occidental continents nay the latest betting for the horseraces or the advent of a dancer at the theatreall that men do is discussed in these pall mall agorae where we of london daily assemble  now among so many talkers consider how many false reports must fly about in such multitudes imagine how many disappointed men there must be how many chatterboxes how many feeble and credulous whereof i mark some specimens in my congregation how many mean rancorous prone to believe ill of their betters eager to find fault and then my brethren fancy how the words of my text must have been read and received in pall mall i perceive several of the congregation looking most uncomfortable one old boy with a dyed moustache turns purple in the face and struts back to the martium another with a shrug of the shoulder and a murmur of rubbish slinks away in the direction of the togatorium and the preacher continues the will of fieldmarshal lord clydesigned at chatham mind where his lordship diedis written strange to say on a sheet of paper bearing the athenaeum club mark  the inference is obvious a man cannot get athenaeum paper except at the athenaeum such paper is not sold at chatham where the last codicil to his lordships will is dated and so the painful belief is forced upon us that a peer a fieldmarshal wealthy respected illustrious could pocket paper at his club and carry it away with him to the country one fancies the hallporter conscious of the old lords iniquity and holding down his head as the marshal passes the door what is that roll which his lordship carries is it his marshals baton gloriously won no it is a roll of foolscap conveyed from the club what has he on his breast under his greatcoat is it his star of india no it is a bundle of envelopes bearing the head of minerva some sealingwax and a halfscore of pens  let us imagine how in the hall of one or other of these clubs this strange anecdote will be discussed  notorious screw says sneer the poor old fellows avarice has long been known  suppose he wishes to imitate the duke of marlborough says simper  habit of looting contracted in india you know aint so easy to get over you know says snigger  when officers dined with him in india remarks solemn it was notorious that the spoons were all of a different pattern  perhaps it isnt true suppose he wrote his paper at the club interposes jones  it is dated at chatham my good man says brown a man if he is in london says he is in london a man if he is in rochester says he is in rochester this man happens to forget that he is using the club paper and he happens to be found out many men dont happen to be found out ive seen literary fellows at clubs writing their rubbishing articles i have no doubt they take away reams of paper they crib thoughts why shouldnt they crib stationery one of your literary vagabonds who is capable of stabbing a reputation who is capable of telling any monstrous falsehood to support his party is surely capable of stealing a ream of paper  well well we have all our weaknesses sighs robinson seen that article thompson in the observer about lord clyde and the club paper youll find it up stairs in the third column of the fifth page towards the bottom of the page i suppose he was so poor he couldnt afford to buy a quire of paper hadnt fourpence in the world oh no  and they want to get up a testimonial to this mans memorya statue or something cries jawkins a man who wallows in wealth and takes paper away from his club i dont say he is not brave brutal courage most men have i dont say he was not a good officer a man with such experience must have been a good officer unless he was a born fool but to think of this man loaded with honorsthough of a low originso lost to selfrespect as actually to take away the athenaeum paper these parvenus sir betray their originbetray their origin i said to my wife this very morning mrs jawkins i said there is talk of a testimonial to this man i will not give one shilling i have no idea of raising statues to fellows who take away club paper no by george i have not why they will be raising statues to men who take club spoons next not one penny of my money shall they have  and now if you please we will tell the real story which has furnished this scandal to a newspaper this tattle to club gossips and loungers the fieldmarshal wishing to make a further provision for a friend informed his lawyer what he desired to do the lawyer a member of the athenaeum club there wrote the draft of such a codicil as he would advise and sent the paper by the post to lord clyde at chatham lord clyde finding the paper perfectly satisfactory signed it and sent it back and hence we have the story of the codicil bearing the signature of clyde f m and written strange to say upon paper bearing the athenaeum club mark  here i have been imagining a dialogue between a halfdozen gossips such as congregate round a club fireplace of an afternoon i wonder how many people besideswhether any chance reader of this very page has read and believed this story about the good old lord have the country papers copied the anecdote and our own correspondents made their remarks on it if my good sir or madam you have read it and credited it dont you own to a little feeling of shame and sorrow now that the trumpery little mystery is cleared to the new inhabitant of light passed away and out of reach of our censure misrepresentation scandal dulness malice a silly falsehood matters nothing censure and praise are alike to him       the music warbling to the deafened ear      the incense wasted on the funeral bier  the pompous eulogy pronounced over the gravestone or the lie that slander spits on it faithfully though this brave old chief did his duty honest and upright though his life was glorious his renownyou see he could write at chatham on london paper you see men can be found to point out how strange his behavior was  and about ourselves my good people do you by chance know any man or woman who has formed unjust conclusions regarding his neighbor have you ever found yourself willing nay eager to believe evil of some man whom you hate whom you hate because he is successful and you are not because he is rich and you are poor because he dines with great men who dont invite you because he wears a silk gown and yours is still stuff because he has been called in to perform the operation though you lived close by because his pictures have been bought and yours returned home unsold because he fills his church and you are preaching to empty pews if your rival prospers have you ever felt a twinge of anger if his wifes carriage passes you and mrs tomkins who are in a cab dont you feel that those people are giving themselves absurd airs of importance if he lives with great people are you not sure he is a sneak and if you ever felt envy towards another and if your heart has ever been black towards your brother if you have been peevish at his success pleased to hear his merit depreciated and eager to believe all that is said in his disfavormy good sir as you yourself contritely own that you are unjust jealous uncharitable so you may be sure some men are uncharitable jealous and unjust regarding you   the proofs and manuscript of this little sermon have just come from the printers and as i look at the writing i perceive not without a smile that one or two of the pages bear strange to say the mark of a club of which i have the honor to be a member those lines quoted in a foregoing page are from some noble verses written by one of mr addisons men mr tickell on the death of cadogan who was amongst the most prominent of marlboroughs captains and eugenios friends if you are acquainted with the history of those times you have read how cadogan had his feuds and hatreds too as tickells patron had his as cadogans great chief had his the duke of marlboroughs character has been so variously drawn writes a famous contemporary of the dukes that it is hard to pronounce on either side without the suspicion of flattery or detraction i shall say nothing of his military accomplishments which the opposite reports of his friends and enemies among the soldiers have rendered problematical those maligners who deny him personal valor seem not to consider that this accusation is charged at a venture since the person of a general is too seldom exposed and that fear which is said sometimes to have disconcerted him before action might probably be more for his army than himself if swift could hint a doubt of marlboroughs courage what wonder that a nameless scribe of our day should question the honor of clyde     the last sketch   not many days since i went to visit a house where in former years i had received many a friendly welcome we went into the ownersan artistsstudio prints pictures and sketches hung on the walls as i had last seen and remembered them the implements of the painters art were there the light which had shone upon so many many hours of patient and cheerful toil poured through the northern window upon print and bust lay figure and sketch and upon the easel before which the good the gentle the beloved leslie labored in this room the busy brain had devised and the skilful hand executed i know not how many of the noble works which have delighted the world with their beauty and charming humor here the poet called up into pictorial presence and informed with life grace beauty infinite friendly mirth and wondrous naturalness of expression the people of whom his dear books told him the storieshis shakspeare his cervantes his moliere his le sage there was his last work on the easela beautiful fresh smiling shape of titania such as his sweet guileless fancy imagined the midsummer nights queen to be gracious and pure and bright the sweet smiling image glimmers on the canvas fairy elves no doubt were to have been grouped around their mistress in laughing clusters honest bottoms grotesque head and form are indicated as reposing by the side of the consummate beauty the darkling forest would have grown around them with the stars glittering from the midsummer sky the flowers at the queens feet and the boughs and foliage about her would have been peopled with gambolling sprites and fays they were dwelling in the artists mind no doubt and would have been developed by that patient faithful admirable genius but the busy brain stopped working the skilful hand fell lifeless the loving honest heart ceased to beat what was she to have beenthat fair titaniawhen perfected by the patient skill of the poet who in imagination saw the sweet innocent figure and with tender courtesy and caresses as it were posed and shaped and traced the fair form is there record kept anywhere of fancies conceived beautiful unborn some day will they assume form in some yet undeveloped light if our bad unspoken thoughts are registered against us and are written in the awful account will not the good thoughts unspoken the love and tenderness the pity beauty charity which pass through the breast and cause the heart to throb with silent good find a remembrance too a few weeks more and this lovely offspring of the poets conception would have been completeto charm the world with its beautiful mirth may there not be some sphere unknown to us where it may have an existence they say our words once out of our lips go travelling in omne oevum reverberating for ever and ever if our words why not our thoughts if the has been why not the might have been  some day our spirits may be permitted to walk in galleries of fancies more wondrous and beautiful than any achieved works which at present we see and our minds to behold and delight in masterpieces which poets and artists minds have fathered and conceived only  with a feeling much akin to that with which i looked upon the friendsthe admirable artistsunfinished work i can fancy many readers turning to the last pages which were traced by charlotte brontes hand of the multitude that have read her books who has not known and deplored the tragedy of her family her own most sad and untimely fate which of her readers has not become her friend who that has known her books has not admired the artists noble english the burning love of truth the bravery the simplicity the indignation at wrong the eager sympathy the pious love and reverence the passionate honor so to speak of the woman what a story is that of that family of poets in their solitude yonder on the gloomy northern moors at nine oclock at night mrs gaskell tells after evening prayers when their guardian and relative had gone to bed the three poetessesthe three maidens charlotte and emily and annecharlotte being the motherly friend and guardian to the other twobegan like restless wild animals to pace up and down their parlor making out their wonderful stories talking over plans and projects and thoughts of what was to be their future life  one evening at the close of 1854 as charlotte nicholls sat with her husband by the fire listening to the howling of the wind about the house she suddenly said to her husband if you had not been with me i must have been writing now she then ran up stairs and brought down and read aloud the beginning of a new tale when she had finished her husband remarked the critics will accuse you of repetition she replied oh i shall alter that i always begin two or three times before i can please myself but it was not to be the trembling little hand was to write no more the heart newly awakened to love and happiness and throbbing with maternal hope was soon to cease to beat that intrepid outspeaker and champion of truth that eager impetuous redresser of wrong was to be called out of the worlds fight and struggle to lay down the shining arms and to be removed to a sphere where even a noble indignation cor ulterius nequit lacerare and where truth complete and right triumphant no longer need to wage war  i can only say of this lady vidi tantum i saw her first just as i rose out of an illness from which i had never thought to recover i remember the trembling little frame the little hand the great honest eyes an impetuous honesty seemed to me to characterize the woman twice i recollect she took me to task for what she held to be errors in doctrine once about fielding we had a disputation she spoke her mind out she jumped too rapidly to conclusions i have smiled at one or two passages in the biography in which my own disposition or behavior forms the subject of talk she formed conclusions that might be wrong and built up whole theories of character upon them new to the london world she entered it with an independent indomitable spirit of her own and judged of contemporaries and especially spied out arrogance or affectation with extraordinary keenness of vision she was angry with her favorites if their conduct or conversation fell below her ideal often she seemed to me to be judging the london folk prematurely but perhaps the city is rather angry at being judged i fancied an austere little joan of arc marching in upon us and rebuking our easy lives our easy morals she gave me the impression of being a very pure and lofty and highminded person a great and holy reverence of right and truth seemed to be with her always such in our brief interview she appeared to me as one thinks of that life so noble so lonelyof that passion for truthof those nights and nights of eager study swarming fancies invention depression elation prayer as one reads the necessarily incomplete though most touching and admirable history of the heart that throbbed in this one little frameof this one amongst the myriads of souls that have lived and died on this great earththis great earththis little speck in the infinite universe of godwith what wonder do we think of today with what awe await tomorrow when that which is now but darkly seen shall be clear as i read this little fragmentary sketch i think of the rest is it and where is it will not the leaf be turned some day and the story be told shall the deviser of the tale somewhere perfect the history of little emmas griefs and troubles shall titania come forth complete with her sportive court with the flowers at her feet the forest around her and all the stars of summer glittering overhead  how well i remember the delight and wonder and pleasure with which i read jane eyre sent to me by an author whose name and sex were then alike unknown to me the strange fascinations of the book and how with my own work pressing upon me i could not having taken the volumes up lay them down until they were read through hundreds of those who like myself recognized and admired that masterwork of a great genius will look with a mournful interest and regard and curiosity upon the last fragmentary sketch from the noble hand which wrote jane eyre
