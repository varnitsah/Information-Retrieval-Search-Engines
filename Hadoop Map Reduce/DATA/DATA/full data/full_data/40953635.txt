40953635	oak openings  james fennimore cooper     preface  it ought to be matter of surprise how men live in the midst of marvels without taking heed of their existence the slightest derangement of their accustomed walks in political or social life shall excite all their wonder and furnish themes for their discussions for months while the prodigies that come from above are presented daily to their eyes and are received without surprise as things of course in a certain sense this may be well enough inasmuch as all which comes directly from the hands of the creator may be said so far to exceed the power of human comprehension as to be beyond comment but the truth would show us that the cause of this neglect is rather a propensity to dwell on such interests as those over which we have a fancied control than on those which confessedly transcend our understanding thus is it ever with men the wonders of creation meet them at every turn without awakening reflection while their minds labor on subjects that are not only ephemeral and illusory but which never attain an elevation higher than that the most sordid interests can bestow  for ourselves we firmly believe that the finger of providence is pointing the way to all races and colors and nations along the path that is to lead the east and the west alike to the great goal of human wants demons infest that path and numerous and unhappy are the wanderings of millions who stray from its course sometimes in reluctance to proceed sometimes in an indiscreet haste to move faster than their fellows and always in a forgetfulness of the great rules of conduct that have been handed down from above nevertheless the main course is onward and the day in the sense of time is not distant when the whole earth is to be filled with the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea  one of the great stumblingblocks with a large class of well meaning but narrowjudging moralists are the seeming wrongs that are permitted by providence in its control of human events such persons take a onesided view of things and reduce all principles to the level of their own understandings if we could comprehend the relations which the deity bears to us as well as we can comprehend the relations we bear to him there might be a little seeming reason in these doubts but when one of the parties in this mighty scheme of action is a profound mystery to the other it is worse than idle it is profane to attempt to explain those things which our minds are not yet sufficiently cleared from the dross of earth to understand look at italy at this very moment the darkness and depression from which that glorious peninsula is about to emerge are the fruits of longcontinued dissensions and an iron despotism which is at length broken by the impulses left behind him by a ruthless conqueror who under the appearance and the phrases of liberty contended only for himself a more concentrated egotism than that of napoleon probably never existed yet has it left behind it seeds of personal rights that have sprung up by the wayside and which are likely to take root with a force that will bid defiance to eradication thus is it ever with the progress of society good appears to arise out of evil and the inscrutable ways of providence are vindicated by general results rather than by instances of particular care we leave the application of these remarks to the intelligence of such of our readers as may have patience to peruse the work that will be found in the succeeding pages  we have a few words of explanation to say in connection with the machinery of our tale in the first place we would remark that the spelling of burroak as given in this book is less our own than an office spelling we think it should be buroak and this for the simple reason that the name is derived from the fact that the acorn borne by this tree is partially covered with a bur old sam johnson however says that burr means the lobe or lap of the ear and those who can fancy such a resemblance between this and the covering of our acorn are at liberty to use the two final consonants having commenced stereotyping with this supernumerary for the sake of uniformity that mode of spelling wrong as we think it has been continued throughout the book  there is nothing imaginary in the fertility of the west personal observation has satisfied us that it much surpasses anything that exists in the atlantic states unless in exceptions through the agency of great care and high manuring or in instances of peculiar natural soil in these times men almost fly we have passed over a thousand miles of territory within the last few days and have brought the pictures at the two extremes of this journey in close proximity in our minds eye time may lessen that wonderful fertility and bring the whole country more on a level but there it now is a glorious gift from god which it is devoutly to be wished may be accepted with due gratitude and with a constant recollection of his unwavering rules of right and wrong by those who have been selected to enjoy it  june 1848     the oak openings   chapter i         how doth the little busy bee        improve each shining hour        and gather honey all the day        from every opening flower                      watts hymns for children  we have heard of those who fancied that they beheld a signal instance of the hand of the creator in the celebrated cataract of niagara such instances of the power of sensible and near objects to influence certain minds only prove how much easier it is to impress the imaginations of the dull with images that are novel than with those that are less apparent though of infinitely greater magnitude thus it would seem to be strange indeed that any human being should find more to wonder at in any one of the phenomena of the earth than in the earth itself or should especially stand astonished at the might of him who created the world when each night brings into view a firmament studded with other worlds each equally the work of his hands  nevertheless there is at bottom a motive for adoration in the study of the lowest fruits of the wisdom and power of god the leaf is as much beyond our comprehension of remote causes as much a subject of intelligent admiration as the tree which bears it the single tree confounds our knowledge and researches the same as the entire forest and though a variety that appears to be endless pervades the world the same admirable adaptation of means to ends the same bountiful forethought and the same benevolent wisdom are to be found in the acorn as in the gnarled branch on which it grew  the american forest has so often been described as to cause one to hesitate about reviving scenes that might possibly pall and in retouching pictures that have been so frequently painted as to be familiar to every mind but god created the woods and the themes bestowed by his bounty are inexhaustible even the ocean with its boundless waste of water has been found to be rich in its various beauties and marvels and he who shall bury himself with us once more in the virgin forests of this widespread land may possibly discover new subjects of admiration new causes to adore the being that has brought all into existence from the universe to its most minute particle  the precise period of our legend was in the year 1812 and the season of the year the pleasant month of july which had now drawn near to its close the sun was already approaching the western limits of a wooded view when the actors in its opening scene must appear on a stage that is worthy of a more particular description  the region was in one sense wild though it offered a picture that was not without some of the strongest and most pleasing features of civilization the country was what is termed rolling from some fancied resemblance to the surface of the ocean when it is just undulating with a long groundswell  although wooded it was not as the american forest is wont to grow with tail straight trees towering toward the light but with intervals between the low oaks that were scattered profusely over the view and with much of that air of negligence that one is apt to see in grounds where art is made to assume the character of nature the trees with very few exceptions were what is called the burr oak a small variety of a very extensive genus and the spaces between them always irregular and often of singular beauty have obtained the name of openings the two terms combined giving their appellation to this particular species of native forest under the name of oak openings  these woods so peculiar to certain districts of country are not altogether without some variety though possessing a general character of sameness the trees were of very uniform size being little taller than peartrees which they resemble a good deal in form and having trunks that rarely attain two feet in diameter the variety is produced by their distribution in places they stand with a regularity resembling that of an orchard then again they are more scattered and less formal while wide breadths of the land are occasionally seen in which they stand in copses with vacant spaces that bear no small affinity to artificial lawns being covered with verdure the grasses are supposed to be owing to the fires lighted periodically by the indians in order to clear their huntinggrounds  toward one of these grassy glades which was spread on an almost imperceptible acclivity and which might have contained some fifty or sixty acres of land the reader is now requested to turn his eyes far in the wilderness as was the spot four men were there and two of them had even some of the appliances of civilization about them the woods around were the then unpeopled forest of michigan and the small winding reach of placid water that was just visible in the distance was an elbow of the kalamazoo a beautiful little river that flows westward emptying its tribute into the vast expanse of lake michigan now this river has already become known by its villages and farms and railroads and mills but then not a dwelling of more pretension than the wigwam of the indian or an occasional shanty of some white adventurer had ever been seen on its banks in that day the whole of that fine peninsula with the exception of a narrow belt of country along the detroit river which was settled by the french as far back as near the close of the seventeenth century was literally a wilderness if a white man found his way into it it was as an indian trader a hunter or an adventurer in some other of the pursuits connected with border life and the habits of the savages  of this last character were two of the men on the open glade just mentioned while their companions were of the race of the aborigines what is much more remarkable the four were absolutely strangers to each others faces having met for the first time in their lives only an hour previously to the commencement of our tale by saying that they were strangers to each other we do not mean that the white men were acquaintances and the indians strangers but that neither of the four had ever seen either of the party until they met on that grassy glade though fame had made them somewhat acquainted through their reputations at the moment when we desire to present this group to the imagination of the reader three of its number were grave and silent observers of the movements of the fourth the fourth individual was of middle size young active exceedingly well formed and with a certain open and frank expression of countenance that rendered him at least welllooking though slightly marked with the smallpox his real name was benjamin boden though he was extensively known throughout the northwestern territories by the sobriquet of ben buzzextensively as to distances if not as to people by the voyageurs and other french of that region he was almost universally styled le bourdon or the drone not however from his idleness or inactivity but from the circumstances that he was notorious for laying his hands on the products of labor that proceeded from others in a word ben boden was a beehunter and as he was one of the first to exercise his craft in that portion of the country so was he infinitely the most skilful and prosperous the honey of le bourdon was not only thought to be purer and of higher flavor than that of any other trader in the article but it was much the most abundant there were a score of respectable families on the two banks of the detroit who never purchased of any one else but who patiently waited for the arrival of the capacious bark canoe of buzz in the autumn to lay in their supplies of this savory nutriment for the approaching winter the whole family of griddle cakes including those of buckwheat indian rice and wheaten flour were more or less dependent on the safe arrival of le bourdon for their popularity and welcome honey was eaten with all and wild honey had a reputation rightfully or not obtained that even rendered it more welcome than that which was formed by the labor and art of the domesticated bee  the dress of le bourdon was well adapted to his pursuits and life he wore a huntingshirt and trousers made of thin stuff which was dyed green and trimmed with yellow fringe this was the ordinary forest attire of the american rifleman being of a character as it was thought to conceal the person in the woods by blending its hues with those of the forest on his head ben wore a skin cap somewhat smartly made but without the fur the weather being warm his moccasins were a good deal wrought but seemed to be fading under the exposure of many marches his arms were excellent but all his martial accoutrements even to a keen longbladed knife were suspended from the rammer of his rifle the weapon itself being allowed to lean in careless confidence against the trunk of the nearest oak as if their master felt there was no immediate use for them  not so with the other three not only was each man well armed but each man kept his trusty rifle hugged to his person in a sort of jealous watchfulness while the other white man from time to time secretly but with great minuteness examined the flint and priming of his own piece  this second paleface was a very different person from him just described he was still young tall sinewy gaunt yet springy and strong stooping and roundshouldered with a face that carried a very decided toplight in it like that of the notorious bardolph in short whiskey had dyed the countenance of gershom waring with a telltale hue that did not less infallibly betray his destination than his speech denoted his origin which was clearly from one of the states of new england but gershom had been so long at the northwest as to have lost many of his peculiar habits and opinions and to have obtained substitutes  of the indians one an elderly wary experienced warrior was a pottawattamie named elksfoot who was well known at all the tradinghouses and garrisons of the northwestern territory including michigan as low down as detroit itself the other red man was a young chippewa or ojebway as the civilized natives of that nation now tell us the word should be spelled his ordinary appellation among his own people was that of pigeonswing a name obtained from the rapidity and length of his flights this young man who was scarcely turned of fiveandtwenty had already obtained a high reputation among the numerous tribes of his nation as a messenger or runner  accident had brought these four persons each and all strangers to one another in communication in the glade of the oak openings which has already been mentioned within half an hour of the scene we are about to present to the reader although the rencontre had been accompanied by the usual precautions of those who meet in a wilderness it had been friendly so far a circumstance that was in some measure owing to the interest they all took in the occupation of the beehunter the three others indeed had come in on different trails and surprised le bourdon in the midst of one of the most exciting exhibitions of his artan exhibition that awoke so much and so common an interest in the spectators as at once to place its continuance for the moment above all other considerations after brief salutations and wary examinations of the spot and its tenants each individual had in succession given his grave attention to what was going on and all had united in begging ben buzz to pursue his occupation without regard to his visitors the conversation that took place was partly in english and partly in one of the indian dialects which luckily all the parties appeared to understand as a matter of course with a sole view to oblige the reader we shall render what was said freely into the vernacular  lets see lets see stranger cried gershom emphasizing the syllable we have put in italics as if especially to betray his origin what you can do with your tools ive heern tell of such doins but never seed a bee lined in all my life and have a desprate fancy for larnin of all sorts from rithmetic to preachin  that comes from your puritan blood answered le bourdon with a quiet smile using surprisingly pure english for one in his class of life they tell me you puritans preach by instinct  i dont know how that is answered gershom though i can turn my hand to anything i heern tell across at bob ruly bois brulk footnote this unfortunate name which it may be necessary to tell a portion of our readers means burnt wood seems condemned to all sorts of abuses among the linguists of the west among other pronunciations is that of bob ruly while an island near detroit the proper name of which is bois blanc is familiarly known to the lake mariners by the name of bobolo of sich doins and would give a weeks keep at whiskey centre to know how twas done  whiskey centre was a sobriquet bestowed by the freshwater sailors of that region and the few other white adventurers of saxon origin who found their way into that trackless region firstly on gershom himself and secondly on his residence these names were obtained from the intensity of their respective characters in favor of the beverage named leau de mort was the place termed by the voyagers in a sort of pleasant travesty on the eau de vie of their distant but still wellremembered manufactures on the banks of the garonne ben boden however paid but little attention to the drawling remarks of gershom waring this was not the first time he had heard of whiskey centre though the first time he had ever seen the man himself his attention was on his own trade or present occupation and when it wandered at all it was principally bestowed on the indians more especially on the runner of elks foot or elksfoot as we prefer to spell it he had some knowledge by means of rumor and the little he knew rendered him somewhat more indifferent to his proceedings than he felt toward those of the pigeonswing of this young redskin he had never heard and while he managed to suppress all exhibition of the feeling a lively curiosity to learn the chippewas business was uppermost in his mind as for gershom he had taken his measure at a glance and had instantly set him down to be what in truth he was a wandering drinking reckless adventurer who had a multitude of vices and bad qualities mixed up with a few that if not absolutely redeeming served to diminish the disgust in which he might otherwise have been held by all decent people in the meanwhile the beehunting in which all the spectators took so much interest went on as this is a process with which most of our readers are probably unacquainted it may be necessary to explain the modus operandi as well as the appliances used  the tools of ben buzz as gershom had termed these implements of his trade were neither very numerous nor very complex they were all contained in a small covered wooden pail like those that artisans and laborers are accustomed to carry for the purpose of conveying their food from place to place uncovering this le bourdon had brought his implements to view previously to the moment when he was first seen by the reader there was a small covered cup of tin a wooden box a sort of plate or platter made also of wood and a common tumbler of a very inferior greenish glass in the year 1812 there was not a pane nor a vessel of clear transparent glass made in all america now some of the most beautiful manufactures of that sort known to civilization are abundantly produced among us in common with a thousand other articles that are used in domestic economy the tumbler of ben buzz however was his countryman in more senses than one it was not only american but it came from the part of pennsylvania of which he was himself a native blurred and of a greenish hue the glass was the best that pittsburg could then fabricate and ben had bought it only the year before on the very spot where it had been made  an oak of more size than usual had stood a little remote from its fellows or more within the open ground of the glade than the rest of the orchard lightning had struck this tree that very summer twisting off its trunk at a height of about four feet from the ground several fragments of the body and branches lay near and on these the spectators now took their seats watching attentively the movements of the beehunter of the stump ben had made a sort of table first levelling its splinters with an axe and on it he placed the several implements of his craft as he had need of each in succession  the wooden platter was first placed on this rude table then le bourdon opened his small box and took out of it a piece of honeycomb that was circular in shape and about an inch and a half in diameter the little covered tin vessel was next brought into use some pure and beautifully clear honey was poured from its spout into the cells of the piece of comb until each of them was about half filled the tumbler was next taken in hand carefully wiped and examined by holding it up before the eyes of the beehunter certainly there was little to admire in it but it was sufficiently transparent to answer his purposes all he asked was to be able to look through the glass in order to see what was going on in its interior  having made these preliminary arrangements buzzing benfor the sobriquet was applied to him in this form quite as often as in the othernext turned his attention to the velvetlike covering of the grassy glade fire had run over the whole region late that spring and the grass was now as fresh and sweet and short as if the place were pastured the white clover in particular abounded and was then just bursting forth into the blossom various other flowers had also appeared and around them were buzzing thousands of bees these industrious little animals were hard at work loading themselves with sweets little foreseeing the robbery contemplated by the craft of man as le bourdon moved stealthily among the flowers and their humming visitors the eyes of the two red men followed his smallest movement as the cat watches the mouse but gershom was less attentive thinking the whole curious enough but preferring whiskey to all the honey on earth  at length le bourdon found a bee to his mind and watching the moment when the animal was sipping sweets from a head of white clover he cautiously placed his blurred and greenlooking tumbler over it and made it his prisoner the moment the bee found itself encircled with the glass it took wing and attempted to rise this carried it to the upper part of its prison when ben carefully introduced the unoccupied hand beneath the glass and returned to the stump here he set the tumbler down on the platter in a way to bring the piece of honeycomb within its circle  so much done successfully and with very little trouble buzzing ben examined his captive for a moment to make sure that all was right then he took off his cap and placed it over tumbler platter honeycomb and bee he now waited half a minute when cautiously raising the cap again it was seen that the bee the moment a darkness like that of its hive came over it had lighted on the comb and commenced filling itself with the honey when ben took away the cap altogether the head and half of the body of the bee was in one of the cells its whole attention being bestowed on this unlookedfor hoard of treasure as this was just what its captor wished he considered that part of his work accomplished it now became apparent why a glass was used to take the bee instead of a vessel of wood or of bark transparency was necessary in order to watch the movements of the captive as darkness was necessary in order to induce it to cease its efforts to escape and to settle on the comb  as the bee was now intently occupied in filling itself buzzing ben or le bourdon did not hesitate about removing the glass he even ventured to look around him and to make another captive which he placed over the comb and managed as he had done with the first in a minute the second bee was also buried in a cell and the glass was again removed le bourdon now signed for his companions to draw near  there they are hard at work with the honey he said speaking in english and pointing at the bees little do they think as they undermine that comb how near they are to the undermining of their own hive but so it is with us all when we think we are in the highest prosperity we may be nearest to a fall and when we are poorest and humblest we may be about to be exalted i often think of these things out here in the wilderness when im alone and my thoughts are actyve  ben used a very pure english when his condition in life is remembered but now and then he encountered a word which pretty plainly proved he was not exactly a scholar a false emphasis has sometimes an influence on a mans fortune when one lives in the world but it mattered little to one like buzzing ben who seldom saw more than half a dozen human faces in the course of a whole summers hunting we remember an englishman however who would never concede talents to burr because the latter said a lamericaine european instead of european  how hive in danger demanded elksfoot who was very much of a matteroffact person no see him no hear himelse get some honey  honey you can have for asking for ive plenty of it already in my cabin though its somewhat arly in the season to begin to break in upon the store in general the beehunters keep back till august for they think it better to commence work when the creaturesthis word ben pronounced as accurately as if brought up at st jamess making it neither creatur nor creatooreto commence work when the creatures have had time to fill up after winters feed but i like the old stock and what is more i feel satisfied this is not to be a common summer and so i thought i would make an early start  as ben said this he glanced his eyes at pigeonswing who returned the look in a way to prove there was already a secret intelligence between them though neither had ever seen the other an hour before  waal exclaimed gershom this is curous ill allow that yes its curousbut weve got an article at whiskey centre thatll put the sweetest honey bee ever suckd altogether out o countenance  an article of which you suck your share ill answer for it judging by the sign you carry between the windows of your face returned ben laughing but hush men hush that first bee is filled and begins to think of home hell soon be off for honey centre and i must keep my eye on him now stand a little aside friends and give me room for my craft  the men complied and le bourdon was now all intense attention to his business the bee first taken had indeed filled itself to satiety and at first seemed to be too heavy to rise on the wing after a few moments of preparation however up it went circling around the spot as if uncertain what course to take the eye of ben never left it and when the insect darted off as it soon did in an airline he saw it for fifty yards after the others had lost sight of it ben took the range and was silent fully a minute while he did so  that bee may have lighted in the corner of yonder swamp he said pointing as he spoke to a bit of low land that sustained a growth of much larger trees than those which grew in the opening or it has crossed the point of the wood and struck across the prairie beyond and made for a bit of thick forest that is to be found about three miles further in the last case i shall have my trouble for nothing  what tother do demanded elksfoot with very obvious curiosity  sure enough the other gentleman must be nearly ready for a start and well see what road he travels tis always an assistance to a beehunter to get one creature fairly off as it helps him to line the next with greater sartainty  ben would say actyve and sartain though he was above saying creatoore or creatur this is the difference between a pennsylvanian and a yankee we shall not stop however to note all these little peculiarities in these individuals but use the proper or the peculiar dialect as may happen to be most convenient to ourselves  but there was no time for disquisition the second bee being now ready for a start like his companion this insect rose and encircled the stump several times ere it darted away toward its hive in an airline so small was the object and so rapid its movement that no one but the beehunter saw the animal after it had begun its journey in earnest to his disappointment instead of flying in the same direction as the bee first taken this little fellow went buzzing off fairly at a right angle it was consequently clear that there were two hives and that they lay in very different directions  without wasting his time in useless talk le bourdon now caught another bee which was subjected to the same process as those first taken when this creature had filled itself it rose circled the stump as usual as if to note the spot for a second visit and darted away directly in a line with the bee first taken ben noted its flight most accurately and had his eye on it until it was quite a hundred yards from the stump this he was enabled to do by means of a quick sight and long practice  well move our quarters friends said buzzing ben good humoredly as soon as satisfied with this last observation and gathering together his traps for a start i must angle for that hive and i fear it will turn out to be across the prairie and quite beyond my reach for today  the prairie alluded to was one of those small natural meadows or pastures that are to be found in michigan and may have contained four or five thousand acres of open land the heavy timber of the swamp mentioned jutted into it and the point to be determined was to ascertain whether the bees had flown over these trees toward which they had certainly gone in an airline or whether they had found their hive among them in order to settle this material question a new process was necessary  i must angle for them chaps repeated le bourdon and if you will go with me strangers you shall soon see the nicest part of the business of beehunting many a man who can line a bee can do nothing at an angle  as this was only gibberish to the listeners no answer was made but all prepared to follow ben who was soon ready to change his ground the beehunter took his way across the open ground to a point fully a hundred rods distant from his first position where he found another stump of a fallen tree which he converted into a stand the same process was gone through with as before and le bourdon was soon watching two bees that had plunged their heads down into the cells of the comb nothing could exceed the gravity and attention of the indians all this time they had fully comprehended the business of lining the insects toward their hives but they could not understand the virtue of the angle the first bore so strong an affinity to their own pursuit of game as to be very obvious to their senses but the last included a species of information to which they were total strangers nor were they much the wiser after le bourdon had taken his angle it requiring a sort of induction to which they were not accustomed in order to put the several parts of his proceedings together and to draw the inference as for gershom he affected to be familiar with all that was going on though he was just as ignorant as the indians themselves this little bit of hypocrisy was the homage he paid to his white blood it being very unseemly according to his view of the matter for a paleface not to know more than a redskin  the bees were some little time in filling themselves at length one of them came out of his cell and was evidently getting ready for his flight ben beckoned to the spectators to stand farther back in order to give him a fair chance and just as he had done so the bee rose after humming around the stump for an instant away the insect flew taking a course almost at right angles to that in which le bourdon had expected to see it fly it required half a minute for him to recollect that this little creature had gone off in a line nearly parallel to that which had been taken by the second of the bees which he had seen quit his original position the line led across the neighboring prairie and any attempt to follow these bees was hopeless  but the second creature was also soon ready and when it darted away le bourdon to his manifest delight saw that it held its flight toward the point of the swamp into or over which two of his first captives had gone this settled the doubtful matter had the hive of these bees been beyond that wood the angle of intersection would not have been there but at the hive across the prairie the reader will understand that creatures which obey an instinct or such a reason as bees possess would never make a curvature in their flights without some strong motive for it thus two bees taken from flowers that stood half a mile apart would be certain not to cross each others tracks in returning home until they met at the common hive and wherever the intersecting angle in their respective flights may be there would that hive be also as this repository of sweets was the game le bourdon had in view it is easy to see how much he was pleased when the direction taken by the last of his bees gave him the necessary assurance that its home would certainly be found in that very point of dense wood     chapter ii         how skilfully it builds its cell        how neat it spreads the wax        and labors hard to store it well        with the sweet food it makes                   watts hymns for children   the next thing was to ascertain which was the particular tree in which the bees had found a shelter collecting his implements le bourdon was soon ready and with a light elastic tread he moved off toward the point of the wood followed by the whole party the distance was about half a mile and men so much accustomed to use their limbs made light of it in a few minutes all were there and the beehunter was busy in looking for his tree this was the consummation of the whole process and ben was not only provided for the necessities of the case but he was well skilled in all the signs that betokened the abodes of bees  an uninstructed person might have passed that point of wood a thousand times without the least consciousness of the presence of a single insect of the sort now searched for in general the bees flew too high to be easily perceptible from the ground though a practised eye can discern them at distances that would almost seem to be marvellous but ben had other assistants than his eyes he knew that the tree he sought must be hollow and such trees usually give outward signs of the defect that exists within then some species of wood are more frequented by the bees than others while the instinct of the industrious little creatures generally enables them to select such homes as will not be very likely to destroy all the fruits of their industry by an untimely fall in all these particulars both bees and beehunter were well versed and ben made his search accordingly  among the other implements of his calling le bourdon had a small spyglass one scarcely larger than those that are used in theatres but which was powerful and every way suited to its purposes ben was not long in selecting a tree a halfdecayed elm as the one likely to contain the hive and by the aid of his glass he soon saw bees flying among its dying branches at a height of not less than seventy feet from the ground a little further search directed his attention to a knothole in and out of which the glass enabled him to see bees passing in streams this decided the point and putting aside all his implements but the axe buzzing ben now set about the task of felling the tree  stranger said gershom when le bourdon had taken out the first chip perhaps youd better let me do that part of the job i shall expect to come in for a share of the honey and im willing to arn all i take i was brought up on axes and jackknives and sich sort of food and can cut or whittle with the best chopper or the neatest whittler in or out of new england  you can try your hand if you wish it said ben relinquishing the axe i can fell a tree as well as yourself but have no such love for the business as to wish to keep it all to myself  waal i can say i like it answered gershom first passing his thumb along the edge of the axe in order to ascertain its state then swinging the tool with a view to try its hang  i cant say much for your axe stranger for this helve has no tarve tot to my mind but sich as it is down must come this elm though ten millions of bees should set upon me for my pains  this was no idle boast of warings worthless as he was in so many respects he was remarkably skilful with the axe as he now proved by the rapid manner in which he severed the trunk of the large elm on which he was at work he inquired of ben where he should lay the tree and when it came clattering down it fell on the precise spot indicated great was the confusion among the bees at this sudden downfall of their longcherished home the fact was not known to their enemy but they had inhabited that tree for a long time and the prize now obtained was the richest he had ever made in his calling as for the insects they filled the air in clouds and all the invaders deemed it prudent to withdraw to some little distance for a time lest the irritated and wronged bees should set upon them and take an ample revenge had they known their power this might easily have been done no ingenuity of man being able to protect him against the assaults of this insignificantlooking animal when unable to cover himself and the angry little heroes are in earnest on the present occasion however no harm befell the marauders so suddenly had the hive tumbled that its late occupants appeared to be astounded and they submitted to their fate as men yield to the power of tempests and earthquakes in half an hour most of them were collected on an adjacent tree where doubtless a consultation on the mode of future proceedings was held after their fashion  the indians were more delighted with le bourdons ingenious mode of discovering the hive than with the richness of the prize while ben himself and gershom manifested most satisfaction at the amount of the earnings when the tree was cut in pieces and split it was ascertained that years of sweets were contained within its capacious cavities and ben estimated the portion that fell to his share at more than three hundred pounds of good honeycomb includedafter deducting the portions that were given to the indians and which were abstracted by gershom the three last however could carry but little as they had no other means of bearing it away than their own backs  the honey was not collected that night the day was too far advanced for that and le bourdoncertainly never was name less merited than this sobriquet as applied to the active young beehunterbut le bourdon to give him his quaint appellation offered the hospitalities of his own cabin to the strangers promising to put them on their several paths the succeeding day with a good store of honey in each knapsack  they do say there ar likely to be troublesome times he continued with simple earnestness after having given the invitation to partake of his homely fare and i should like to hear what is going on in the world from whiskey centre i do not expect to learn much i will own but i am mistaken if the pigeonswing here has not a message that will make us all open our ears  the indians ejaculated their assent but gershom was a man who could not express anything sententiously as the beehunter led the way toward his cabin or shanty he made his comments with his customary freedom before recording what he communicated however we shall digress for one moment in order to say a word ourselves concerning this term shanty it is now in general use throughout the whole of the united states meaning a cabin that has been constructed in haste and for temporary purposes by a license of speech it is occasionally applied to more permanent residences as men are known to apply familiar epithets to familiar objects the derivation of the word has caused some speculation the term certainly came from the westperhaps from the northwestand the best explanation we have ever heard of its derivation is to suppose shanty as we now spell it a corruption of chiente which it is thought may have been a word in canadian french phrase to express a dogkennel chenil we believe is the true french term for such a thing and our own word is said to be derived from itmeute meaning a kennel of dogs or a pack of hounds rather than their dwelling at any rate chiente is so plausible a solution of the difficulty that one may hope it is the true one even though he has no better authority for it than a very vague rumor curious discoveries are sometimes made by these rude analogies however though they are generally thought not to be very near akin to learning for ourselves now we do not entertain a doubt that the sobriquet of yankees which is in every mans mouth and of which the derivation appears to puzzle all our philologists is nothing but a slight corruption of the word yengeese the term applied to the english by the tribes to whom they first became known we have no other authority for this derivation than conjecture and conjectures that are purely our own but it is so very plausible as almost to carry conviction of itself footnote since writing the above the author has met with an allusion that has induced him to think he may not have been the first to suggest this derivation of the word yankee with himself the suggestion is perfectly original and has long since been published by him but nothing is more probable than the fact that a solution so very natural of this longdisputed question in language may have suggested itself to various minds  the chiente or shanty of le bourdon stood quite near to the banks of the kalamazoo and in a most beautiful grove of the burroak ben had selected the site with much taste though the proximity of a spring of delicious water had probably its full share in influencing his decision it was necessary moreover that he should be near the river as his great movements were all made by water for the convenience of transporting his tools furniture etc as well as his honey a famous bark canoe lay in a little bay out of the current of the stream securely moored head and stern in order to prevent her beating against any object harder than herself  the dwelling had been constructed with some attention to security this was rendered necessary in some measure as ben had found by experience on account of two classes of enemiesmen and bears from the first it is true the beehunter had hitherto apprehended but little there were few human beings in that region the northern portions of the noble peninsula of michigan are somewhat low and swampy or are too broken and savage to tempt the native hunters from the openings and prairies that then lay in such rich profusion further south and west with the exception of the shores or coasts it was seldom that the northern half of the peninsula felt the footstep of man with the southern half however it was very different the openings and glades and watercourses offering almost as many temptations to the savage as they have since done to the civilized man nevertheless the bison or the buffalo as the animal is erroneously but very generally termed throughout the country was not often found in the vast herds of which we read until one reached the great prairies west of the mississippi there it was that the red men most loved to congregate though always bearing in numbers but a trifling proportion to the surface they occupied in that day however near as to the date but distant as to the events the chippewas ottawas pottawattamies kindred tribes we believe had still a footing in michigan proper and were to be found in considerable numbers in what was called the st josephs country or along the banks of the stream of that name a region that almost merits the lofty appellation of the garden of america le bourdon knew many of their warriors and was much esteemed among them though he had never met with either of those whom chance now had thrown in his way in general he suffered little wrong from the red men who wondered at his occupation while they liked his character but he had sustained losses and even ill treatment from certain outcasts of the tribes as well as from vagrant whites who occasionally found their way to his temporary dwellings on the present occasion le bourdon felt far more uneasiness from the circumstance of having his abode known to gershom waring a countryman and fellowchristian in one sense at least than from its being known to the chippewa and the pottawattamie  the bears were constant and dangerous sources of annoyance to the beehunter it was not often that an armed manand le bourdon seldom moved without his riflehas much to apprehend from the common brown bear of america though a formidablelooking animal especially when full grown it is seldom bold enough to attack a human being nothing but hunger or care for its young ever inducing it to go so much out of the ordinary track of its habits but the love of the bear for honey amounts to a passion not only will it devise all sorts of bearish expedients to get at the sweet morsels but it will scent them from afar on one occasion a family of bruins had looked into a shanty of bens that was not constructed with sufficient care and consummated their burglary by demolishing the last comb that disaster almost ruined the adventurer then quite young in his calling and ever since its occurrence he had taken the precaution to build such a citadel as should at least set teeth and paws at defiance to one who had an axe with access to young pines this was not a difficult task as was proved by the present habitation of our hero  this was the second season that le bourdon had occupied castle meal as he himself called the shanty this appellation was a corruption of chateau au mtel a name given to it by a wag of a voyageur who had aided ben in ascending the kalamazoo the previous summer and had remained long enough with him to help him put up his habitation the building was just twelve feet square in the interior and somewhat less than fourteen on its exterior it was made of pine logs in the usual mode with the additional security of possessing a roof of squared timbers of which the several parts were so nicely fitted together as to shed rain this unusual precaution was rendered necessary to protect the honey since the bears would have unroofed the common bark coverings of the shanties with the readiness of human beings in order to get at stores as ample as those which the beehunter had soon collected beneath his roof there was one window of glass which le bourdon had brought in his canoe though it was a single sash of six small lights that opened on hinges the exterior being protected by stout bars of riven oak securely let into the logs the door was made of three thicknesses of oaken plank pinned well together and swinging on stout iron hinges so secured as not to be easily removed its outside fastening was made by means of two stout staples a short piece of oxchain and an unusually heavy padlock nothing short of an iron bar and that cleverly applied could force this fastening on the inside three bars of oak rendered all secure when the master was at home  you set considrable store by your honey i guess stranger said gershom as le bourdon unlocked the fastenings and removed the chain if a body may judge by the kear care you take ont now down our way we aint half so particlar dolly and blossom never so much as putting up a bar to the door even when i sleep out which is about half the time now the summer is fairly set in  and whereabouts is down our way if one may be so bold as to ask the question returned le bourdon holding the door halfopened while he turned his face toward the other in expectation of the answer  why down at whiskey centre to be sure as the vygerers and other boatmen call the place  and where is whiskey centre demanded ben a little pertinaciously  why i thought everybody would a known that answered greshom sin whiskey is as drawin as a blister whiskey centre is just where i happen to live bein what a body may call a travellin name as im now down at the mouth of the kalamazoo why whiskey centres there too  i understand the matter now answered le bourdon composing his wellformed mouth in a sort of contemptuous smile you and whiskey being sworn friends are always to be found in company when i came into the river which was the last week in april i saw nothing like whiskey nor anything like a centre at the mouth  if youd a ben a fortnight later stranger youd a found both travellin centres and stationary differs somewhat i guess one is always to be found while tother must be sarched ater  and pray who are dolly and blossom i hope the last is not a whiskey blossom  not sheshe never touches a spoonful though i tell her it never hurt mortal she tries hard to reason me into it that it hurts me but thats all a mistake as anybody can see that jest looks at me  ben did look at him and to say truth came to a somewhat different conclusion  is she so blooming that you call her blossom demanded the bee hunter or is she so young  the gals a little of both dolly is my wife and blossom is my sister the real name of blossom is margery waring but everybody calls her blossom and so i gin into it with the rest on em  it is probable that le bourdon lost a good deal of his interest in this flower of the wilderness as soon as he learned she was so nearly related to the whiskey centre gershom was so very uninviting an object and had so many palpable marks that he had fairly earned the nickname which as it afterward appeared the western adventurers had given him as well as his abode wherever the last might be that no one of decently sober habits could readily fancy anything belonging to him at any rate the beehunter now led the way into his cabin whither he was followed without unnecessary ceremony by all three of his guests  the interior of the chiente to use the most poetical if not the most accurate word was singularly clean for an establishment set up by a bachelor in so remote a part of the world the honey in neat wellconstructed kegs was carefully piled along one side of the apartment in a way to occupy the minimum of room and to be rather ornamental than unsightly these kegs were made by le bourdon himself who had acquired as much of the art as was necessary to that object the woods always furnished the materials and a pile of staves that was placed beneath a neighboring tree sufficiently denoted that he did not yet deem that portion of his task completed  in one corner of the hut was a pile of welldressed bearskins three in number each and all of which had been taken from the carcasses of fallen foes within the last two months three more were stretched on saplings near by in the process of curing it was a material part of the beehunters craft to kill this animal in particular and the trophies of his conflicts with them were proportionably numerous on the pile already prepared he usually slept  there was a very rude table a single board set up on sticks and a bench or two together with a wooden chest of some size completed the furniture tools were suspended from the walls it is true and no less than three rifles in addition to a very neat double barrelled shotgun or fowlingpiece were standing in a corner these were arms collected by our hero in his different trips and retained quite as much from affection as from necessity or caution of ammunition there was no very great amount visible only three or four horns and a couple of pouches being suspended from pegs but ben had a secret store as well as another rifle carefully secured in a natural magazine and arsenal at a distance sufficiently great from the chiente to remove it from all danger of sharing in the fortunes of his citadel should disaster befall the last  the cooking was done altogether out of doors for this essential comfort le bourdon had made very liberal provision he had a small oven a sufficiently convenient fireplace and a storehouse at hand all placed near the spring and beneath the shade of a magnificent elm in the storehouse he kept his barrel of flour his barrel of salt a stock of smoked or dried meat and that which the woodsman if accustomed in early life to the settlements prizes most highly a halfbarrel of pickled pork the bark canoe had sufficed to transport all these stores merely ballasting handsomely that ticklish craft and its owner relied on the honey to perform the same office on the return voyage when trade or consumption should have disposed of the various articles just named  the reader may smile at the word trade and ask where were those to be found who could be parties to the traffic the vast lakes and innumerable rivers of that region however remote as it then was from the ordinary abodes of civilized man offered facilities for communication that the active spirit of trade would be certain not to neglect in the first place there were always the indians to barter skins and furs against powder lead rifles blankets and unhappily firewater then the white men who penetrated to those semiwilds were always ready to dicker and to swap and to trade rifles and watches and whatever else they might happen to possess almost to their wives and children  but we should be doing injustice to le bourdon were we in any manner to confound him with the dickering race he was a bee hunter quite as much through love of the wilderness and love of adventure as through love of gain profitable he had certainly found the employment or he probably would not have pursued it but there was many a man whonay most men even in his own humble class in lifewould have deemed his liberal earnings too hardly obtained when gained at the expense of all intercourse with their own kind but buzzing ben loved the solitude of his situation its hazards its quietude relieved by passing moments of high excitement and most of all the selfreliance that was indispensable equally to his success and his happiness woman as yet had never exercised her witchery over him and every day was his passion for dwelling alone and for enjoying the strange but certainly most alluring pleasures of the woods increasing and gaining strength in his bosom it was seldom now that he held intercourse even with the indian tribes that dwelt near his occasional places of hunting and frequently had he shifted his ground in order to avoid collision however friendly with whites who like himself were pushing their humble fortunes along the shores of those inland seas which as yet were rarely indeed whitened by a sail in this respect boden and waring were the very antipodes of each other gershom being an inveterate gossip in despite of his attachment to a vagrant and border life  the duties of hospitality are rarely forgotten among border men the inhabitant of a town may lose his natural disposition to receive all who offer at his board under the pressure of society but it is only in most extraordinary exceptions that the frontier man is ever known to be inhospitable he has little to offer but that little is seldom withheld either through prudence or niggardliness under this feelingwe might call it habit alsole bourdon now set himself at work to place on the table such food as he had at command and ready cooked the meal which he soon pressed his guests to share with him was composed of a good piece of cold boiled pork which ben had luckily cooked the day previously some bears meat roasted a fragment of venison steak both lean and cold and the remains of a duck that had been shot the day before in the kalamazoo with bread salt and what was somewhat unusual in the wilderness two or three onions raw the last dish was highly relished by gershom and was slightly honored by ben but the indians passed it over with cold indifference the dessert consisted of bread and honey which were liberally partaken of by all at table  little was said by either host or guests until the supper was finished when the whole party left the chiente to enjoy their pipes in the cool evening air beneath the oaks of the grove in which the dwelling stood their conversation began to let the parties know something of each others movements and characters  you are a pottawattamie and you a chippewa said le bourdon as he courteously handed to his two red guests pipes of theirs that he had just stuffed with some of his own tobaccoi believe you are a sort of cousins though your tribes are called by different names  nation ojebway returned the elder indian holding up a finger by way of enforcing attention  tribe pottawattamie added the runner in the same sententious manner  baccy goodput in the senior by way of showing he was well contented with his comforts  have you nothin to drink demanded whiskey centre who saw no great merit in anything but firewater  there is the spring returned le bourdon gravely a gourd hangs against the tree  gershom made a wry face but he did not move  is there any news stirring among the tribes asked the beehunter waiting however a decent interval lest he might be supposed to betray a womanly curiosity  elksfoot puffed away some time before he saw fit to answer reserving a salvo in behalf of his own dignity then he removed the pipe shook off the ashes pressed down the fire a little gave a reviving draught or two and quietly replied  ask my young brotherhe runnerhe know  but pigeonswing seemed to be little more communicative than the pottawattamie he smoked on in quiet dignity while the beehunter patiently waited for the moment when it might suit his younger guest to speak that moment did not arrive for some time though it came at last almost five minutes after elksfoot had made the allusion mentioned the ojebway or chippewa removed his pipe also and looking courteously round at his host he said with emphasis  bad summer come soon palefaces call young men togedder and dig up hatchet  i had heard something of this answered le bourdon with a saddened countenance and was afraid it might happen  my brother dig up hatchet too eh demanded pigeonswing  why should i i am alone here on the openings and it would seem foolish in me to wish to fight  got no tribeno ojebwayno pottawattamie eh  i have my tribe as well as another chippewa but can see no use i can be to it here if the english and americans fight it must be a long way from this wilderness and on or near the great salt lake  dont knownebber know till see english warrior plenty in canada  that may be but american warriors are not plenty here this country is a wilderness and there are no soldiers hereabouts to cut each others throats  what you tink him asked pigeonswing glancing at gershom who unable to forbear any longer had gone to the spring to mix a cup from a small supply that still remained of the liquor with which he had left home got pretty good scalp  i suppose it is as good as anothersbut he and i are countrymen and we cannot raise the tomahawk on one another  dont tink so plenty yankee him  le bourdon smiled at this proof of pigeonswings sagacity though he felt a good deal of uneasiness at the purport of his discourse  you are right enough in that he answered but im plenty of yankee too  no dont say so returned the chippewano mustnt say dat english no yankee him not a bit like you  why we are unlike each other in some respects it is true though we are countrymen notwithstanding my great father lives at washington as well as his  the chippewa appeared to be disappointed perhaps he appeared sorry too for le bourdons frank and manly hospitality had disposed him to friendship instead of hostilities while his admissions would rather put him in an antagonist position it was probably with a kind motive that he pursued the discourse in a way to give his host some insight into the true condition of matters in that part of the world  plenty breetish in woods he said with marked deliberation and point yankee no come yet  let me know the truth at once chippewa exclaimed le bourdon i am but a peaceable beehunter as you see and wish no mans scalp or any mans honey but my own is there to be a war between america and canada or not  some say yes some say no returned pigeonswing evasively my part dont know go now to see but plenty montreal belt among redskins plenty rifle plenty powder too  i heard something of this as i came up the lakes rejoined ben and fell in with a trader an old acquaintance from canada and a good friend too though he is to be my enemy according to law who gave me to understand that the summer would not go over without blows still they all seemed to be asleep at mackinaw michilimackinac as i passed there  wake up pretty soon canada warrior take fort  if i thought that chippewa i would be off this blessed night to give the alarm  notink better of dat  go i would if i died for it the next hour  tink betterbe no such fool i tell you  and i tell you pigeonswing that go i would if the whole ojebway nation was on my trail i am an american and mean to stand by my own people come what will  tought you only peaceable beehunter just now retorted the chippewa a little sarcastically  by this time le bourdon had somewhat cooled and he became conscious of his indiscretion he knew enough of the history of the past to be fully aware that in all periods of american history the english and for that matter the french too so long as they had possessions on this continent never scrupled about employing the savages in their conflicts it is true that these highly polished and we may justly add humane nationsfor each is out of all question entitled to that character in the scale of comparative humanity as between communities and each if you will take its own account of the matter stands at the head of civilization in this respectwould notwithstanding these high claims carry on their american wars by the agency of the tomahawk the scalpingknife and the brand eulogies though pronounced by ourselves on ourselves cannot erase the stains of blood even down to the present hour a cloud does not obscure the political atmosphere between england and america that its existence may not be discovered on the prairies by a movement among the indians the pulse that is to be felt there is a sure indication of the state of the relations between the parties every one knows that the savage in his warfare slays both sexes and all ages that the doorpost of the frontier cabin is defiled by the blood of the infant whose brains have been dashed against it and that the smouldering ruins of loghouses oftener than not cover the remains of their tenants but what of all that brutus is still an honorable man and the american who has not this sin to answer for among his numberless transgressions is reviled as a semibarbarian the time is at hand when the lion of the west will draw his own picture too and fortunate will it be for the characters of some who will gather around the easel if they do not discover traces of their own lineaments among his labors  the feeling engendered by the character of such a warfare is the secret of the deeply seated hostility which pervades the breast of the western american against the land of his ancestors he never sees the times and cares not a rush for the mystifications of the quarterly review but he remembers where his mother was brained and his father or brother tortured aye and by whose instrumentality the foul deeds were mainly done the man of the world can understand that such atrocities may be committed and the people of the offending nation remain ignorant of their existence and in a measure innocent of the guilt but the sufferer in his provincial practice makes no such distinction confounding all alike in his resentments and including all that bear the hated name in his maledictions it is a fearful thing to awaken the anger of a nation to excite in it a desire for revenge and thrice is that danger magnified when the people thus aroused possess the activity the resources the spirit and the enterprise of the americans we have been openly derided and that recently because in the fulness of our sense of power and sense of right language that exceeds any direct exhibition of the national strength has escaped the lips of legislators and perhaps justly has exposed them to the imputation of boastfulness that derision however will not soon be repeated the scenes enacting in mexico faint as they are in comparison with what would have been seen had hostilities taken an other direction place a perpetual gag in the mouths of all scoffers the child is passing from the gristle into the bone and the next generation will not even laugh as does the present at any idle and illconsidered menaces to coerce this republic strong in the consciousness of its own power it will eat all such fanfaronades if any future statesman should be so illadvised as to renew them with silent indifference  now le bourdon was fully aware that one of the surest pulses of approaching hostilities between england and america was to be felt in the far west if the indians were in movement some power was probably behind the scenes to set them in motion pigeonswing was well known to him by reputation and there was that about the man which awakened the most unpleasant apprehensions and he felt an itching desire to learn all he could from him without betraying any more of his own feelings if that were possible  i do not think the british will attempt mackinaw ben remarked after a long pause and a good deal of smoking had enabled him to assume an air of safe indifference  got him i tell you answered pigeonswing pointedly  got what chippewa  himmacnawgot fortgot sogersgot whole island know dat for been dere  this was astounding news indeed the commanding officer of that illstarred garrison could not himself have been more astonished when he was unexpectedly summoned to surrender by an enemy who appeared to start out of the earth than was le bourdon at hearing this intelligence to western notions michilimackinac was another gibraltar although really a place of very little strength and garrisoned by only one small company of regulars still habit had given the fortress a sort of sanctity among the adventurers of that region and its fall even in the settled parts of the country sounded like the loss of a province it is now known that anticipating the movements of the americans some three hundred whites sustained by more than twice that number of indians including warriors from nearly every adjacent tribe had surprised the post on the 17th of july and compelled the subaltern in command with some fifty odd men to surrender this rapid and highly military measure on the part of the british completely cut off the post of chicago at the head of lake michigan leaving it isolated on what was then a very remote wilderness chicago mackinac and detroit were the three grand stations of the americans on the upper lakes and here were two of them virtually gone at a blow     chapter iii                ho whos here       if anything thats civil speak if savage       take or lend                                 cymbeline   not another syllable did le bourdon utter to the chippewa or the chippewa to him in that sitting touching the important event just communicated each carefully avoided manifesting any further interest in the subject but the smoking continued for some time after the sun had set as the shades of evening began to gather the pottawattamie arose shook the ashes from his pipe gave a grunt and uttered a word or two by way of announcing his disposition to retire on this hint ben went into the cabin spread his skins and intimated to his guests that their beds were ready for them few compliments pass among border men on such occasions and one after another dropped off until all were stretched on the skins but the master of the place he remained up two hours later ruminating on the state of things when perceiving that the night was wearing on he also found a nest and sought his repose  nothing occurred to disturb the occupants of castle meal as le bourdon laughingly called his cabin until the return of day if there were any bears scenting around the place as often occurred at night their instinct must have apprised them that a large reinforcement was present and caused them to defer their attack to a more favorable opportunity the first afoot next morning was the beehunter himself who arose and left his cabin just as the earliest streaks of day were appearing in the east although dwelling in a wilderness the openings had not the character of ordinary forests the air circulates freely beneath their oaks the sun penetrates in a thousand places and grass grows wild but verdant there was little of the dampness of the virgin woods and the morning air though cool as is ever the case even in midsummer in regions still covered with trees was balmy and at that particular spot it came to the senses of le bourdon loaded with the sweets of many a wide glade of his favorite white clover of course he had placed his cabin near those spots where the insect he sought most abounded and a fragrant site it proved to be in favorable conditions of the atmosphere ben had a taste for all the natural advantages of his abode and was standing in enjoyment of its placid beauties when some one touched his elbow turning quick as thought he perceived the chippewa at his side that young indian had approached with the noiseless tread of his people and was now anxious to hold a private communication with him  pottawattamie got long earcome fudder said pigeonswing go cookhousetink we want breakfast  ben did as desired and the two were soon side by side at the spring in the outlet of which they made their ablutionsthe redskin being totally without paint when this agreeable office was performed each felt in better condition for a conference  elkfoot got belt from canada fadder commenced the chippewa with a sententious allusion to the british propensity to keep the savages in pay know he got him know he keep him  and you pigeonswingby your manner of talking i had set you down for a kings injin too  talk sono feel bit so my heart yankee  and have you not had a belt of wampum sent you as well as the rest of them  dat truegot himdont keep him  what did you dare to send it back  aint fool dough young keep him no keep him keep him for canada fadder no keep him for chippewa brave  what have you then done with your belt  bury him where nobody find him dis war nowaubkenewh no hole in heart to let king in  pigeonswing as this young indian was commonly called in his tribe in consequence of the rapidity of his movement when employed as a runner had a much more respectable name and one that he had fairly earned in some of the forays of his people but which the commonalty had just the same indisposition to use as the french have to call marshal soult the duc de dalmatie the last may be the most honorable title but it is not that by which he is the best known to his countrymen waubkenewh was an appellation notwithstanding of which the young chippewa was justly proud and he often asserted his right to use it as sternly as the old hero of toulouse asserted his right to his duchy when the austrians wished to style him le marechal duc soult  and you are friendly to the yankees and an enemy to the red coats  waubkenewh grasped the hand of le bourdon and squeezed it firmly then he said warily  take careelkfoot friend of blackbird like to look at canada belt got medal of king too have yankee scalp byem by take caremust speak low when elkfoot near  i begin to understand you chippewa you wish me to believe that you are a friend to america and that the pottawatamie is not if this be so why have you held the speech that you did last night and seemed to be on a warpath against my countrymen  dat good way eh elkfoot den tink me his friend dat very good in wartime  but is it true or false that mackinaw is taken by the british  dat true toogone and warrior all prisoner plenty winnebago plenty pottawatamie plenty ottowa plenty redskin dere  and the chippewas  some ojebway tooanswered pigeonswing after a reluctant pause cant all go on same path this war hatchets somehow got two handleone strike yankee one strike king george  but what is your business here and where are you now going if you are friendly to the americans i make no secret of my feelingsi am for my own people and i wish proof that you are a friend and not an enemy  too many question one time returned the chippewa a little distastefully no good have so long tongue ask one question answer himask anoder answer him too  well then what is your business here  go to chicago for genral  do you mean that you bear a message from some american general to the commandant at chicago  just sodat my business guess him right off he he he  it is so seldom that an indian laughs that the beehunter was startled  where is the general who has sent you on this errand he demanded  he at detroitgot whole army derewarrior plenty as oak in opening  all this was news to the beehunter and it caused him to muse a moment ere he proceeded  what is the name of the american general who has sent you on this path he then demanded  hell answered the ojebway quietly  hell you mean to give his indian title i suppose to show that he will prove dangerous to the wicked but how is he called in our own tongue  helldat he namegood name for soger eh  i believe i understand you chippewahull is the name of the governor of the territory and you must have mistaken the soundis it not so  hullhelldont knowjust sameone good as tother  yes one will do as well as the other if a body only understands

tongue though you do call yourself a friend of the yankees if you have been sent from detroit to chicago why are you so far north as this why are you here on the banks of the kalamazoo when your path ought to lead you more toward the st josephs  been to mackinaw genral says first go to mackinaw and see wid own eye how garrison doden go to chicago and tell warrior dere what happen and how he best manage understan dat bourdon  aye it all sounds well enough i will acknowledge you have been to mackinaw to look about you there and having seen things with your own eyes have started for chicago to give your knowledge to the commandant at that place now redskin have you any proof of what you say  for some reason that the beehunter could not yet fathom the chippewa was particularly anxious either to obtain his confidence or to deceive him which he was attempting was not yet quite apparent but that one or other was uppermost in his mind ben thought was beyond dispute as soon as the question last named was put however the indian looked cautiously around him as if to be certain there were no spectators then he carefully opened his tobaccopouch and extricated from the centre of the cut weed a letter that was rolled into the smallest compass to admit of this mode of concealment and which was encircled by a thread the last removed the letter was unrolled and its superscription exposed the address was to captainheald u s army commanding at chicago in one corner were the words on public service by pigeonswing all this was submitted to the beehunter who read it with his own eyes  dat goodasked the chippewa pointedlydat tell trutblieve him  le bourdon grasped the hand of the indian and gave it a hearty squeeze then he said frankly and like a man who no longer entertained any doubts  i put faith in all you say chippewa that is an officers letter and i now see that you are on the right side you playd so deep a game at first howsever that i didnt know exactly what to make of you now as for the pottawattamiedo you set him down as friend or foe in reality  enemytake your scalptake my scalp in minute only cant catch him he got belt from montreal and it look handsome in his eye  which way dye think hes travelling as i understood you he and you fell into the same path within a mile of this very spot was the meeting altogether friendly  yes friendlybut ask too many questiontoo much squawask one question den stop for answer  very truei will remember that an indian likes to do one thing at a time which way then do you think hes travelling  dont knowony guessguess he on path to blackbird  and where is blackbird and what is he about  two question dat returned the chippewa smiling and holding up two of his fingers at the same time by way of rebuke blackbird on warpathwhen warrior on dat path he take scalp if can get him  but where is his enemy there are no whites in this part of the country but here and there a trader or a trapper or a beehunter or a voyageur  take his scalpall scalp good in war time ant particlar down at montreal what you call garrison at chicago  blackbird you then think may be moving upon chicago in that case chippewa you should outrun this pottawatamie and reach the post in time to let its men know the danger  start as soon as eat breakfast cant go straight nudder or pottawatamie see print of moccasin must trow him off trail  very true but ill engage youre cunning enough to do that twice over should it be necessary  just then gershom waring came out of the cabin gaping like a hound and stretching his arms as if fairly wearied with sleep at the sight of this man the indian made a gesture of caution saying however in an undertone  how is heartyankee or breeshlove montreal eh pretty good scalp love king george eh  i rather think not but am not certain he is a poor paleface however and its of no great account how he stands his scalp would hardly be worth the taking whether by english or american  sell down at montrealbetter look out for pottawatamie dont like that injin  well be on our guard against him and there he comes looking as if his breakfast would be welcome and as if he was already thinking of a start  le bourdon had been busy with his pots during the whole time this discourse was going on and had warmed up a sufficiency of food to supply the wants of all his guests in a few minutes each was busy quietly eating his mornings meal gershom having taken his bitters aside and as he fancied unobserved this was not so much owing to niggardliness as to a distrust of his having a sufficient supply of the liquor that long indulgence had made in a measure necessary to him to last until he could get back to the barrels that were still to be found in his cabin down on the shore of the lake  during the breakfast little was said conversation forming no material part of the entertainment at the meals of any but the cultivated when each had risen however and by certain preliminary arrangements it was obvious that the two indians intended to depart the pottawatamie advanced to le bourdon and thrust out a hand  thankeehe said in the brief way in which he clipped his englishgood suppergood sleepgood breakfast now go thankee when any friend come to pottawatamie village good wigwam dere and no door  i thank you elksfootand should you pass this way agin soon i hope youll just step into this chiente and help yourself it i should happen to be off on a hunt good luck to you and a happy sight of home  the pottawatamie then turned and thrust out a hand to each of the others who met his offered leavetaking with apparent friendship the beehunter observed that neither of the indians said anything to the other touching the path he was about to travel but that each seemed ready to pursue his own way as if entirely independent and without the expectation of having a companion  elksfoot left the spot the first after completing his adieus the pottawattamie threw his rifle into the hollow of his arm felt at his belt as if to settle it into its place made some little disposition of his light summer covering and moved off in a southwesterly direction passing through the open glades and almost equally unobstructed groves as steady in his movements as if led by an instinct  there he goes on a beeline said le bourdon as the straight form of the old savage disappeared at length behind a thicket of trees on a beeline for the st josephs river where he will shortly be among friends and neighbors i do not doubt what chippewa are you in motion too  must go now returned pigeonswing in a friendly way byem by come back and eat more honeybring sweet news hopeno canada here placing a finger on his heartall yankee  god be with you chippewagod be with you we shall have a stirring summer of it and i expect to hear of your name in the wars as of a chief who knows no fear  pigeonswing waved his hand cast a glance half friendly half contemptuously at whiskey centre and glided away the two who remained standing near the smouldering fire remarked that the direction taken by the chippewa was toward the lake and nearly at right angles to that taken by the pottawattamie they also fancied that the movement of the former was about half as fast again as that of the latter in less than three minutes the young indian was concealed in the openings though he had to cross a glade of considerable width in order to reach them  the beehunter was now alone with the only one of his guests who was of the color and race to which he himself belonged of the three he was the visitor he least respected but the dues of hospitality are usually sacred in a wilderness and among savages so that he could do nothing to get rid of him as gershom manifested no intention to quit the place le bourdon set about the business of the hour with as much method and coolness as if the other had not been present the first thing was to bring home the honey discovered on the previous day a task of no light labor the distance it was to be transported being so considerable and the quantity so large but our beehunter was not without the means of accomplishing such an object and he now busied himself in getting ready as gershom volunteered his assistance together they toiled in apparent amity and confidence  the kalamazoo is a crooked stream and it wound from the spot where le bourdon had built his cabin to a point within a hundred yards of the fallen tree in which the bees had constructed their hive as a matter of course ben profited by this circumstance to carry his canoe to the latter place with a view to render it serviceable in transporting the honey first securing everything in and around the chiente he and gershom embarked taking with them no less than four pieces of firearms one of which was to use the language of the west a doublebarrelled shotgun before quitting the place however the beehunter went to a large kennel made of logs and let out a mastiff of great power and size between this dog and himself there existed the best possible intelligence the master having paid many visits to the prisoner since his return feeding and caressing him glad indeed was this fine animal to be released bounding back and forth and leaping about le bourdon in a way to manifest his delight he had been cared for in his kennel and well cared for too but there is no substitute for liberty whether in man or beast individuals or communities  when all was ready le bourdon and gershom got into the canoe whither the former now called his dog using the name of hive an appellation that was doubtless derived from his own pursuit as soon as the mastiff leaped into the canoe ben shoved off and the light craft was pushed up the stream by himself and gershom without much difficulty and with considerable rapidity but little driftwood choked the channel and after fifteen minutes of moderate labor the two men came near to the point of low wooded land in which the beetree had stood as they drew nigh certain signs of uneasiness in the dog attracted his masters attention and he pointed them out to gershom  theres game in the wind answered whiskey centre who had a good knowledge of most of the craft of border life notwithstanding his ungovernable propensity to drink and who by nature was both shrewd and resolute i shouldnt wondera common expression of his classif we found bears prowling about that honey  such things have happened in my time answered the beehunter and twice in my experience ive been driven from the field and forced to let the devils get my arnins  that was when you had no comrade stranger returned gershom raising a rifle and carefully examining its flint and its priming it will be a large family on em that drives us from that tree for my mind is made up to give doll and blossom a taste of the sweets  if this was said imprudently as respects ownership in the prize it was said heartily so far as spirit and determination were concerned it proved that whiskey centre had points about him which if not absolutely redeeming served in some measure to lessen the disgust which one might otherwise have felt for his character the beehunter knew that there was a species of hardihood that belonged to border men as the fruits of their habits and apparently he had all necessary confidence in gershoms disposition to sustain him should there be occasion for a conflict with his old enemies  the first measure of the beehunter after landing and securing his boat was to quiet hive the animal being under excellent command this was soon done the mastiff maintaining the position assigned him in the rear though evidently impatient to be let loose had not le bourdon known the precise position of the fallen tree and through that the probable position of his enemies he would have placed the mastiff in advance as a pioneer or scout but he deemed it necessary under the actual circumstances to hold him as a reserve or a force to be directed whither occasion might require with this arrangement then le bourdon and whiskey centre advanced side by side each carrying two pieces from the margin of the river toward the open land that commanded a view of the tree on reaching the desired point a halt was called in order to reconnoitre  the reader will remember that the beeelm had stood on the edge of a dense thicket or swamp in which the trees grew to a size several times exceeding those of the oaks in the openings and le bourdon had caused it to fall upon the open ground in order to work at the honey with greater ease to himself consequently the fragments lay in full view of the spot where the halt was made a little to gershoms surprise ben now produced his spyglass which he levelled with much earnestness toward the tree the beehunter however well knew his business and was examining into the state of the insects whom he had so violently invaded the night before the air was filled with them flying above and around the tree a perfect cloud of the little creatures hovering directly over the hole as if to guard its treasure  waal said gershom in his drawling way when le bourdon had taken a long look with the glass i dont see much use in spyglassin in that fashion spyglassin may do out on the lake if a body has only the tools to do it with but here in the openins natures eyes is about as good as them a body buys in the stores  take a look at them bees and see what a fret theyre in returned ben handing the glass to his companion as long as ive been in the business ive never seen a colony in such a fever commonly a few hours after the bees find that their tree is down and their plans broken into they give it up and swarm looking for a new hive and setting about the making more food for the next winter but here are all the bees yet buzzing above the hole as if they meant to hold out for a siege  theres an onaccountable grist on emgershom was never very particular in his figures of speech usually terming anything in quantities agrist and meaning in the present instance by onaccountable a number not to be countedan onaccountable grist on em i can tell you and if you mean to charge upon sich enemies you must look out for somebody besides whiskey centre for your vanguard what in natur has got into the critters they cant expect to set that tree on its legs agin  do you see a flight of them just in the edge of the foresthere more to the southward demanded le bourdon  sure enough there is a lot on em there too and they seem to be comin and goin to the tree like folksgershom would put his noun of multitude into the plural novaanglicecomin and goin like folks carryin water to a fire a body would think by the stir among em them critters barrel was empty  the bears are there coolly returned the beehunter ive seen such movements before and know how to account for them the bears are in the thicket but dont like to come out in the face of such a colony i have heard of bears being chased miles by bees when their anger was up  mortality they have a good deal of dander dandruff for sich little vipers but what are we to do bourdon for doll and blossom must taste that honey halfs mine you know and i dont like to give it up  the beehunter smiled at the coolness with which gershom assigned to himself so large a portion of his property though he did not think it worth his while just then to demur to his declaration as the lawyers might have it there was a sort of border rule which gave all present equal shares in any forest captures just as vessels in sight come in for prizemoney taken in time of war by public cruisers at any rate the honey of a single tree was not of sufficient value to induce a serious quarrel about it if there should be any extra trouble or danger in securing the present prize every craft in view might fairly enough come in for its share  doll shall not be forgotten if we can only house our honey answered the beehunter nor blossom neither ive a fancy already for that blossom of the wilderness and shall do all i can to make myself agreeable to her a man cannot approach a maiden with anything sweeter than honey  some gals like sugard words better but let me tell you one thing stranger  you have eaten bread and salt with me whiskey and both are scarce articles in a wilderness and youve slept under my roof is it not almost time to call me something else than stranger  well bourdon if you prefer that name though stranger is a name i like it has sich an up and off sound to it when a man calls all he sees strangers its a sign he dont let the grass grow in the road for want of movin and a movin man for me any day before your stationaries i was born on the seashore in the bay state and here i am up among the freshwater lakes as much natralized as any muskelunge that was ever cotchd in huron or about mackinaw if i can believe my eyes bourdon there is the muzzle of a bear to be seen jist under that heavy hemlockhere where the bees seem thickest  no doubt in the world answered le bourdon coolly though he had taken the precaution to look to the priming of each of his pieces as if he expected there would soon be occasion to use them but what was that you were about to say concernin blossom it would not be civil to the young woman to overlook her on account of a bear or two  you take it easy strangerbourdon i should sayyou take it easy what i was about to say was this that the whull lake country and thats a wide stretch to foot it over i know but big as it is the whull lake country dont contain blossoms equal im her brother and perhaps ought to be a little modest in sich matters but i ant a bit and let out jist what i think blossoms a dimond if there be dimonds on arth  and yonder is a bear if there be bears on earth exclaimed le bourdon who was not a little amused with gershoms account of his family but who saw that the moment was now arrived when it would be necessary to substitute deeds for words there they come in a drove and they seem in earnest  this was true enough no less than eight bears half of which however were quite young came tumbling over the logs and bounding up toward the fallen tree as if charging the citadel of the bees by preconcert their appearance was the signal for a general rally of the insects and by the time the foremost of the clumsy animals had reached the tree the air above and around him was absolutely darkened by the cloud of bees that was collected to defend their treasures bruin trusted too much to the thickness of his hide and to the defences with which he was provided by nature besides being too much incited by the love of honey to regard the little heroes but thrust his nose in at the hole doubtless hoping to plunge it at once into the midst of a mass of the sweets a growl a start backward and a flourishing of the forepaws with sundry bites in the air at once announced that he had met with greater resistance than he had anticipated in a minute all the bears were on their hindlegs beating the air with their forepaws and nipping right and left with their jaws in vigorous combat with their almost invisible foes instinct supplied the place of science and spite of the hides and the long hair that covered them the bees found the means of darting their stings into unprotected places until the quadrupeds were fairly driven to rolling about on the grass in order to crush their assailants this last process had some effect a great many bees being destroyed by the energetic rollings and tumblings of the bears but as in the tide of battle the places of those who fell were immediately supplied by fresh assailants until numbers seemed likely to prevail over power if not over discipline at this critical instant when the bears seemed fatigued with their nearly frantic saltations and violent blows upon nothing le bourdon deemed it wise to bring his forces into the combat gershom having been apprised of the plan both fired at the same instant each ball took effect one killing the largest of all the bears dead on the spot while the other inflicted a grievous wound on a second this success was immediately followed by a second discharge wounding two more of the enemy while ben held the second barrel of his shotgun in reserve while the hurt animals were hobbling off the men reloaded their pieces and by the time the last were ready to advance on the enemy the ground was cleared of bears and bees alike only two of the former remaining of which one was already dead and the other dying as for the bees they followed their retreating enemies in a body making a mistake that sometimes happens to still more intelligent beings that of attributing to themselves and their own prowess a success that had been gained by others  the beehunter and his friend now set themselves at work to provide a reception for the insects the return of which might shortly be expected the former lighted a fire being always provided with the means while gershom brought dry wood in less than five minutes a bright blaze was gleaming upward and when the bees returned as most of them soon did they found this new enemy intrenched as it might be behind walls of flame thousands of the little creatures perished by means of this new invention of man and the rest soon after were led away by their chiefs to seek some new deposit for the fruits of their industry     chapter iv               the sad butterfly         waving his lackered wings darts quickly on         and by his free flight counsels us to speed         for better lodgings and a scene more sweet         than these dear borders offer us tonight                                     simms   it was noon before ben and gershom dared to commence the process of cutting and splitting the tree in order to obtain the honey until then the bees lingered around their fallen hive and it would have been dangerous to venture beyond the smoke and heat in order to accomplish the task it is true le bourdon possessed several secrets of more or less virtue to drive off the bees when disposed to assault him but no one that was as certain as a good fire backed by a dense column of vapor various plants are thought to be so offensive to the insects that they avoid even their odor and the beehunter had faith in one or two of them but none of the right sort happened now to be near and he was obliged to trust first to a powerful heat and next to the vapor of damp wood  as there were axes and wedges and a beetle in the canoe and gershom was as expert with these implements as a master of fencing is with his foil to say nothing of the skill of le bourdon the tree was soon laid open and its ample stores of sweets exposed in the course of the afternoon the honey was deposited in kegs the kegs were transferred to the canoe and the whole deposited in the chiente the day had been one of toil and when our two bordermen sat down near the spring to take their evening meal each felt glad that his work was done  i believe this must be the last hive i line this summer said le bourdon while eating his supper my luck has been good so far but in troublesome times one had better not be too far from home i am surprised waring that you have ventured so far from your family while the tidings are so gloomy  thats partly because you dont know me and partly because you dont know dolly as for leaving hum with anybody to kear for it i should like to know who is more to the purpose than dolly waring i havent no idee that even bees would dare get upon her if they did theyd soon get the worst ont her tongue is allpowerful to say nawthin of her arms and if the sogers can only handle their muskets as she can handle a broom there is no need of new regiments to carry on this war  now nothing could be more false than this character but a drunkard has little regard to what he says  i am glad your garrison is so strong answered the beehunter thoughtfully but mine is too weak to stay any longer out here in the openings whiskey centre i intend to break up and return to the settlement before the redskins break loose in earnest if you will stay and lend me a hand to embark the honey and stores and help to carry the canoe down the river you shall be well paid for your trouble  waal id about as lief do that as do anything else good jobs is scarce out here in the wilderness and when a body lights of one he ought to profit by it i come up here thinkin to meet you for i heern tell from a voyager that you was abeeing it out in the openins and theres nawthin in natur that dolly takes to with a greater relish than good wild honey try whiskey ive told her a thousand times and youll soon get to like that better than all the rest of creation but not a drop could i ever get her or blossom to swallow its true that leaves so much the more for me but im a companionable crittur and dont think ive drunk as much as i want unless i take it societylike thats one reason ive taken so mightily to you bourdon youre not much at a pull but you ant downright afeared of a jug neither  the beehunter was glad to hear that all the family had not this mans vice for he now plainly foresaw that the accidents of his position must bring him and these strangers much in contact for some weeks at least le bourdon though not absolutely afraid of a jug as whiskey centre had expressed it was decidedly a temperate man drinking but seldom and never to excess he too well knew the hazards by which he was surrounded to indulge in this way even had he the taste for it but he had no taste that way one small jug of brandy forming his supply for a whole season in these days of exaggeration in all things exaggeration in politics in religion in temperance in virtue and even in education by putting new wine into old bottles that one little jug might have sufficed to give him a bad name but fiveandthirty years ago men had more real independence than they now possess and were not as much afraid of that croquemitaine public opinion as they are today to be sure it was little to le bourdons taste to make a companion of such a person as whiskey centre but there was no choice the man was an utter stranger to him and the only means he possessed of making sure that he did not carry off the property that lay so much at his mercy was by keeping near him with many men the beehunter would have been uneasy at being compelled to remain alone with them in the woods for cases in which one had murdered another in order to get possession of the goods in these remote regions were talked of among the other rumors of the borders but gershom had that in his air and manner that rendered ben confident his delinquencies at the most would scarcely reach bloodshed pilfer he might but murder was a crime which he did not appear at all likely to commit  after supping in company our two adventurers secured everything and retiring to the chiente they went to sleep no material disturbance occurred but the night passed in tranquillity the bee hunter merely experiencing some slight interruption to his slumbers from the unusual circumstance of having a companion one as long accustomed to be alone as himself would naturally submit to some such sensation our habits getting so completely the mastery as often to supplant even nature  the following morning the beehunter commenced his preparations for a change of residence had he not been discovered it is probable that the news received from the chippewa would not have induced him to abandon his present position so early in the season but he thought the risk of remaining was too great under all the circumstances the pottawattamie in particular was a subject of great distrust to him and he believed it highly possible some of that old chiefs tribe might be after his scalp ere many suns had risen gershom acquiesced in these opinions and as soon as his brain was less under the influence of liquor than was common with him he appeared to be quite happy in having it in his power to form a species of alliance offensive and defensive with a man of his own color and origin great harmony now prevailed between the two gershom improving vastly in all the better qualities the instant his intellect and feelings got to be a little released from the thraldom of the jug his own immediate store of whiskey was quite exhausted and le bourdon kept the place in which his own small stock of brandy was secured a profound secret these glimmerings of returning intellect and of reviving principles are by no means unusual with the sot thus proving that so long as there is life there is hope for the moral as well as for the physical being what was a little remarkable gershom grew less vulgar even in his dialect as he grew more sober showing that in all respects he was becoming a greatly improved person  the men were several hours in loading the canoe not only all the stores and ammunition but all the honey being transferred to it the beehunter had managed to conceal his jug of brandy reduced by this time to little more than a quart within an empty powderkeg into which he had crammed a beaverskin or two that he had taken as it might be incidentally in the course of his rambles at length everything was removed and stowed in its proper place on board the capacious canoe and gershom expected an announcement on the part of ben of his readiness to embark but there still remained one duty to perform the beehunter had killed a buck only the day before the opening of our narrative and shouldering a quarter he had left the remainder of the animal suspended from the branches of a tree near the place where it had been shot and cleaned as venison might be needed before they could reach the mouth of the river ben deemed it advisable that he and gershom should go and bring in the remainder of the carcass the men started on this undertaking accordingly leaving the canoe about two in the afternoon  the distance between the spot where the deer had been killed and the chiente was about three miles which was the reason why the beehunter had not brought home the entire animal the day he killed it the american woodsman often carrying his game great distances in preference to leaving it any length of time in the forest in the latter case there is always danger from beasts of prey which are drawn from afar by the scent of blood le bourdon thought it possible they might now encounter wolves though he had left the carcass of the deer so suspended as to place it beyond the reach of most of the animals of the wilderness each of the men however carried a rifle and hive was allowed to accompany them by an act of grace on the part of his master  for the first halfhour nothing occurred out of the usual course of events the beehunter had been conversing freely with his companion who he rejoiced to find manifested far more common sense not to say good sense than he had previously shown and from whom he was deriving information touching the number of vessels and the other movements on the lakes that he fancied might be of use to himself when he started for detroit while thus engaged and when distant only a hundred rods from the place where he had left the venison le bourdon was suddenly struck with the movements of the dog instead of doubling on his own tracks and scenting right and left as was the animals wont he was now advancing cautiously with his head low seemingly feeling his way with his nose as if there was a strong taint in the wind  sartain as my name is gershom exclaimed waring just after he and ben had come to a halt in order to look around themyonder is an injin the crittur is seated at the foot of the large oak hereaway more to the right of the dog and hive has struck his scent the fellow is asleep with his rifle across his lap and cant have much dread of wolves or bears  i see him answered le bourdon and am as much surprised as grieved to find him there it is a little remarkable that i should have so many visitors just at this time on my huntingground when i never had any at all before yesterday it gives a body an uncomfortable feeling waring to live so much in a crowd well wellim about to move and it will matter little twentyfour hours hence  the chaps a winnebago by his paint added gershombut lets go up and give him a call  the beehunter assented to this proposal remarking as they moved forward that he did not think the stranger of the tribe just named though he admitted that the use of paint was so general and loose among these warriors as to render it difficult to decide  the crittur sleeps soundly exclaimed gershom stopping within ten yards of the indian to take another look at him  hell never awake put in the beehunter solemnlythe man is dead see there is blood on the side of his head and a rifle bullet has left its hole there  even while speaking the beehunter advanced and raising a sort of shawl that once had been used as an ornament and which had last been thrown carelessly over the head of its late owner he exposed the wellknown features of elksfoot the pottawattamie who had left them little more than twentyfour hours before the warrior had been shot by a riflebullet directly through the temple and had been scalped the powder had been taken from his horn and the bullets from his pouch but beyond this he had not been plundered the body was carefully placed against a tree in a sitting attitude the rifle was laid across its legs and there it had been left in the centre of the openings to become food for beasts of prey and to have its bones bleached by the snows and the rains  the beehunter shuddered as he gazed at this fearful memorial of the violence against which even a wilderness could afford no sufficient protection that pigeonswing had slain his late fellow guest le bourdon had no doubt and he sickened at the thought although he had himself dreaded a good deal from the hostility of the pottawattamie he could have wished this deed undone that there was a jealous distrust of each other between the two indians had been sufficiently apparent but the beehunter could not have imagined that it would so soon lead to results as terrible as these  after examining the body and noting the state of things around it the men proceeded deeply impressed with the necessity not only of their speedy removal but of their standing by each other in that remote region now that violence had so clearly broken out among the tribes the beehunter had taken a strong liking to the chippewa and he regretted so much the more to think that he had done this deed it was true that such a state of things might exist as to justify an indian warrior agreeably to his own notions in taking the life of any one of a hostile tribe but le bourdon wished it had been otherwise a man of gentle and peaceable disposition himself though of a profoundly enthusiastic temperament in his own peculiar way he had ever avoided those scenes of disorder and bloodshed which are of so frequent occurrence in the forest and on the prairies and this was actually the first instance in which he had ever beheld a human body that had fallen by human hands gershom had seen more of the peculiar life of the frontiers than his companion in consequence of having lived so closely in contact with the fire water but even he was greatly shocked with the suddenness and nature of the pottawattamies end  no attempt was made to bury the remains of elksfoot inasmuch as our adventurers had no tools fit for such a purpose and any merely superficial interment would have been a sort of invitation to the wolves to dig the body up again  let him lean agin the tree said waring as they moved on toward the spot where the carcass of the deer was left and ill engage nothin touches him theres that about the face of man bourdon that skears the beasts and if a body can only muster courage to stare them full in the eye one single human can drive before him a whull pack of wolves  ive heard as much returned the beehunter but should not like to be the human to try the experiment that the face of man may have terrors for a beast i think likely but hunger would prove more than a match for such fear yonder is our venison waring safe where i left it  the carcass of the deer was divided and each man shouldering his burden the two returned to the river taking care to avoid the path that led by the body of the dead indian as both labored with much earnestness everything was soon ready and the canoe speedily left the shore the kalamazoo is not in general a swift and turbulent stream though it has a sufficient current to carry away its waters without any appearance of sluggishness of course this character is not uniform reaches occurring in which the placid water is barely seen to move and others again are found in which something like rapids and even falls appear but on the whole and more especially in the part of the stream where it was the canoe had little to disturb it as it glided easily down impelled by a light stroke of the paddle  the beehunter did not abandon his station without regret he had chosen a most agreeable site for his chiente consulting air shade water verdure and groves as well as the chances of obtaining honey in his regular pursuit he had been unusually fortunate and the little pile of kegs in the centre of his canoe was certainly a grateful sight to his eyes the honey gathered this season moreover had proved to be of an unusually delicious flavor affording the promise of high prices and ready sales still the beehunter left the place with profound regret he loved his calling he loved solitude to a morbid degree perhaps and he loved the gentle excitement that naturally attended his beelining his discoveries and his gains of all the pursuits that are more or less dependent on the chances of the hunt and the field that of the beehunter is of the most quiet and placid enjoyment he has the stirring motives of uncertainty and doubt without the disturbing qualities of bustle and fatigue and while his exercise is sufficient for health and for the pleasures of the open air it is seldom of a nature to weary or unnerve then the study of the little animal that is to be watched and if the reader will plundered is not without a charm for those who delight in looking into the wonderful arcana of nature so great was the interest that le bourdon sometimes felt in his little companions that on three several occasions that very summer he had spared hives after having found them because he had ascertained that they were composed of young bees and had not yet got sufficiently colonized to render a new swarming more than a passing accident with all this kindness of feeling toward his victims boden had nothing of the transcendental folly that usually accompanies the sentimentalism of the exaggerated but his feelings and impulses were simple and direct though so often gentle and humane he knew that the bee like all the other inferior animals of creation was placed at the disposition of man and did not scruple to profit by the power thus beneficently bestowed though he exercised it gently and with a proper discrimination between its use and its abuse  neither of the men toiled much as the canoe floated down the stream very slight impulses served to give their buoyant craft a reasonably swift motion and the current itself was a material assistant these circumstances gave an opportunity for conversation as the canoe glided onward  ater all suddenly exclaimed waring who had been examining the pile of kegs for some time in silenceater all bourdon your trade is an oncommon one a most extrornary and oncommon callin  more so think you gershom than swallowing whiskey morning noon and night answered the beehunter with a quiet smile  aye but thats not a reglar callin only a likin now a man may have a likin to a hundred things in which he dont deal i set nothin down as a business which a man dont live by  perhaps youre right waring more die by whiskey than live by whiskey  whiskey centre seemed struck with this remark which was introduced so aptly and was uttered so quietly he gazed earnestly at his companion for near a minute ere he attempted to resume the discourse  blossom has often said as much as this he then slowly rejoined and even dolly has prophesized the same  the beehunter observed that an impression had been made and he thought it wisest to let the reproof already administered produce its effect without endeavoring to add to its power waring sat with his chin on his breast in deep thought while his companion for the first time since they had met examined the features and aspect of the man at first sight whiskey centre certainly offered little that was inviting but a closer study of his countenance showed that he had the remains of a singularly handsome man vulgar as were his forms of speech coarse and forbidding as his face had become through the indulgence which was his bane there were still traces of this truth his complexion had once been fair almost to effeminacy his cheeks ruddy with health and his blue eye bright and full of hope his hair was light and all these peculiarities strongly denoted his saxon origin it was not so much anglosaxon as americosaxon that was to be seen in the physical outlines and hues of this nearly selfdestroyed being the heaviness of feature the ponderousness of limb and movement had all long disappeared from his race most probably under the influence of climate and his nose was prominent and graceful in outline while his mouth and chin might have passed for having been under the chisel of some distinguished sculptor it was in truth painful to examine that face steeped as it was in liquor and fast losing the impress left by nature as yet the body retained most of its power the enemy having insidiously entered the citadel rather than having actually subdued it the beehunter sighed as he gazed at his moody companion and wondered whether blossom had aught of this marvellous comeliness of countenance without its revolting accompaniments  all that afternoon and the whole of the night that succeeded did the canoe float downward with the current occasionally some slight obstacle to its progress would present itself but on the whole its advance was steady and certain as the river necessarily followed the formation of the land it was tortuous and irregular in its course though its general direction was toward the northwest or west a little northerly the riverbottoms being much more heavily timberedto use a woodsman termthan the higher grounds there was little of the parklike openings on its immediate banks though distant glimpses were had of many a glade and of many a charming grove  as the canoe moved toward its point of destination the conversation did not lag between the beehunter and his companion each gave the other a sort of history of his life for now that the jug was exhausted gershom could talk not only rationally but with clearness and force vulgar he was and as such uninviting and often repulsive still his early education partook of that peculiarity of new england which if it do not make her children absolutely all they are apt to believe themselves to be seldom leaves them in the darkness of a besotted ignorance as usually happens with this particular race gershom had acquired a good deal for a man of his class in life and this information added to native shrewdness enabled him to maintain his place in the dialogue with a certain degree of credit he had a very lively perception fancied or realof all the advantages of being born in the land of the puritans deeming everything that came of the great blarney stone superior to everything else of the same nature elsewhere and while much disposed to sneer and rail at all other parts of the country just as much indisposed to take as disposed to give ben boden soon detected this weakness in his companions character a weakness so very general as scarce to need being pointed out to any observant man and which is almost inseparable from halfway intelligence and provincial selfadmiration and ben was rather inclined to play on it whenever gershom laid himself a little more open than common on the subject on the whole however the communications were amicable and the dangers of the wilderness rendering the parties allies they went their way with an increasing confidence in each others support gershom now that he was thoroughly sober could impart much to ben that was useful while ben knew a great deal that even his companion coming as he did from the chosen people was not sorry to learn as has been already intimated each communicated to the other in the course of this long journey on the river an outline of his past life  the history of gershom waring was one of everyday occurrence he was born of a family in humble circumstances in massachusetts a community in which however none are so very humble as to be beneath the paternal watchfulness of the state the common schools had done their duty by him while according to his account of the matter his only sister had fallen into the hands of a female relative who was enabled to impart an instruction slightly superior to that which is to be had from the servants of the public after a time the death of this relative and the marriage of gershom brought the brother and sister together again the last still quite young from this period the migratory life of the family commenced previously to the establishment of manufactories within her limits new england systematically gave forth her increase to the states west and south of her own territories a portion of this increase still migrates and will probably long continue so to do but the tide of young women which once flowed so steadily from that region would now seem to have turned and is setting back in a flood of factory girls but the warings lived at too early a day to feel the influence of such a pass of civilization and went west almost as a matter of course with the commencement of his migratory life gershom began to dissipate as it has got to be matter of convention to term drinking fortunately mrs waring had no children thus lessening in a measure the privations to which those unlucky females were obliged to submit when gershom left his birthplace he had a sum of money exceeding a thousand dollars in amount the united means of himself and sister but by the time he had reached detroit it was reduced to less than a hundred several years however had been consumed by the way the habits growing worse and the money vanishing as the family went further and further toward the skirts of society at length gershom attached himself to a sutler who was going up to michilimackinac with a party of troops and finally he left that place to proceed in a canoe of his own to the head of lake michigan where was a post on the present site of chicago which was then known as fort dearborn  in quitting mackinac for chicago waring had no very settled plan his habits had completely put him out of favor at the former place and a certain restlessness urged him to penetrate still farther into the wilderness in all his migrations and wanderings the two devoted females followed his fortunes the one because she was his wife the other because she was his sister when the canoe reached the mouth of the kalamazoo a gale of wind drove it into the river and finding a deserted cabin ready built to receive him gershom landed and had been busy with the rifle for the last fortnight the time he had been on shore hearing from some voyageurs who had gone down the lake that a beehunter was up the river he had followed the stream in its windings until he fell in with le bourdon  such is an outline of the account which whiskey centre gave of himself it is true he said very little of his propensity to drink but this his companion was enabled to conjecture from the context of his narrative as well as from what he had seen it was very evident to the beehunter that the plans of both parties for the summer were about to be seriously deranged by the impending hostilities and that some decided movement might be rendered necessary even for the protection of their lives this much he communicated to gershom who heard his opinions with interest and a concern in behalf of his wife and sister that at least did some credit to his heart for the first time in many months indeed gershom was now perfectly sober a circumstance that was solely owing to his having had no access to liquor for eightandforty hours with the return of a clear head came juster notions of the dangers and difficulties in which he had involved the two selfdevoted women who had accompanied him so far and who really seemed ready to follow him in making the circuit of the earth  its troublesome times exclaimed whiskey centre when his companion had just ended one of his strong and lucid statements of the embarrassments that might environ them ere they could get back to the settled portions of the countryits troublesome times truly i see all you would say bourdon and wonder i ever got my foot so deep into it without thinkin of all beforehand the best on us will make mistakes howsever and i suppose ive been called on to make mine as well as another  my trade speaks for itself returned the beehunter and any man can see why one who looks for bees must come where theyre to be found but i will own gershom that your speculation lies a little beyond my understanding now you tell me you have two full barrels of whiskey  had bourdonhadone of them is pretty nearly half used i am afeared  well had until you began to be your own customer but here you are squatted at the mouth of the kalamazoo with a barrel and a half of liquor and nobody but yourself to drink it where the profits are to come from exceeds pennsylvany calculations perhaps a yankee can tell  you forget the injins i met a man at mackinaw who only took out in his canoe one barrel and he brought in skins enough to set up a grocery at detroit but i was on the trail of the soldiers and meant to make a business ont at fort dearborn what between the soldiers and the redskins a man might sell gallons a day and at fair prices  its a sorry business at the best whiskey and now youre fairly sober if youll take my advice youll remain so why not make up your mind like a man and vow youll never touch another drop  maybe i will when these two barrels is emptiedive often thought of doin some sich matter and agin and agin has dolly and blossom advised me to fall into the plan but its hard to give up old habits all at once if i could only taper off on a pint a day for a year or so i think i might come round in time i know as well as you do bourdon that sobriety is a good thing and dissipation a bad thing but its hard to give up all at once  lest the instructed reader should wonder at a mans using the term dissipation in a wilderness it may be well to explain that in common american parlance dissipation has got to mean drunkenness perhaps half of the whole country if told that a man or a woman might be exceedingly dissipated and never swallow anything stronger than water would stoutly deny the justice of applying the word to such a person this perversion of the meaning of a very common term has probably arisen from the circumstance that there is very little dissipation in the country that is not connected with hard drinking a dissipated woman is a person almost unknown in america or when the word is applied it means a very different degree of misspending of time from that which is understood by the use of the same reproach in older and more sophisticated states of society the majority rules in this country and with the majority excess usually takes this particular aspect refinement having very little connection with the dissipation of the masses anywhere  the excuses of his companion however caused le bourdon to muse more than might otherwise have been the case on whiskey centres condition apart from all considerations connected with the mans own welfare and the happiness of his family there were those which were inseparable from the common safety in the present state of the country boden was a man of much decision and firmness of character and he was clearheaded as to causes and consequences the practice of living alone had induced in him the habits of reflection and the selfreliance produced by his solitary life a life of which he was fond almost to a passion caused him to decide warily but to act promptly as they descended the river together therefore he went over the whole of gershom warings case and prospects with great impartiality and care and settled in his own mind what ought to be done as well as the mode of doing it he kept his own counsel however discussing all sorts of subjects that were of interest to men in their situation as they floated down the stream avoiding any recurrence to this theme which was possibly of more importance to them both just then than any other that could be presented     chapter v        he was a wight of high renown         and thou art but of low degree      tis pride that pulls the country down         then take thine auld cloak about thee                                      shakespeare   the canoe did not reach the mouth of the river until near evening of the third day of its navigation it was not so much the distance though that was considerable as it was the obstacles that lay in the way which brought the travellers to the end of their journey at so late a period as they drew nearer and nearer to the place where gershom had left his wife and sister le bourdon detected in his companion signs of an interest in the welfare of the two last as well as a certain feverish uneasiness lest all might not be well with them that said something in favor of his heart whatever might be urged against his prudence and care in leaving them alone in so exposed a situation  im afeard a body dont think as much as he ought to do when liquor is in him said whiskey centre just as the canoe doubled the last point and the hut came into view else i never could have left two women by themselves in so lonesome a place god be praised there is the chiente at any rate and theres a smoke comin out of it if my eyes dont deceive me look bourdon for i can scarcely see at all  there is the house and as you say there is certainly a smoke rising from it  theres comfort in that exclaimed the truant husband and brother with a sigh that seemed to relieve a very loaded breast yes theres comfort in that if theres a fire there must be them that lighted it and a fire at this season too says that theres somethin to eat i should be sorry bourdon to think id left the women folks without food though to own the truth i dont remember whether i did or not  the man who drinks gershom has commonly but a very poor memory  thats trueyes ill own that and i wish it warnt as true as it is but reason and strong drink do not travel far in company  gershom suddenly ceased speaking dropping his paddle like one beset by a powerless weakness the beehunter saw that he was overcome by some unexpected occurrence and that the mans feelings were keenly connected with the cause whatever that might be looking eagerly around in quest of the explanation le bourdon saw a female standing on a point of land that commanded a view of the river and its banks for a considerable distance unequivocally watching the approach of the canoe  there she is said gershom in a subdued tonethats dolly and there she has been ill engage half the time of my absence waitin to get the first glimpse of my miserable body as it came back to her sich is woman bourdon and god forgive me if i have ever forgotten their natur when i was bound to remember it but we all have our weak moments at times and i trust mine will not be accounted agin me more than them of other men  this is a beautiful sight gershom and it almost makes me your friend the man for whom a woman can feel so much concernthat a womannay women for you tell me your sister is one of the family but the man whom decent women can follow to a place like this must have some good pints about him that woman is aweepin and it must be for joy at your return  twould be jist like dolly to do soshes done it before and would be likely to do so agin answered gershom nearly choked by the effort he made to speak without betraying his own emotion put the canoe into the pint and let me land there i must go up and say a kind word to poor dolly while you can paddle on and let blossom know im near at hand  the beehunter complied in silence casting curious glances upward at the woman while doing so in order to ascertain what sort of a female whiskey centre could possibly have for a wife to his surprise dorothy waring was not only decently but she was neatly clad appearing as if she had studiously attended to her personal appearance in the hope of welcoming her wayward and unfortunate husband back to his forest home this much le bourdon saw by a hasty glance as his companion landed for a feeling of delicacy prevented him from taking a longer look at the woman as gershom ascended the bank to meet his wife le bourdon paddled on and landed just below the grove in which was the chiente it might have been his long exclusion from all of the other sex and most especially from that portion of it which retains its better looks but the being which now met the beehunter appeared to him to belong to another world rather than to that in which he habitually dwelt as this was margery waring who was almost uniformly called blossom by her acquaintances and who is destined to act an important part in this legend of the openings it may be well to give a brief description of her age attire and personal appearance at the moment when she was first seen by le bourdon  in complexion color of the hair and outline of face margery waring bore a strong family resemblance to her brother in spite of exposure and the reflection of the suns rays from the water of the lake however her skin was of a clear transparent white such as one might look for in a drawingroom but hardly expect to find in a wilderness while the tint of her lips cheeks and in a diminished degree of her chin and ears were such as one who wielded a pencil might long endeavor to catch without succeeding her features had the chiselled outline which was so remarkable in her brother while in her countenance in addition to the softened expression of her sex and years there was nothing to denote any physical or moral infirmity to form a drawback to its witchery and regularity her eyes were blue and her hair as near golden as human tresses well could be exercise a life of change and of dwelling much in the open air had given to this unusually charming girl not only health but its appearance still she was in no respect coarse or had anything in the least about her that indicated her being accustomed to toil with some slight exception in her hands perhaps which were those of a girl who did not spare herself when there was an opportunity to be of use in this particular the vagrant life of her brother had possibly been of some advantage to her as it had prevented her being much employed in the ordinary toil of her condition in life still margery waring had that happy admixture of delicacy and physical energy which is perhaps oftener to be met in the american girl of her class than in the girl of almost any other nation and far oftener than in the young american of her sex who is placed above the necessity of labor  as a stranger approached her the countenance of this fair creature expressed both surprise and satisfaction surprise that any one should have been met by gershom in such a wilderness and satisfaction that the stranger proved to be a white man and seemingly one who did not drink  you are blossom said the beehunter taking the hand of the half reluctant girl in a way so respectful and friendly that she could not refuse it even while she doubted the propriety of thus receiving an utter strangerthe blossom of whom gershom waring speaks so often and so affectionately  you are then my brothers friend answered margery smiling so sweetly that le bourdon gazed on her with delight we are so glad that he has come back five terrible nights have sister and i been here alone and we have believed every bush was a red man  that danger is over now blossom but there is still an enemy near you that must be overcome  an enemy there is no one here but dolly and myself no one has been near us since gershom went after the beehunter whom we heard was out in the openings are you that beebunter  i am beautiful blossom and i tell you there is an enemy here in your cabin that must be looked to  we fear no enemies but the red men and we have seen none of them since we reached this river what is the name of the enemy you so dread and where is he to be found  his name is whiskey and he is kept somewhere in this hut in casks show me the place that i may destroy him before his friend comes to his assistance  a gleam of bright intelligence flashed into the face of the beautiful young creature first she reddened almost to scarlet then her face became pale as death compressing her lips intensely she stood irresolutenow gazing at the pleasing and seemingly well disposed stranger before her now looking earnestly toward the still distant forms of her brother and sister which were slowly advancing in the direction of the cabin  dare you margery at length asked pointing toward her brother  i dare he is now quite sober and may be reasoned with for the sake of us all let us profit by this advantage  he keeps the liquor in two casks that you will find under the shed behind the hut  this said the girl covered her face with both her hands and sunk on a stool as if afraid to be a witness of that which was to follow as for le bourdon he did not delay a moment but passed out of the cabin by a second door that opened in its rear there were the two barrels and by their side an axe his first impulse was to dash in the heads of the casks where they stood but a moments reflection told him that the odor so near the cabin would be unpleasant to every one and might have a tendency to exasperate the owner of the liquor he cast about him therefore for the means of removing the casks in order to stave them at a distance from the dwelling  fortunately the cabin of whiskey centre stood on the brow of a sharp descent at the bottom of which ran a brawling brook at another moment le bourdon would have thought of saving the barrels but time pressed and he could not delay seizing the barrel next to him he rolled it without difficulty to the brow of the declivity and set it off with a powerful shove of his foot it was the half empty cask and away it went the liquor it contained washing about as it rolled over and over until hitting a rock about halfway down the declivity the hoops gave way when the staves went over the little precipice and the water of the stream was tumbling through all that remained of the cask at the next instant a slight exclamation of delight behind him caused the beehunter to look round and he saw margery watching his movement with an absorbed interest her smile was one of joy not unmingled with terror and she rather whispered than said aloudthe otherthe otherthat is fullbe quick there is no time to lose the beehunter seized the second cask and rolled it toward the brow of the rocks it was not quite as easily handled as the other barrel but his strength sufficed and it was soon bounding down the declivity after its companion the second cask hit the same rock as the first whence it leaped off the precipice and aided by its greater momentum it was literally dashed in pieces at its base  not only was this barrel broken into fragments but its hoops and staves were carried down the torrent driving before them those of the sister cask until the whole were swept into the lake which was some distance from the cabin  that job is well done exclaimed le bourdon when the last fragment of the wreck was taken out of sight no man will ever turn himself into a beast by means of that liquor  god be praised murmured margery he is so different stranger when he has been drinking from what he is when he has not you have been sent by providence to do us this good  i can easily believe that for it is so with us all but you must not call me stranger sweet margery for now that you and i have this secret between us i am a stranger no longer  the girl smiled and blushed then she seemed anxious to ask a question in the mean time they left the shed and took seats in waiting for the arrival of gershom and his wife it was not long ere the last entered the countenance of the wife beaming with a satisfaction she made no effort to conceal dolly was not as beautiful as her sisterinlaw still she was a comely woman though one who had been stricken by sorrow she was still young and might have been in the pride of her good looks had it not been for the manner in which she had grieved over the fall of gershom the joy that gladdens a womans heart however was now illuminating her countenance and she welcomed le bourdon most cordially as if aware that he had been of service to her husband for months she had not seen gershom quite himself until that evening  i have told dolly all our adventurs bourdon cried gershom as soon as the brief greetings were over and she tells me alls right hereabouts three canoeloads of injins passed along shore goin up the lake she tells me this very aternoon but they didnt see the smoke the fire bein out and must have thought the hut empty if indeed they knew anythin of it at all  the last is the most likely remarked margery for i watched them narrowly from the beeches on the shore and there was no pointing or looking up as would have happened had there been any one among them who could show the others a cabin houses ant so plenty in this part of the country that travellers pass without turning round to look at them an injin has curiosity as well as a white man though he manages so often to conceal it  didnt you say blossom that one of the canoes was much behind the others and that a warrior in that canoe did look up toward this grove as if searching for the cabin asked dorothy  either it was so or my fears made it seem so the two canoes that passed first were well filled with injins each having eight in it while the one that came last held but four warriors they were a mile apart and the last canoe seemed to be trying to overtake the others i did think that nothing but their haste prevented the men in the last canoe from landing but my fears may have made that seem so that was not so  as the cheek of the charming girl flushed with excitement and her race became animated margery appeared marvellously handsome more so the beehunter fancied than any other female he had ever before seen but her words impressed him quite as much as her looks for he at once saw the importance of such an event to persons in their situation the wind was rising on the lake and it was ahead for the canoes should the savages feel the necessity of making a harbor they might return to the mouth of the kalamazoo a step that would endanger all their lives in the event of these indians proving to belong to those whom there was now reason to believe were in british pay in times of peace the intercourse between the whites and the red men was usually amicable and seldom led to violence unless through the effects of liquor but a price being placed on scalps a very different state of things might be anticipated as a consequence of the hostilities this was then a matter to be looked to and as evening was approaching no time was to be lost  the shores of michigan are generally low nor are harbors either numerous or very easy of access it would be difficult indeed to find in any other part of the world so great an extent of coast that possesses so little protection for the navigator as that of this very lake there are a good many rivers it is true but usually they have bars and are not easy of entrance this is the reason why that very convenient glove the constitution which can be made to fit any hand has been discovered to have an extra finger in it which points out a mode by which the federal government can create ports wherever nature has forgotten to perform this beneficent office it is a little extraordinary that the fingers of so many of the great expounders turn out to be thumbs however exhibiting clumsiness rather than that adroit lightness which usually characterizes the dexterity of men who are in the habit of rummaging other peoples pockets for their own especial purposes it must be somewhat uphill work to persuade any disinterested and clearheaded man that a political power to regulate commerce goes the length of making harbors the one being in a great measure a moral while the other is exclusively a physical agency any more than it goes the length of making warehouses and cranes and carts and all the other physical implements for carrying on trade now what renders all this thumbing of the constitution so much the more absurd is the fact that the very generous compact interested does furnish a means by which the poverty of ports on the great lakes may be remedied without making any more unnecessary rents in the great national glove congress clearly possesses the power to create and maintain a navy which includes the power to create all sorts of necessary physical appliances and among others places of refuge for that navy should they be actually needed as a vessel of war requires a harbor and usually a better harbor than a merchantvessel it strikes us the expounders would do well to give this thought a moments attention behind it will be found the most unanswerable argument in favor of the lighthouses too  but to return to the narrative the kalamazoo could be entered by canoes though it offered no very available shelter for a vessel of any size there was no other shelter for the savages for several miles to the southward and should the wind increase of which there were strong indications it was not only possible but highly probable that the canoes would return according to the account of the females they had passed only two hours before and the breeze had been gradually gathering strength ever since it was not unlikely indeed that the attention paid to the river by the warrior in the last canoe may have had reference to this very state of the weather and his haste to overtake his companions been connected with a desire to induce them to seek a shelter all this presented itself to the beehunters mind at once and it was discussed between the members of the party freely and not without some grave apprehensions  there was one elevated pointelevated comparatively if not in a very positive sensewhence the eye could command a considerable distance along the lake shore thither margery now hastened to look after the canoes boden accompanied her and together they proceeded side by side with a newborn but lively and increasing confidence that was all the greater in consequence of their possessing a common secret  brother must be much better than he was the girl observed as they hurried on for he has not once been into the shed to look at the barrels before he went into the openings he never entered the house without drinking and sometimes he would raise the cup to his mouth as often as three times in the first halfhour now he does not seem even to think of it  it may be well that he can find nothing to put into his cup should he fall into his old ways one is never sure of a man of such habits until he is placed entirely out of harms way  gershom is such a different being when he has not been drinking rejoined the sister in a touching manner we love him and strive to do all we can to keep him up but it is hard  i am surprised that you should have come into this wilderness with any one of bad habits  why not he is my brother and i have no parentshe is all to me and what would become of dorothy if i were to quit her too she has lost most of her friends since gershom fell into these ways and it would quite break her heart did i desert her  all this speaks well for you pretty margery but it is not the less surprisingah there is my canoe in plain sight of all who enter the river that must be concealed injins or no injins  it is only a step further to the place where we can get a lookout just there beneath the burroak hours and hours have i sat on that spot with my sewing while gershom was gone into the openings  and dollywhere was she while you were here  poor dollyi do think she passed quite half her time up at the beechtree where you first saw her looking if brother was not coming home it is a cruel thing to a wife to have a truant husband  which i hope may never be your case pretty margery and which i think never can  margery did not answer but the speech must have been heard uttered as it was in a much lower tone of voice than the young man had hitherto used for the charming maiden looked down and blushed fortunately the two now soon arrived at the tree and their conversation naturally reverted to the subject which had brought them there three canoes were in sight close in with the land but so distant as to render it for some time doubtful which way they were moving at first the beehunter said that they were still going slowly to the southward but he habitually carried his little glass and on levelling that it was quite apparent that the savages were paddling before the wind and making for the mouth of the river this was a very grave fact and as blossom flew to communicate it to her brother and his wife le bourdon moved toward his own canoe and looked about for a place of concealment  several considerations had to be borne in mind in disposing of the canoes for that of gershom was to be secreted as well as that of the beehunter a tall aquatic plant that is termed wild rice and which we suppose to be the ordinary riceplant unimproved by tillage grows spontaneously about the mouths and on the flats of most of the rivers of the part of michigan of which we are writing as indeed it is to be found in nearly all the shallow waters of those regions there was a good deal of this rice at hand and the beehunter paddling his own canoe and towing the other entered this vegetable thicket choosing a channel that had been formed by some accident of nature and which wound through the herbage in a way soon to conceal all that came within its limits these channels were not only numerous but exceedingly winding and the beehunter had no sooner brought his canoes to the firm ground and fastened them there than he ascended a tree and studied the windings of these narrow passages until he had got a general idea of their direction and characters this precaution taken he hurried back to the hut  well gershom have you settled on the course to be taken were the first words uttered by the beehunter when he rejoined the family of whiskey centre  we havent answered the husband sister begs us to quit the chiente for the indians must soon be here but wife seems to think that she must be safe now im at home agin  then wife is wrong and sister is right if you will take my advice you will hide all your effects in the woods and quit the cabin as soon as possible the injins cannot fail to see this habitation and will be certain to destroy all they find in it and that they do not carry off besides the discovery of the least article belonging to a white man will set them on our trail for scalps will soon bear a price at montreal in half an hour all that is here can be removed into the thicket that is luckily so near and by putting out the fire with care and using proper caution we may give the place such a deserted look that the savages will suspect nothing  if they enter the river bourdon they will not camp out with a wigwam so near by and should they come here what is to prevent their seein the footprints we shall leave behind us  the night and that only before morning their own footsteps will be so plenty as to deceive them luckily we all wear moccasins which is a great advantage just now but every moment is precious and we should be stirring let the women take the beds and bedding while you and i shoulder this chest up it goes and away with it  gershom had got to be so much under his companions influence that he complied though his mind suggested various objections to the course taken to which his tongue gave utterance as they busied themselves in this task the effects of whiskey centre had been gradually diminishing in quantity as well as in value for the last three years and were now of no great amount in any sense still there were two chests one large and one small the last contained all that a generous regard for the growing wants of the family had left to margery while the first held the joint wardrobes of the husband and wife with a few other articles that were considered as valuable among other things were half a dozen of very thin silver teaspoons which had fallen to gershom on a division of family plate the other six were carefully wrapped up in paper and put in the till of margerys chest being her portion of this species of property the americans generally have very little plate though here and there marked exceptions do exist nor do the humbler classes lay out much of their earnings in jewelry while they commonly dress far beyond their means in all other ways in this respect the european female of the same class in life frequently possesses as much in massive golden personal ornaments as would make an humble little fortune while her attire is as homely as cumbrous petticoats coarse cloth and a vile taste can render it on the other hand the american matron that has not a setone halfdozen of silver teaspoons must be poor indeed and can hardly be said to belong to the order of housekeepers at all by means of a careful mother both gershom and his sister had the halfdozen mentioned and they were kept more as sacred memorials of past and better days than as articles of any use the household goods of waring would have been limited by his means of transportation if not by his poverty two common lowpost maple bedsteads were soon uncorded and carried off as were the beds and bedding there was scarcely any crockery pewter and tin being its substitutes and as for chairs there was only one and that had rockers a practice of new england that has gradually diffused itself over the whole country looking down ridicule the drilling of boardingschools the comments of elderly ladies of the old school the sneers of nurses and in a word all that venerable ideas of decorum could suggest until this appliance of domestic ease has not only fairly planted itself in nearly every american dwelling but in a good many of europe also  it required about twenty minutes for the party to clear the cabin of every article that might induce an indian to suspect the presence of white men the furniture was carried to a sufficient distance to be safe from everything but a search and care was had to avoid as much as possible making a trail to lead the savages to the place selected for the temporary storeroom this was merely a close thicket into which there was a narrow but practicable entrance on the side the least likely to be visited when all was accomplished the four went to the lookout to ascertain how far the canoes had come it was soon ascertained that they were within a mile driving down before a strong breeze and following sea and impelled by as many paddles as there were living beings in them ten minutes would certainly bring them up with the bar and five more fairly within the river the question now arose where the party was to be concealed during the stay of the savages dolly as was perhaps natural for the housewife wished to remain by her worldly goods and pretty margery had a strong feminine leaning to do the same but neither of the men approved of the plan it was risking too much in one spot and a suggestion that the beehunter was not long in making prevailed  it will be remembered that le bourdon had carried the canoes within the field of wild rice and bestowed them there with a good deal of attention to security now these canoes offered in many respects better places of temporary refuge under all the circumstances than any other that could readily be found on shore they were dry and by spreading skins of which boden had so many comfortable beds might be made for the females which would be easily protected from the night air and dews by throwing a rug over the gunwales then each canoe contained many articles that would probably be wanted that of the beehunter in particular furnishing food in abundance as well as diverse other things that would be exceedingly useful to persons in their situation the great advantage of the canoes however in the mind of le bourdon was the facilities they offered for flight he hardly hoped that indian sagacity would be so far blinded as to prevent the discovery of the many footsteps they must have left in their hurried movements and he anticipated that with the return of day something would occur to render it necessary for them to seek safety by a stealthy removal from the spot this might be done he both hoped and believed under cover of the rice should sufficient care be taken to avoid exposure in placing the canoes he had used the precaution to leave them where they could not be seen from the cabin or its vicinity or indeed from any spot in the vicinity of the ground that the savages would be likely to visit during their stay all these reasons le bourdon now rapidly laid before his companions and to the canoes the whole party retired as fast as they could walk  there was great judgment displayed on the part of the beehunter in selecting the wild rice as a place of shelter at that season it was sufficiently grown to afford a complete screen to everything within it that did not exceed the height of a man or which was not seen from some adjacent elevation most of the land near the mouth of the river was low and the few spots which formed exceptions had been borne in mind when the canoes were taken into the field but just as gershom was on the point of putting a foot into his own canoe with a view to arrange it for the reception of his wife he drew back and exclaimed after the manner of one to whom a most important idea suddenly occurs  lands sake ive forgotten all about them barrels theyll fall into the hands of the savages and an awful time theyll make with them let me pass dolly i must look after the barrels this instant  while the wife gently detained her eager husband the beehunter quietly asked to what barrels he alluded  the whiskey casks was the answer theres two on em in the shed behind the hut and whiskey enough to set a whole tribe in commotion i wonder i should have overlooked the whiskey  it is a sign of great improvement friend waring and will lead to no bad consequences returned le bourdon coolly i foresaw the danger and rolled the casks down the hill where they were dashed to pieces in the brook and the liquor has long since been carried into the lake in the shape of grog  waring seemed astounded but was so completely mystified as not to suspect the truth that his liquor should be hopelessly lost was bad enough but even that was better than to have it drunk by savages without receiving any returns after groaning and lamenting over the loss for a few minutes he joined the rest of the party in making some further dispositions which le bourdon deemed prudent if not necessary  it had occurred to the beehunter to divide his own cargo between the two canoes which was the task that the whole party was now engaged in the object was to lighten his own canoe in the event of flight and by placing his effects in two parcels give a chance to those in the boat which might escape of having wherewithal to comfort and console themselves as soon as this new arrangement was completed le bourdon ran up to a tree that offered the desired facilities and springing into its branches was soon high enough to get a view of the bar and the mouth of the river by the parting light of day he distinctly saw four canoes coming up the stream which was one more than those reported to him by margery as having passed     chapter vi        and long shall timorous fancy see       the painted chief and pointed spear       and reasons self shall bow the knee       to shadows and delusions here                                  freneau   a bright moon reflected on the earth for about an hour the light of the sun as the latter luminary disappeared by its aid the bee hunter who still continued in the tree was enabled to watch the movements of the canoes of the indians though the persons they contained soon got to be so indistinct as to render it impossible to do more than count their numbers the last he made out to be five each in three of the canoes and six in the other making twentyone individuals in all this was too great an odds to think of resisting in the event of the strangers turning out to be hostile and the knowledge of this disparity in force admonished all the fugitives of the necessity of being wary and prudent  the strangers landed just beneath the hut or at the precise spot where whiskey centre was in the habit of keeping his canoe and whence boden had removed it only an hour or two before the savages had probably selected the place on account of its shores being clear of the wild rice and because the high ground near it promised both a lookout and comfortable lodgings several of the party strolled upward as if searching for an eligible spot to light their fire and one of them soon discovered the cabin the warrior announced his success by a whoop and a dozen of the indians were shortly collected in and about the chiente all this proved the prudence of the course taken by the fugitives  blossom stood beneath the tree and the beehunter told her as each incident occurred all that passed among the strangers when the girl communicated the same to her brother and his wife who were quite near at hand in one of the canoes as there was no danger of being overheard conversation in an ordinary tone passed between the parties two of whom at least were now fond of holding this sort of communion  do they seem to suspect the neighborhood of the occupants of the cabin asked margery when the beehunter had let her know the manner in which the savages had taken possession of her late dwelling  one cannot tell savages are always distrustful and cautious when on a warpath and these seem to be scenting about like so many hounds which are nosing for a trail they are now gathering sticks to light a fire which is better than burning the chiente  that they will not be likely to do until they have no further need of it tell me bourdon do any go near the thicket of alders where we have hidden our goods  not as yet though there is a sudden movement and many loud yells among them  heaven send that it may not be at having discovered anything we have forgotten the sight of even a lost dipper or cup would set them bloodhounds on our path as sure as we are white and they are savages  as i live they scent the whiskey there is a rush toward and a powwow in and about the shedyes of a certainty they smell the liquor some of it has escaped in rolling down the hill and their noses are too keen to pass over a fragrance that to them equals that of roses well let them scent as they mayeven an injin does not get drunk through his nose  you are quite right bourdon but is not this a most unhappy scent for us since the smell of whiskey can hardly be there without their seeing it did not grow in the woods of itself like an oak or a beech  i understand you margery and there is good sense in what you say they will never think the liquor grew there like a blackberry or a chestnut though the place is called whiskey centre  it is hard enough to know that a family has deserved such a name without being reminded of it by those that call themselves friends answered the girl pointedly after a pause of near a minute though she spoke in sorrow rather than in anger  in an instant the beehunter was at pretty margerys side making his peace by zealous apologies and winning protestations of respect and concern the mortified girl was soon appeased and after consulting together for a minute they went to the canoe to communicate to the husband and wife what they had seen  the whiskey after all is likely to prove our worst enemy said the beehunter as he approached it would seem that in moving the barrels some of the liquor has escaped and the nose of an injin is too quick for the odor it leaves not to scent it  much good may it do them growled gershomtheyve lost me that whiskey and let them long for it without gettin any as a punishment for the same my fortun would have been made could i only have got them two barrels as far as fort dearborn before the troops moved  the barrels might have been got there certainly answered le bourdon so much provoked at the mans regrets for the destroyer which had already come so near to bringing want and ruin on himself and family as momentarily to forget his recent scene with pretty margery but whether anything would have been in them is another question one of those i rolled to the brow of the hill was half empty as it was  gershom is so troubled with the ague if he dont take stimulant in this new country put in the wife in the apologetic manner in which woman struggles to conceal the failings of him she loves as for the whiskey i dont grudge that in the least for its a poor way of getting rich to be selling it to soldiers who want all the reason liquor has left em and more too still gershom needs bitters and ought not to have every drop he has taken thrown into his face  by this time le bourdon was again sensible of his mistake and he beat a retreat in the best manner he could secretly resolving not to place himself any more between two fires in consequence of further blunders on this delicate subject he now found that it was a very different thing to joke whiskey centre himself on the subject of his great failing from making even the most distant allusion to it in the presence of those who felt for a husbands and a brothers weakness with a liveliness of feeling that brutal indulgence had long since destroyed in the object of their solicitude he accordingly pointed out the risk there was that the indians should make the obvious inference that human beings must have recently been in the hut to leave the fresh scent of the liquor in question behind them this truth was so apparent that all felt its force though to no one else did the danger seem so great as to the bee hunter he had greater familiarity with the indian character than any of his companions and dreaded the sagacity of the savages in a just proportion to his greater knowledge he did not fail therefore to admonish his new friends of the necessity for vigilance  i will return to the tree and take another look at the movements of the savages le bourdon concluded by saying by this time their fire must be lighted and by the aid of my glass a better insight may be had into their plans and feelings  the beehunter now went back to his tree whither he was slowly followed by margery the girl yielding to a feverish desire to accompany him at the very time she was half restrained by maiden bashfulness though anxiety and the wish to learn the worst as speedily as possible prevailed  they have kindled a blazing fire and the whole of the inside of the house is as bright as if illuminated said le bourdon who was now carefully bestowed among the branches of his small tree there are lots of the red devils moving about the chiente inside and out and they seem to have fish as well as venison to cook aye there goes more dry brush on the fire to brighten up the picture and daylight is almost eclipsed as i live they have a prisoner among em  a prisoner exclaimed margery in the gentle tones of female pity not a white person surely  nohe is a redskin like all of thembutwait a minute till i can get the glass a little more steady yesit is soi was right at first  what is so bourdonand in what are you right  you may remember blossom that your brother and i spoke of the two injins who visited me in the openings one was a pottawattamie and the other a chippewa the first we found dead and scalped after he had left us and the last is now in yonder hut bound and a prisoner he has taken to the lake on his way to fort dearborn and has with all his craft and resolution fallen into enemies hands well will it be for him if his captors do not learn what befell the warrior who was slain near my cabin and left seated against a tree  do you think these savages mean to revenge the death of their brother on this unfortunate wretch  i know that he is in the pay of our general at detroit while the pottawattamies are in the pay of the english this of itself would make them enemies and has no doubt been the cause of his being taken but i do not well see how injins on the lake here can know anything of what happened some fifty miles or so up in the openings  perhaps the savages in the canoes belong to the same party as the warrior you call elksfoot and that they have had the means of learning his death and by whose hand he fell  the beehunter was surprised at the quickness of the girls wit the suggestion being as discreet as it was ingenious the manner in which intelligence flies through the wilderness had often surprised him and certainly it was possible that the party now before him might have heard of the fate of the chief whose body he had found in the openings short as was the time for the news to have gone so far the circumstance that the canoes had come from the northward was against the inference however and after musing a minute on the facts le bourdon mentioned this objection to his companion  are we certain these are the same canoes as those which i saw pass this afternoon asked margery who comprehended the difficulty in an instant of those i saw two passed first and one followed while here are four that have landed  what you say may be true enough we are not to suppose that the canoes you saw pass are all that are on the lake but let the savages be whom they may prudence tells us to keep clear of them if we can and this more so than ever now i can see that pigeonswing who i know to be an american injin is treated by them as an enemy  how are the savages employed now bourdon do they prepare to eat or do they torture their prisoner  no fear of their attempting the last tonight there is an uneasiness about them as if they still smelt the liquor but some are busy cooking at the fire i would give all my honey pretty margery to be able to save pigeonswing he is a good fellow for a savage and is heart and hand with us in this new war that he tells me has begun between us and the english  you surely would not risk your own life to save a savage who kills and scalps at random as this man has done  in that he has but followed the habits of his color and race i dare say we do things that are quite as bad according to injin ways of thinking i do believe margery was that man to see me in the hands of the pottawattamies as i now see him he would undertake something for my relief  but what can you a single man do when there are twenty against you asked margery a little reproachfully as to manner speaking like one who had more interest in the safety of the young beehunter than she chose very openly to express  no one can say what he can do till he tries i do not like the way they are treating that chippewa for it looks as if they meant to do him harm he is neither fed nor suffered to be with his masters but there the poor fellow is bound hand and foot near the cabin door and lashed to a tree they do not even give him the relief of suffering him to sit down  the gentle heart of margery was touched by this account of the manner in which the captive was treated and she inquired into other particulars concerning his situation with a more marked interest than she had previously manifested in his state the beehunter answered her questions as they were put and the result was to place the girl in possession of a minute detail of the true manner in which pigeonswing was treated  although there was probably no intention on the part of the captors of the chippewa to torture him before his time tortured he must have been by the manner in which his limbs and body were confined not only were his arms fastened behind his back at the elbows but the hands were also tightly bound together in front the legs had ligatures in two places just above the knees and just below the ankles around the body was another fastening which secured the captive to a beech that stood about thirty feet from the door of the cabin and so nearly in a line with the fire within and the lookout of le bourdon as to enable the last distinctly to note these particulars aided as he was by his glass relying on the manner in which they secured their prisoner the savages took little heed of him but each appeared bent on attending to his own comfort by means of a good supper and by securing a dry lair in which to pass the night all this le bourdon saw and noted too ere he dropped lightly on his feet by the side of margery at the root of the tree  without losing time that was precious the beehunter went at once to the canoes and communicated his intention to waring the moon had now set and the night was favorable to the purpose of le bourdon at the first glance it might seem wisest to wait until sleep had fallen upon the savages ere any attempt were made to approach the hut but boden reasoned differently a general silence would succeed as soon as the savages disposed of themselves to sleep which would be much more likely to allow his footsteps to be overheard than when tongues and bodies and teeth were all in active movement a man who eats after a long march or a severe paddling usually concentrates his attention on his food as le bourdon knew by long experience and it is a much better moment to steal upon the hungry and weary to do so when they feed than to do so when they sleep provided anything like a watch be kept that the pottawattamie would neglect this latter caution le bourdon did not believe and his mind was made up not only to attempt the rescue of his chippewa friend but to attempt it at once  after explaining his plan in a few words and requesting warings assistance le bourdon took a solemn leave of the party and proceeded at once toward the hut in order to understand the movements of the beehunter it may be well now briefly to explain the position of the chiente and the nature of the ground on which the adventurer was required to act the hut stood on a low and somewhat abrupt swell being surrounded on all sides by land so low as to be in many places wet and swampy there were a good many trees on the knoll and several thickets of alders and other bushes on the lower ground but on the whole the swamps were nearly devoid of what is termed timber two sides of the knoll were abrupt that on which the casks had been rolled into the lake and that opposite which was next to the tree where boden had so long been watching the proceedings of the savages the distance between the hut and this tree was somewhat less than a mile the intervening ground was low and most of it was marshy though it was possible to cross the marsh by following a particular course fortunately this course which was visible to the eye by daylight and had been taken by the fugitives on quitting the hut might be dimly traced at night by one who understood the ground by means of certain trees and bushes that formed so many fingerposts for the traveller unless this particular route were taken however a circuit of three or four miles must be made in order to pass from the chiente to the spot where the family had taken refuge as le bourdon had crossed this firm ground by daylight and had observed it well from his tree he thought himself enough of a guide to find his way through it in the dark aided by the marks just mentioned  the beehunter had got as far as the edge of the marsh on his way toward the hut when pausing an instant to examine the priming of his rifle he fancied that he heard a light footstep behind him turning quick as thought he perceived that pretty margery had followed him thus far although time pressed he could not part from the girl without showing that he appreciated the interest she manifested in his behalf taking her hand therefore he spoke with a simplicity and truth that imparted to his manner a natural grace that one bred in courts might have envied what was more with a delicacy that few in course would deem necessary under the circumstances he did not in his language so much impute to concern on his own account this movement of margerys as to that she felt for her brother and sister though in his inmost heart a throbbing hope prevailed that he had his share in it  do not be troubled on account of gershom and his wife pretty margery said the beehunter which as i perceive is the main reason why you have come here and as for myself be certain that i shall not forget who i have left behind and how much her safety depends on my prudence  margery was pleased though a good deal confused it was new to her to hear allusions of this sort but nature supplied the feeling to appreciate them  is it not risking too much bourdon she said are you sure of being able to find the crossing in the marsh in a night so very dark i do not know but looking so long at the bright light in the cabin may blind me but it does seem as if i never saw a darker night  the darkness increases for the starlight is gone but i can see where i go and so long as i can do that there is not much fear of losing my way i do not like to expose you to danger but  never mind me bourdonset me to do anything in which you think i can be of use exclaimed the girl eagerly  well then margery you may do this come with me to the large tree in the centre of the marsh and i will set you on a duty that may possibly save my life i will tell you my meaning when there  margery followed with a light impatient step and as neither stopped to speak or to look around the two soon stood beneath the tree in question it was a large elm that completely overshadowed a considerable extent of firm ground here a full and tolerably near view could be had of the hut which was still illuminated by the blazing fire within for a minute both stood silently gazing at the strange scene then le bourdon explained to his companion the manner in which she might assist him  once at the elm it was not so difficult to find the way across the marsh as it was to reach that spot coming from the chiente as there were several elms scattered about in the centre of the marsh the beehunter was fearful that he might not reach the right tree in which case he would be compelled to retrace his steps and that at the imminent hazard of being captured he carried habitually a small dark lantern and had thought of so disposing of it in the lower branches of this very elm as to form a focus of it but hesitated about doing that which might prove a guide to his enemies as well as to himself if margery would take charge of this lantern he could hope to reap its advantages without incurring the hazard of having a light suspended in the tree for any length of time margery understood the lessons she received and promised to obey all the injunctions by which they were accompanied  now god bless you margery added the beehunter providence has brought me and your brothers family together in troublesome times should i get back safe from this adventure i shall look upon it as a duty to do all i can to help gershom place his wife and sister beyond the reach of harm  god bless you bourdon half whispered the agitated girl i know it is worth some risk to save a human life even though it be that of an injin and i will not try to persuade you from this undertaking but do not attempt more than is necessary and rely on my using the lantern just as you have told me to use it  those young persons had not yet known each other a single day yet both felt that confidence which years alone in the crowds of the world can ordinarily create in the human mind the cause of the sympathy which draws heart to heart which generates friendships and love and passionate attachments is not obvious to all who choose to talk of it there is yet a profound mystery in our organization which has hitherto escaped the researches of both classes of philosophers and which it probably was the design of the creator should not be made known to us until we draw nearer to that great end which sooner or later is to be accomplished in behalf of our race when knowledge will abound and we shall better understand our being and its objects than is permitted to us in this our day of ignorance but while we cannot trace the causes of a thousand things we know and feel their effects among the other mysteries of our nature is this of sudden and strong sympathies which as between men for men and women for women awaken confidence and friendship and as between those of different sexes excite passionate attachments that more or less color their future lives the great delineator of our common nature in no one of the many admirable pictures he has drawn of men manifests a more profound knowledge of his subject than in that in which he portrays the sudden and nearly ungovernable inclination which romeo and juliet are made to display for each other an inclination that sets reason habit prejudice and family enmities at defiance that such an attachment is to be commended we do not say that all can feel it we do not believe that connections formed under its influence can always be desirable we are far from thinking but that it may exist we believe is just as certain as any of the incomprehensible laws of our wayward and yet admirable nature we have no veronese tale to relate here however but simply a homely legend in which human feeling may occasionally be made to bear an humble resemblance to that worldrenowned picture which had its scenes in the beautiful capital of venetian lombardy  when le bourdon left his companion now so intensely interested in his success to pick his way in the darkness across the remainder of the marsh margery retired behind the tree where the first thing she did was to examine her lantern and to see that its light was ready to perform the very important office which might so speedily be required of it satisfied on this point she turned her eyes anxiously in the direction of the hut by this time every trace of the beehunter was lost the hillock in his front forming too dark a background to admit of his being seen but the fire still blazed in the chiente the savages not having yet finished their cooking though several had satisfied their appetites and had already sought places where they might stretch themselves for the night margery was glad to see that these last individuals bestowed themselves within the influence of the fire warm as was the night this was done most probably to escape from the annoyance of the mosquitos more or less of which are usually found in the low lands of the new countries and near the margins of rivers  margery could distinctly see the chippewa erect and bound to his tree on him she principally kept her looks riveted for near his person did she expect first again to find the beehunter indeed there was no chance of seeing one who was placed beneath the light of the fire since the brow of the acclivity formed a complete cover throwing all below it into deep shade this circumstance was of the greatest importance to the adventurer however enabling him to steal quite near to his friend favored by a darkness that was getting to be intense quitting margery we will now rejoin le bourdon who by this time was approaching his goal  the beehunter had some difficulty in finding his way across the marsh but floundering through the impediments and on the whole preserving the main direction he got out on the firm ground quite as soon as he had expected to do it was necessary for him to use extreme caution the indians according to their custom had dogs two of which had been in sight lying about halfway between the prisoner and the door of the hut boden had seen a savage feeding these dogs and it appeared to him at the time as if the indian had been telling them to be watchful of the chippewa he well knew the services that the red men expected of these animals which are kept rather as sentinels than for any great use they put them to in the hunts an indian dog is quick enough to give the alarm and he will keep on a trail for a long run and with considerable accuracy but it is seldom that he closes and has his share in the death unless in the case of very timid and powerless creatures  nevertheless the presence of these dogs exacted extra caution in the movements of the beehunter he had ascended the hill a little out of the stream of light which still issued from the open door of the hut and was soon high enough to get a good look at the state of things on the bit of level land around the cabin fully onehalf of the savages were yet up and in motion though the processes of cooking and eating were by this time nearly ended these men had senses almost as acute as those of their dogs and it was very necessary to be on his guard against them also by moving with the utmost caution le bourdon reached the edge of the line of light where he was within ten yards of the captive here he placed his rifle against a small tree and drew his knife in readiness to cut the prisoners thongs three several times while the beehunter was making these preparations did the two dogs raise their heads and scent the air once the oldest of the two gave a deep and most ominous growl singular as it may seem this last indication of giving the alarm was of great service to le bourdon and the chippewa the latter heard the growl and saw two of the movements of the animals heads from all which he inferred that there was some creature or some danger behind him this naturally enough induced him to bestow a keen attention in that direction and being unable to turn body limbs or head the sense of hearing was his only means of watchfulness it was while in this state of profound listening that pigeonswing fancied he heard his own name in such a whisper as one raises when he wishes to call from a short distance with the least possible expenditure of voice presently the words pigeonswing and chippewa were succeeded by those of bee hunter bourdon this was enough the quickwitted warrior made a low ejaculation such as might be mistaken for a halfsuppressed murmur that proceeded from pain but which one keenly on the watch and who was striving to communicate with him would be apt to understand as a sign of attention the whispering then ceased altogether and the prisoner waited the result with the stoic patience of an american indian a minute later the chippewa felt the thongs giving way and his arms were released at the elbows an arm was next passed round his body and the fastenings at the wrist were cut at this instant a voice whispered in his ear be of good heart chippewayour friend bourdon is here can you stand  no stand answered the indian in a low whispertoo much tie  at the next moment the feet of the chippewa were released as were also his knees of all the fastenings none now remained but that which bound the captive to the tree in not cutting this the bee hunter manifested his coolness and judgment for were the stout rope of bark severed the indian would have fallen like a log from total inability to stand his thongs had impeded the circulation of the blood and the usual temporary paralysis had been the consequence pigeonswing understood the reason of his friends forbearance and managed to rub his hands and wrists together while the beehunter himself applied friction to his feet by passing his own arms around the bottom of the tree the reader may imagine the intense anxiety of margery the while for she witnessed the arrival of le bourdon at the tree and could not account for the long delay which succeeded  all this time the dogs were far from being quiet or satisfied their masters accustomed to being surrounded at night by wolves and foxes or other beasts took little heed however of the discontent of these creatures which were in the habit of growling in their lairs the beehunter as he kept rubbing at his friends legs felt now but little apprehension of the dogs though a new source of alarm presented itself by the time the chippewa was barely able to sustain his weight on his feet and long before he could use them with anything like his former agility the manner in which the savages came together in the hut and the gestures made by their chief announced pretty plainly that a watch was about to be set for the night as it was probable that the sentinel would take his station near the prisoner the beehunter was at a loss to decide whether it were better to commence the flight before or after the rest of the savages were in their lairs placing his mouth as close to the ear of pigeonswing as could be done without bringing his head into the light the following dialogue passed between le bourdon and the captive  do you see chippewa the beehunter commenced the chief is telling one of the young men to come and keep guard near you  see him well nough make too many sign no to see  what think youshall we wait till the warriors are asleep or try to be off before the sentinel comes  bess wait if one ting you got riflegot tomahawkgot knife eh  i have them all though my rifle is a short distance behind me and a little down the hill  dat badnebber let go rifle on warpath well you tomahawk him i scalp himdatll do  i shall kill no man chippewa unless there is great occasion for it if there is no other mode of getting you off i shall choose to cut this last thong and leave you to take care of yourself  give him tomahawk dengive him knife too  not for such a purpose i do not like to shed blood without a good reason for it  no call war good reason eh bess reason in world pottawattamie dig up hatchet agin great fadder at washtondat no good reason why take his scalp eh  in whispering these last words the chippewa used so much energy that the dogs again raised their heads from between their forepaws and growled almost at that instant the chief and his few remaining wakeful companions laid themselves down to sleep and the young warrior designated as the sentinel left the hut and came slowly toward the prisoner the circumstances admitted of no delay le bourdon pressed the keen edge of his knife across the withe that bound the indian to the tree first giving him notice in order that he might be prepared to sustain his own weight this done the bee hunter dropped on the ground crawling away out of the light though the brow of the hill almost immediately formed a screen to conceal his person from all near the hut in another instant he had regained his rifle and was descending swiftly toward the crossing at the marsh     chapter vii        we call them savageoh be just         their outraged feelings scan       a voice comes forth tis from the dust         the savage was a man                                  sprague   as soon as le bourdon reached the commencement of that which might be called his path across the marsh he stopped and looked backward he was now sufficiently removed from the low acclivity to see objects on its summit and had no difficulty in discerning all that the waning fire illuminated there stood the chippewa erect against the tree as if still bound with thongs while the sentinel was slowly approaching him the dogs were on their feet and gave two or three sharp barks which had the effect to cause five or six of the savages to lift their heads in their lairs one arose even and threw an armful of dried branches on the fire producing a bright blaze that brought everything around the hut and which the light could touch into full view  the beehunter was astonished at the immovable calmness with which pigeonswing still stood to his tree awaiting the approach of the sentinel in a few moments the latter was at his side at first the pottawattamie did not perceive that the prisoner was unbound he threw him into shadow by his own person and it required a close look to note the circumstance boden was too far from the spot to see all the minor movements of the parties but there was soon a struggle that could not be mistaken as the pottawattamie was examining the prisoner an exclamation that escaped him betrayed the sudden consciousness that the chippewa was unbound the sound was no sooner uttered than pigeonswing made a grasp at the sentinels knife which however he did not obtain when the two closed and fell rolling down the declivity into the darkness when the pottawattamie seized the chippewa he uttered a yell which instantly brought every man of his party to his feet as the savages now united in the whoops and the dogs began to bark wildly an infernal clamor was made  at first le bourdon did not know how to act he greatly feared the dogs and could not but think of margery and the probable consequences should those sagacious animals follow him across the marsh but he did not like the idea of abandoning pigeonswing when a single blow of his arm or a kick of his foot might be the cause of his escape while deliberating in painful uncertainty the sounds of the struggle ceased and he saw the sentinel rising again into the light limping like one who had suffered by a fall presently he heard a footstep near him and calling in a low voice he was immediately joined by pigeonswing before the beehunter was aware of his intention the chippewa seized his rifle and levelling at the sentinel who still stood on the brow of the hill drawn in all his savage outlines distinctly in the light of the flames he fired the cry the leap into the air and the fall announced the unerring character of the aim in coming to the earth the wounded man fell over the brow of the sharp acclivity and was heard rolling toward its base  le bourdon felt the importance of now improving the precious moments and was in the act of urging his companion to follow when the latter passed an arm around his body whipped his knife from the girdle and sheath and dropping the rifle into his friends arms bounded away in the darkness taking the direction of his fallen enemy there was no mistaking all this chippewa led by his own peculiar sense of honor risking everything to obtain the usual trophy of victory by this time a dozen of the savages stood on the brow of the hill seemingly at a loss to understand what had become of the combatants perceiving this the beehunter profited by the delay and reloaded his rifle as everything passed almost as swiftly as the electric spark is known to travel it was but a moment after the pottawattamie fell ere his conqueror was through with his bloody task just as le bourdon threw his rifle up into the hollow of his arm he was rejoined by his red friend who bore the reeking scalp of the sentinel at his belt though fortunately the beehunter did not see it on account of the obscurity else might he not have been so willing to continue to act with so ruthless an ally  further stay was out of the question for the indians were now collected in a body on the brow of the hill where the chief was rapidly issuing his orders in a minute the band dispersed every man bounding into the darkness as if aware of the danger of remaining within the influence of the bright light thrown from the fire then came such a clamor from the dogs as left no doubt in the mind of the beehunter that they had scented and found the remains of the fallen man a fierce yell came from the same spot the proof that some of the savages had already discovered the body and le bourdon told his companion to follow taking his way across the marsh as fast as he could overcome the difficulties of the path  it has already been intimated that it was not easy if indeed it were possible to cross that piece of low wet land in a direct line there was tolerably firm ground on it but it lay in an irregular form its presence being generally to be noted by the growth of trees le bourdon had been very careful in taking his landmarks foreseeing the probability of a hasty retreat and he had no difficulty for some time in keeping in the right direction but the dogs soon left the dead body and came bounding across the marsh disregarding its difficulties though their plunges and yells soon made it apparent that even they did not escape altogether with dry feet as for the savages they poured down the declivity in a stream taking the dogs as their guides and safe ones they might well be accounted so far as the scent was concerned though they did not happen to be particularly well acquainted with all the difficulties of the path  at length le bourdon paused causing his companion to stop also in the hurry and confusion of the flight the former had lost his landmarks finding himself amidst a copse of small trees or large bushes but not in the particular copse he sought every effort to get out of this thicket except by the way he had entered it proved abortive and the dogs were barking at no great distance in his rear it is true that these animals no longer approached for they were floundering in the mud and water but their throats answered every purpose to lead the pursuers on and the low calls that passed from mouth to mouth let the pursued understand that the pottawattamies were at their heels if not absolutely on their trail  the crisis demanded both discretion and decision qualities in which the beehunter with his forest training was not likely to be deficient he looked out for the path by which he had reached the unfortunate thicket and having found it commenced a retreat by the way he had come nerve was needed to move almost in a line toward the dogs and their masters but the nerve was forthcoming and the two advanced like veterans expecting the fire of some concealed but wellarmed battery presently le bourdon stopped and examined the ground on which he stood  here we must turn chippewa he said in a guarded voice this is the spot where i must have missed my way  good place to turn bout answered the indiandog too near  we must shoot the dogs if they press us too hard returned the beehunter leading off rapidly now secure in the right direction they seem to be in trouble just at this time but animals like them will soon find their way across this marsh  bess shoot pottawattamie coolly returned pigeonswing pottawattamie got capital scalpdogs ears no good for nutting any more  yonder i believe is the tree i am in search of exclaimed le bourdon if we can reach that tree i think all will go well with us  the tree was reached and the beehunter proceeded to make sure of his course from that point removing from his pouch a small piece of moistened powder that he had prepared ere he liberated the chippewa he stuck it on a low branch of the tree he was under and on the side next the spot where he had stationed margery when this was done he made his companion stand aside and lighting some spunk with his flint and steel he fired his powder of course this little preparation burned like the fireworks of a boy making sufficient light however to be seen in a dark night for a mile or more no sooner was the wetted powder hissing and throwing off its sparks than the beehunter gazed intently into the now seemingly tangible obscurity of the marsh a bright light appeared and vanished it was enough the beehunter threw down his own signal and extinguished it with his foot and as he wished the lantern of margery appeared no more assured now of the accuracy of his position as well as of the course he was to pursue le bourdon bade his companion follow and pressed anew across the marsh a tree was soon visible and toward that particular object the fugitives steadily pressed until it was reached at the next instant margery was joined and the beehunter could not refrain from kissing her in the excess of his pleasure  there is a dreadful howling of dogs said margery feeling no offence at the liberty taken in a moment like that and it seems to me that a whole tribe is following at their heels for heavens sake bourdon let us hasten to the canoes brother and sister must think us lost  the circumstances pressed and the beehunter took margerys arm passing it through one of his own with a decided and protecting manner that caused the girls heart to beat with emotions not in the least connected with fear leaving an impression of pleasure even at that perilous moment as the distance was not great the three were soon on the beach and near to the canoes here they met dorothy alone and pacing to and fro like a person distressed she had doubtless heard the clamor and was aware that the savages were out looking for their party as margery met her sister she saw that something more than common had gone wrong and in the eagerness of her apprehensions she did not scruple about putting her questions  what has become of brother where is gershom demanded the sensitive girl at once  the answer was given in a low voice and in that sort of manner with which woman struggles to the last to conceal the delinquencies of him she loves  gershom is not himself just now half whispered the wifehe has fallen into one of his old ways agin  old ways slowly repeated the sister dropping her own voice to tones similar to those in which the unpleasant news had just been communicated how is that possible now that all the whiskey is emptied  it seems that bourdon had a jug of brandy among his stores and gershom found it out i blame no one for bourdon who never abuses the gifts of providence had a right to his comforts at least but it is a pity that there was anything of the sort in the canoes  the beehunter was greatly concerned at this unwelcome intelligence feeling all its importance far more vividly than either of his companions they regretted as women but he foresaw the danger as a man accustomed to exertion in trying scenes if whiskey centre had really fallen into his old ways so as to render himself an incumbrance instead of being an assistant at such a moment the fact was to be deplored but it could only be remedied by time luckily they had the indian with them and he could manage one of the canoes while he himself took charge of the other as no time was to be lostthe barking of the dogs and the cries of the savages too plainly letting it be known that the enemy was getting through the marsh by some means or otherhe hurried the party down to the canoes entering that of whiskey centre at once  le bourdon found gershom asleep but with the heavy slumbers of the drunkard dolly had removed the jug and concealed it as soon as the state of her husband enabled her to do so without incurring his violence else might the unfortunate man have destroyed himself by indulging in a liquor so much more palatable than that he was accustomed to use after so long and compelled an abstinence the jug was now produced however and le bourdon emptied it in the river to the great joy of the two females though not without a sharp remonstrance from the chippewa the beehunter was steady and the last drop of the liquor of gascony was soon mingling with the waters of the kalamazoo this done the beehunter desired the women to embark and called to the chippewa to do the same by quitting the spot in the canoes it was evident the pursuers would be balked temporarily at least since they must recross the marsh in order to get into their own boats without which further pursuit would be fruitless  it might have been by means of a secret sympathy or it was possibly the result of accident but certain it is that the chippewa was placed in that of le bourdon as for whiskey centre he lay like a log in the bottom of his own light bark cared for only by his affectionate wife who had made a pillow for his head but fortunately if no assistance just then not any material hindrance to the movements of his friends by the time le bourdon and the chippewa had got their stations and the canoes were free of the bottom it was evident by the sounds that not only the dogs but divers of their masters had floundered through the swamp and were already on the firm ground east of it as the dogs ran by scent little doubt remained of their soon leading the savages to the place of embarkation aware of this the beehunter directed the chippewa to follow and urged his own canoe away from the shore following one of three of the natural channels that united just at that point  the clamor now sensibly increased and the approach of the pursuers was much faster than it had previously been in consequence of there no longer being wet land beneath their feet at the distance of fifty yards from the shore however the channel or open avenue among the riceplants that the canoes had taken made a short turn to the northward for all the events we have just been recording occurred on the northern or leeward side of the river once around this bend in the channel the canoes would have been effectually concealed from those on the beach had it even been broad daylight and of course were so much more hidden from view under the obscurity of a very dark night perceiving this and fearful that the dip of the paddles might be heard le bourdon ceased to urge his canoe through the water telling the chippewa to imitate his example and let the boats drift in consequence of this precaution the fugitives were still quite near the shore when first the dogs then a party of their masters came rushing down to the very spot whence the canoes had departed scarcely two minutes before as no precautions were taken to conceal the advance of the pursuers the pursued or the individuals among them who alone understood the common language of the great ojebway nation well had an opportunity of hearing and understanding all that was said le bourdon had brought the two canoes together and the chippewa at his request now translated such parts of the discourse of their enemies as he deemed worthy of communicating to the females  say now nobody dere commenced the indian coolly tink he no great way offmean to look for himtink dog uneasywoner why dog so uneasy  them dogs are very likely to scent us here in the canoes we are so near them whispered le bourdon  spose he do cant catch us coolly answered the chippewa beside shoot him dont take carebad for dog to chase warrior too much  there is one speaking now who seems to have authority  yeshe chiefknow he voicehear him too oftenhe mean to put pigeonswing to torture well let him catch pigeonswing fustswift bird do that eh  but what says heit may be of importance to learn what the chief says just now  who care what he saycant do nuttinif get good chance take his scalp too  aye that i dare saybut he is speaking earnestly and in a low voice listen and let us know what he says i do not well understand at this distance  the chippewa complied and maintained an attentive silence until the chief ceased to speak then he rendered what had been said into such english as he could command accompanying the translation by the explanations that naturally suggested themselves to one like himself  chief talk to young men said the chippewaall chief talk to young mentell him dat pigeonswing must get off in canoedont see canoe nudderbut muss be canoe else he swim tink more than one injin heredont know doughmaybe maybe notcant tell till see trail morrow morning  well well but what does he tell his young men to do demanded the beehunter impatiently  dont be squaw bourdontell all byem bye tell young men spose he get canoe den he may get our canoe and carry em offspose he swim dat chippewa devil swim down stream and get our canoe dat fashionbess go back some of you and see arter our canoedat what he tell young men most  that is a lucky thought exclaimed le bourdonlet us paddle down at once and seize all their canoes before they can get there the distance by water owing to this bend in the river is not half as great as that by land and the marsh will double the distance to them  dat good counsel said pigeonswingyou goi follow  this was no sooner said than the canoes again got in motion the darkness might now have been a sufficient protection had there been no rice but the plant would have concealed the movement even at noonday the fire in the hut served as a beacon and enabled le bourdon to find the canoes when he reached the landing he could still hear the dogs barking on the marsh and the voices of those with them calling in loud tones to two of the savages who had remained at the chiente as a sort of campguard  what do them chaps say asked le bourdon of the chippewa they yell as if striving to make the two men at the door of the hut hear them can you make out what they are bawling so loud  tell two warrior to come down and take care of canoedat alllet em comefind two here to take care of demgot good scalp them two rascal pottawattamie  nonopigeonswingwe must have no more of that work tonight but must set about towing these four canoes off the shore as fast as we can have you got hitches on your two  fast noughso fast he follow answered the indian who notwithstanding his preparations to help to remove the canoes was manifestly reluctant to depart without striking another blow at his enemies now good time for dem rascal to lose scalp  them rascals as you call them begin to understand their friends in the marsh and are looking to the priming of their rifles we must be moving or they may see us and give us a shot shove off chippewa and paddle at once for the middle of the bay  as le bourdon was much in earnest pigeonswing was fain to comply had the last possessed a rifle of his own or even a knife it is highly probable he would have leaped ashore and found the means of stealing on some of his enemies unawares and thus secured another trophy but the beehunter was determined and the chippewa however reluctant was compelled to obey for not only had le bourdon kept his rifle at his side but he had used the precaution of securing his knife and tomahawk both of which he carried habitually the same as a red man  the canoes had now a somewhat difficult task the wind still blew fresh and it was necessary for one of these light craft pretty well loaded with its proper freight and paddled by only a single person to tow two other craft of equal size dead to the windward the weight in the towing craft and the lightness of those that were towed rendered this task however easier than it might otherwise have proved in the course of a couple of minutes all the canoes were far enough from the shore to be out of sight of the two indians who by that time had got down to the beach to look after their own craft the yell these savages raised on finding themselves too late not only announced their disappointment but communicated the extent of the disaster to their friends who were still floundering through the marsh  the great advantage that the party of the beehunter had now obtained must be very apparent to all in possession of all the canoes their enemies were or would be for some time at least confined to the northern side of the river which was so wide near its mouth as to present an effectual barrier between them and those who occupied the opposite bank the canoes also enabled the weaker party to change their position at will carrying with them as many effects as were on board and which included the whole of the property of le bourdon while their loss deprived their enemies of all extra means of motion and would be very likely to induce them to proceed on their expedition by land the objects of that expedition could only be conjectured by the beehunter until he had questioned the chippewa a thing he did not fail to do so soon as he believed the party quite safe under the south shore here the fugitives landed proceeding up a natural channel in the wild rice in order to do so and selecting a bit of dry beach for their purpose margery set about lighting a fire in order to keep the mosquitos at a distance selecting a spot to kindle it behind a swell on the land that concealed the light from all on the other shore in the morning it would be necessary to extinguish that fire lest its smoke should betray their position it was while these things were in progress and after le bourdon had himself procured the fuel necessary to feed pretty margerys fire that he questioned the chippewa touching his captivity  yes tell all bout him answered the indian as soon as interrogatedno good to hide trail from friend member when say goodby up in openin to bourdon  certainlyi remember the very instant when you left me the pottawattamie went on one path and you went on another i was glad of that as you seemed to think he was not your friend  yes good not to travel on same path as inimy cause he quarrel sometime coolly returned the indian dis time path come together somehow and pottawattamie lose he scalp  i am aware of all that pigeonswing and wish it had not been so i found the body of elksfoot sitting up against a tree soon after you left me and knew by whose hands he had fallen  didnt find scalp eh  no the scalp had been taken though i accounted that but for little since the mans life was gone there is little gained by carrying on war in this manner making the woods and the openings and the prairies alike unsafe you see to what distress this family is reduced by your injin manner of making war  how you make him denwant to hear go kiss and give venison to inimy or go get his scalp eh which bess fashion to make him afeard and own you master  all that may be done without killing single travellers or murdering women and children the peace will be made none the sooner between england and america because you have got the scalp of elksfoot  no habent got him any longer wish hadpottawattamie take him away and say he bury him well let him hide him in a hole deep as white mans well cant hide pigeonswing honor dere too dat is safe as notch cut on stick can make him  this notch on a stick was the indian mode of gazetting a warrior and a certain number of these notches was pretty certain to procure for him a sort of savage brevet which answered his purpose quite as well as the modern mode of brevetting at washington answers our purpose neither brings any pay we believe nor any command except in such cases as rarely occur and then only to the advantage of government there are varieties in honor as in any other human interest so are there many moral degrees in warfare thus the very individual who admires the occupation of algiers or that of tahiti or the attack on canton together with the long train of indian events which have dyed the peninsulas of the east in the blood of their people sees an alarming enormity in the knocking down of the walls of vera cruz though the breach opened a direct road into san juan de ulloa in the eyes of the same profound moralists the garitas of mexico ought to have been respected as so many doors opening into the boudoirs of the beautiful dames of that fine capital it being a monstrous thing to fire a shot into the streets of a town no matter how many came out of them we are happy therefore to have it in our power to add these touches of philosophy that came from pigeonswing to those of the sages of the old world by way of completing a code of international morals on this interesting subject in which the student shall be at a loss to say which he most admiresthat which comes from the schools or that which comes direct from the wilderness  so best answered the beehunter i wish i could persuade you to throw away that disgusting thing at your belt remember chippewa you are now among christians and ought to do as christians wish  what christians do eh returned the indian with a sneer get drunk like whiskey centre dere cheat poor red man den get down on knee and look up at manitou dat what christian do eh  they who do such things are christian but in nameyou must think better of such as are christians in fact  ebberybody call himself christian tell youall paleface christian dey say now listen to chippewa once talk long talk wit missionarytell all about christianwhat christian dowhat christian sayhow he eat how he sleep how he drinkall good wish pigeonwing christianden member soger at garrisonno eat no sleep no drink christian fashiondo ebbery ting soger fashionswear fight cheat get drunkwuss dan injindat christian eh  no that is not acting like a christian and i fear very few of us who call ourselves by that name act as if we were christians in truth said le bourdon conscious of the justice of the chippewas accusation  just datnow i get himask missionary one day where all christian go to so dat injin cant find himnone in woodsnone on prairienone in garrisonnone in macknawnone at detroitwhere all go to den so injin cant find him ony in missionary talk  i am curious to know what answer your missionary made to that question  well tell yousay ony one in ten tousant raal christians mong paleface dough all call himself christian dat what injin tink queer eh  it is not easy to make a red man understand all the ways of the palefaces pigeonswing but we will talk of these things another time when we are more at our ease just now i wish to learn all i can of the manner in which you fell into the hands of the pottawattamies  dat plain noughwish christian talk half as plain you see bourdon dat elksfoot on scout when we meet in openin up river i knowd his arnd and so took scalp dem pottawattamie his friend when dey come to meet ole chief no find him but find pigeonwing got me when tired and sleep got elkfoot scalp wid mesorry for datknow scalp by scalplock which had gray hair and some mark so put me in canoe and meant to take chippewa to chicago to torture himbut too much wind so when meet friend in todder canoe come back here to wait little while  this was the simple explanation of the manner in which pigeonswing had fallen into the hands of his enemies it would seem that elksfoot had come in a canoe from the mouth of the st josephs to a point about halfway between that river and the mouth of the kalamazoo and there landed what the object of the party was does not exactly appear though it is far from being certain that it was not to seize the beehunter and confiscate his effects although le bourdon was personally a stranger to elksfoot news flies through the wilderness in an extraordinary manner and it was not at all unlikely that the fact of a white americans being in the openings should soon spread along with the tidings that the hatchet was dug up and that a party should go out in quest of his scalp and the plunder it would seem that the savage tact of the chippewa detected that in the manner of the pottawattamie chief which assured him the intentions of the old warrior were not amicable and that he took the very summary process which has been related not only to secure his scalp but effectually to put it out of his power to do any mischief to one who was an ally and by means of recent confidence now a friend all this the indian explained to his companion in his usual clipped english but with a clearness sufficient to make it perfectly intelligible to his listener the beehunter listened with the most profound attention for he was fully aware of the importance of comprehending all the hazards of his own situation  while this dialogue was going on margery had succeeded in lighting her fire and was busy in preparing some warm compound which she knew would be required by her unhappy brother after his debauch dorothy passed often between the fire and the canoe feeling a wifes anxiety in the fate of her husband as for the chippewa intoxication was a very venial offence in his eyes though he had a contempt for a man who would thus indulge while on a warpath the american indian does possess this merit of adapting his deportment to his circumstances when engaged in war he usually prepares himself in the coolest and wisest manner to meet its struggles indulging only in moments of leisure and of comparative security it is true that the march of what is called civilization is fast changing the red mans character and he is very apt now to do that which he sees done by the christians around him  le bourdon when his dialogue with the chippewa was over and after a few words of explanation with margery took his own canoe and paddled through the riceplants into the open water of the river to reconnoitre the breadth of the stream induced him to float down before the wind until he reached a point where he could again command a view of the hut what he there saw and what he next did must be reserved for a succeeding chapter     chapter viii       the elfin cast a glance around      as he lighted down from his courser toad      then round his breast his wings he wound      and close to the rivers brink he strode      he sprang on a rock he breathed a prayer      above his head his arm he threw      then tossed a tiny curve in air      and headlong plunged in the water blue                                            drake   an hour had intervened between the time when le bourdon had removed the canoes of the pottawattamies and the time when he returned alone to the northern side of the river in the course of that hour the chief of the savages had time to ascertain all the leading circumstances that have just been related and to collect his people in and around the hut for a passing council the moment was one of action and not of ceremonies no pipe was smoked nor any of the observances of the great councils of the tribe attended to the object was merely to glean facts and to collect opinions in all the tribes of this part of north america something very like a principle of democracy is the predominant feature of their politics it is not however that bastard democracy which is coming so much in fashion among ourselves and which looks into the gutters solely for the people forgetting that the landlord has just as much right to protection as the tenant the master as the servant the rich as the poor the gentleman as the blackguard the indians know better than all this they understand fully that the chiefs are entitled to more respect than the loafers in their villages and listen to the former while their ears are shut to the latter they appear to have a common sense which teaches them to avoid equally the exaggerations of those who believe in blood and of those who believe in blackguardism with them the doctrines of new men would sound as an absurdity for they never submit to change for changes sake on the contrary while there is no positive hereditary rank there is much hereditary consideration and we doubt if a red man could be found in all america who is so much of a simpleton as to cite among the qualifications of any man for a situation of trust and responsibility that he had never been taught how to perform its duties they are not guilty of the contradiction of elevating men because they are selftaught while they expend millions on schools doubtless they have after a fashion of their own demagogues and caesars but they are usually kept within moderate limits and in rare instances indeed do either ever seriously trespass on the rights of the tribe as human nature is everywhere the same it is not to be supposed that pure justice prevails even among savages but one thing would seem to be certain that all over the world man in his simplest and wildest state is more apt to respect his own ordinances than when living in what is deemed a condition of high civilization  when le bourdon reached the point whence he could get a good view of the door of the hut which was still illuminated by the fire within he ceased using the paddle beyond the slight effort necessary to keep the canoe nearly stationary he was quite within the range of a rifle but trusted to the darkness of the night for his protection that scouts were out watching the approaches to the hut he felt satisfied and he did not doubt that some were prowling along the margin of the kalamazoo either looking for the lost boats or for those who had taken them away this made him cautious and he took good care not to place his canoe in a position of danger  it was very apparent that the savages were in great uncertainty as to the number of their enemies had not the rifle been fired and their warrior killed and scalped they might have supposed that their prisoner had found the means of releasing his limbs himself and thus effected his escape but they knew that the chippewa had neither gun nor knife and as all their own arms even to those of the dead man were still in their possession it was clear that he had been succored from without now the pottawattamies had heard of both the beehunter and whiskey centre and it was natural enough for them to ascribe some of these unlookedfor feats to one or the other of these agents it is true the hut was known to have been built three or four years earlier by an indian trader and no one of the party had ever actually seen gershom and his family in possession but the conjectures on this head were as near the fact as if the savages had passed and repassed daily there was only one point on which these close calculators of events were at fault so thoroughly had everything been removed from the chiente and so carefully the traces of its recent occupation concealed that no one among them suspected that the family had left the place only an hour before their own arrival the beehunter moreover was well assured that the savages had not yet blundered on the hidingplace of the furniture had this been discovered its contents would have been dragged to light and seen around the fire for there is usually little selfrestraint among the red men when they make a prize of this sort  nevertheless there was one point about which even those keen scented children of the forest were much puzzled and which the bee hunter perfectly comprehended notwithstanding the distance at which he was compelled to keep himself the odor of the whiskey was so strong in and about the chiente that the pottawattamies did not know what to make of it that there should be the remains of this peculiar smellone so fragrant and tempting to those who are accustomed to indulge in the liquorin the hut itself was natural enough but the savages were perplexed at finding it so strong on the declivity down which the barrels had been rolled on this subject were they conversing when le bourdon first got near enough to observe their proceedings after discussing the matter for some time torches were lighted and most of the party followed a grim old warrior who had an exceedingly true nose for the scent of whiskey and who led them to the very spot where the halfbarrel had been first stove by rolling off a rock and where its contents had been mainly spilled here the earth was yet wet in places and the scent was so strong as to leave no doubt of the recent nature of the accident which had wasted so much of a liquor that was very precious in pottawattamie eyes for accident they thought it must be since no sane man could think of destroying the liquor intentionally  all the movements gestures and genuflections of the savages were plainly seen by the beehunter we say the genuflections for nearly all of the indians got on their knees and applied their noses to the earth in order to scent the fragrance of the beloved whiskey some out of curiosity but more because they loved even this tantalizing indulgence when no better could be had but le bourdon was right in his conjectures that the matter was not to end here although most of the indians scented the remains of the whiskey out of love for the liquor a few of their number reasoned on the whole transaction with quite as much acuteness as could have been done by the shrewdest natural philosopher living to them it was very apparent that no great length of time a few hours at most could have elapsed since that whiskey was spilled and human hands must have brought it there in the first place and poured it on the ground in the second there must have been a strong reason for such an act and that reason presented itself to their minds with unerring accuracy their own approach must have been seen and the liquor was destroyed because it could not be removed in time to prevent its falling into their hands even the precise manner in which the whiskey had been disposed of was pretty nearly conjectured by a few of the chiefs acute and practised as they were who accustomed to this species of exercise of their wits had some such dexterity in examining facts of this nature and in arriving at just results as the men of the schools manifest in the inquiries that more especially belong to their habits and training but their conclusions were confined to themselves and they were also sufficiently enveloped in doubts to leave those who made them ready enough to receive new impressions on the same subject  all this moreover le bourdon both saw and understood or if not absolutely all so much of it as to let him comprehend the main conclusions of the savages as well as the process by which they were reached to obtain light the indians made a fire near the charmed spot which brought themselves and their movements into plain view from the canoe of the beehunter curiosity now became strongly awakened in the latter and he ventured in nearer to the shore in order to get the best possible view of what was going on in a manner he was solving an enigma and he experienced the sort of pleasure we all feel at exercising our wits on difficulties of that nature the interest he felt rendered the young man careless as respected the position of his canoe which drifted down before the strong breeze until le bourdon found himself in the very edge of the wild rice which at this point formed but a very narrow belt along the beach it was this plant indeed that contributed to make the young man so regardless of his drift for he looked upon the belt of rice as a species of landmark to warn him when to turn but at no other spot along that whole shore where the plant was to be found at all was its belt so narrow as at this immediately opposite to the new fire of the savages and almost within the influence of its rays to le bourdons surprise and somewhat to his consternation just as his little craft touched the rice the forms of two stout warriors passed along the beach between him and the light their feet almost dipping in the water so near were these two warriors to him that on listening intently he heard not only their voices as they communicated their thoughts to each other in low tones but the tread of their moccasined feet on the ground retreat under the circumstances would not be safe for it must have been made under the muzzles of the rifles and but one resource presented itself by grasping in his hand two or three stalks of the riceplant and holding them firmly the drift of the canoe was arrested  after a moments reflection le bourdon was better satisfied with this new station than he had been on first gaining it to have ventured on such a near approach to his enemies he would have regarded as madness but now he was there well concealed among the rice he enjoyed the advantages of observation it gave him and looked upon the chance that brought him there as lucky he found a thong of buckskin and fastened his canoe to the stalks of the plant thus anchoring or mooring his little bark and leaving himself at liberty to move about in it the rice was high enough to conceal him even when erect and he had some difficulty in finding places favorable to making his observations through it when the beehunter made his way into the bow of his canoe however which he did with a moccasined and noiseless foot he was startled at perceiving how small was his cover in point of fact he was now within three feet of the inner edge of the riceplant which grew within ten feet of the shore where the two warriors already mentioned were still standing in close communication with each other their faces were turned toward the fire the bright light from which at times streamed over the canoe itself in a way to illumine all it contained the first impulse of le bourdon on ascertaining how closely he had drifted to the shore was to seize a paddle and make off but a second thought again told him it would be far safer to remain where he was taking his seat therefore on a bit of board laid athwart from gunwale to gunwale if such a craft can be said to have gunwales at all he patiently waited the course of events  by this time all or nearly all of the pottawattamies had collected on this spot on the side of the hill the hut was deserted its fire got to be low and darkness reigned around the place on the other hand the indians kept piling brush on their new fire until the whole of that hillside the stream at its foot and the ravine through which the latter ran were fairly illuminated of course all within the influence of this light was to be distinctly seen and the beehunter was soon absorbed in gazing at the movements of savage enemies under circumstances so peculiar  the savages seemed to be entranced by the singular and to most of them unaccountable circumstance of the earths giving forth the scent of fresh whiskey in a place so retired and unknown while two or three of their number had certain inklings of the truth as has been stated to much the greater portion of their body it appeared to be a profound mystery and one that in some inexplicable manner was connected with the recent digging up of the hatchet ignorance and superstition ever go hand in hand and it was natural that many perhaps most of these uninstructed beings should thus consider so unusual a fragrance on such a spot whiskey has unfortunately obtained a power over the red man of this continent that it would require many fathers matthew to suppress and which can only be likened to that which is supposed to belong to the influence of witchcraft the indian is quite as sensible as the white man of the mischief that the firewater produces but like the white man he finds how hard it is to get rid of a master passion when we have once submitted ourselves to its sway the portion of the band that could not account for the fact of the scent of their beloved beverages being found in such a place and it was all but three of their whole party were quite animated in their discussions on the subject and many and crude were the suggestions that fell from their lips the two warriors on the beach were more deeply impressed than any of their companions with the notion that some medicine charm was connected with this extraordinary affair  the reader will not be surprised to hear that le bourdon gazed on the scene before him with the most profound attention so near did he seem to be and so near was he in fact to the savages who were grouped around the fire that he fancied he could comprehend what they were saying by the expressions of their grim and swarthy countenances his conjectures were in part just and occasionally the beehunter was absolutely accurate in his notions of what was said the frequency with which different individuals knelt on the ground to scent an odor that is always so pleasant to the red man would of itself have given a clew to the general character of the discourse but the significant and expressive gestures the rapid enunciation and the manner in which the eyes of the speakers glanced from the faces near themselves to the spot consecrated by whiskey pretty plainly told the story it was while thus intently occupied in endeavoring to read the singular impression made on the minds of most of those wild beings by an incident so much out of the usual track of their experience that le bourdon suddenly found the bow of his canoe thrusting itself beyond the inner margin of the rice and issuing into open water within ten feet of the very spot where the two nearest of the savages were still conferring together apart the buckskin thong which served as a fastening had got loosened and the light craft was again drifting down before the strong southerly wind which still continued to blow a little gale  had there been an opportunity for such a thing the beehunter would have made an effort to escape but so sudden and unexpected was this exposure that he found himself almost within reach of a rifle before he was aware of his approaching the two warriors on the shore at all his paddle was in the stern of the canoe and had he used the utmost activity the boat would have grounded on the beach ere he could have obtained it in this situation therefore he was absolutely without any other means than his hands of stopping the canoe had there even been time  le bourdon understood his real situation without stopping to reflect and though his heart made one violent leap as soon as he perceived he was out of cover he immediately bethought him of the course he ought to pursue it would have been fatal to betray alarm or to attempt flight as accident had thus brought him as it might be on a visit to the spot he at once determined to give his arrival the character of a friendly call and the better to support the pretension to blend with it if possible a little of the oracular or medicine manner in order to impose on the imaginations of the superstitious beings into whose power he had so unwittingly fallen  the instant the canoe touched the shore and it was only a moment after it broke through the cover le bourdon arose and extending his hand to the nearest indian saluted him with the mongrel term of sago a slight exclamation from this warrior communicated to his companion an arrival that was quite as much a matter of surprise to the indians as to their guest and through this second warrior to the whole party on the hillside a little clamor succeeded and presently the beehunter was surrounded with savages  the meeting was marked by the selfcommand and dignified quiet that are so apt to distinguish the deportment of indian warriors when they are on the warpath and alive to the duties of manhood the beehunter shook hands with several who received his salutations with perfect calmness if not with absolute confidence and amity this little ceremony gave our hero an opportunity to observe the swarthy countenances by which he was surrounded most of which were fierce in their paint as well as to reflect a little on his own course by a fortunate inspiration he now determined to assume the character of a medicine man and to connect his prophecies and juggleries with this lucky accident of the whiskey accordingly he inquired if any one spoke english not wishing to trust his explanations to his own imperfect knowledge of the ojebway tongue which is spoken by all the numerous tribes of that widelyextended nation several could render themselves intelligible in english and one was so expert as to render communication with him easy if not very agreeable as the savages however soon insisted on examining the canoe and taking a look at its contents previously to listening to their visitors explanations le bourdon was fain to submit and to let the young men satisfy their curiosity  the beehunter had come on his hazardous expedition in his own canoe previously to quitting the south shore however he had lightened the little craft by landing everything that was not essential to his present purpose as nearly half of his effects were in the canoe of whiskey centre the task was soon performed and lucky it was for our hero that he had bethought him of the prudence of the measure his sole object had been to render the canoe swifter and lighter in the event of a chase but as things turned out he saved no small portion of his property by using the precaution the indians found nothing in the canoe but one rifle with a horn and pouch a few light articles belonging to the beehunters domestic economy and which he had not thought it necessary to remove and the paddles all the honey and the skins and stores and spare powder and lead and in short everything else that belonged to le bourdon was still safe on the other side of the river the greatest advantage gained by the pottawattamies was in the possession of the canoe itself by means of which they would now be enabled to cross the kalamazoo or make any other similar expedition by water  but as yet not a sign of hostility was betrayed by either party the beehunter seemed to pay no attention to his rifle and ammunition or even to his canoe while the savages after having warily examined the last together with its contents returned to their visitor to reexamine him with a curiosity as lively as it was full of distrust at this stage in the proceeding something like a connected and intelligible conversation commenced between the chief who spoke english and who was known in most of the north western garrisons of the americans by the name of thundercloud or cloud by way of abbreviation on account of his sinister looks though the man actually sustained a tolerably fair reputation for one of those who having been wronged was so certain to be calumniated no man was ever yet injured that he has not been slandered  who kill and scalp my young man asked cloud a little abruptly  has my brother lost a warrior was the calm reply yes i see that he has a medicineman can see that though it is dark  who kill him if can seewho scalp him too  an enemy did both answered le bourdon oracularly yes twas an enemy that killed him and an enemy that took his scalp  why do it eh why come here to take pottawattamia scalp when no warpath open eh  pottawattamie the truth must always be said to a medicineman there is no use in trying to hide truth from him there is a war path open and a long and a tangled path it is my great father at washington has dug up the hatchet against my great father at quebec enemies always take scalps when they can get them  dat truedat right toonobody grumble at datbut who enemy paleface or redskin  this time it was a redskina chippewaone of your own nation though not of your own tribe a warrior called pigeonswing whom you had in thongs intending to torture him in the morning he cut his thongs and shot your young manafter which he took his scalp  how know dat demanded the cloud a little fiercely you long and help kill pottawattamie eh  i know it answered le bourdon coolly because medicinemen know most of what happens do not be so hasty chief for this is a medicine spotwhiskey grows here  a common exclamation escaped all of the red men who comprehended the clear distinct and oracularlike language and manner of the beehunter he intended to make an impression on his listeners and he succeeded admirably perhaps as much by means of manner as of matter as has been said all who understood his wordssome four or five of the partygrunted forth their surprise at this evidence of their guests acquaintance with the secrets of the place in which they were joined by the rest of their companions as soon as the words of the paleface had been translated even the experienced and wary old chiefs who had more than half conjectured the truth in connection with this mysterious odor of whiskey were much unsettled in their opinions concerning the wonder and got to be in that condition of mind when a man does not know what to think of any particular event the beehunter quickwitted and managing for his life was not slow to perceive the advantage he had gained and he proceeded at once to clinch the nail he had so skilfully driven turning from cloud to the headchief of the party a warrior whom he had no difficulty in recognizing after having so long watched his movements in the earlier part of the night he pushed the same subject a little further  yes this place is called by the whites whiskey centre he added which means that it is the centre of all the whiskey of the country round about  dat true said cloud quicklyi hear soger at fort dearborn call him whiskey centre  this little circumstance greatly complicated the mystery and le bourdon perceived that he had hit on a lucky explanation  soldiers far and nearsoldiers drunk or sobersoldiers with scalps and soldiers without scalpsall know the place by that name but you need not believe with your eyes shut and noses stopped chief since you have the means of learning for yourselves the truth of what i tell you come with me and i will tell you where to dig in the morning for a whiskey spring  this communication excited a tremendous feeling among the savages when its purport came to be explained to the whole party apart from the extraordinary miraculous nature of such a spring which in itself was sufficient to keep alive expectation and gratify curiosity it was so comfortable to have an inexhaustible supply of the liquor running out of the bowels of the earth that it is no wonder the news spread infinite delight among the listeners even the two or three of the chiefs who had so shrewdly divined the manner in which the liquor had been spilled were staggered by the solemnity and steadiness of the beehunters manner and perhaps a little carried away by sympathy with those around them this yielding of the human mind to the influence of numbers is so common an occurrence as scarcely to require explanation and is the source of half the evils that popular associations inflict on themselves it is not that men capable of seeing the truth are ever wanting but men capable of maintaining it in the face of clamor and collected power  it will be readily conceived that a medicineman who is supposed to possess the means of discovering a spring that should overflow with pure whiskey would not be left without urgent demands for a speedy exercise of this art this was now the case with le bourdon who was called on from all sides to point out the precise spot where the young men were to commence digging in order to open on the treasure our hero knew that his only hope of escape was connected with his steadily maintaining his assumed character or of maintaining this assumed character with his going on at once to do something that might have the effect temporarily at least of satisfying the impatience of his now attentive listeners accordingly when the demand was made on him to give some evidence of his power he set about the task not only with composure but with a good deal of ingenuity  le bourdon it will be remembered had with his own hands rolled the two barrels of whiskey down the declivity feeling the great importance of effectually destroying them he had watched their descent from the top to the bottom of the hill and the final disappearance of the staves etc into the torrent which brawled at its foot it had so happened that the halffilled cask broke and let out its liquor at a point much more remote from the stream than the filled the latter had held together until it went over the low rocky precipice already mentioned and was stove at its base within two yards of the torrent which received all its fragments and swept them away including most of the liquor itself but not until the last had been spilled now the odorous spot which had attracted the noses of the savages and near which they had built their fire was that where the smallest quantity of the whiskey had fallen le bourdon reasoned on these circumstances in this wiseif half a barrel of the liquor can produce so strong a scent a barrel filled ought to produce one still stronger and i will manifest my medicinecharacter by disregarding for the present moment the spot on the hillside and proceed at once to that at the foot of the rocks to this latter point therefore did he direct all the ceremony as well as his own footsteps when he yielded to the solicitations of the pottawattamies and undertook to point out the position of the whiskey spring  the beehunter understood the indian character too well to forget to embellish his work with a proper amount of jugglery and acting luckily he had left in the canoe a sort of frock of mottled colors that he had made himself to wear in the woods in the autumn as a huntingdress under the notion that such a covering would conceal his approach from his game by blending its hues with those of the autumn leaf this dress he now assumed extorting a good deal of halfsuppressed admiration from the younger warriors by the gay appearance he made then he drew out his spyglass to its greatest length making various mysterious signs and gestures as he did so this glass proved to be a great auxiliary and possibly alone kept the doubters in awe le bourdon saw at once that it was entirely new even to the oldest chief and he felt how much it might be made to assist him beckoning to cloud and adjusting the focus he directed the small end of his glass to the fire and placed the large end to that indians eye a solitary savage who loved the scent of whiskey too much to tear himself away from the spot was lingering within the influence of the rays and of course was seen by the chief with his person diminished to that of a dwarf and his form thrown to a seeming distance  an eloquent exclamation followed this exhibition of the medicine mans power and each of the chiefs and most of the other warriors were gratified with looks through the glass  what dat mean demanded cloud earnestly see wolfeye well noughwhy he so littlewhy he so far off he  that is to show you what a medicineman of the palefaces can do when he is so minded that indian is named wolfseye and he loves whiskey too well that i know as well as i know his name  each of these exhibitions of intelligence extorted exclamations of wonder it is true that one or two of the higher chiefs understood that the name might possibly have been obtained from cloud but how was the medicineman to know that wolfseye was a drunkard this last had not been said in terms but enough had been said to let those who were aware of the propensity feel that more was meant than had been expressed before there was time however to deliberate on or to dissect this specimen of mysterious knowledge le bourdon reversed the glass and applied the small end to the eye of cloud after having given it its former direction the indian fairly yelled partly with dread and partly with delight when he saw wolfseye large as life brought so near him that he fancied he might be touched with his own hand  what dat mean exclaimed cloud as soon as surprise and awe enabled him to find his voice fuss he little den he bigfuss he great way den he close bywhat dat mean eh  it means that i am a medicineman and this is a medicineglass and that i can see with it into the earth deeper than the wells or higher than the mountains  these words were translated and explained to all three they extorted many ejaculations of wonder and divers grunts of admiration and contentment cloud conferred a moment with the two principal chiefs then he turned eagerly to the beehunter saying  all good but want to hear morewant to larn morewant to see more  name your wants freely pottawattamie answered le bourdon with dignity they shall be satisfied  want to seewant to taste whiskey springsee wont dowant to taste  goodyou shall smell first then you shall see after that you shall taste give me room and be silent a great medicine is near  thus delivering himself le bourdon proceeded with his necromancy     chapter ix  he turned him round and fled amain with hurry and dash to the beach again he twisted over from side to side and laid his cheek to the cleaving tide the strokes of his plunging arms are fleet and with all his might he flings his feet but the watersprites are round him still to cross his path and work him ill                                       the culprit fay   the first step in the conjuration of the beehunter was to produce an impression on the minds of his untutored observers by resorting to a proper amount of mummery and mystical action this he was enabled to do with some effect in consequence of having practised as a lad in similar mimicry by way of pastime the germans and the descendants of germans in america are not of a very high class as respects education taken as a body and they retain many of the most inveterate of the superstitions of their teutonic ancestors although the beehunter himself was of purely english descent he came from a state that was in part peopled by these germans and their descendants and by intercourse with them he had acquired a certain knowledge of their notions on the subject of necromancy that he now found was of use so far as gravity of mien solemn grimaces and unintelligible mutterings were concerned le bourdon played his part to admiration and by the time he had led the party half the distance he intended to go our necromancer or medicine man had complete possession of the imaginations of all the savages the two or three chiefs already mentioned alone excepted at this stage of the proceedings occurred a little incident which goes to prove the disposition of the common mind to contribute in deceiving itself and which was of considerable assistance to le bourdon in maintaining his assumed character  it will be remembered that the place where the indians had found their strongest scent was on the hillside or the spot where the halffilled barrel had let out most of its contents near this spot their new fire was still brightly blazing and there wolfseye remained regaling one of his senses at least with an odor that he found so agreeable but the beehunter knew that he should greatly increase the wonder of the savages by leading them to a new scent spot one to which there was no visible clew and where the odor was probably much stronger than on the hillside accordingly he did not approach the fire but kept around the base of the hill just enough within the influence of the light to pick his way readily and yet so distant from it as to render his countenance indistinct and mysterious no sooner however had he got abreast of the scentspot known to the savages than the crowd endeavored to lead him toward it by gestures and hints and finally by direct intimations that he was going astray all this our medicineman disregarded he held his way steadily and solemnly toward that place at the foot of the hill where he knew that the filled barrel had let out its contents and where he reasonably enough expected to find sufficient traces of the whiskey to answer his purposes at first this pertinacity provoked the crowd which believed he was going wrong but a few words from crowsfeather the principal chief caused the commotion to cease in a few more minutes le bourdon stopped near the place of his destination as a fresh scent of whiskey was very perceptible here a murmur of admiration not unmixed with delight passed among the attendants  now let the young men build a fire for me said the beehunter solemnlynot such a fire as that which is burning on the hill but a medicinefire i smell the whiskey spring and want a medicine light to see it  a dozen young men began to collect the brush in a minute a pile of some size had been accumulated on a flat rock within twenty feet of the spot where le bourdon knew that the cask had been dashed to pieces when he thought the pile sufficiently large he told crowsfeather that it might be lighted by bringing a brand from the other fire  this will not be a medicinelight for that can come only from medicinematches he added but i want a fire to see the shape of the ground put in the brand brothers let us have a flame  the desire of the beehunter was gratified and the whole of the base of the hill around the spot where the filled cask had broken was illuminated  now let all the pottawattamies stand back added le bourdon earnestly it might cost a warrior his life to come forward too soonor if not his life it might give a rheumatism that can never be cured which is worse when it is time for my red brothers to advance they will be called  as the beehunter accompanied this announcement by suitable gestures he succeeded in ranging all of the silent but excited savages on three sides of his fire leaving that next his mysterious spring to himself alone when all was arranged le bourdon moved slowly but unaccompanied to the precise spot where the cask had broken here he found the odor of the whiskey so strong as to convince him that some of the liquor must yet remain on examining more closely he ascertained that several shallow cavities of the flat rock on which the cask had been dashed still contained a good deal of the liquor enough to prove of great assistance to his medicine character  all this while the beehunter kept one portion of his faculties on the alert in order to effect his escape that he might deceive for a time aided as he was by so many favorable circumstances he did not doubt but he dreaded the morning and the results of a night of reflection and rest crowsfeather in particular troubled him and he foresaw that his fate would be terrible did the savages once get an inkling of the deception he was practising as he stood there bending over the little pools of whiskey he glanced his eyes toward the gloom which pervaded the northern side of the hill and calculated the chances of escape by trusting to his speed all of the pottawattamies were on the opposite side and there was a thicket favorably placed for a cover so near that the rifle would scarce have time to perform its fatal office ere he might hope to bury himself within its leaves so tempting did the occasion appear that for a single instant le bourdon forgot his caution and his mummeries and had actually advanced a step or two in the direction toward which he contemplated flight when on glancing an uneasy look behind him he perceived crowsfeather and his two intimate counsellors stealthily preparing their rifles as if they distrusted his intentions this at once induced a change of plan and brought the beehunter back to a sense of his critical position and of the indispensable necessity of caution to a man in his situation  le bourdon now seemingly gave all his attention to the rocks where he stood and out of which the muchcoveted liquor was expected to flow though his thoughts were still busily employed in considering the means of escape the whole time while stooping over the different pools and laying his plans for continuing his medicine charms the beehunter saw how near he had been to committing a great mistake it was almost as indispensable to carry off the canoe as it was to carry off himself since with the canoe not only would all his own property but pretty margery and gershom and his wife be at the mercy of the pottawattamies whereas by securing the boat the wide kalamazoo would serve as a nearly impassable barrier until time was given to the whites to escape his whole plan was changed by this suggestion and he no longer thought of the thicket and of flight inland at the same time that the bee hunter was laying up in his mind ideas so important to his future movements he did not neglect the necessary examination of the means that might be required to extend and prolong his influence over the minds of the superstitious children of the forest on whom he was required to practise his arts his thoughts reverted to the canoe and he concocted a plan by which he believed it possible to get possession of his little craft again once on board it by one vigorous shove he fancied he might push it within the cover of the riceplants where he would be in reasonable safety against the bullets of the savages could he only get the canoe on the outer side of the narrow belt of the plant he should deem himself safe  having arranged his course in his own mind le bourdon now beckoned to crowsfeather to draw near at the same time inviting the whole party to approach within a few feet of the spot where he himself stood the beehunter had brought with him from the boat a fragment of the larger end of a cane fishingrod which he used as a sort of wand its size was respectable and its length about eight feet with this wand he pointed out the different objects he named and it answered the very important purpose of enabling him to make certain small changes in the formation of the ground that were of the greatest service to him without permitting curious eyes to come so near as to detect his artifices  now open your ears crowsfeather and you cloud and all of you young braves commenced the beehunter solemnly and with a steadiness that was admirable yes open wide your ears the great spirit has given the red man a nose that he might smelldoes the cloud smell more than common  sartainsmell whiskeythis whiskey centre dey saynatral dat such smell be here  do all the chiefs and warriors of the pottawattamies who are present also smell the same  spose sowhy he dont eh got nosecan smell whiskey good way tell you  it is right they should smell the liquor here for out of this rock a whiskey spring will soon begin to run it will begin with a very small stream but soon will there be enough to satisfy everybody the great manitou knows that his red children are dry he has sent a medicineman of the palefaces to find a spring for them now look at this piece of rockit is drynot even the dew has yet moistened it seeit is made like a wooden bowl that it may hold the liquor of the spring let crowsfeather smell itsmell it cloudlet all my young men smell it too that they may be certain that there is nothing there  on this invitation accompanied as it was by divers flourishes of the wand and uttered in a deep solemn tone of voice the whole party of the indians gathered around the small hollow basinlike cavity pointed out by the beehunter in order both to see and to smell most knelt and each and all applied their noses to the rock as near the bowl as they could thrust them even the dignified and distrustful crowsfeather could not refrain from bending in the crowd this was the moment for which le bourdon wished and he instantly prepared to carry out his design  previously however to completing the project originally conceived a momentary impulse prevailed which urged him to adopt a new mode of effecting his escape now that most of the savages were on their hands and knees struggling to get their noses as near as possible to the bowl and all were intent on the same object it occurred to the beehunter who was almost as active as the panther of the american forest that he might dash on toward the canoe and make his escape without further mummery had it been only a question of human speed perhaps such would have been the wisest thing he could do but a moments reflection told him how much swifter than any foot of man was the bullet of a rifle the distance exceeded a hundred yards and it was altogether in bright light by means of the two fires wolfseye continuing to pile brush on that near which he still maintained his post as if afraid the precious liquor would start out of the scentspot and be wasted should he abandon his ward happily therefore le bourdon relinquished his dangerous project almost as soon as it was entertained turning his attention immediately to the completion of the plan originally laid  it has been said that the beehunter made sundry flourishes with his wand while the savages were most eager in endeavoring to smell the rock he lightly touched the earth that confined the whiskey in the largest pool and opened a passage by which the liquor could trickle down the side of the rock selecting a path for itself until it actually came into the bowl by a sinuous but certain channel  here was a wonder liquor could not only be smelled but it could be actually seen as for cloud not satisfied with gratifying the two senses connected with the discoveries named he began to lap with his tongue like a dog to try the effect of taste  the manitou does not hide his face from the pottawattamie exclaimed this savage rising to his feet in astonishment this is the firewater and such as the palefaces bring us for skins  others imitated his example and the exclamations of wonder and delight flew from mouth to mouth in a torrent of vehement assertions and ejaculations so great a medicine charm had never before been witnessed in that tribe or in that region and a hundred more might succeed before another should equal this in its welcome character there was whiskey of a certainty not much in quantity to be sure but of excellent quality as several affirmed and coming in a current that was slowly increasing this last sign was owing to the circumstance that le bourdon had deepened the outlet of the pool permitting a larger quantity to flow down the little channel  the moment had now come for a decisive step the beehunter knew that his precious rivulet would soon cease to run and that he must carry out his design under the first impressions of his charm or that he probably would not be permitted to carry it out at all at this moment even crowsfeather appeared to be awed by what he had seen but a chief so sagacious might detect the truth and disappointment would then be certain to increase the penalties he would incur  making many sweeps of his wand and touching various points of the rock both to occupy the attention of the savages and to divert it from his pool the beehunter next felt in his pocket and drew out a small piece of resin that he knew was there the remains of a store with which he resined the bow of his fiddle for our hero had a violin among his effects and often used it in his solitary abodes in the openings breaking this resin on a coal he made it flash and blaze but the quantity was too small to produce the medicinefire he wanted  i have more in my canoe he said addressing himself to the interpreter while i go for it the red men must not stir lest they destroy a palefaces doings least of all they must go near the spring it would be better for the chiefs to lead away their young men and make them stand under the oak where nothing can be done to hurt the medicinecharm  the beehunter pointed to a tree that stood in the direction of the canoe in order to prevent distrust though he had taken care to select a spot whence the little craft could not be seen on account of an intervening swell in the land crowsfeather led his warriors to the indicated place where they took their stations in silent and grave attention  in the mean while le bourdon continued his incantations aloud walking toward his canoe waving his hand and uttering a great deal of gibberish as he slowly proceeded in passing the tree our hero though he did not turn his head was sensible that he was followed by the chiefs a movement against which he did not dare to remonstrate though it sadly disappointed him neither hastening nor retarding his steps however in consequence of this unpleasant circumstance the young man continued on once or twice sweeping the wand behind him in order to ascertain if he could reach his followers but crowsfeather and his companions stopped when they reached the swell of land which concealed the canoe suffering the medicineman to move on alone of this fact le bourdon became aware by turning three times in a circle and pointing upward at the heavens with his wand as he did so  it was a nervous moment when the beehunter reached the canoe he did not like to look behind him again lest the chiefs should suspect his motive and in shoving off from the shore he might do so within a few yards of the muzzle of a hostile rifle there was no time to lose however for any protracted delay on his part would certainly cause the savages to approach through curiosity if not through distrust of his motives he stepped into his light craft therefore without any delay still flourishing his wand and muttering his incantations the first thing was to walk to the stern of the canoe that his weight might raise the bow from the shore and also that he might have an excuse for turning round and thus get another look at the indians so critical was his situation and so nervous did it make our young hero that he took no heed of the state of matters in the canoe until the last moment when he had turned however he ascertained that the two principal chiefs had drawn so near as to be within twenty yards of him though neither held his rifle at ready but each leaned on it in a careless manner as if in no anticipation of any necessity to make a speedy use of the weapon this state of things could not last and le bourdon braced his nerves for the final trial on looking for his paddle however he found that of three which the canoe had contained when he left it not even one was to be seen these wily savages had out of all question taken their opportunity to remove and secrete these simple but almost indispensable means of motion  at the instant when first apprised of the loss just mentioned the beehunters heart sunk within him and he fell into the seat in the stern of the canoe nearly with the weight of so much lead then a species of desperation came over him and putting an end of his cane wand upon the bottom with a vigorous shove he forced the canoe swiftly astern and to windward sudden as was this attempt and rapid as was the movement the jealous eyes and ready hands of the chiefs seemed to anticipate it two shots were fired within a few seconds after the canoe had quitted the shore the reports of the rifles were a declaration of hostilities and a general yell accompanied by a common rush toward the river announced that the whole band now understood that some deception had been practised at their expense  although the two chiefs in advance had been so very prompt they were not quick enough for the rapid movement of the canoe the distance between the stern of the boat and the riceplants was so small that the single desperate shove given by the beehunter sufficed to bury his person in the cover before the leaden messengers reached him anticipating this very attempt and knowing that the savages might get their range from the part of the canoe that was still in sight le bourdon bent his body far over the gunwale grasping the riceplants at the same time and hauling his little craft through them in the way that sailors call hand over hand this expedient most probably saved his life while bending over the gunwale he heard the crack of the rifles and the whizzing of two bullets that appeared to pass just behind him by this time the whole of the canoe was within the cover  in a moment like that we are describing incidents pass so rapidly as almost to defy description it was not twenty seconds from the instant when le bourdon first put his wand down to push the canoe from the land ere he found his person emerging from the cover on its weather side here he was effectually concealed from his enemies not only on account of the cover made by the riceplants but by reason of the darkness the light not extending far enough from the fire to illumine objects on the river nevertheless new difficulties presented themselves when clear of the rice the wind which still blew strong pressed upon his canoe to such a degree as not only to stop its further movement from the shore but so as to turn it broadside to to its power trying with his wand the bee hunter ascertained that it would no longer reach the bottom then he attempted to use the cane as a paddle but soon found it had not sufficient hold of the water to answer for such an implement the most he could effect with it in that way was to keep the canoe for a short distance along the outer edge of the rice until it reached a spot where the plant extended a considerable distance farther toward the middle of the river once within this little forest of the wild rice he was enabled to drag the canoe farther and farther from the north shore though his progress was both slow and laborious on account of the resistance met  all this time the savages were not idle until the canoe got within its new cover it was at no instant fifty yards from the beach and the yells and orders and whoopings sounded as if uttered directly in le bourdons ear a splashing in the water soon announced that our fugitive was pursued by swimmers as the savages knew that the beehunter was without a paddle and that the wind blew fresh the expectation of overtaking their late captive in this manner was by no means chimerical half a dozen active young men would prove very formidable to one in such a situation more especially while entangled in the mazes of the riceplant the beehunter was so well convinced of this circumstance that no sooner did he hear the splashes of the swimmers than he redoubled his exertions to pull his canoe farther from the spot but his progress was slow and he was soon convinced that his impunity was more owing to the fact that his pursuers did not know where to find him than to the rapidity of his flight  notwithstanding his exertions and the start obtained le bourdon soon felt assured that the swimmers were within a hundred feet of him their voices coming from the outer margin of the cover in which he now lay stationary he had ceased dragging the canoe ahead from an apprehension of being heard though the rushing of the wind and the rustling of the rice might have assured him that the slight noises made by his own movements would not be very likely to rise above those sounds the splashing of the swimmers and their voices gradually drew nearer until the beehunter took up his rifle determined to sacrifice the first savage who approached hoping thereby to intimidate the others for the first time it now occurred to him that the breech of his rifle might be used as a paddle and he was resolved to apply it to that service could he once succeed in extricating himself from the enemies by whom he was nearly environed and from the rice  just as le bourdon fancied that the crisis had arrived and that he should soon be called on to kill his man a shout was given by a savage at some distance in the river and presently calls passed from mouth to mouth among the swimmers our hero now listened to a degree that kept his faculty of hearing at a point of painful attention the voices and plashes on the water receded and what was startling a sound was heard resembling that which as produced by a paddle when struck incautiously against the side of a canoe was it then possible that the chippewa was out or had the pottawattamies one boat that had escaped his attention the last was not very probable as he had several times counted their little fleet and was pretty sure of having taken it all to the other side of the river the sound of the paddle was repeated however then it occurred to the beehunter that pigeonswing might be on the scent for another scalp  although the conjecture just mentioned was exceedingly unpleasant to le bourdon the chase of the strange canoe gave him an opportunity to drag his own light craft ahead penetrating deeper and deeper among the wild rice which now spread itself to a considerable distance from the shore and grew so thick as to make it impossible to get through the waving mass at length wearied with his exertions and a little uncertain as to his actual position our hero paused listening intently in order to catch any sounds that might direct his future movements  by this time the savages ceased to call to each other most probably conscious of the advantage it gave the fugitive the beehunter perfectly understood that his pursuers must be aware of its being entirely out of his power to get to windward and that they would keep along the shore of the river as he did himself expecting to see his canoe sooner or later driven by the wind on the beach this had made him anxious to drag his boat as much toward the outer edge of the rice as he could get it and by the puffs of wind that he occasionally felt he hoped he had in a great measure effected his purpose still he had his apprehensions of the savages as some would be very apt to swim quite out into the stream not only to look for him but to avoid being entangled among the plants it was only in the natural channels of the rice of which there were a good many that a swimmer could very readily make his way or be in much safety by waiting long enough moreover the beehunter was sure he should tire out his pursuers and thus get rid of them  just as le bourdon began to think this lastmentioned purpose had been accomplished he heard low voices directly to windward and the splashing of water as if more than one man was coming down upon him forcing the stalks of the plants aside he grasped the rifle and let the canoe drift which it did slowly under the power of the wind notwithstanding the protection of the cover the swimmers forced their way through the stalks but it was evident just then that they were more occupied by their present pursuit than in looking for him presently a canoe came brushing through the rice forced by the wind and dragged by two savages one of whom swam on each bow the last did not see the beehunter or his canoe the one nearest having his face turned in the opposite direction but they were distinctly seen by the former surprised that a seizure should be made with so little fracas le bourdon bent forward to look the better and as the stern of the strange canoe came almost under his eyes he saw the form of margery lying in its bottom his blood curdled at this sight for his first impression was that the charming young creature had been killed and scalped but there being no time to lose he sprang lightly from one canoe to the other carrying the rifle in his hand as he struck in the bottom of the boat of gershom he heard his name uttered in a sweet female voice and knew that margery was living without stopping however to inquire more he moved to the head of the canoe and with a sharp blow on the fingers made each of the savages release his grasp then seizing the riceplants he dragged the little craft swiftly to windward again all this was done as it might be in an instant the savages and the canoe being separated some twenty feet in much less time than is required to relate the occurrence  bourdon are you injured asked margery her voice trembling with anxiety  not in the least dear margeryand you my excellent girl  they caught my canoe and i almost died of fright but they have only dragged it toward the shore  god be praised is there any paddle in the canoe  there are severalone is at your feet bourdonand here i have another  then let us search for my canoe and get out of the rice if we can but find my canoe we shall be safe enough for the savages have nothing in which to cross the river keep your eyes about you margery and look among the rice for the other boat  the search was not long but it was intently anxious at length margery saw the lost canoe just as it was drifting past them and it was secured immediately in a few minutes le bourdon succeeded in forcing the two craft into open water when it was easy for him to paddle both to windward the reader can readily imagine that our hero did not permit many minutes to elapse ere he questioned his companion on the subject of her adventures nor was margery reluctant to tell them she had become alarmed at le bourdons protracted absence and taking advantage of pigeonswing lying down she unloaded her brothers canoe and went out into the river to look for the absent one as a matter of coursethough so feminine and far removed from all appearance of coarseness a true american girl in this respectmargery knew perfectly well how to manage a bark canoe the habits of her life for the last few years made her acquainted with this simple art and strength being much less needed than skill she had no difficulty in going whither she wished the fires served as beacons and margery had been a distant witness of the beehunters necromancy as well as of his escape the instant the latter was effected she endeavored to join him and it was while incautiously paddling along the outer edge of the rice with this intention that her canoe was seized by two of the swimmers as soon as these last ascertained that they had captured a squaw they did not give themselves the trouble to get into the canoea very difficult operation with one made of bark and which is not loadedbut they set about towing the captured craft to the shore swimming each with a single hand and holding on by the other  i shall not soon forget this kindness of yours margery said le bourdon with warmth when the girl had ended her simple tale which had been related in the most artless and ingenuous manner no man could forget so generous a risk on the part of a young woman in his behalf  i hope you do not think it wrong bourdoni should be sorry to have you think ill of me  wrong dear margerybut no matter let us get ourselves out of present difficulties and into a place of safety then i will tell you honestly what i think of it and of you too was your brother awake dear margery when you left the family  i believe nothe sleeps long and heavily after drinking but he can now drink no more until he reaches the settlements  not unless he finds the whiskey spring returned the beehunter laughing  the young man then related to his wondering companion the history of the mummery and incantations of which she had been a distant spectator le bourdons heart was light after his hazards and escape and his spirits rose as his narrative proceeded nor was pretty margery in a mood to balk his humor as the beehunter recounted his contrivances to elude the savages and most especially when he gave the particulars of the manner in which he managed to draw whiskey out of the living rock the girl joined in his merriment and filled the boat with that melody of the laugh of her years and sex which is so beautifully described by halleck     chapter x       the things that once she loved are still the same      yet now there needs another name      to give the feeling which they claim        while she the feeling gives      she cannot call it gladness or delight      and yet there seems to be a richer lovelier light      on een the humblest thing that lives                                 washington allston   the history given by le bourdon lasted until the canoes reached the south shore glad enough was dorothy to see them both safe back for neither of her companions had yet awoke it was then midnight and all now retired to seek the rest which might be so needful to prepare them for the exertions of the next day the beehunter slept in his canoe while margery shared the buffaloskin of her sister  as perfect security for the moment at least was felt by the sleepers their slumbers were sound and reached into the morning then le bourdon arose and withdrawing to a proper distance he threw off his clothes and plunged into the stream in conformity with a daily practice of his at that genial season of the year after bathing the young man ascended a hill whence he might get a good view of the opposite shore and possibly obtain some notion of what the pottawattamies were about in all his movements however the beehunter had an eye to the concealment of his person it being of the last importance that the savages should not learn his position with the intention of concealment the fire had been suffered to go down a smoke being a sign that no indian would be likely to overlook as for the canoe and the bivouac of the party the wild rice and an intermediate hill formed a perfect cover so long as nothing was shown above them  from the height to which he ascended the beehunter aided by his glass got a very clear view of whiskey centre and the parts adjacent the savages were already stirring and were busy in the various avocations of the red man on a warpath one party was disposing of the body of their dead companion several were cooking or cleaning the wildfowl shot in the bay while a group was collected near the spot of the wishedfor spring reluctant to abandon the hopes to which it had given birth at the very moment they were plotting to obtain the scalp of the medicineman the beloved firewater that seduces so many to their destruction who have enjoyed the advantages of moral teaching and which has been a withering curse on the red man of this continent still had its influence and the craving appetites of several of the drunkards of the party brought them to the spot as soon as their eyes opened on the new day the beehunter could see some of this cluster kneeling on the rocks lapping like hounds at the scattered little pools of the liquor while others scented around in the hope of yet discovering the bird that laid the golden egg le bourdon had now little expectation that his assumed character could be maintained among these savages any longer did accident again throw him in their way the chiefs he saw had distrusted him all along but had given him an opportunity to prove what he could do in order to satisfy the more vulgar curiosity of their young men he wisely determined therefore to keep out of the hands of his enemies  although le bourdon could hold a conversation in the tongue of the ojebways he was not fond of so doing he comprehended without difficulty nearly all of what was said by them and had observed the previous night that the warriors made many allusions to a chief whom they styled onoah but who he himself knew was usually called scalping peter among the whites of that frontier this savage had a fearful reputation at all the garrisons though he never showed himself in them and he was now spoken of by the pottawattamies present as if they expected to meet him soon and to be governed by his commands or his advice the beehunter had paid great attention whenever this dreaded name was mentioned for he was fully aware of the importance of keeping clear of an enemy who bore so bad a reputation that it was not considered prudent for a white man to remain long in his company even in a time of peace his english sobriquet had been obtained from the circumstances of its being reputed that this chief who seemed to belong to no tribe in particular while he had great influence with all had on divers occasions murdered the palefaces who fell in his way and then scalped them it was added that he had already forty notches on his pole to note that number of scalps taken from the hated whites in short this indian a sort of chief by birth though of what tribe no one exactly knew appeared to live only to revenge the wrongs done his color by the intruders who had come from toward the rising sun to drive his people into the great salt lake on the other side of the rocky mountains of course there was a good deal that was questionable in these reports a rumor in the openings and on the prairies having this general resemblance to those that circulate in town and in drawingrooms and at feasts that no one of them all can be relied on as rigidly exact but le bourdon was still young and had yet to learn how little of that which we all hear is true and how very much is false nevertheless as an indian tradition is usually more accurate than a white mans written history so is a rumor of the forest generally entitled to more respect than the ceaseless gossipings of the beings who would be affronted were they not accounted civilized  the beehunter was still on the elevated bit of ground making his observations when he was joined by margery the girl appeared fresh and handsome after a night of sleep and coming from her dressing room in a thicket and over a stream of sweet running water but she was sad and thoughtful no sooner had le bourdon shaken her hand and repeated his thanks for the succor of the past night than the full heart of margery poured out its feelings as the swollen stream overflows its banks and began to weep  brother is awake she said as soon as her sobs were quieted by a powerful effect but as is usual with him after hard drinking so stupid that dolly cannot make him understand our danger he tells her he has seen too many injins to be afraid of these and that they will never harm a family that has brought so much liquor into their country  his senses must be at a low ebb truly if he counts on injin friendship because he has sold firewater to the young men answered le bourdon with a nice understanding of not only indian nature but of human nature we may like the sin margery while we detest the tempter i have never yet met with the man paleface or redskin who did not curse in his sober moments the hand that fed his appetite while intoxicated  i dare say that may be very true returned the girl in a low voice but one has need of his reason to understand it what will become of us now it is hard to say why now margery more than yesterday or the day before yesterday there were no savages near us and gershorn had all along told us he intended to start for the garrison at the head of the lake as soon as he got back from his visit to the openings he is back but not in a state to protect his wife and sister from the red man who will be looking for us as soon as they can build a canoe or anything that will do to cross the river with  had they even a canoe returned le bourdon coolly they would not know where to look for us thank heaven that will be a job that would take some time nor is a bark canoe built in a minute but margery if your brother be a little dull and heavy after his debauch i am sober and as much awake as ever i was in my life  oh you have no weakness like that of poor brothers to make you otherwise but bourdon you will naturally wish to take care of yourself and your property and will quit us the first good opportunity im sure that we have no right to expect you will stay a minute longer than it is your interest to do so and i do not know that i wish it  not wish it margery exclaimed the beehunter in the manner of a disappointed man i had supposed you would have wished my company but now i know the contrary i shall not much care how soon i go or into whose hands i fall  it is strange how apt are those who ought to understand one another so readily to misinterpret each others thoughts margery had never seen the beehunter twentyfour hours before though she had often heard of him and of his success in his art for the fame of a man of good reputation and active qualities spreads far on a frontier the very individual whose existence would be nearly overlooked in a crowded region shall be spoken of and known by his qualities a hundred leagues from his place of residence when settlements are few and far apart in this way margery had heard of boden or of bourdon as she called him in common with hundreds who confounding his real name with his sobriquet made the mistake of using the last under the impression that it was the true appellation margery had no other knowledge of french than the few words gleaned in her slow progress among a frontier on which it is true more of that language than of any other was heard but heard under circumstances that were not particularly favorable to the acquisition of a foreign tongue had she understood the real meaning of bourdon she would have bitten off her tongue before she would have once called boden by such an appellation though the beehunter himself was so accustomed to his canadian nickname as to care nothing at all about it but margery did not like to give pain to any one and least of all would she desire to inflict it on the beehunter though he were only an acquaintance of a day still margery could not muster sufficient courage to tell her new friend how much he was mistaken and that of all the youths she had ever met she would most prefer to keep him near her brother and sister in their distress while the young man inspired by a pure and infant passion was just in the frame of mind to believe the worst of himself and of his claims to the attention of her who had begun to occupy so many of his thoughts  no explanation occurring our young people descended from the hill misconceiving each others meaning and wishes and unhappy under the influence of an ideal source of misery when actual circumstances created so many that were substantial and real gershom was found awake but as his sister had described him stupid and lethargic the beehunter at once saw that in his present condition whiskey centre would still be an incumbrance rather than of any service in the event of an occasion for extraordinary exertion margery had hinted that it usually took twentyfour hours to bring her brother entirely round after one of his serious debauches and within that time it was more than probable that the fate of the family would be decided  le bourdon thought intently during breakfast of the condition of his party and of the best mode of proceeding while the pallid and anxious young creature at his side believed he was deliberating solely on the best means of extricating himself and his store of honey from the savages on the other shore had the acquaintance between these young people been of longer date than it actually was margery could not have entertained a notion so injurious to the bee hunter for a single moment but there was nothing either violent or depreciating in supposing that one so near being a total stranger would think first of himself and his own interests in the situation in which this young man was now placed  little was said during the meal dorothy was habitually silent the result of grief and care as for her husband he was too stupid to talk though usually somewhat garrulous while the indian seldom did two things at the same time this was the hour for acting when that for talking should arrive he would be found equal to its duties pigeonswing could either abstain from food or could indulge in it without measure just as occasion offered he had often gone for days without tasting a mouthful with the exception of a few berries perhaps and he had lain about the campfire a week at a time gorging himself with venison like an anaconda it is perhaps fortunate for the american indian that this particular quality of food is so very easy of digestion since his excesses on it are notorious and so common to his habits as almost to belong to his nature death might otherwise often be the consequence  when the breakfast was ended it was time to consult about the future course as yet the pottawattamies had made no new discovery but the sagacity of the red man was ever to be feared when it came to be merely a question of finding his foe in a forest  we have obtained one advantage over the enemy said le bourdon by crossing the river water leaves no trail even had crowsfeather a canoe he might not know where to go in it in order to find us  dat not so put in the chippewa a little dogmatically know we hab canoeknow cross river in him  why should they know this pigeonswing we may have gone out upon the lake or we may have gone up in the oak openings again for anything the pottawattamies can know to the contrary  tell you not so know dont go on lake cause wind blow know dont go up river cause dat hard work know come here cause dat easy injin like to do what easy and paleface do just what injin do crowsfeather make raft pretty soon den he come look arter scalp  yes said margery gently you had better load your canoe at once and go on the lake while the savages cannot reach you the wind is fair for them that are to go north and i have heard you say that you are bound to mackinaw  i shall load my canoe and i shall load yours too margery but i shall not go away from this family so long as any in it stand in need of my services  brother will be able to help us by afternoon he manages a canoe well when himself so go bourdon while you can i dare say you have a mother at home or a sister perhaps a wife  neither interrupted the beehunter with emphasis no one expects me no one has a right to expect me  the color stole into pretty margerys cheeks as she heard these words and a ray of comfort gleamed on an imagination that for the last hour had been portraying the worst still her generous temper did not like the idea of the beehunters sacrificing himself for those who had so few claims on him and she could not but again admonish him of the necessity of losing no time  you will think better of this bourdon the girl resumed we are going south and cannot quit the river with this wind but you could not have a better time to go north unless the wind blows harder than i think it does  the lake is a bad water for a canoe when there is much wind put in gershom yawning after he had spoken as if the effort fatigued him i wonder what were all doing over on this side of the river whiskey centre is a good enough country for me im going back to look arter my casks now ive breakfasted come doll lets load up and be off  you are not yourself yet gershom returned the sorrowful wife or you would not talk in this way you had better listen to the advice of bourdon who has done so much for us already and who will tell you the way to keep out of injin clutches we owe our lives to bourdon gershom and you should thank him for it  whiskey centre muttered a few half intelligible words of thanks and relapsed into his state of drowsy indifference the beehunter saw however that the effects of the brandy were leaving him and he managed to get him on one side where he persuaded the fellow to strip and go into the water the bath did wonders for the poor creature who soon got to be so far himself again as to be of use instead of being an incumbrance when sober and more especially when sober for several consecutive days gershom was a man of sufficient energy possessing originally great personal strength and activity which had been essentially lessened however by his excesses in liquor it has already been stated what a different being he became in a moral point of view after having been sober for any length of time  on his return from the bathing le bourdon again joined the females margery had been weeping but she smiled in a friendly way on meeting his eye and appeared less anxious for his departure than she had been an hour before as the day advanced and no signs of the savages were seen a sense of greater security began to steal over the females and margery saw less necessity for the departure of their new friend it was true he was losing a wind but the lake was rough and after all it might be better to wait in short now that no immediate danger was apparent margery began to reason in conformity with her wishes as is so apt to be the case with the young and inexperienced the beehunter perceived this change in the deportment of his fair friend and was well enough disposed to hope it would admit of a favorable construction  all this time the chippewa had taken little visible interest in the state of the party to which he had now attached himself the previous evening had been fertile in excitement and in gratification and he had since slept and ate to his entire content he was ready to meet events as they might arise and began to plot the means of obtaining more pottawattamie scalps let not the refined reader feel disdisgust at this exhibition of the propensities of an american savage civilized life has had and still has very many customs little less excusable than that of scalping without dragging into the account the thousand and one sins that disgrace and deform society it will be sufficient to look into the single interest of civilized warfare in order to make out our case in the first place the noblest strategy of the art is to put the greatest possible force on the least of the enemy and to slay the weaker party by the mere power of numbers then every engine that ingenuity can invent is drawn into the conflict and rockets revolvers shells and all other infernal devices are resorted to in order to get the better of an enemy who is not provided with such available means of destruction and after the battle is over each side commonly claims the victory sometimes because a partial success has been obtained in a small portion of the field sometimes because half a dozen horses have run away with a gun carrying it into the hostile ranks and again because a bit of rag has fallen from the hands of a dead man and been picked up by one of the opposing side how often has it happened that a belligerent well practised in his art has kept his own colors out of the affair and then boasted that they were not lost now an indian practises no such shameless expedients his point of honor is not a bit of rag but a bit of his skin he shaves his head because the hair encumbers him but he chivalrously leaves a scalplock by the aid of which his conquerors can the more easily carry away the coveted trophy the thought of cheating in such a matter never occurs to his unsophisticated mind and as for leaving his colors in barracks while he goes in the field himself he would disdain itnay cannot practise it for the obvious reason that his head would have to be left with them  thus it was with pigeonswing he had made his toilet for the war path and was fierce in his paint but honest and fairdealing in other particulars if he could terrify his enemies by looking like a skeleton or a demon it was well his enemy would terrify him if possible by similar means but neither would dream or did dream of curtailing by a single hair that which might be termed the flagstaff of his scalp if the enemy could seize it he was welcome to the prize but if he could seize that of the enemy no scruples on the score of refinement or delicacy would be apt to interfere with his movements it was in this spirit then that pigeonswing came to the canoe where le bourdon was holding a little private discourse with margery and gave utterance to what was passing in his mind  good time now get more scalps bourdon said the chippewa in his clipping sententious english  it is a good time too to keep our own chippewa was the answer your scalplock is too long to be put before pottawattamie eyes without good looking after it  nebber mind himif go go if stay stay always good for warrior to bring home scalp  yes i know your customs in this respect pigeonswing but ours are different we are satisfied if we can keep out of harms way when we have our squaws and pappooses with us  no pappooses here returned the indian looking around himdat your squaw eh  the reader can readily imagine that this abrupt question brought blushes into the cheeks of pretty margery making her appear ten times more handsome than before while even le bourdon did not take the interrogatory wholly undisturbed still the latter answered manfully as became his sex  i am not so fortunate as to have a squaw and least of all to have this said le bourdon  why no hab hershe good squaw returned the literalminded indian hansome nough for chief you ask she habnow squaw wellalways like warrior to ask him fuss den say yes  aye that may do with your redskin squaws le bourdon hastily replied for he saw that margery was not only distressed but a little displeasedbut not with the young women of the palefaces i never saw margery before last evening and it takes time for a paleface girl to know a youth  just so wid redskinsometime dont know till too late see plenty dat in wigwam  then it is very much in the wigwams as it is in the houses i have heard this before  why not sameskin make no differencepaleface spile squaw too make too much of her  that can never be exclaimed le bourdon earnestly when a pretty modest warmhearted young woman accepts a youth for a husband he can never make enough of her  on hearing sentiments so agreeable to a womans ears margery looked down but she looked pleased pigeonswing viewed the matter very differently and being somewhat of a partisan in matters relating to domestic economy he had no thought of leaving a point of so much importance in so bad a way accordingly it is not surprising that in pursuing the subject he expressed opinions in several essentials diametrically the reverse of those of the beehunter  easy nough spile squaw rejoined the chippewa what she good for dont make her work cant go on the warpathcant take scalp cant shoot deercant huntcant kill warriorso muss work dat what squaw good for  that may do among red men but we palefaces find squaws good for something elsewe love them and take care of themkeep them from the cold in winter and from the heat in summer and try to make them as comfortable and happy as we can  dat good talk for young squaws ears returned the chippewa a little contemptuously as to manner though his real respect for the beehunter of whose prowess he had so lately been a witness kept him a little within bounds but it bess not take nobody in what injin say to squaw he dowhat paleface say he no do  is that true bourdon demanded margery laughing at the indians earnestness  i shall be honest and own that there may be some truth in itfor the injin promises nothing or next to nothing and it is easy to square accounts in such cases that white men undertake more than they always perform is quite likely to be the fact the injin gets his advantage in this matter by not even thinking of treating his wife as a woman should be treated  how should treat woman put in pigeonswing with warmth when warrior eat venison gib her rest eh dat no goodwhat you call good den if good hunter husband she get noughif ant good hunter she dont get nough just so wid injinsometime hungry sometime full dat way to live  aye that may be your red mans ways but it is not the manner in which we wish to treat our wives ask pretty margery here if she would be satisfied to wait until her husband had eaten his dinner and then come in for the scraps nonopigeonswing we feed our women and children first and come in last ourselves  dat good for pappoosehe little want venisonsquaw tough use to wait do her good  margery now laughed outright at these specimens of indian gallantry which only too well embody the code of the red mans habits doubtless the heart has its influence among even the most savage people for nature has not put into our breasts feelings and passions to be discarded by ones own expedients or wants but no advocate of the american indian has ever yet been able to maintain that woman fills her proper place in his estimate of claims as for margery though so long subject to the whims passions and waywardness of a drunkard she had reaped many of the advantages of having been born in that womans paradise new england we are no great admirers of the legacy left by the puritan to his descendants taken as an inheritance in morals manners and customs and as a whole though there are parts in the way of codicils that there is no portion of the christian world which might not desire to emulate in particular do we allude to the estimate put upon and the treatment received by their women our allusion is not to the refinements and gracefulness of polished intercourse for of them the blarney rock of plymouth has transmitted but a meagre account in the inventory and perhaps the less that is said about this portion of the family property the better but dropping a few degrees in the social scale and coming down to the level where we are accustomed to regard people merely as men and women we greatly question if any other portion of the world can furnish a parallel to the manly considerate rational and wisely discriminating care that the new england husband as the rule bestows on his wife the father on his daughter or the brother on his sister gershom was a living and all things considered a remarkable instance of these creditable traits when sober he was uniformly kind to dorothy and for margery he would at any time risk his life the latter indeed had more power over him than his own wife possessed and it was her will and her remonstrances that most frequently led him back from the verge of that precipice over which he was so often disposed to cast himself by some secret link she bound him closest to the family dwelling and served most to recall the days of youth and comparative innocence when they dwelt together beneath the paternal roof and were equally the objects of the affection and solicitude of the same kind mother his attachment to dorothy was sincere and for one so often brutalized by drink steady but dorothy could not carry him as far back in recollections as the one only sister who had passed the morning of life with him in the same homely but comfortable abode  we have no disposition to exaggerate the character of those whom it is the fashion to term the american yeomen though why such an appellation should be applied to any in a state of society to which legal distinctions are unknown is what we could never understand there are no more of esquires and yeomen in this country than there are of knights and nobles though the quiet manner in which the transition from the old to the new state of things has been made has not rendered the public mind very sensible to the changes but recurring to the class which is a positive thing and consequently ought to have a name of some sort or other we do not belong to those that can sound its praises without some large reservations on the score of both principles and manners least of all are we disposed to set up these yeomen as a privileged class like certain of the titular statesmen of the country and fall down and worship a calfnot a golden one by the wayof our own setting up we can see citizens in these yeomen but not princes who are to be especially favored by laws made to take from others to bestow on them but making allowances for human infirmities the american freeholder belongs to a class that may justly hold up its head among the tillers of the earth he improves daily under the influence of beneficent laws and if he dont get spoiled of which there is some danger in the eagerness of factions to secure his favor and through that favor his voteif he escape this danger he will ere long make a reasonably near approach to that being which the tongue of the flatterer would long since have persuaded him he had already more than got to be  to one accustomed to be treated kindly as was the case with margery the chippewas theory for the management of squaws contained much to excite her mirth as well as her resentment as she now made apparent by her remarks  you do not deserve to have a wife pigeonswing she cried half laughing yet evidently alive to the feelings of her sexcan have no gratitude for a wifes tenderness and care i wonder that a chippewa girl can be found to have you  dont want him coolly returned the indian making his preparations to light his pipegot winnebagoe squaw already good nough for me shoot her tother husband and take his scalpden she come into my wigwam  the wretch exclaimed margery  but this was a word the savage did not understand and he continued to puff at the newly lighted tobacco with all of a smokers zeal when the fire was secured he found time to continue the subject  yes dat good warpathgot rifle got wife got two scalp dont do so well ebbery day  and that woman hoes your corn and cooks your venison demanded the beehunter  sartaincapital good to hoeno good to cookmake deer meat too dry want to be made to mind business byem by teach him no larn all at once like paleface pappoose in school  pigeonswing have you never observed the manner in which the white man treats his squaw  sartainsee him make much of herput her in warm cornerwrap blanket round hergive her venison fore he eat himselfsee all dat oftenwhat den dat dont make it right  i give you up chippewa and agree with margery in thinking you ought not to have a squaw at all  tink alike denwhy no get marry asked the indian without circumlocution  margerys face became red as fire then her cheeks settled into the color of roses and she looked down embarrassed the beehunters admiration was very apparent to the indian though the girl did not dare to raise her eyes from the ground and so did not take heed of it but this gossiping was suddenly brought to an end by a most unexpected cause of interruption the manner and form of which it shall be our office to relate in the succeeding chapter     chapter xi     so should it befor no heart beats       within his cold and silent breast     to him no gentle voice repeats       the soothing words that make us blest                                     peabody   the interruption came from dorothy who on ascending the little height had discovered a canoe coming into the mouth of the river and who was running breathless with haste to announce the circumstance to the beehunter the latter immediately repaired to the eminence and saw for himself the object that so justly had alarmed the woman the canoe was coming in from the lake after running before the wind which now began to abate a little in its strength and it evidently had been endeavoring to proceed to the northward the reason for its entering the river was probably connected with the cookery or food of the party since the lake was each minute getting to be safer and more navigable for so light a craft to le bourdons great apprehension he saw the savages on the north shore making signal to this strange canoe by means of smoke and he foresaw the probability of his enemies obtaining the means of crossing the stream should the strangers proceed in the desired direction to counteract this design he ran down to a spot on the beach where there was no riceplant and showing himself to the strangers invited them to land on the south side which was much the nearest and in other visible respects quite as convenient as the opposite bank of the river one of the strangers soon made a gesture with an arm implying assent and the bows of this strange canoe were immediately turned toward the spot where the beehunter stood  as the canoe drew near the whole party including pigeonswing came to the margin of the water to receive the strangers of the last there were three one paddling at each end of the light bark and a third seated in its centre doing nothing as the beehunter had his glass with which he examined these visitors he was soon questioned by his companions concerning their character and apparent purposes  who are they bourdon demanded the impatient margeryand why do they come here  the last is a question they must answer for themselves but the person paddling in the bows of the canoe seems to be a white man and a soldieror a halfsoldier if one may judge from his dress the man in the middle of the canoe is white also this last fellow seems to be a parsonyes he is a clergyman though pretty well used up in the wilderness as to dress the third man is a redskin beyond all doubt  a clergyman repeated margery in surprise what should a clergyman be doing here  there are missionaries scattered about among the savages i suppose you know and this is probably one of them a body can tell one of these parsons by his outside as far as he can see him the poor man has heard of the war most likely and is trying to get back into the settlements while his scalp is safe on his head  dont hurt him put in the chippewa pointedly know mean well talk about great spiritinjin dont scalp sich medicinemenif dont mind what he say no good to take his scalp  im glad to hear this pigeonswing for i had begun to think no mans scalp was safe under your fingers but what can the soger be doing down thisaway a body would think there was business enough for all the sogers up at the garrison at the head of the lake by the way pigeonswing what has become of your letter to the captain at fort dearborn to let him know of the war  chaw him up like so much baccy answered the chippewayes chaw him up lest pottawattamie get hold on him and ask one of king georges men to read him no good to hab letter in sich times  the general who employed you to carry that letter will scarce thank you for your care  yes he dotank all samepay all sameletter no use now  how can you know that the letter might be the means of preventing the garrison from falling into the enemys hands  got dere already garrison all kill scalp or prisoner pottawattamie talk tell me dat  is this possible mackinaw and chicago both gone already john bull must have been at work among the savages a long time to get them into this state of readiness  sartainwork long as can member alway somebody talkin for great montreal fadder among red men  it must be as you say chippewabut here are our visitorslet us see what we can make of them  by this time the canoe was so near as to render it easy to distinguish countenances and dress without the aid of the glassso near indeed that a swiftmoving boat like the canoe might be expected soon to reach the shore the truth of the observation of the beehunter was confirmed as the strangers approached the individual in the bows of the canoe was clearly a soldier in a fatiguedress and the musket between his legs was one of those pieces that government furnishes to the troops of the line the man in the middle of the boat could no more be mistaken than he in its bows each might be said to be in uniformthe wellworn nay almost threadbare black coat of the minister as much denoting him to be a man of peace as the fatiguejacket into batteries to all of which innovations bad as they may be and useless and uncalled for and wanton as they are we are much more willing to submit than to the newfangled and lubberly abomination of saying on a steamboat or on a ship  while le bourdon was so much astounded at hearing the terrible name of onoah which was familiar enough to him neither of his white companions betrayed any emotion had the indian been termed scalping peter it is probable that both dorothy and margery would have screamed if not actually fled but they knew nothing of the appellation that was given to this mysterious chief in the language of the red men to this circumstance therefore was it owing that the utterance of his name did not produce a general commotion the beehunter observed nevertheless a great change in the demeanor of the chippewa the instant the missionary had uttered the ominous word though he did not seem to be alarmed on the contrary boden fancied that his friend pigeonswing was pleased rather than terrified at ascertaining the character of their visitor though he no longer put himself forward as had been the case previously and from that moment the young warrior appeared to carry himself in a more subdued and less confident manner than was his wont this unexpected demeanor on the part of his friend somewhat confounded le bourdon though it in a degree relieved his apprehensions of any immediate danger all this time the conversation between the missionary and the corporal went on in as quiet and composed a manner as if each saw no ground for any other uneasiness than that connected with the fall of mackinaw  yes sir returned the soldier onoah is a good guide and a great hand at a councilfire but these is wartimes and we must stand to our arms each accordin to his edication and temperyou sir with preachin and prayin and i with gun and baggonet  ah corporal the preaching and praying would be of quite as much account with you men of war as your arms and ammunition if you could only be made to think so look at fort dearborn it was defended by human means having its armed band and its guns and swords and captains and corporals yet you have seen their pride lowered their means of defence destroyed and a large part of your comrades massacred all this has been done to armed men while the lord has brought me an unarmed and humble teacher of his word safely out of the hands of the philistines and placed me here in safety on the shores of the kalamazoo  for that matter mr amen the lord has done the same by me with a musket on my shoulder and a baggonet by my side returned the literal corporal preachin may be good on some marches but arms and ammunition answers well enough on others hearken to the hebrew who knows all the ways of the wilderness and see if he dont give you the same opinion  the hebrew is one of the discarded of the lord as he is one chosen of the lord returned the missionary i agree with you however that he is as safe an adviser for a human adviser as can be easily found therefore will i consult him child of the seed of abraham he added turning to onoah thou hast heard the tidings from mackinaw we cannot think any longer of pursuing our journey in that direction whither then wouldst thou advise that we shall direct our steps i ask this question of thee first as an experienced and sagacious dweller in the wilderness at a more fitting time i intend to turn to the lord and seek divine aid for the direction of our footsteps  aye observed the corporal who entertained a good deal of respect for the zealous but slightly fanatical missionary though he believed an indian was always safe to consult in matters of this sort try bothif one staff should fail it may be well to have another to lean on a good soldier always keeps a part of his troops for a reserve i motto of his coat of arms the gare a qui la touchc or noli me tangere of his device  the head was shaved as is usual with a warrior carrying only the chivalrous scalplock but the chief was not in his paint the outline of this celebrated savages features was bold and eagle like a comparison that his steady calm piercing eye well sustained the chin was full and expanded the lips compressed and firm the teeth were short but even and sound his smile courteous and at times winning  in the way of attire onoah was simply dressed consulting the season and his journey he had a single eagles feather attached to the scalplock and wore a belt of wampum of more than usual value beneath which he had thrust his knife and tomahawk a light figured and fringed huntingshirt of cotton covered his body while leggings of deerskin with a plain moccasin of similar material rose to his knee the latter with the lower part of a stout sinewy thigh was bare he also carried a horn and pouch and a rifle of the american rather than of the military fashion that is one long true and sighted to the deviation of a hair  on landing peter for so he was generally called by the whites when in courtesy they omitted the prefix of scalping courteously saluted the party assembled around the bow of the canoe this he did with a grave countenance like a true american but in simple sincerity so far as human eye could penetrate his secret feelings to each man he offered his hand glancing merely at the two females though it may be questioned if he ever before had looked upon so perfect a picture of female loveliness as margery at that precise instant presented with her face flushed with excitement her spirited blue eye wandering with curiosity and her beautiful mouth slightly parted in admiration  sago sago said peter in his deep guttural enunciation speaking reasonably good english sago sago all ole and young friend come to see you and eat in your wigwamwhich headchief eh  we have neither wigwam nor chief here answered le bourdon though he almost shrunk from taking the hand of one of whom he had heard the tales of which this savage had been the hero we are common people and have no one among us who holds the states commission i live by taking honey of which you are welcome to all you can want and this man is a helper of the sutlers at the garrisons he was travelling south to join the troops at the head of the lake and i was going north to mackinaw on my way in toward the settlements  why is my brother in such haste demanded peter mildly bees get tired of making honey  the times are troubled and the red men have dug up the hatchet a paleface cannot tell when his wigwam is safe  where my brodder wigwam asked peter looking warily around him see he ant here where is he  over in the openings far up the kalamazoo we left it last week and had got to the hut on the other shore when a party of pottawattamies came in from the lake and drove us over here for safety  on hearing this peter turned slowly to the missionary raising a finger as one makes a gesture to give emphasis to his words  tole you so said the indian know dere was pottawattamie dere can tell em great way off  we fear them having women in our party added the beehunter and think they might fancy our scalps  dat like enough all injin love scalp in wartime you yankee dey brish cant travel on same path now and not quarrel must not let pottawattamie catch you  how are we to help it now you have come in we had all the canoes on this side of the river and were pretty safe but should you cross and place your canoe in their hands there is nothing to prevent them from doing what they please with us if you will promise not to cross the river till we can get out well on the lake we may shift our ground however and leave no trail  muss cross overyes muss cross over else pottawattamie tink it strangeyes muss cross over shant touch canoe dough  how can you help it if they be so minded you are but a single man and they are twenty  on hearing this corporal flint pricked up his ears and stood if possible more erect than ever for he considered himself a part of a man at least and one moreover who had served in all the wars of the west from the great battle of st glair to that of mad anthony he was spared the necessity of a reply however for peter made a significant gesture which as much as told him that he would take that office on himself  no need be afeard said peter quietly know pottawattamieknow all chief nobody touch canoe of onoah when he say dont touch him  yet they are injins of the british and i see you here in company with a soldier of uncle sam  no matter onoah go just where he please sometime to pottawattamie sometime to iroquois all ojebways know onoah all six nation know him well all injin know him even cherokee know him now and open ears when he speak muss cross river and shake hand with crowsfeather  there was nothing boastful or vaunting in peters manner while he thus announced his immunity or power but he alluded to it in a quiet natural way like one accustomed to being considered a personage of consequence mankind in general make few allowances for the influence of habit the sensibilities of the vainglorious themselves being quite as often wounded by the most natural and direct allusions of those who enjoy advantages superior to their own as by those that are intended to provoke comparisons in the present instance however no such feeling could exist the indian asserting no more than his extended reputation would fully maintain  when peter had thus expressed himself the missionary thought it meet to add a few words in explanation this he did however aside walking a little apart with the beehunter in order so to do as for gershom no one seemed to think him of sufficient importance to throw away any interest or care on him  you can trust to peter friend beehunter the missionary observed for what he promises he will perform i know him well and have put myself altogether in his hands if he says that the pottawattamies are not to have his canoe the pottawattamies will not get it he is a man to be depended on  is not this then scalping peter who bears so terrible a name on all this frontier demanded le bourdon  the same but do not disturb yourself with names they hurt no one and will soon be forgotten a descendant of abraham and of isaac and of jacob is not placed in the wilderness by the hand of divine power for no purpose since he is here rely on it it is for good  a descendant of abraham and isaac and jacob is not peter then a redskin and an injin  certainly though no one knows his tribe but himself i know it friend beehunter and shortly shall proclaim it throughout the length and breadth of the land yes it has been given to me to make this important discovery though i sometimes think that peter himself is really as ignorant as all around him of the tribe to which he properly belongs  do you wish to keep it a secret from me too i own that in my eyes the tribe of a redskin goes a good way in making up my opinions of the man is he a winnebagoe  no my friend the winnebagoes have no claims on him at all  nor a pottawattamie ottawa or ojebway of any sort  he is none of these peter cometh of a nobler tribe than any that beareth such names  perhaps he is an injin of the six nations they tell me that many such have found their way hither since the war of the revolution  all that may be true but peter cometh not of pottawattamie ottawa nor ojebway  he can hardly be of the sacs or the foxes he has not the appearance of an injin from a region so far west  neither neither neither answered parson amen now so full of his secret as fairly to let it overflow peter is a son of israel one of the lost children of the land of judea in common with many of his red brethrenmind i do not say all but with many of his red brethrenthough he may not know exactly of what tribe himself this last point has exercised me greatly and days and nights have i pondered over the facts turn to genesis xlix and 14th and there will you find all the authorities recorded zebulon shall dwell at the haven of the sea that refers to some other red brother nearer to the coast most clearly issachar is a strong ass crouching down between two burdens and bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant unto tribute that refers most manifestly to the black man of the southern states and cannot mean peter dan shall be a serpent by the way an adder in the path there is the red man for you drawn with the pencil of truth gad a troop shall overcome him here corporal come this way and tell our new friend how mad anthony with his troopers finally routed the redskins you were there and know all about it no language can be plainer until the longknives and leatherstockings came into the woods the red man had his way against them he could not prevail  yes returned corporal flint who delighted in talking of the wars it was very much as parson amen says the savages by their nimbleness and artifices would first ambush us and then break away from our charges until the ginral bethought him of bringing cavalry into the wilderness nobody ever thought of such a plan until old anthony invented it as soon as we got the fire of the savages at the mawmee we charged with the baggonet and put em up and no sooner was they up than away went the horse into them flourishing the long knife and pressing the heel of the leather stocking into the flanks of their beasts mr amen has found a varse in scripturs that does come near to the pint and almost foretells our victory and that too as plain as it stood in dispatches arterward from headquarters  gad a troop shall overcome him put in the missionary triumphantly  thats itthats it there was just one troop on em and not a man more mad anthony said a troop would answer arter we had put the redskins up out of their ambushes or any other bushes and so it did i must acknowledge that i think more of the scripturs than ever since parson amen read to me that varse  hearken unto this friend beehunter added the missionary who by this time had fairly mounted his hobby and fancied he saw a true israelite in every other indian of the west and tell me if words were ever more propheticbenjamin shall ravin as a wolf in the morning he shall devour his prey and at night he shall divide the spoil the art of man could not draw a more faithful picture of these indians  boden was not much skilled in sacred lore and scarce knew what to make of all this the idea that the american indians were the descendants of the lost tribes of israel was entirely new to him nor did he know anything to boast of touching those tribes even in their palmiest days and while in possession of the promised land still he had some confused recollection of that which he had read when a childwhat american has notand was enabled to put a question or two in return for the information now received what do you take the savages of america for jews he asked understanding the general drift of the missionarys meaning  as sure as you are there friend beehunter though you are not to suppose that i think peter onoah of the tribe of benjamin no i turn to the 21st verse for the tribe of peter naphthalinaphthalis the root of his stock naphthali is a hind let loose he giveth goodly words now what can be plainer than this a hind let loose is a deer running at large and by a metaphor that deer includes the man that hunts him now peter has beennay is stilla renowned hunter and is intended to be enumerated among the hinds let loose he giveth goodly words would set that point at rest if anything were wanting to put it beyond controversy for onoah is the most eloquent speaker ear ever listened to no one that has ever heard him speak can doubt that he is the one who giveth goodly words  to what other circumstance the wellintentioned missionary would next have alluded in the course of this demonstration of a theory that had got to be a favorite with him is more than can now be related since the indian himself drew near and put an end to the conversation peter had made up his mind to cross the river at once and came to say as much to his companions both of whom he intended to leave behind him le bourdon could not arrest this movement short of an appeal to force and force he did not like to use doubting equally its justice and its prudence     chapter xii  there is no other land like thee no dearer shore thou art the shelter of the free the home the port of liberty thou hast been and shall ever be till time is oer ere i forget to think upon my land shall mother curse the son she bore                                                   percival   the independent not to say controlling manner of peter would seem to put all remonstrances and arguments at defiance le bourdon soon had occasion to see that both the missionary and the corporal submitted to his wishes and that there was no use in gainsaying anything he proposed in all matters he did as he pleased his two companions submitting to his will as completely as if one of them had seen in this supposed child of israel joshua the son of nun and the other even aaron the highpriest himself  peters preparations were soon made everything belonging to the missionary and the corporal was removed from the canoe which then contained only the extra clothing and the special property of the indian himself as soon as ready the latter quietly and fearlessly paddled away his canoe going easily and swiftly down before the wind he had no sooner got clear of the rice than the beehunter and margery ran away to the eminence to watch his movements and to note his reception among the pottawattamies leaving them there we shall accompany the canoe in its progress toward the northern shore  at first peter paddled quietly on as if he had no other object before him than the passage of the river when quite clear of the rice however he ceased and undid his bundle of clothes which were carefully put away in the knapsack of a soldier from this repository of his effects the chief carefully drew forth a small bundle on opening which no less than seven fresh human scalps appeared these he arranged in order on a wandlike pole when satisfied with the arrangement he resumed the paddle it was apparent from the first that the pottawattamies on the north shore had seen the strange canoe when it entered the river and they now collected in a group at the ordinary landing beneath the chiente to await its approach peter ceased his own exertion as soon as he had got within a hundred yards of the beach took the scalppole in his hand arose and permitted the canoe to drift down before the wind certain it would take the desired direction from the circumstance of his having placed it precisely to windward of the landing once or twice he slowly waved the pole in a way to draw attention to the scalps which were suspended from its end each obvious and distinct from its companions  napoleon when he returned from the campaign of austerlitz or wellington when he entered the house of commons to receive the thanks of its speaker on his return from spain or the chief of all the battles of the rio bravo del norte or him of the valley of mexico whose exploits fairly rival those of cortes himself could scarcely be a subject of greater interest to a body of spectators assembled to do him honor than was this wellknown indian as he drew near to the pottawattamies waving his scalps in significant triumph glory as the homage paid by man to military renown is termed was the common impulse with them all it is true that measured by the standards of reason and right the wise and just might find motives for appreciating the victories of those named differently from the manner in which they are usually regarded through the atmosphere of success but in the common mind it was all glory alike the name of onoah passed in murmurs of admiration from mouth to mouth for as it appeared the person of this renowned indian was recognized by many on the shore some time ere he reached it himself  crowsfeather and the other chiefs advanced to meet the visitor the young men standing in the background in respectful admiration peter now stepped from the canoe and greeted each of the principal men with the courteous gravity of a savage he shook hands with each calling one or two by name a proof of the parties having met before then the following dialogue occurred all spoke in the tongue of the pottawattamies but as we have had occasion to remark on previous occasions it is to be presumed that the reader would scarcely be able to understand what was said were we to record it word for word in the language in which it was uttered in consequence of this difficulty and for other reasons to which it may not be necessary to allude we shall endeavor to translate that which passed as closely as the english idioms will permit us so to do  my father is very welcome exclaimed crowsfeather who by many degrees exceeded all his companions in consideration and rank i see he has taken many scalps as is his practice and that the pale faces are daily getting to be fewer will the sun ever rise on that day when their wigwams will look like the branches of the oak in winter can my father give us any hope of seeing that hour  it is a long path from the saltlake out of which the sun rises to that other saltlake in which it hides itself at night the sun sleeps each night beneath water but it is so hot that it is soon dried when it comes out of its bed in the morning this is the great spirits doings and not ours the sun is his sun the indians can warm themselves by it but they cannot shorten its journey a single tomahawk handles length the same is true of time it belongs to the manitou who will lengthen or shorten it as he may see fit we are his children and it is our duty to submit he has not forgotten us he made us with his own hand and will no more turn us out of the land than a father will turn his child from the wigwam  we hope this is so but it does not seem thus to out poor weak eyes onoah we count the palefaces and every summer they grow fast as the grass on the prairies we can see more when the leaf falls than when the tree is in bud and then more when the leaf is in bud than when it falls a few moons will put a town where the pine stood and wigwams drive the wolves from their homes in a few years we shall have nothing but dogs to eat if the paleface dogs do not eat us  squaws are impatient but men know how to wait this land was given to the red man by the great spirit as i have often told you my children if he has let in the palefaces for a few winters it is to punish us for having done wrong now that we are sorry for what we have done he will help us to drive away the strangers and give us the woods again to hunt in by ourselves have not messengers from our great father in montreal been among the pottawattamies to strengthen their hearts  they are always whispering in the ears of our tribes i cannot remember the time when whispers from montreal have not been among us their blankets are warm their firewater is strong their powder is good and their rifles shoot well but all this does not stop the children of uncle sam from being more at night than they were in the morning the red men get tired of counting them they have become plentier than the pigeons in the spring my father has taken many of their scalps but the hair must grow after his knife their scalps are so many  see rejoined peter lowering his pole so that all might examine his revolting trophies these come from the soldiers at the head of the lake blackbird was there with his young men no one of them all got as many scalps this is the way to stop the white pigeon from flying over us in such flocks as to hide and darken the sun  another murmur of admiration passed through the crowd as each young warrior bent forward to count the number of the scalps and to note by signs familiar to themselves the ages sex and condition of the different victims here was another instance among a hundred others of which they had heard of the prowess of the mysterious onoah as well as of his inextinguishable hatred of the race that was slowly but unerringly supplanting the ancient stock causing the places that once knew the people of their tribes to know them no more as soon as this little burst of feeling had subsided the conversation went on  we have had a paleface medicineman among us onoah continued crowsfeather and he has so far blinded us that we know not what to think  the chief then recounted the leading events of the visit of the bee hunter to the place stating each occurrence fairly as he understood it and as fairly confessing that even the chiefs were at a loss to know what to make of the affair in addition to this account he gave the mysterious onoah the history of the prisoner they had taken the death of elksfoot their intention to torture that very morning the chippewa they had captured and his flight together with the loss of their young man and the subsequent escape of their unknown enemies who had taken away all of their own canoes how far the medicineman had anything to do with the other events of his narrative crowsfeather very candidly admitted he could not even conjecture he was still at a loss whether to set down the conjurer for a pretender or as a real oracle peter however was less credulous even than the chiefs he had his superstitious notions like all uneducated men but a clear head and quick intellect placed him far above the weaknesses of the red man in general on receiving a description of the person of the unknown medicineman he at once recognized the beehunter with an indian to describe and an indian to interpret or apply escape from discovery was next to impossible  although onoah or the tribeless as he was also frequently called by the red men from the circumstance of no ones knowing to what particular section of the great indian family he belonged perfectly understood that the beehunter he had seen on the other shore was the individual who had been playing the part of a conjurer among these pottawattamies he was very careful not to reveal the fact to crowsfeather he had his own policy and was fully aware of all the virtue there is in mystery and reserve with an indian these qualities go farther even than with a white man and we of the caucasian race are not entirely exempt from the folly of being deceived by appearances on the present occasion peter kept his knowledge to himself still leaving his red brethren in doubt and uncertainty but he took care to be right in his own opinions by putting as many questions as were necessary for that purpose once assured of this fact he turned to other subjects of even greater interest to himself and his companions  the conference which now took place between the tribeless and crowsfeather was held apart both being chiefs of too much importance to be intruded on at a moment like that the two chiefs exhibited a very characteristic picture while engaged in this conference they seated themselves on a bank and drawing their legs partially under them sat face to face with their heads less than two feet asunder occasionally gesticulating with dignity but each speaking in his turn with studied decorum crowsfeather was highly painted and looked fierce and warlike but onoah had nothing extraordinary about him with the exception of the decorations and dress already described unless it might be his remarkable countenance the face of this indian ordinarily wore a thoughtful cast an expression which it is not unusual to meet with in a savage though at times it lighted up as it might be with the heat of inward fires like the crater giving out its occasional flames beneath the hues of a saddened atmosphere one accustomed to study the human face and to analyze its expressions would possibly have discovered in that countenance lines of deep artifice together with the traces of a profound and constitutional enthusiasm he was bent at that very moment on a scheme worthy of the loftiest spirit living the regeneration and union of the people of his race with a view to recover the possessions they had yielded to the palefaces but it was a project blended with the ferocity and revenge of a savagenoble while ferocious  not idly had the whites scattered along that frontier given the sobriquet of scalping to peter as his pole now showed it had been earned in a hundred scenes of bloody vengeance and so great had been his success that the warrior prophet and councillor for all these characters were united in his single person began to think the attainment of his wishes possible as a matter of course much ignorance of the power of the anglosaxon race on this continent was blended with these opinions and hopes but it was scarcely an ignorance exceeding that of certain persons of far higher pretensions in knowledge who live in another hemisphere and who often set themselves up as infallible judges of all things connected with man and his attributes peter the tribeless was not more in fault than those who fancied they saw the power of this great republic in the gallant little band collected at corpus christi under its indomitable chief and who march by march nay foot by foot as it might be have perseveringly predicted the halt the defeat the disasters and final discomfiture which it has not yet pleased divine providence to inflict on this slight effort of the young hercules as he merely moves in his cradle alas the enemy that most menaces the overthrow of this new and otherwise invincible exhibition of human force is within seated in the citadel itself and must be narrowly watched or he will act his malignant purpose and destroy the fairest hopes that ever yet dawned on the fortunes of the human race  the conference between the chiefs lasted fully an hour crowsfeather possessed much of the confidence of peter and as for onoah neither tecumseh nor his brother the prophet commanded as much of the respect of crowsfeather as he did himself some even whispered that the tribeless was the individual who lay behind all and that the others named merely acted as he suggested or advised the reader will obtain all the insight into the future that it is necessary now to give him by getting a few of the remarks made by the two colloquists just before they joined the rest of the party  my father then intends to lead his palefaces on a crooked path and take their scalps when he has done with them said crowsfeather who had been gravely listening to peters plans of future proceeding but who is to get the scalp of the chippewa  one of my pottawattamie young men but not until i have made use of him i have a medicinepriest of the palefaces and a warrior with me but shall not put their scalps on my pole until they have paddled me further the council is to be first held in the oak openingswe translate this term freely that used by peter meaning rather the open woods of the prairiesand i wish to show my prisoners to the chiefs that they may see how easy it is to cut off all the yankees i have now four men of that people and two squaws in my power let every red man destroy as many and the land will soon be clear of them all  this was uttered with gleamings of ferocity in the speakers face that rendered his countenance terrible even crowsfeather quailed a little before that fierce aspect but the whole passed away almost as soon as betrayed and was succeeded by a friendly and deceptive smile that was characteristic of the wily asiatic rather than of the aboriginal american  they cannot be counted returned the pottawattamie chief as soon as his restraint was a little removed by this less terrific aspect of his companion if all i hear is true blackbird says that even the squaws of the palefaces are numerous enough to overcome all the red men that remain  there will be two less when i fasten to my pole the scalps of those on the other side of the river answered peter with another of his transient but startling gleams of intense revenge but no matter now my brother knows all i wish him to do not a hair of the head of any of these palefaces must be touched by any hand but mine when the time comes the knife of onoah is sure the pottawattamies shall have their canoes arid can follow us up the river they will find us in the openings and near the prairie round they know the spot for the red men love to hunt the deer in that region now go and tell this to your young men and tell them that corn will not grow nor the deer wait to be killed by any of your people if they forget to do as i have said vengeance shall come when it is time  crowsfeather communicated all this to his warriors who received it as the ancients received the words of their oracles each member of the party endeavored to get an accurate notion of his duty in order that he might comply to the very letter with the injunctions received so profound was the impression made among all the red men of the northwest by the previous labors of the tribeless to awaken a national spirit and so great was their dread of the consequences of disobedience that every warrior present felt as if his life were the threatened penalty of neglect or disinclination to obey  no sooner however had crowsfeather got through with his communication than a general request was made that the problem of the whiskeyspring might be referred to onoah for solution the young men had strong hopes notwithstanding all that had passed that this spring might yet turn out to be a reality the scent was still there strong and fragrant and they could not get rid of the notion that firewater grew on that spot it is true their faith had been somewhat disturbed by the manner in which the medicineman had left them and by his failure to draw forth the gushing stream which he had impliedly promised and in a small degree performed nevertheless little pools of whiskey had been found on the rock and several had tasted and satisfied themselves of the quality of the liquor as is usual that taste had created a desire for more a desire that seldom slumbered on an indian palate when strong drinks were connected with its gratification  peter heard the request with gravity and consented to look into the matter with a due regard to his popularity and influence he had his own superstitious views but among them there did not happen to be one which admitted the possibility of whiskeys running in a stream from the living rock still he was willing to examine the charmed spot scent the fragrant odor and make up his own estimate of the artifices by which the beehunter had been practising on the untutored beings into whose hand chance had thrown him  while the young men eagerly pointed out the precise spots where the scent was the strongest peter maintained the most unmoved gravity he did not kneel to smell the rocks like the other chiefs for this an innate sense of propriety told him would be undignified but he made his observations closely and with a keen indianlike attention to every little circumstance that might aid him in arriving at the truth all this time great was the awe and deep the admiration of the lookerson onoah had succeeded in creating a moral power for himself among the indians of the northwest which much exceeded that of any other red man of that region the whites scarcely heard of him knew but little of his career and less of his true character for both were shrouded in mystery there is nothing remarkable in this ignorance of the palefaces of the time they did not understand their own leaders much less the leaders of the children of the openings the prairies and the forest at this hour what is really known by the mass of the american people of the true characters of their public men no nation that has any claim to civilization and publicity knows less and for several very obvious reasons the want of a capital in which the intelligence of the nation periodically assembles and whence a corrected public opinion on all such matters ought constantly to flow as truth emanates from the collisions of minds is one of these reasons the extent of the country which separates men by distances that no fact can travel over without incurring the dangers of being perverted on the road is another but the most fatal of al he influences that tend to mislead the judgment of the american citizen is to be found in the abuse of a machinery that was intended to produce an exactly contrary effect if the tongue was given to man to communicate ideas to his fellows so has philosophy described it as a gift to conceal his thoughts if the press was devised to circulate truth so has it been changed into a means of circulating lies one is easily nay more easily sent abroad on the four winds of the heavens than the other truth requires candor impartiality honesty research and industry but a falsehood whether designed or not stands in need of neither of that which is the most easily produced the country gets the most and it were idle to imagine that a people who blindly and unresistingly submit to be put as it might be under the feet of falsehood as respects all their own public men can ever get very accurate notions of those of other nations  thus was it with onoah his name was unknown to the whites except as a terrible and muchdreaded avenger of the wrongs of his race with the red men it was very different they had no forked tongues to make falsehood take the place of truth or if such existed they were not believed the pottawattamies now present knew all about tecumseh footnote a tiger stooping for his prey of whom the whites had also various and ample accounts this shawanee chief had long been active among them and his influence was extended far and near he was a bold restless and ingenious warrior one perhaps who better understood the art of war as it was practised among red men than any indian then living they knew the name and person also of his brother elkswatawa footnote a door opened or the prophet whose name has also become incorporated with the histories of the times these two chiefs were very powerful though scarce dwelling regularly in any tribe but their origin their careers and their characters were known to all as were those of their common father pukeesheno footnote i light from fly and their mother meethetaskefootnote a turtle laying her eggs in the sand but with onoah it was very different with him the past was as much of a mystery as the future no indian could say even of what tribe he was born the totem that he bore on his person belonged to no people then existing on the continent and all connected with him his history nation and family was conjecture and fancy  it is said that the indians have traditions which are communicated only to a favored few and which by them have been transmitted from generation to generation an enlightened and educated red man has quite recently told us in person that he had been made the repository of some of these traditions and that he had thus obtained enough of the history of his race to be satisfied that they were not derived from the lost tribes of israel though he declined communicating any more it is so natural to resort to secrecy in order to extend influence that we can have no difficulty in believing the existence of the practice there probably being no other reason why free masonry or odd fellowship should have recourse to such an expedient but to rule through the imagination in preference to the judgment now peter enjoyed all the advantages of mystery it was said that even his real name was unknown that of onoah having been given in token of the many scalps he took and that of wawanosh which he also sometimes bore having been bestowed on him by adoption in consequence of an act of favor extended to him from an ojebway of some note while that of peter was clearly derived from the whites some of his greatest admirers whispered that when the true name of the tribeless should get to be known his origin early career and all relating to him would at once become familiar to every red man at present the indians must rest content with what they saw and understood the wisdom of wawa nosh made itself felt in the councils his eloquence no speaker has equalled for ages as for his vengeance on the enemies of his race that was to be estimated by the scalps he had taken more than this no indian was to be permitted to know until the mission of this oracle and chief was completed  had one enlightened by the education of a civilized man been there to watch the movements and countenance of peter as he scented the whiskey and looked in vain for the cause of the odor and for a clew to the mystery which so much perplexed the pottawattamies he would probably have discovered some reason to distrust the sincerity of this remarkable savages doubts if ever peter was an actor it was on that occasion he did not in the least fall into any of the errors of his companions but the scent a good deal confounded him at first at length he came to the natural conclusion that this unusual odor was in some way connected with the family he had left on the other shore and from that moment his mind was at ease  it did not suit the views of peter however to explain to the pottawattamies that which was now getting to be so obvious to himself on the contrary he rather threw dust into the eyes of the chiefs with a view to bring them also under the influence of superstition after making his observations with unmoved gravity he promised a solution of the whole affair when they should again meet in the openings and proposed to recross the river before quitting the shore peter and crowsfeather had a clear understanding on the subject of their respective movements and as soon as the former began to paddle up against the wind the latter called his young men together made a short address and led them into the woods as if about to proceed on a march of length the party notwithstanding did not proceed more than a mile and a half when it came to a halt and lighted a fire in order to cook some venison taken on the way  when peter reached the south shore he found the whole group assembled to receive him his tale was soon told he had talked with the pottawattamies and they were gone the canoes however must be carried to the other shore and left there in order that their owners might recover their property when they returned this much had peter promised and his paleface friends must help him to keep his word then he pointed to the openings as to their place of present safety there they would be removed from all immediate danger and he would accompany them and give them the countenance and protection of his name and presence as for going south on the lake that was impossible so long as the wind lasted and it was useless even could it be done the troops had all left chicago and the fort was destroyed  parson amen and corporal flint both of whom were completely deluded by peter fancying him a secret friend of the whites in consequence of his own protestations to that effect and the service he had already rendered them in appearance at least instantly acquiesced in this wily savages proposal it was the best the wisest nay the only thing that now could be done mackinaw was gone as well as chicago and detroit must be reached by crossing the peninsula instead of taking the easier but far more circuitous route of the lakes gershom was easily enough persuaded into the belief of the feasibility as well as of the necessity of this deviation from his original road and he soon agreed to accompany the party  with le bourdon the case was different he understood himself and the wilderness for him the wind was fair and there was no necessity for his touching at mackinaw at all it is true he usually passed several days on that pleasant and salubrious island and frequently disposed of lots of honey there but he could dispense with the visit and the sales there was certainly danger now to be apprehended from the ottawas who would be very apt to be out on the lake after this maritime excursion against the fort but it was possible even to elude their vigilance in a word the bee hunter did not believe in the prudence of returning to the openings but thought it by far the wisest for the whole party to make the best of its way by water to the settlements all this he urged warmly on his white companions taking them aside for that purpose and leaving peter and pigeonswing together while he did so  but parson amen would as soon have believed that his old congregation in connecticut was composed of philistines as not to believe that the red men were the lost tribes and that peter in particular was not especially and elaborately described in the old testament he had become so thoroughly possessed by this crotchet as to pervert everything that he saw read or heard into evidence of some sort or other of the truth of his notions in this respect there was nothing peculiar in the good missionarys weakness it being a failing common to partisans of a theory to discover proofs of its truths in a thousand things in which indifferent persons can find even no connection with the subject at all in this frame of mind the missionary would as soon think of letting go his hold on the bible itself as think of separating from an indian who might turn out any day to be a direct representative of abraham and isaac and jacob not to speak irreverently but to use language that must be familiar to all the wellmeaning missionary wished to be in at the death  corporal flint too had great faith in peter it was a part of the scheme of the savage to make this straight forward soldier an instrument in placing many scalps in hit power and though he had designed from the first to execute his bloody office on the corporal himself he did not intend to do so until he had made the most of him as a stoolpigeon here were four more palefaces thrown in his power principally by means of the confidence he had awakened in the minds of the missionary and the soldier and that same confidence might be made instrumental in adding still more to the number peter was a sagacious even a farseeing savage but he labored under the curse of ignorance had his information been of a more extended nature he would have seen the utter fallacy of his project to destroy the palefaces altogether and most probably would have abandoned it  it is a singular fact that while such men as tecumseh his brother the prophet and peter were looking forward to the downfall of the republic on the side of the forest so many who ought to have been better informed on such a subject were anxiously expecting nay confidently predicting it from beyond the atlantic notwithstanding these sinister soothsayers the progress of the nation has by a beneficent providence been onward and onward until it is scarcely presumptuous to suppose that even england has abandoned the expectation of classing this country again among her dependencies the fortunes of america under god depend only on herself america may destroy america of that there is danger but it is pretty certain that europe united could make no serious impression on her favored by position and filled with a population that we have ever maintained was one of the most military in existence a truth that recent events are hourly proving to be true it much exceeds the power of all the enemies of her institutions to make any serious impression on her there is an enemy who may prove too much for her it exists in her bosom and god alone can keep him in subjection and repress his desolation  these were facts however of which wawanosh or onoah was as ignorant as if he were an english or french minister of state and had got his notions of the country from english or french travellers who wished for what they predicted he had heard of the towns and population of the republic but one gets a very imperfect notion of any fact of this sort by report unless previous experience has prepared the mind to make the necessary comparisons and fitted it to receive the images intended to be conveyed no wonder then that peter fell into a mistake common to those who had so many better opportunities of forming just opinions and of arriving at truths that were sufficiently obvious to all who did not wilfully shut their eyes to their existence     chapter xiii       hearest thou voices on the shore       that our ears perceive no more       deafened by the cataracts roar       bear through sorrow wrong and ruth       in thy heart the dew of youth       on thy lips the smile of truth                             longfellow   from all that has been stated the reader will probably be prepared to learn that boden did not succeed in his effort to persuade gershom and the other christians to accompany him on his voyage round by lake huron corporal flint was obdurate and parson amen confiding as for gershom he did not like the thought of retracing his steps so soon and the females were obliged to remain with the husband and brother  you had better get out of the river while all the canoes are on this side said margery as she and le bourdon walked toward the boats in company the council having ended and everything beginning to assume the appearance of action remember you will be quite alone and have a long long road to travel  i do remember all this margery and see the necessity for all of us getting back to the settlements as fast as we can i dont half like this peter his name is a bad one in the garrisons and it makes me miserable to think that you may be in his power  the missionary and the corporal as well as my brother seem willing to trust himwhat can two females do when their male protector has made up his mind in such a matter  one who would very gladly be your protector pretty margery has not made up his mind to the prudence of trusting peter at all put yourself under my care and my life shall be lost or i will carry you safe to your friends in detroit  this might be deemed tolerably explicit yet was it not sufficiently so to satisfy female scruples or female rights margery blushed and she looked down while she did not look absolutely displeased but her answer was given firmly and with a promptitude that showed she was quite in earnest  i cannot quit dorothy placed as she isand it is my duty to die with brother she said  have you thought enough of this margery may not reflection change your mind  this is a duty on which a girl is not called to reflect she must feel in a matter of conscience  the beehunter fairly sighed and from a very resolute he became a very irresolute sort of person as was natural to one in his situation he let out the secret current his thoughts had taken in the remarks which followed  i do not like the manner in which peter and pigeonswing are now talking together he said when an injin is so earnest there is generally mischief brewing do you see peters manner  he seems to be telling the young warrior something that makes both forget themselves i never saw two men who seem so completely to forget all the rest of the world as them two savages what can be the meaning bourdon of so much fierce earnestness  i would give the world to knowpossibly the chippewa may tell me we understand each other tolerably well and just as you spoke he gave me a secret sign that i have a right to think means confidence and friendship that savage is either a fast friend or a thorough villain  is it safe to trust any of them bourdon nonoyour best way will be to go down the lakes and get back to detroit as soon as you can not only your property but your life is at risk  go and leave you here margeryhere with a brother whose failing you know as well as i do and who may at any moment fall back into his old ways i should not be a man to do it  but brother can get no liquor now for it is all emptied when himself for a few days gershom is a good protector as well as a good provider you must not judge brother too harshly from what you have seen of him bourdon  i do not wish to judge him at all margery we all have our failins and whiskey is his i dare say mine are quite as bad in some other way its enough for me margery that gershom is your brother to cause me to try to think well of him we must not trust to there being no more liquor among us for if that soger is altogether without his rations hes the first soger i ever met with who was  but this corporal is a friend of the minister and ministers ought not to drink  ministers are like other men as them that live much among em will soon find out howsever if you will stay margery there is no more to be said i must cache footnote a western term obviously derived from cacher to conceal cache is much used by the western adventurers my honey and get the canoe ready to go up stream again where you go margery i go too unless you tell me that you do not wish my company  this was said quietly but in the manner of one whose mind was made up margery scarce knew how to take it that she was secretly delighted cannot be denied while at the same time that she felt a generous and lively concern for the fortunes of le bourdon is quite as certain as gershom just then called to her to lend her assistance in preparing to embark she had no leisure for expostulation nor do we know that she now seriously wished to divert the beehunter from his purpose  it was soon understood by every one that the river was to be crossed in order that gershom might get his household effects previously to ascending the kalamazoo this set all atwork but the chippewa who appeared to le bourdon to be watchful and full of distrust as the latter had a job before him that would be likely to consume a couple of hours the others were ready for a start long before he had his hole dug it was therefore arranged that the bee hunter should complete his task while the others crossed the stream and went in quest of gershoms scanty stock of household goods pigeonswing however was not to be found when the canoes were ready and peter proceeded without him nor did le bourdon see anything of his friend until the adventurers were fairly on the north shore when he rejoined le bourdon sitting on a log a curious spectator of the latters devices to conceal his property but not offering to aid him in a single movement the beehunter too well understood an indian warriors aversion to labor of all sorts unless it be connected with his military achievements to be surprised at his companions indifference to his own toil as the work went on a friendly dialogue was kept up between the parties  i didnt know pigeonswing but you had started for the openings before us observed le bourdon that tribeless old injin made something of a fuss about your being out of the way i dare say he wanted you to help back the furniture down to the canoes  got squawwhat he wantbetter to do dat  so you would put that pretty piece of work on such persons as margery and dolly  why not no bot squawbot know how dere business to work for warrior  did you keep out of the way then lest old peter should get you at a job that is onsuitable to your manhood  keep out of way of pottawattamie returned the chippewa no want to lose scalpradder take hisn  but peter says the pottawattamies are all gone and that we have no longer any reason to fear them and this medicinepriest tells us that what peter says we can depend on for truth  dat good medicineman eh tink he know a great deal eh  that is more than i can tell you pigeonswing for though ive been a medicineman myself so lately it is in a different line altogether from that of parson amens  as the beehunter uttered this answer he was putting the last of his honeykegs into the cache and as he rose from completing the operation he laughed heartily like one who saw images in the occurrences of the past night that tended to divert himself if they had not the same effect on the other spectators  if you medicineman can tell who peter be winnebagoe sioux fox ojebway six nations all say dont know him medicineman ought to knowwho he be eh  i am not enough of a medicineman to answer your question pigeonswing set me at finding a whiskeyspring or any little job of that sort and ill turn my back to no other whiskeyspring finder on the whole frontier but as for peter he goes beyond my calculations quite why is he called scalping peter in the garrisons if he be so good an injin chippewa  you ask questionyou answer dont know less he take a good many scalps hear he do take all he can findden hear he dont  but you take all you can find pigeonswing and that which is good in you cannot be so bad in peter  dont take scalp from friend when you hear pigeonswing scalp friend eh  i never did hear it and hope i never shall but when did you hear that peter is so wicked  spose he dont cause he got no friend among paleface bes take care of dat man  im of your way of thinking myself chippewa though the corporal and the priest think him all in all when i asked parson amen how he came to be the associate of one who went by a scalping name even he told me it was all name that peter hadnt touched a hair of a human head in the way of scalping since his youth and that most of his notions and ways were quite jewish the parson has almost as much faith in peter as he has in his religion im not quite sure he has not even more  no matter bes always for paleface to trust paleface and injin to trust injin dat most likely to be right  nevertheless i trust you pigeonswing and hitherto you have not deceived me  the chippewa cast a glance of so much meaning on the beehunter that the last was troubled by it for many a day did le bourdon remember that look and painful were the apprehensions to which it gave birth until that morning the intercourse between the two had been of the most confidential character but something like a fierce hatred was blended in that look could it be that the feelings of the chippewa were changed and was it possible that peter was in any way connected with this alteration in looks and sentiments all these suspicions passed through le bourdons mind as he finished his cache and sufficiently disagreeable did he find it to entertain them the circumstances however did not admit of any change of plan and in a few minutes the two were in the canoe and on their way to join their companions  peter had dealt fairly enough with those who accompanied him the pottawattamies were nowhere to be seen and gershom led the corporal to the place where his household goods had been secreted in so much confidence that both the men left their arms behind them such was the state of things when le bourdon reached the north shore the young man was startled when his eyes fell on the rifles but on looking around there did not really appear to be any sufficient reason why they might not be laid aside for a few minutes  the beehunter having disposed of all his honey had now a nearly empty canoe accordingly he received a portion of gershoms effects all of which were safely transported from their place of concealment to the water side their owner was slowly recovering the use of his body and mind though still a little dull from his recent debauch the females supplied his place however in many respects and two hours after the party had landed it was ready again to proceed on its journey into the interior the last article was stowed in one of the canoes and gershom announced his willingness to depart  at this moment peter led the beehunter aside telling his friends that he would speedily rejoin them our hero followed his savage leader along the foot of the declivity in the rear of the hut until the former stopped at the place where the first and principal fire of the past night had been lighted here peter made a sweeping gesture of his hand as if to invite his companion to survey the different objects around as this characteristic gesture was made the indian spoke  my brother is a medicineman he said he knows where whiskey growslet him tell peter where to find the spring  the recollection of the scene of the previous night came so fresh and vividly over the imagination of the beehunter that instead of answering the question of the chief he burst into a hearty fit of laughter then fearful of giving offence he was about to apologize for a mirth so illtimed when the indian smiled with a gleam of intelligence on his swarthy face that seemed to say i understand it all and continued  goodthe chief with three eyesin allusion to the spyglass that le bourdon always carried suspended from his neckis a very great medicineman he knows when to laugh and when to look sad the pottawattamies were dry and he wanted to find them some whiskey to drink but could notour brother in the canoe had drunk it all good  again the beehunter laughed and though peter did not join in his mirth it was quite plain that he understood its cause with this goodnatured sort of intelligence between them the two returned to the canoes the beehunter always supposing that the indian had obtained his object in receiving his indirect admission that the scene of the previous night had been merely a piece of ingenious jugglery so much of a courtier however was peter and so entire his selfcommand that on no occasion afterward did he ever make any further allusion to the subject  the ascent of the river was now commenced it was not a difficult matter for le bourdon to persuade margery that her brothers canoe would be too heavily loaded for such a passage unless she consented to quit it for his own pigeonswing took the girls place and was of material assistance in forcing the light but steady craft up stream the three others continued in the canoe in which they had entered the river with this arrangement therefore our adventurers commenced this new journey  every reader will easily understand that ascending such a stream as the kalamazoo was a very difficult thing from descending it the progress was slow and at many points laborious at several of the rifts it became necessary to track the canoes up and places occurred at which the only safe way of proceeding was to unload them altogether and transport boats cargoes and all on the shoulders of the men across what are called in the language of the country portages or carryingplaces in such toil as this the corporal was found to be very serviceable but neither of the indians declined to lend their assistance in work of this manly character by this time moreover gershom had come round and was an able bodied vigorous assistant once more if the corporal was the master of any alcohol he judiciously kept it a secret for not a drop passed any ones lips during the whole of that toilsome journey  although the difficult places in the river were sufficiently numerous most of the reaches were places having steady but not swift currents toward the lake in these reaches the paddles and those not very vigorously applied enabled the travellers to advance as fast as was desirable and such tranquil waters were a sort of restingplaces to those who managed the canoes it was while ascending these easy channels that conversation most occurred each speaker yielding as was natural to the impulses of the thoughts uppermost in his mind the missionary talked much of the jews and as the canoes came near each other he entered at large with their different occupants into the reasons he had for believing that the red men of america were the lost tribes of israel the very use of the word tribes would this simpleminded and not very profound expounder of the word of god say is one proof of the truth of what i tell you now no one thinks of dividing the white men of america into tribes who ever heard of the tribe of new england or of the tribe of virginia or of the tribe of the middle states footnote the reader is not to infer any exaggeration in this picture there is no end to the ignorance and folly of sects and parties when religious or political zeal runs high the writer well remembers to have heard a universalist of more zeal than learning adduce as an argument in favor of his doctrine the twentyfifth chapter and fortysixth verse of st matthew where we are told that the wicked shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into vis eternal by drawing a distinction between the adjectives and this so much the more because the old testament speaks of everlasting hills and everlasting valleys  thus proving from the bible a substantial difference between everlasting and eternal now every sophomore knows that the word used in matthew is the same in both cases being aionion or existing forever even among the blacks there are no tribes there is a very remarkable passage in the sixtyeighth psalm that has greatly struck me since my mind has turned to this subject god shall wound the head his enemies saith the psalmist and the hairy scalp of such a one as goeth on still in his wickedness here is a very obvious allusion to a wellknown and what we think a barbarous practice of the red men but rely on it friends nothing that is permitted on earth is permitted in vain the attentive reader of the inspired book by gleaning here and there can collect much authority for this new opinion about the lost tribes and the day will come i do not doubt when men will marvel that the truth hath been so long hidden from them i can scarcely open a chapter in the old testament that some passage does not strike me as going to prove this identity between the red men and the hebrews and were they all collected together and published in a book mankind would be astonished at their lucidity and weight as for scalping it is a horrid thing in our eyes but it is honorable with the red men and i have quoted to you the words of the psalmist in order to show the manner in which divine wisdom inflicts penalties on sin here is plain justification of the practice provided always that the sufferer be in the bondage of transgression and obnoxious to divine censure let no man therefore in the pride of his learning and perhaps of his prosperity disdain to believe things that are so manifestly taught and foretold but let us all bow in humble submission to the will of a being who to our finite understanding is so perfectly incomprehensible  we trust that no one of our readers will be disposed to deride parson amens speculations on this interesting subject although this may happen to be the first occasion on which he has ever heard the practice of taking scalps justified by scripture viewed in a proper spirit they ought merely to convey a lesson of humility by rendering apparent the wisdom nay the necessity of mens keeping themselves within the limits of the sphere of knowledge they were designed to fill and convey when rightly considered as much of a lesson to the puseyite with abstractions that are quite as unintelligible to himself as they are to others to the highwrought and dogmatical calvinist who in the midst of his fiery zeal forgets that love is the very essence of the relation between god and man to the quaker who seems to think the cut of a coat essential to salvation to the descendant of the puritan who whether he be socinian calvinist universalist or any other 1st appears to believe that the rock on which christ declared he would found his church was the rock of plymouth and to the unbeliever who in deriding all creeds does not know where to turn to find one to substitute in their stead humility in matters of this sort is the great lesson that all should teach and learn for it opens the way to charity and eventually to faith and through both of these to hope finally through all of these to heaven  the journey up the kalamazoo lasted many days the ascent being often so painful and no one seeming in a hurry peter waited for the time set for his council to approach and was as well content to remain in his canoe as to camp out in the openings gershom never was in haste while the beehunter would have been satisfied to pass the summer in so pleasant a manner margery being seated most of the time in his canoe in his ordinary excursions le bourdon carried the mastiff as a companion but now that his place was so much better filled hive was suffered to roam the woods that lined most of the riverbanks joining his master from time to time at the portages or landings as for the missionary and the corporal impatience formed no part of their present disposition the first had been led by the artful peter to expect great results to his theory from the assembly of chiefs which was to meet in the openings and the credulous parson was in one sense going as blindly on the path of destruction as any sinner it had ever been his duty to warn of his fate was proceeding in the same direction in another the corporal too was the dupe of peters artifices this man had heard so many stories to the indians prejudice at the different posts where he had been stationed as at first to render him exceedingly averse to making the present journey in his company the necessity of the case as connected with the preservation of his own life after the massacre of fort dearborn and the influence of the missionary had induced him to overlook his ancient prejudices and to forget opinions that it now occurred to him had been founded in error once fairly within the influence of peters wiles a simpleminded soldier like the corporal was soon completely made the indians dupe by the time the canoe reached the mouth of the kalamazoo as has been related each of these men placed the most implicit reliance on the good faith and friendly feelings of the very being whose entire life both sleeping and waking thoughts were devoted not only to his destruction but to that of the whole white race on the american continent so bland was the manner of this terrible savage when it comported with his views to conceal his ruthless designs that persons more practised and observant than either of his two companions might have been its dupes not to say its victims while the missionary was completely mystified by his own headlong desire to establish a theory and to announce to the religious world where the lost tribes were to be found the corporal had aided in deceiving himself also by another process with him peter had privately conversed of war and had insinuated that he was secretly laboring in behalf of his great father at washington and against the other great father down at montreal as between the two peter professed to lean to the interests of the first though had he laid bare his inmost soul a fiery hatred of each would have been found to be its predominant feeling but corporal flint fondly fancied he was making a concealed march with an ally while he thus accompanied one of the fiercest enemies of his race  peter is not to be judged too harshly it is always respectable to defend the fireside and the land of ones nativity although the cause connected with it may be sometimes wrong this indian knew nothing of the principles of colonization and had no conception that any other than its original ownersoriginal so far as his traditions reachedcould have a right to his own huntinggrounds of the slow but certain steps by which an overruling providence is extending a knowledge of the true god and of the great atonement through the death of his blessed son peter had no conception nor would it probably have seemed right to his contracted mind had he even seen and understood this general tendency of things to him the paleface appeared only as a rapacious invader and not a creature obeying the great law of his destiny the end of which is doubtless to help knowledge to abound until it shall cover the whole earth as the waters cover the sea hatred inextinguishable and active hatred appeared to be the law of this mans being and he devoted all the means aided by all the intelligence he possessed to the furtherance of his narrow and shortsighted means of vengeance and redress in all this he acted in common with tecumseh and his brother though his consummate art kept him behind a veil while the others were known and recognized as open and active foes no publication speaks of this peter nor does any orator enumerate his qualities while the other two chiefs have been the subjects of every species of descriptive talent from that of the poet to that of the painter  as day passed after day the feeling of distrust in the bosom of the beehunter grew weaker and weaker and peter succeeded in gradually worming himself into his confidence also this was done moreover without any apparent effort the indian made no professions of friendship laid himself out for no particular attention nor ever seemed to care how his companions regarded his deportment his secret purposes he kept carefully smothered in his own breast it is true but beyond that no other sign of duplicity could have been discovered even by one who knew his objects and schemes so profound was his art that it had the aspect of nature pigeonswing alone was alive to the danger of this mans company and he knew it only by means of certain semiconfidential communications received in his character of a red man it was no part of peters true policy to become an ally to either of the great belligerents of the day on the contrary his ardent wish was to see them destroy each other and it was the sudden occurrence of the present war that had given a new impulse to his hopes and a new stimulus to his efforts as a time most propitious to his purposes he was perfectly aware of the state of the chippewas feelings and he knew that this man was hostile to the pottawattamies as well as to most of the tribes of michigan but this made no difference with him if pigeonswing took the scalp of a white man he cared not whether it grew on an english or an american head in either case it was the destruction of his enemy with such a policy constantly in view it cannot be matter of surprise that peter continued on just as good terms with pigeonswing as with crowsfeather but one precaution was observed in his intercourse with the first to crowsfeather then on the warpath in quest of yankee scalps he had freely communicated his designs on his own white companions while he did not dare to confide to the chippewa this particular secret since that indians relations with the beehunter were so amicable as to be visible to every observer peter felt the necessity of especial caution in his communication with this savage therefore and this was the reason why the chippewa was in so much painful uncertainty as to the others intentions he had learned enough to be distrustful but not enough to act with decision  once and once only during their slow passage up the kalamazoo did the beehunter observe something about peter to awaken his original apprehensions the fourth day after leaving the mouth of the river and when the whole party were resting after the toil of passing a carryingplace our hero had observed the eyes of that tribeless savage roaming from one white face to another with an expression in them so very fiendish as actually to cause his heart to beat quicker than common the look was such a one as le bourdon could not remember to have ever before beheld in a human countenance in point of fact he had seen peter in one of those moments when the pent fires of the volcano that ceaselessly raged within his bosom were becoming difficult to suppress and when memory was busiest in recalling to his imagination scenes of oppression and wrong that the white man is only too apt to forget amid the ease of his civilization and the security of his power but the look and the impression produced by it on le bourdon soon passed away and were forgotten by him to whom it might otherwise have proved to be a most useful warning  it was a little remarkable that margery actually grew to be attached to peter often manifesting toward the chief attentions and feelings such as a daughter is apt to exhibit toward a father this arose from the high and courteous bearing of this extraordinary savage at all times an indian warrior is apt to maintain the dignified and courteous bearing that has so often been remarked in the race but it is very seldom that he goes out of his way to manifest attention to the squaws doubtless these men have the feelings of humanity and love their wives and offspring like others but it is so essential a part of their training to suppress the exhibition of such emotions that it is seldom the mere lookeron has occasion to note them peter however had neither wife nor child or if they existed no one knew where either was to be found the same mystery shrouded this part of his history as veiled all the rest in his hunts various opportunities occurred for exhibiting to the females manly attentions by offering to them the choicest pieces of his game and pointing out the most approved indian modes of cooking the meats so as to preserve their savory properties this he did sparingly at first and as a part of a system of profound deception but day by day and hour after hour most especially with margery did his manner become sensibly less distant and more natural the artlessness the gentle qualities blended with feminine spirit as they were and the innocent gayety of the girl appeared to win on this nearly remorseless savage in spite of his efforts to resist her influence perhaps the beauty of margery contributed its share in exciting these novel emotions in the breast of one so stern we do not mean that peter yielded to feelings akinto love of this he was in a manner incapable but a man can submit to a gentle regard for woman that shall be totally free from passion this sort of regard peter certainly began to entertain for margery and like begetting like as money produces money it is not surprising that the confidence of the girl herself as well as her sympathies should continue to increase in the favor of this terrible indian  but the changes of feeling and the various little incidents to which we have alluded did not occur in a single moment of time day passed after day and still the canoes were working their way up the winding channels of the kalamazoo placing at each setting sun longer and longer reaches of its sinuous stream between the travellers and the broad sheet of michigan as le bourdon had been up and down the river often in his various excursions he acted as the pilot of the navigation though all worked even to the missionary and the chippewa on such an expedition toil was not deemed to be discreditable to a warrior and pigeonswing used the paddle and the pole as willingly and with as much dexterity as any of the party  it was only on the eleventh day after quitting the mouth of the river that the canoes came to in the little bay where le bourdon was in the habit of securing his light bark when in the openings castle meal was in full view standing peacefully in its sweet solitude and hive who as he came within the range of his old hunts had started off and got to the spot the previous evening now stood on the bank of the river to welcome his master and his friends to the chiente it wanted a few minutes of sunset as the travellers landed and the parting rays of the great luminary of our system were glancing through the various glades of the openings imparting a mellow softness to the herbage and flowers so far as the beehunter could perceive not even a bear had visited the place in his absence on ascending to his abode and examining the fastenings and on entering the hut storehouse etc le bourdon became satisfied that all the property he had left behind was safe and that the foot of manhe almost thought of beast toohad not visited the spot at all during the last fortnight     chapter xiv        hope in your mountains and hope in your streams         bow down in their worship and loudly pray       trust in your strength and believe in your dreams         but the wind shall carry them all away                                         brainard   the week which succeeded the arrival of our party at chateau au miel or castle meal as le bourdon used to call his abode was one of very active labor it was necessary to house the adventurers and the little habitation already built was quite insufficient for such a purpose it was given to the females who used it as a private apartment for themselves while the cooking eating and even sleeping so far as the males were concerned were all done beneath the trees of the openings but a new chiente was soon constructed which though wanting in the completeness and strength of castle meal was sufficient for the wants of these sojourners in the wilderness it is surprising with how little of those comforts which civilization induces us to regard as necessaries we can get along when cast into the midst of the western wilds the female whose foot has trodden from infancy upward on nothing harder than a good carpetwho has been reared amid all the appliances of abundance and art seems at once to change her nature along with her habits and often proves a heroine and an active assistant when there was so much reason to apprehend she might turn out to be merely an encumbrance in the course of a life that is now getting to be well stored with experience of this sort as well as of many other varieties we can recall a hundred cases of women who were born and nurtured in affluence and abundance who have cheerfully quitted the scenes of youth their silks and satins their china and plate their mahogany and brussels to follow husbands and fathers into the wilderness there to compete with the savage often for food and always for the final possession of the soil  but in the case of dorothy and blossom the change had never been of this very broad character and habit had long been preparing them for scenes even more savage than that into which they were now cast both were accustomed to work as blessed be god the american woman usually works that is to say within doors and to render home neat comfortable and welcome as housewives they were expert and willing considering the meagreness of their means and le bourdon told the halfdelighted halfblushing margery ere the latter had been twentyfour hours in his chiente that nothing but the presence of such a one as herself was wanting to render it an abode fit for a prince then the cooking was so much improved apart from cleanliness the venison was found to be more savory the cakes were lighter and the pork less greasy on this subject of grease however we could wish that a sense of right would enable us to announce its utter extinction in the american kitchen or if not absolutely its extinction such a subjection of the unctuous properties as to bring them within the limits of a reasonably accurate and healthful taste to be frank dorothy carried a somewhat heavy hand in this respect but pretty margery was much her superior how this difference in domestic discipline occurred is more than we can say but of its existence there can be no doubt there are two very respectable sections of the civilized world to which we should imagine no rational being would ever think of resorting in order to acquire the art of cookery and these are germany and the land of the pilgrims one hears and reads in those elegant specimens of the polite literature of the day the letters from washington and from various travellers who go up and down this river in steamboats or along that railway gratis much in honor of the good things left behind the several writers in the region of the kock but woe betide the wight who is silly enough to believe in all this poetical imagery and who travels in that direction in the expectation of finding a good table it is extraordinary that such a marked difference does exist on an interest of this magnitude among such near neighbors but of the fact we should think no intelligent and experienced man can doubt believing as we do that no small portion of the elements of national character can be and are formed in the kitchen the circumstance may appear to us of more moment than to some of our readers the vacuum left in cookery between boston and baltimore for instance is something like that which exists between le verriers new planet and the sun  but margery could even fry pork without causing it to swim in grease and at a venison steak a professed cook was not her superior she also understood various little mysteries in the way of converting their berries and fruits of the wilderness into pleasant dishes and corporal flint soon affirmed that it was a thousand pities she did not live in a garrison which agreeably to his view of things was something like placing her at the comptoir of the cafe de paris or of marrying her to some second vatel  with the eating and drinking the building advanced pari passu pigeonswing brought in his venison his ducks his pigeons and his game of different varieties daily keeping the larder quite as well supplied as comported with the warmth of the weather while the others worked on the new chiente in order to obtain materials for this building one so much larger than his old abode ben went up the kalamazoo about half a mile where he felled a sufficient number of young pines with trunks of about a foot in diameter cutting them into lengths of twenty and thirty feet respectively these lengths or trunks were rolled into the river down which they slowly floated until they arrived abreast of castle meal where they were met by peter in a canoe who towed each stick as it arrived to the place of landing in this way at the end of two days work a sufficient quantity of materials was collected to commence directly on the building itself  loghouses are of so common occurrence as to require no particular description of the one now put up from us it was rather less than thirty feet in length and onethird narrower than it was long the logs were notched and the interstices were filled by pieces of the pine split to a convenient size the roof was of bark and of the simplest construction while there was neither door nor window though one aperture was left for the first and two for the last corporal flint however was resolved that not only a door should be made as well as shutters for the windows but that the house should in time be picketed when le bourdon remonstrated with him on the folly of taking so much unnecessary pains it led to a discussion in which the missionary even felt constrained to join  whats the usewhats the use exclaimed le bourdon a little impatiently when he found the corporal getting to be in earnest in his proposal here have i lived safely two seasons in castle meal without any pickets or palisades and yet you want to turn this new house into a regular garrison  aye bourdon that was in peaceable times but these is war times ive seen the fall of fort dearborn and i dont want to see the fall of another post this war the pottawattamies is hostile even peter owns and the pottawattamies has been here once as you say yourself and may come agin  the only pottawattamie who has ever been at this spot to my knowledge is dead and his bones are bleaching up yonder in the openings no fear of him then  his body is gone answered the corporal and what is more the rifle is gone with it i heard that his rifle had been forgotten and went to collect the arms left on the field of battle but found nothing no doubt his friends have burned or buried the chief and they will be apt to take another look in this quarter of the country having larnt the road  boden was struck with this intelligence as well as with the reasoning and after a moments pause he answered in a way that showed a wavering purpose  it will take a weeks work to picket or palisade the house he answered and i wish to be busy among the bees once more  go to your bees bourdon and leave me to fortify and garrison as becomes my trade parson amen here will tell you that the children of israel are often bloodyminded and are not to be forgotten  the corporal is right put in the missionary the corporal is quite right the whole history of the ancient jews gives us this character of them and even saul of tarsus was bent on persecution and slaughter until his hand was stayed by the direct manifestation of the power of god i can see glimmerings of this spirit in peter and this at a moment when he is almost ready to admit that hes a descendant of israel  is peter ready to allow that asked the beehunter with more interest in the answer than he would have been willing to allow  as good as thatyes quite as good as that i can see plainly that peter has some heavy mystery on his mind sooner or later we shall learn it when it does come out the world may be prepared to learn the whole history of the ten tribes  in my judgment observed the corporal that chief could give the history of twenty if he was so minded  there were but ten of them brother flintbut ten and of those ten he could give us a full and highly interesting account one of these days we shall hear it all in the mean time it may be well enough to turn one of these houses into some sort of a garrison  let it then be castle meal said le bourdon surely if any one is to be defended and fortified in this way it ought to be the women you may easily palisade that hut which is so much stronger than this and so much smaller  with this compromise the work went on the corporal dug a trench four feet deep encircling the castle as happy as a lord the whole time for this was not the first time he had been at such work which he considered to be altogether in character and suitable to his profession no youthful engineer fresh from the point that seat of military learning to which the republic is even more indebted for its signal successes in mexico than to the high military character of this populationno young aspirant for glory fresh from this useful school could have greater delight in laying out his first bastion or counterscarp or glacis than corporal flint enjoyed in fortifying castle meal it will be remembered that this was the first occasion he was ever actually at the head of the engineering department hitherto it had been his fortune to follow but now it had become his duty to lead as no one else of that party had ever been employed in such a work on any previous occasion the corporal did not affect to conceal the superior knowledge with which he was overflowing gershom he found a ready and active assistant for by this time the whiskey was well out of him and he toiled with the greater willingness as he felt that the palisades would add to the security of his wife and sister neither did parson amen disdain to use the pick and shovel for while the missionary had the fullest reliance in the fact that the red men of that region were the descendants of the children of israel he regarded them as a portion of the chosen people who were living under the ban of the divine displeasure and as more than usually influenced by those evil spirits whom st paul mentions as the powers of the air in a word while the good missionary had all faith in the final conversion and restoration of these children of the forests he did not overlook the facts of their present barbarity and great propensity to scalp he was not quite as efficient as gershom at this novel employment but a certain inborn zeal rendered him both active and useful as for the indians neither of them deigned to touch a tool pigeonswing had little opportunity for so doing indeed being usually from the rising to the setting sun out hunting for the support of the party while peter passed most of his time in ruminations and solitary walks this last paid little attention to the work about the castle either knowing it would at any moment by an act of treachery be in his power to render all these precautions of no avail or relying on the amount of savage force that he knew was about to collect in the openings whenever he cast a glance on the progress of the work it was with an eye of great indifference once he even carried his duplicity so far as to make a suggestion to the corporal by means of which as he himself expressed it in his imperfect english injin no get inside to use knife and tomahawk this seeming indifference on the part of peter did not escape the observation of the beehunter who became still less distrustful of that mysterious savage as he noted his conduct in connection with the dispositions making for defence  le bourdon would not allow a tree of any sort to be felled anywhere near his abode while the corporal and his associates were busy in digging the trench he had gone to a considerable distance quite out of sight from castle meal and near his great highway the river where he cut and trimmed the necessary number of burroaks for the palisades boden labored the more cheerfully at this work for two especial reasons one was the fact that the defences might be useful to himself hereafter as much against bears as against indians and the other because margery daily brought her sewing or knitting and sat on the fallen trees laughing and chatting as the axe performed its duties on three several occasions peter was present also accompanying blossom with a kindness of manner and an attention to her pretty little tastes in culling flowers that would have done credit to a man of a higher school of civilization  the reader is not to suppose however because the indian pays but little outward attention to the squaws that he is without natural feeling or manliness of character in some respects his chivalrous devotion to the sex is perhaps in no degree inferior to that of the class which makes a parade of such sentiments and this quite as much from convention and ostentation as from any other motive the red man is still a savage beyond all question but he is a savage with so many nobler and more manly qualities when uncorrupted by communion with the worst class of whites and not degraded by extreme poverty as justly to render him a subject of our admiration in selfrespect in dignity and in simplicity of deportment the indian chief is usually a gentleman and this though he may have never heard of revelation and has not the smallest notion of the atonement and of the deep obligations it has laid on the human race  amid the numberless exaggerations of the day one of particular capacity has arisen connected with the supposed character of a gentleman those who regard all things through the medium of religious feeling are apt to insist that he who is a christian is necessarily a gentleman while he can be no thorough gentleman who has not most of the qualities of the christian character this confusion in thought and language can lead to no really useful result while it embarrasses the minds of many and renders the expression of our ideas less exact and comprehensive than they would otherwise be  we conceive that a man may be very much of a christian and very little of a gentleman or very much of a gentleman and very little of a christian there is in short not much in common between the two characters though it is possible for them to become united in the same individual that the finished courtesies of polished life may wear some of the aspects of that benevolence which causes the christian to love his neighbor as himself is certainly true though the motives of the parties are so very different as to destroy all real identity between them while the moving principle of a gentleman is selfrespect that of a christian is humility the first is ready to lay down his life in order to wipe away an imaginary dishonor or to take the life of another the last is taught to turn the other cheek when smitten in a word the first keeps the world its opinions and its estimation ever uppermost in his thoughts the last lives only to reverence god and to conform to his will in obedience to his revealed mandates certainly there is that which is both grateful and useful in the refined deportment of one whose mind and manners have been polished even in the schools of the world but it is degrading to the profoundly beautiful submission of the truly christian temper to imagine that anything like a moral parallel can justly be run between them  of course peter had none of the qualities of him who sees and feels his own defects and relies only on the merits of the atonement for his place among the children of light while he had so many of those qualities which depend on the estimate which man is so apt to place on his own merits in this last sense this indian had a great many of the essentials of a gentleman a lofty courtesy presiding over all his intercourse with others when passion or policy did not thrust in new and sudden principles of action even the missionary was so much struck with the gentleness of this mysterious savages deportment in connection with margery as at first to impute it to a growing desire to make a wife of that flower of the wilderness but closer observation induced greater justice to the indian in this respect nothing like the uneasiness impatience or distrust of passion could be discerned in his demeanor and when parson amen perceived that the beehunters marked devotion to the beautiful blossom rather excited a benevolent and kind interest in the feelings of peter so far at least as one could judge of the heart by external appearances than anything that bore the fierce and uneasy impulses of jealousy he was satisfied that his original impression was a mistake  as le bourdon flourished his axe and margery plied her needles making a wholesome provision for the coming winter the mysterious indian would stand a quarter of an hour at a time immovable as a statue his eyes riveted first on one and then on the other what passed at such moments in that stern breast it exceeds the penetration of man to say but that the emotions thus pent within barriers that none could pass or destroy were not always ferocious and revengeful a carefully observant spectator might possibly have suspected had such a person been there to note all the signs of what was uppermost in the chiefs thoughts still gleamings of sudden but intense ferocity did occasionally occur and at such instants the countenance of this extraordinary being was truly terrific fortunately such bursts of uncontrollable feeling were transient being of rare occurrence and of very short duration  by the time the corporal had his trenches dug le bourdon was prepared with his palisades which were just one hundred in number being intended to enclose a space of forty feet square the men all united in the transportation of the timber which was floated down the river on a raft of white pine the burroak being of a specific gravity that fresh water would not sustain a couple of days however sufficed for the transportation by water and as many more for that by land between the place of landing and castle meal this much accomplished the whole party rested from their labors the day which succeeded being the sabbath  those who dwell habitually amid the haunts of men alone thoroughly realize the vast importance that ought to be attached to the great day of rest men on the ocean and men in the forest are only too apt to overlook the returns of the sabbath thus slowly but inevitably alienating themselves more and more from the dread being who established the festival as much in his own honor as for the good of man when we are told that the almighty is jealous of his rights and desires to be worshipped we are not to estimate this wish by any known human standard but are ever to bear in mind that it is exactly in proportion as we do reverence the creator and ruler of heaven and earth that we are nearest or farthest from the condition of the blessed it is probably for his own good that the adoration of man is pleasing in the eyes of god  the missionary though a visionary and an enthusiast as respected the children of israel was a zealous observer of his duties on sundays he never neglected to set up his tabernacle even though it were in a howling wilderness and went regularly through the worship of god according to the form of the sect to which he belonged his influence on the present occasion was sufficient to cause a suspension of all labor though not without some remonstrances on the part of the corporal the latter contended that in military affairs there was no sunday known unless it might be in peaceable times and that he had never heard of intrenchments resting from their labors on the part of either the besieger or the besieged work of that sort he thought ought to go on day and night by means of reliefs and instead of pausing to hold church he had actually contemplated detailing fatigue parties to labor through not only that day but the whole of the succeeding night  as for peter he never offered the slightest objection to any of parson amens sermons or prayers he listened to both with unmoved gravity though no apparent impression was ever made on his feelings the chippewa hunted on the sabbaths as much as on any other day and it was in reference to this fact that the following little conversation took place between margery and the missionary as the party sat beneath the oaks passing a tranquil eventide at midsummer  how happens it mr amen said margery who had insensibly adopted the missionarys sobriquet that no red man keeps the sabbathday if they are all descended from the jews this is one of the most respected of all the commandments and it does not seem natural margerys use of terms was necessarily influenced by association and educationthat any of that people should wholly forget the day of rest  perhaps you are not aware margery that the jews even in civilized countries do not keep the same sabbath as the christians returned the missionary they have public worship on a saturday as we do on a sunday now i did think i saw some signs of peters privately worshipping yesterday while we were all so busy at our garrison you may have observed how thoughtful and silent the chief was in the middle of the afternoon  i did observe it said the beehunter but must own i did not suspect him of holding meeting for any purposes within himself that was one of the times when i like the manners and behavior of this injin the least  we do not knowwe do not knowperhaps his spirit struggled with the temptations of the evil one to me he appeared to be worshipping and i set the fact down as a proof that the red men keep the jewish sabbath  i did not know that the jews keep a sabbath different from our own else i might have thought the same but i never saw a jew to my knowledge did you margery  not to know him for one answered the girl and true enough was the remark of each fiveandthirty years ago america was singularly not only a christian but a protestant nation jews certainly did exist in the towns but they were so blended with the rest of the population and were so few in number as scarcely to attract attention to them as a sect as for the romanists they too had their churches and their dioceses but what untravelled american had then ever seen a nun from monks heaven be praised we are yet spared and this is said without any prejudice against the denomination to which they usually belong he who has lived much in a country where that sect prevails if a man of a particle of liberality soon learns that piety and reverence for god and a deep sense of all the christian obligations can just as well nay better exist in a state of society where a profound submission to wellestablished dogmas is to be found than in a state of society where there is so much political freedom as to induce the veriest pretenders to learning to imagine that each man is a church and a hierarchy in his own person all this is rapidly changing romanists abound and spots that half a century since appeared to be the most improbable place in the world to admit of the rites of the priests of rome now hear the chants and prayers of the massbooks all this shows a tendency toward that great commingling of believers which is doubtless to precede the final fusion of sects and the predicted end  on the monday that succeeded the sabbath mentioned the corporal had all his men at work early pinning together his palisades making them up into manageable bents and then setting them up on their legs as the materials were all there and quite ready to be put together the work advanced rapidly and by the time the sun drew near the western horizon once more castle meal was surrounded by its bristling defences the whole was erect and staylathed waiting only for the earth to be shovelled back into the trench and to be pounded well down as it was the palisades offered a great increase of security to those in the chiente and both the females expressed their obligations to their friends for having taken this important step toward protecting them from the enemy when they retired for the night everything was arranged so that the different members of the party might know where to assemble within the works among the effects of gershom were a conch and a horn the latter being one of those common instruments of tin which are so much used in and about american farmhouses to call the laborers from the field the conch was given to the men that in case of need they might sound the alarm from without while the horn or trumpet of tin was suspended by the door of the chiente in order that the females might have recourse to it at need  about midnight long after the whole party had retired to rest and when the stillness of the hours of deepest repose reigned over the openings the beehunter was awoke from his sleep by an unwonted call at first he could scarce believe his senses so plaintive and yet so wild was the blast but there could be no mistake it was the horn from the chiente and in a moment he was on his feet by this time the corporal was afoot and presently all the men were in motion on this occasion gershom manifested a readiness and spirit that spoke equally well for his heart and his courage he was foremost in rushing to the assistance of his wife and sister though le bourdon was very close on his heels  on reaching the gate of the palisade it was found closed and barred within nor did any one appear until dorothy was summoned by repeated calls in the wellknown voice of her husband when the two females came out of the chiente great was their wonder and alarm no horn had been blown by either of them and there the instrument itself hung on its peg as quiet and mute as if a blast had never been blown into it the beehunter on learning this extraordinary fact looked around him anxiously in order to ascertain who might be absent every man was present and each person stood by his arms no one betraying the slightest consciousness of knowing whence the unaccountable summons had proceeded  this has been done by you corporal in order to bring us together under arms by way of practice le bourdon at length exclaimed  false alarms is useful if not overdone especially among raw troops answered flint coolly but i have given none tonight i will own i did intend to have you all out in a day or two by way of practice but i have thought it useless to attempt too much at once when the garrison is finished it will be time enough to drill the men to the alarmposts  what is your opinion peter continued le bourdon you understand the wilderness and its ways to what is this extrornary call owing why have we been brought here at this hour  somebody blow horn most likely answered peter in his unmoved philosophical manner spose dont know den cant tell warrior often hear larm on warpath  this is an onaccountable thing if i ever heard a horn i heard one tonight yet this is the only horn we have and no one has touched it it was not the conch i heard there is no mistaking the difference in sound between a shell and a horn and there is the conch hanging at gershoms neck just where it has been the whole night  no one has touched the conchi will answer for that returned gershom laying a hand on the shell as if to make certain all was right  this is most extrornary i heard the horn if ears of mine ever heard such an instrument  each of the white men added as much for every one of them had distinctly heard the blast still neither could suggest any probable clue to the mystery the indians said nothing but it was so much in conformity with their habits for red men to maintain silence whenever any unusual events awakened feelings in others that no one thought their deportment out of rule as for peter a statue of stone could scarcely have been colder in aspect than was this chief who seemed to be altogether raised above every exhibition of human feeling even the corporal gaped though much excited for he had been suddenly aroused from a deep sleep but peter was as much superior to physical as to moral impressions on this occasion he made no suggestion manifested no concern exhibited no curiosity and when the men withdrew again to their proper habitation he walked back with them in the same silence and calm as those with which he had advanced gershom however entered within the palisade and passed the remainder of the night with his family  the beehunter and the chippewa accidentally came together as the men moved slowly toward their own hut when the following short dialogue occurred between them  is that you pigeonswing exclaimed le bourdon when he found his friend touching an elbow as if by chance  yes dis mewant better friend eh  no im well satisfied to have you near me in an alarm chippewa weve stood by each other once in troublesome times and i think we can do as much agin  yes stand by frienddat honor nebber turn back on friend dat my way  chippewa who blew the blast on the horncan you tell me that  why dont you ask peter he wise chiefknow ebberyting young injin ask ole injin when dont knowwhy not young paleface ask ole man too eh  pigeonswing if truth was said i believe it would be found that you suspect peter of having a hand in this business  this speech was rather too idiomatic for the comprehension of the indian who answered according to his own particular view of the matter  dont blow horn wid hand he saidinjin blow wid mout just like paleface  the beehunter did not reply but his companions remark had a tendency to revive in his breast certain unpleasant and distrustful feelings toward the mysterious savage which the incidents and communications of the last two weeks had had a strong tendency to put to sleep     chapter xv        none knows his lineage age or name       his looks are like the snows of caucasus his eyes       beam with the wisdom of collected ages       in green unbroken years he sees tis said       the generations pass like autumn fruits       garnerd consumed and springing fresh to life       again to perish                                       hillhouse   no further disturbance took place that night and the men set about filling up the trenches in the morning steadily as if nothing had happened they talked a little of the extraordinary occurrence but more was thought than said le bourdon observed however that pigeonswing went earlier than usual to the hunt and that he made his preparations as if he expected to be absent more than the customary time  as there were just one hundred feet of ditch to fill with dirt the task was completed and that quite thoroughly long ere the close of the day the pounding down of the earth consumed more time and was much more laborious than the mere tumbling of the earth back into its former bed but even this portion of the work was sufficiently attended to when all was done the corporal himself a very critical sort of person in what he called garrisons was fain to allow that it was as pretty a piece of palisading as he had ever laid eyes on the garrison wanted only one thing now to render it a formidable postand that was waterno spring or well existing within its narrow limit however he procured two or three empty barrels portions of le bourdons effects placed them within the works and had them filled with sweet water by emptying this water two or three times a week and refilling the barrels it was thought that a sufficient provision of that great necessary would be made and kept up luckily the corporals garrison did not drink and the want was so much the more easily supplied for the moment  in truth the chiente was now converted into a place of some strength when it is considered that artillery had never yet penetrated to those wilds more than half the savages of the west fought with arrows and spears in that day as most still do when the great prairies are reached a rifleman so posted as to have his body in a great measure covered by the trunk of a burroak tree would be reasonably secure against the missives of an indian and using his own fatal instrument of death under a sense of personal security he would become a formidable opponent to dislodge nor was the smallness of the work any objection to its security a single well armed man might suffice to defend twentyfive feet of palisades when he would have been insufficient to make good his position with twice the extent then le bourdon had cut loops on three sides of the hut itself in order to fire at the bears and sometimes at the deer which had often approached the building in its days of solitude and quiet using the window on the fourth side for the same purpose in a word a sense of increased security was felt by the whole party when this work was completed though one arrangement was still wanting to render it perfect by separating the real garrison from the nominal garrison during the night there always existed the danger of surprise and the corporal now that his fortifications were finished soon devised a plan to obviate this lastnamed difficulty his expedient was very simple and had somewhat of barracklife about it  corporal flint raised a low platform along one side of the chiente by placing there logs of pine that were squared on one of their sides above at the height of a mans head a roof of bark was reared on poles and prairie grass aided by skins formed very comfortable barrackbeds beneath as the men were expected to lie with their heads to the wall of the hut and their feet outward there was ample space for twice their number thither then were all the homely provisions for the night transported and when margery closed the door of the chiente after returning the bee hunters cordial good night it was with no further apprehension for the winding of the mysterious horn  the first night that succeeded the new arrangement passed without any disturbance pigeonswing did not return as usual at sunset and a little uneasiness was felt on his account but as he made his appearance quite early in the morning this source of concern ceased nor did the chippewa come in emptyhanded he had killed not only a buck but he had knocked over a bear in his rambles besides taking a mess of famously fine trout from a brawling stream at no great distance the fish were eaten for breakfast and immediately after that meal was ended a party  i know no more than he has himself told me by his account there is to be a great council of red men on the prairie a few miles from this spot he is waiting for the appointed day to come in order to go and make one of the chiefs that will be there is not this true chippewa  yes dat truewhat dat council smoke round fire for eh you know  no i do not and would be right glad to have you tell me pigeonswing perhaps the tribe mean to have a meetin to determine in their own minds which side they ought to take in this war  not dat nudder know well nough which side take got message and wampum from canada fadder and most all injin up thisa way look for yankee scalp not dat nudder  then i have no notion what is at the bottom of this council peter seems to expect great things from it that i can see by his way of talking and looking whenever he speaks of it  peter want to see him very much smoke at great many sich council fire  do you intend to be present at this council on prairie round asked the beehunter innocently enough pigeonswing turned to look at his companion in a way that seemed to inquire how far he was really the dupe of the mysterious indians wiles then suddenly aware of the importance of not betraying all he himself knew until the proper moment had arrived he bent his eyes forward again continuing onward and answering somewhat evasively  dont know he replied hunter nebber tell chief want venison and he must hunt just like squaw in paleface wigwamwork work sweep sweepcook cooknever know when work done so hunter hunt hunthunt  and for that matter chippewa just like squaw in the red mans village too hoe hoedig digcarry carryso that she never knows when she may sit down to rest  yes returned pigeonswing coolly nodding his assent as he moved steadily forward dat do right way wid squawjuss what he good forjuss what he made forwork for warrior and cook his dinner paleface make too much of squaw  not accordin to your account of their manner of getting along injin if the work of our squaws is never done we can hardly make too much of them where does peter keep his squaw  dont know answered the chippewa nobody know dont know where his tribe even  this is very extraornary considering the influence the man seems to enjoy how is it that he has so completely got the ears of all the red men far and near  to this question pigeonswing gave no answer his own mind was so far under peters control that he did not choose to tell more than might be prudent he was fully aware of the mysterious chiefs principal design that of destroying the white race altogether and of restoring the red men to their ancient rights but several reasons prevented his entering into the plot heart and hand in the first place he was friendly to the yankees from whom he personally had received many favors and no wrongs then the tribe or half tribe to which he belonged had been employed more or less by the agents of the american government as runners and in other capacities ever since the peace of 83 and lastly he himself had been left much in different garrisons where he had not only acquired his english but a habit of thinking of the americans as his friends it might also be added that pigeonswing though far less gifted by nature than the mysterious peter had formed a truer estimate of the power of the yankees and did not believe they were to be annihilated so easily how it happened that this indian had come to a conclusion so much safer than that of peters a man of twice his capacity is more than we can explain though it was probably owing to the accidental circumstances of his more intimate associations with the whites  the beehunter was by nature a man of observation a faculty that his habits had both increased and stimulated had it not been for the manner in which he was submitting to the influence of margery he would long before have seen that in the deportment of the chippewa which would have awakened his distrust not that margery in any way endeavored to blind him to what was passing before his face but that he was fast getting to have eyes only for her by this time she filled not only his waking but many of his sleeping thoughts and when she was not actually before him charming him with her beauty enlivening him with her artless gayety and inspiring him with her innocent humor he fancied she was there imagination perhaps heightening all those advantages which we have enumerated when a man is thoroughly in love he is quite apt to be fit for very little else but to urge his suit such in a certain way proved to be the case with le bourdon who allowed things to pass unheeded directly before his eyes that previously to his acquaintance with margery would not only have been observed but which would have most probably led to some practical results the conduct of pigeonswing was among the circumstances that were thus overlooked by our hero in point of fact peter was slowly but surely working on the mind of the chippewa changing all his opinions radically and teaching him to regard every paleface as an enemy the task in this instance was not easy for pigeonswing in addition to his general propensities in favor of the yankees the result of mere accident had conceived a real personal regard for le bourdon and was very slow to admit any views that tended to his injury the struggle in the mind of the young warrior was severe and twenty times was he on the point of warning his friend of the danger which impended over the whole party when a sense of good faith toward peter who held his word to the contrary prevented his so doing this conflict of feeling was now constantly active in the breast of the young savage  pigeonswing had another source of uneasiness to which his companions were entirely strangers while hunting his keen eyes had detected the presence of warriors in the openings it is true he had not seen even one but he knew that the signs he had discovered could not deceive him not only were warriors at hand but warriors in considerable numbers he had found one deserted lair from which its late occupants could not have departed many hours when it came under his own notice by means of that attentive sagacity which forms no small portion of the education of an american indian pigeonswing was enabled to ascertain that this party of itself numbered seventeen all of whom were men and warriors the first fact was easily enough to be seen perhaps there being just seventeen different impressions left in the grass but that all these persons were armed men was learned by pigeonswing through evidence that would have been overlooked by most persons by the length of the lairs he was satisfied none but men of full stature had been there and he even examined sufficiently close to make out the proofs that all but four of these men carried firearms strange as it may seem to those who do not know how keen the senses become when whetted by the apprehensions and wants of savage life pigeonswing was enabled to discover signs which showed that the excepted were provided with bows and arrows and spears  when the beehunter and his companion came in sight of the carcase of the bear which they did shortly after the last remark which we have given in the dialogue recorded the former exclaimed with a little surprise  hows this chippewa you have killed this beast with your bow did you not hunt with the rifle yesterday  bad fire rifle off nowaday answered pigeonswing sententiously make noisenoise no good  noise repeated the perfectly unsuspecting beehunter little good or little harm can noise do in these openings where there is neither mountain to give back an echo or ear to be startled the crack of my rifle has rung through these groves a hundred times and no harm come of it  forget wartime now bess nebber fire less cant help him pottawattamie hear great way off  oh thats it is it youre afraid our old friends the pottawattamies may find us out and come to thank us for all that happened down at the rivers mouth well continued le bourdon laughing if they wish another whiskeyspring i have a small jug left safely hid against a wet day a very few drops will answer to make a tolerable spring you redskins dont know everything pigeonswing though you are so keen and quickwitted on a trail  bess not tell pottawattamie any more bout springs answered the chippewa gravely for by this time he regarded the state of things in the openings to be so serious as to feel little disposition to mirth why you dont go home eh why dont medcineman go home too bess for paleface to be wid paleface when red man go on war path color bess keep wid color  i see you want to be rid of us pigeonswing but the parson has no thought of quitting this part of the world until he has convinced all the redskins that they are jews  what he mean eh demanded the chippewa with more curiosity than it was usual for an indian warrior to betray what sort of a man jew eh why call red man jew  i know very little more about it than you do yourself pigeonswing but such as my poor knowledge is youre welcome to it youve heard of the bible i dare say  sartainmedcineman read him sunday good book to read some tink  yes its all that and a great companion have i found my bible when ive been alone with the bees out here in the openings it tells us of our god chippewa and teaches us how we are to please him and how we may offend its a great loss to you redskins not to have such a book among you  medcineman bring himdont do much good yet some day praps do better how dat make red man jew  why this is a new idea to me though parson amen seems fully possessed with it i suppose you know what a jew is  dont know anything bout him sort o nigger eh  no no pigeonswing youre wide of the mark this time but that we may understand each other well begin at the beginning like which will let you into the whole history of the paleface religion as weve had a smart walk however and here is the bears meat safe and sound just as you left it let us sit down a bit on this trunk of a tree while i give you our tradition from beginning to end as it might be in the first place chippewa the earth was made without creatures of any sort to live on itnot so much as a squirrel or a woodchuck  poor country to hunt in dat observed the chippewa quietly while le bourdon was wiping his forehead after removing his cap ojebways stay in it very little time  this according to our belief was before any ojebway lived at length god made a man out of clay and fashioned him as we see men fashioned and living all around us  yes answered the chippewa nodding his head in assent den manitou put plenty blood in himdat make red warrior bible good book if tell dat tradition  the bible says nothing about any colors but we suppose the man first made to have been a paleface at any rate the palefaces have got possession of the best parts of the earth as it might be and i think they mean to keep them first come first served you know the palefaces are many and are strong  stop exclaimed pigeonswing in a way that was very unusual for an indian to interrupt another when speaking want to ask question how many paleface you tink is dere ebber count him  count himwhy chippewa you might as well count the bees as they buzz around a fallen tree you saw me cut down the tree i last discovered and saw the movement of the little animals and may judge what success tongue or eye would have in counting them now just as true would it be to suppose that any man could count the palefaces on this earth  dont want count all answered pigeonswing want to know how many dis side of great salt lake  thats another matter and more easily come at i understand you now chippewa you wish to know how many of us there are in the country we call america  juss so returned pigeonswing nodding in assent dat juss it juss what injin want to know  well we do have a count of our own people from time to time and i suppose come about as near to the truth as men can come in such a matter there must be about eight millions of us altogether that is old and young big and little male and female  how many warrior you gotdont want hear about squaw and pappoose  no i see youre warlike this morning and want to see how we are likely to come out of this struggle with your great canada father counting all round i think we might muster hard on upon a million of fighting mengood bad and indifferent that is to say there must be a million of us of proper age to go into the wars  pigeonswing made no answer for near a minute both he and the bee hunter had come to a halt alongside of the bears meat and the latter was beginning to prepare his own portion of the load for transportation while his companion stood thus motionless lost in thought suddenly pigeonswing recovered his recollection and resumed the conversation by saying  what million mean bourdon how many time soger at detroit and soger on lakes  a million is more than the leaves on all the trees in these openingsle bourdons notions were a little exaggerated perhaps but this was what he saidyes more than the leaves on all these oaks far and near a million is a countless number and i suppose would make a row of men as long as from this spot to the shores of the great salt lake if not farther  it is probable that the beehunter himself had no very clear notion of the distance of which he spoke or of the number of men it would actually require to fill the space he mentioned but his answer sufficed deeply to impress the imagination of the indian who now helped le bourdon to secure his load to his back in silence receiving the same service in return when the meat of the bear was securely bestowed each resumed his rifle and the friends commenced their march in toward the chiente conversing as they went on the matter which still occupied their minds when the beehunter again took up the history of the creation it was to speak of our common mother  you will remember chippewa he said that i told you nothing on the subject of any woman what i have told you as yet consarned only the first man who was made out of clay into whom god breathed the breath of life  dat goodmake warrior fuss juss right when breat in him fit to take scalp eh  why as to that it is not easy to see whom he was to scalp seeing that he was quite alone in the world until it pleased his creator to give him a woman for a companion  tell bout dat returned pigeonswing with interesttell how he got squaw  accordin to the bible god caused this man to fall into a deep sleep when he took one of his ribs and out of that he made a squaw for him then he put them both to live together in a most beautiful garden in which all things excellent and pleasant was to be found some such place as these openings i reckon  any bee dere asked the indian quite innocently plenty honey eh  that will i answer for it could hardly be otherwise when it was the intention to make the first man and first woman perfectly happy i dare say chippewa if the truth was known it would be found that bees was a sipping at every flower in that most delightful garden  why paleface quit dat garden eh why come here to drive poor injin way from game tell me dat bourdon if he can why paleface ever leave dat garden when he so hansome eh  god turned him out of it chippewayes he was turned out of it with shame on his face for having disobeyed the commandments of his creator having left the garden his children have scattered over the face of the earth  so come here to drive off injin well dat e way wid paleface i did ever hear of red man comin to drive off paleface  i have heard of your red warriors often coming to take our scalps chippewa more or less of this has been done every year since our people have landed in america more than that they have not done for we are too many to be driven very far in by a few scattering tribes of injins  tink den more paleface dan injin eh asked the chippewa with an interest so manifest that he actually stopped in his semitrot in order to put the question more paleface warrior dan red men  more aye a thousand times more chippewa where you could show one warrior we could show a thousand  now this was not strictly true perhaps but it answered the purpose of deeply impressing the chippewa with the uselessness of peters plans and sustained as it was by his early predilections it served to keep him on the right side in the crisis which was approaching the discourse continued much in the same strain until the men got in with their bears meat having been preceded some time by the others with the venison  it is a little singular that neither the questions nor the manner of pigeonswing awakened any distrust in the beehunter so far from this the latter regarded all that had passed as perfectly natural and as likely to arise in conversation in the way of pure speculation as in any other manner pigeonswing intended to be guarded in what he said and did for as yet he had not made up his mind which side he would really espouse in the event of the great project coming to a head he had the desire natural to a red man to avenge the wrongs committed against his race but this desire existed in a form a good deal mitigated by his intercourse with the yankees and his regard for individuals it had nevertheless strangely occurred to the savage reasoning of this young warrior that possibly some arrangement might be effected by means of which he should take scalps from the canadians while peter and his other followers were working their will on the americans in this confused condition was the mind of the chippewa when he and his companion threw down their loads near the place where the provision of game was usually kept this was beneath the tree near the spring and the cookhouse in order that no inconvenience should arise from its proximity to the place where the party dwelt and slept for a siege should there be occasion to shut themselves up within the garrison the men depended on the pickled pork and a quantity of dried meat of the latter of which the missionary had brought a considerable supply in his own canoe among these stores were a few dozen of buffaloes or bisons tongues a delicacy that would honor the best table in the civilized world though then so common among the western hunters as scarce to be deemed food as good as the common salted pork and beef of the settlements  the evening that followed proved to be one of singular softness and sweetness the sun went down in a cloudless sky and gentle airs from the southwest fanned the warm cheeks of margery as she sat resting from the labors of the day with le bourdon at her side speaking of the pleasures of a residence in such a spot the youth was eloquent for he felt all that he said and the maiden was pleased the young man could expatiate on bees in a way to arrest any ones attention and margery delighted to hear him relate his adventures with these little creatures his successes losses and journeys  but are you not often lonely bourdon living here in the openings whole summers at a time without a living soul to speak to demanded margery coloring to the eyes the instant the question was asked lest it should subject her to an imputation against which her modesty revolted that of wishing to draw the discourse to a discussion on the means of preventing this solitude in future  i have not been hitherto answered le bourdon so frankly as at once to quiet his companions sensitiveness though i will not answer for the future now that i have so many with me we may make some of them necessary mindi say some not all of my present guests if i could have my pick pretty margery the present company would give me all i can desire and more too i should not think of going to detroit for that companion since she is to be found so much nearer  margery blushed and looked downthen she raised her eyes smiled and seemed grateful as well as pleased by this time she had become accustomed to such remarks and she had no difficulty in discovering her lovers wishes though he had never been more explicit the reflections natural to her situation threw a shade of gentle seriousness over her countenance rendering her more charming than ever and causing the youth to plunge deeper and deeper into the meshes that female influence had cast around him in all this however one of the parties was governed by a manly sincerity and the other by girlish artlessness diffidence one of the most certain attendants of a pure passion alone kept le bourdon from asking margery to become his wife while margery herself sometimes doubted whether it were possible that any reputable man could wish to connect himself and his fortunes with a family that had sunk as low as persons could well sink in this country and not lose their characters altogether with these doubts and distrusts so naturally affecting the mind of each these young people were rapidly becoming more and more enamored the beehunter betraying his passion in the close absorbed attentions that more properly belong to his sex while that of margery was to be seen in sudden blushes the thoughtful brow the timid glance and a cast of tenderness that came over her whole manner and as it might be her whole being  while our young folk were thus employed now conversing cheerfully now appearing abstracted and lost in thought though seated side by side le bourdon happened to look behind him and saw that peter was regarding them with one of those intense but mysterious expressions of the countenance that had now more than once attracted his attention giving reason each time for a feeling in which doubt curiosity and apprehension were singularly mingled even in himself  at the customary hour which was always early in that party of simple habits the whole family sought its rest the females withdrew within the chiente while the males arranged their skins without ever since the erection of the palisades le bourdon had been in the habit of calling hive within the defences leaving him at liberty to roam about inside at pleasure previously to this new arrangement the dog had been shut up in his kennel in order to prevent his getting on the track of a deer or in close combat with some bear when his master was not present to profit by his efforts as the palisades were too high for his leap this putting him at liberty within them answered the double purpose of giving the mastiff room for healthful exercise and of possessing a most vigilant sentinel against dangers of all sorts on the present occasion however the dog was missing and after calling and whistling for him some time the beehunter was fain to bar the gate and leave him on the outside this done he sought his skin and was soon asleep  it was midnight when the beehunter felt a hand laid on his own arm it was the corporal making this movement in order to awake him in an instant the young man was on his feet with his rifle in his hand  did you not hear it bourdon demanded the corporal in a tone so low as scarce to exceed a whisper  hear what ive been sleeping sound as a bee in winter  the hornthe horn has been blown twice and i think we shall soon hear it again  the horn was hanging at the door of the chiente and the conch too it will be easy to see if they are in their places  it was only necessary to walk around the walls of the hut to its opposite side in order to ascertain this fact le bourdon did so accompanied by the corporal and just as each laid a hand on the instruments which were suspended in their proper places a heavy rush was made against the gate as if to try its fastenings these pushes were repeated several times with a violence that menaced the bars of course the two men stepped to the spot a distance of only a few paces the gateway of the palisades and the door of the chiente being contiguous to each other and immediately ascertained that it was the mastiff endeavoring to force his way in the bee hunter admitted the dog which had been trained to suppress his bark though this animal was too brave and large to throw away his breath when he had better rely on his force powerful animals of this race are seldom noisy it being the province of the cur both among dogs and men to be blustering and spitting out their venom at all hours and seasons hive however in addition to his natural disposition had been taught from the time he was a pup not to betray his presence unnecessarily by a bark and it was seldom that his deep throat opened beneath the arches of the oaks when it did it told like the roaring of the lion in the desert  hive was no sooner admitted to the garrison than he manifested just as strong a desire to get out as a moment before he had manifested to get in this le bourdon well knew indicated the presence of some thing or creature that did not properly belong to the vicinity after consulting with the corporal pigeonswing was called and leaving him as a sentinel at the gate the two others made a sortie the corporal was as brave as a lion and loved all such movements though he fully anticipated encountering savages while his companion expected an interview with bears  as this movement was made at the invitation of the dog it was judiciously determined to let him act as pioneer on the advance previously to quitting the defences however the two adventurers looked closely to their arms each examined the priming saw that his horn and pouch were accessible and loosened his knife in its sheath the corporal moreover fixed his baggonet as he called the formidable glittering instrument that usually embellished the end of his musketa musket being the weapon he chose to carry while the beehunter himself was armed with a long western rifle     chapter xvi       the raptures of a conquerors mood      rushed burning through his frame      the depths of that green solitude      its torrents could not tame      though stillness lay with eves last smile      round those far fountains of the nile                                mrs hemans   when the beehunter and corporal flint thus went forth in midnight from the garrison of castle meal chateau au miel as the latter would have expressed it it was with no great apprehension of meeting any other than a fourfooted enemy notwithstanding the blast of the horn the worthy corporal supposed he had heard the movements of the dog seemed to announce such a result rather than any other for hive was taken along as a sort of guide le bourdon however did not permit his mastiff to run off wide but having the animal at perfect command it was kept close to his own person  the two men first moved toward the grove of the kitchen much to hives discontent the dog several times halted and he whined and growled and otherwise manifested his great dislike to proceed in that direction at length so decided did his resistance become that his master said to his companion  it seems to me best corporal to let the mastiff lead us i have never yet seen him so set on not going in one way and on going in another hive has a capital nose and we may trust him  forward returned the corporal wheeling short in the direction of the dog one thing should be understood however bourdon which is thisyou must act as light troops in this sortie and i as the main body if we come on the inimy it will be your duty to skrimmage in front as long as you can and then fall back on your resarves i shall depend chiefly on the baggonet which is the best tool to put an injin up with and as he falls back before my charge we must keep him under as warm a fire as possible having no cavalry the dog might be made useful in movements to the front and on our flanks  pooh pooh corporal youre almost as much set in the notions of your trade as parson amen is set in his idees about the lost tribes in my opinion therell be more tribes found in these openings before the summer is over than we shall wish to meet let us follow the dog and see what will turn up hive was followed and he took a direction that led to a distant point in the openings where not only the trees were much thicker than common but where a small tributary of the kalamazoo ran through a ravine from the higher lands adjacent into the main artery of all the neighboring watercourses the beehunter knew the spot well having often drank at the rivulet and cooled his brow in the close shades of the ravine when heated by exertions in the more open grounds in short the spot was one of the most eligible for concealment coolness and pure water within several miles of castle meal the trees formed a spacious grove around it and by means of the banks their summits and leaves answered the purpose of a perfect screen to those who might descend into the ravine or it would be better to say to the bottom le bourdon was no sooner satisfied that his mastiff was proceeding toward the great spring which formed the rivulet at the head of the ravine mentioned than he suspected indians might be there he had seen signs about the spot which wore an appearance of its having been used as a place of encampmentor for camping out as it is termed in the language of the westand coupling the sound of the horn with the dogs movements his quick apprehension seized on the facts as affording reasonable grounds of distrust consequently he resorted to great caution as he and the corporal entered the wood which surrounded the spring and the small oval bit of bottom that lay spread before it like a little lawn hive was kept close at his masters side though he manifested a marked impatience to advance now corporal said the beehunter in a low tone i think we have lined some savages to their holes we will go round the basin and descend to the bottom in a close wood which grows there did you see that  i suppose i did answered the corporal who was as firm as a rock you meant to ask me if i saw fire  i did the red men have lighted their council fire in this spot and have met to talk around it well let em hearken to each others thoughts if they will we shall be neither the better nor the worse for it  i dont know that when the commanderinchief calls together his principal officers something usually comes of it who knows but this very council is called in order to take opinions on the subject of besieging or of storming our new garrison prudent soldiers should always be ready for the worst  i have no fear so long as peter is with us that chief is listened to by every redskin and while we have him among us there will be little to care for but we are getting near to the bottom and must work our way through these bushes with as little noise as possible i will keep the dog quiet  the manner in which that sagacious animal now behaved was truly wonderful hive appeared to be quite as much aware of the necessity of extreme caution as either of the men and did not once attempt to precede his master his own length on one or two occasions he actually discovered the best passages and led his companions through them with something like the intelligence of a human being neither growl nor bark escaped him on the contrary even the hacking breathing of an impatient dog was suppressed precisely as if the animal knew how near he was getting to the most watchful ears in the world  after using the greatest care the beehunter and the corporal got just such a station as they desired it was within a very few feet of the edge of the cover but perfectly concealed while small openings enabled them to see all that was passing in their front a fallen tree a relic of somewhat rare occurrence in the openings of michigan even furnished them with a seat while it rendered their position less exposed hive placed himself at his masters side apparently trusting to other senses than that of sight for his information since he could see nothing of what was going on in front  as soon as the two men had taken their stations and began to look about them a feeling of awe mingled with their curiosity truly the scene was one so very remarkable and imposing that it might have filled more intellectual and better fortified minds with some such sensation the fire was by no means large nor was it particularly bright but sufficient to cast a dim light on the objects within reach of its rays it was in the precise centre of a bit of bottom land of about half an acre in extent which was so formed and surrounded as to have something of the appearance of the arena of a large amphitheatre there was one break in the encircling rise of ground it is true and that was at a spot directly opposite the station of le bourdon and his companion where the rill which flowed from the spring found a passage out toward the more open ground branches shaded most of the mound but the arena itself was totally free from all vegetation but that which covered the dense and beautiful sward with which it was carpeted such is a brief description of the natural accessories of this remarkable scene  but it was from the human actors and their aspects occupations movements dress and appearance generally that the awe which came over both the beehunter and the corporal had its origin of these near fifty were present offering a startling force by their numbers alone each man was a warrior and each warrior was in his paint these were facts that the familiarity of the two white men with indian customs rendered only too certain what was still more striking was the fact that all present appeared to be chiefs a circumstance which went to show that an imposing body of red men was most likely somewhere in the openings and that too at no great distance it was while observing and reflecting on all these things a suspicion first crossed the mind of le bourdon that this great council was about to be held at that midnight hour and so near his own abode for the purpose of accommodating peter whose appearance in the dark crowd from that instant he began to expect  the indians already present were not seated they stood in groups conversing or stalked across the arena resembling so many dark and stately spectres no sound was heard among them a circumstance that added largely to the wild and supernatural aspect of the scene if any spoke it was in a tone so low and gentle as to carry the sound no farther than to the ears that were listening two never spoke at the same time and in the same group while the moccasin permitted no footfall to be audible nothing could have been more unearthly than the picture presented in that little woodcircled arena of velvet like grass and rural beauty the erect stalking forms half naked if not even more the swarthy skins the faces fierce in the savage conceits which were intended to strike terror into the bosoms of enemies and the glittering eyes that fairly sparkled in their midst all contributed to the character of the scene which le bourdon rightly enough imagined was altogether much the most remarkable of any he had ever been in the way of witnessing  our two spectators might have been seated on the fallen tree half an hour all of which time they had been gazing at what was passing before their eyes with positively not a human sound to relieve the unearthly nature of the picture no one spoke coughed laughed or exclaimed in all that period suddenly every chief stood still and all the faces turned in the same direction it was toward the little gateway of the rill which being the side of the arena most remote from the beehunter and the corporal lay nearly in darkness as respected them with the red men it must have been different for they all appeared to be in intent expectation of some one from that quarter nor did they have to wait long for in half a minute two forms came out of the obscurity advancing with a dignified and deliberate tread to the centre of the arena as these newcomers got more within the influence of the flickering light le bourdon saw that they were peter and parson amen the first led with a slow imposing manner while the other followed not a little bewildered with what he saw it may be as well to explain here that the indian was coming alone to this place of meeting when he encountered the missionary wandering among the oaks looking for le bourdon and the corporal and instead of endeavoring to throw off this unexpected companion he quietly invited him to be of his own party  it was evident to le bourdon at a glance that peter was expected though it was not quite so clear that such was the fact as regarded his companion still respect for the great chief prevented any manifestations of surprise or discontent and the medicineman of the palefaces was received with as grave a courtesy as if he had been an invited guest just as the two had entered the dark circle that formed around them a young chief threw some dry sticks on the fire which blazing upward cast a stronger light on a row of as terrifically looking countenances as ever gleamed on human forms this sudden illumination with its accompanying accessories had the effect to startle all the white spectators though peter looked on the whole with a calm like that of the leafless tree when the cold is at its height and the currents of the wintry air are deathlike still nothing appeared to move him whether expected or not though use had probably accustomed his eye to all the aspects in which savage ingenuity could offer savage forms he even smiled as he made a gesture of recognition which seemed to salute the whole group it was just then when the fire burned brightest and when the chiefs pressed most within its influence that le bourdon perceived that his old acquaintances the headmen of the pottawattamies were present among the other chiefs so strangely and portentously assembled in these grounds which he had so long possessed almost entirely to himself  a few of the oldest of the chiefs now approached peter and a low conversation took place between them what was said did not reach le bourdon of course for it was not even heard in the dark circle of savages who surrounded the fire the effect of this secret dialogue however was to cause all the chiefs to be seated each taking his place on the grass the whole preserving the original circle around the fire fortunately for the wishes of le bourdon peter and his companions took their stations directly opposite to his own seat thus enabling him to watch every lineament of that remarkable chiefs still more remarkable countenance unlike each and all of the red men around him the face of peter was not painted except by the tints imparted by nature which in his case was that of copper a little tarnished or rendered dull by the action of the atmosphere the beehunter could distinctly trace every lineament nor was the dark roving eye beyond the reach of his own vision some attention was given to the fire too one of the younger chiefs occasionally throwing on it a few dried sticks more to keep alive the flame and to renew the light than from any need of warmth one other purpose however this fire did answer that of enabling the young chiefs to light the pipes that were now prepared it seldom occurring that the chiefs thus assembled without smoking around their councilfire  as this smoking was just then more a matter of ceremony than for any other purpose a whiff or two suffices for each chief the smoker passing the pipe to his neighbor as soon as he had inhaled a few puffs the indians are models of propriety in their happiest moods and every one in that dark and menacing circle was permitted to have his turn with the pipe before any other step was taken there were but two pipes lighted and mouths being numerous some time was necessary in order to complete this ceremony still no sign of impatience was seen the lowest chief having as much respect paid to his feelings as related to his attention as the highest at length the pipes completed their circuit even parson amen getting and using his turn when a dead pause succeeded the silence resembled that of a quaker meeting and was broken only by the rising of one of the principal chiefs evidently about to speak the language of the great ojebway nation was used on this occasion most of the chiefs present belonging to some one of the tribes of that stock though several spoke other tongues english and french included of the three whites present parson amen alone fully comprehended all that was said he having qualified himself in this respect to preach to the tribes of that people though le bourdon understood nearly all and even the corporal comprehended a good deal the name of the chief who first spoke at this secret meeting which was afterward known among the ojebways by the name of the council of the bottom land near to the spring of gushing water was bears meat an appellation that might denote a distinguished hunter rather than an orator of much renown  brothers of the many tribes of the ojebways commenced this personage the great spirit has permitted us to meet in council the manitou of our fathers is now among these oaks listening to our words and looking in at our hearts wise indians will be careful what they say in such a presence and careful of what they think all should be said and thought for the best we are a scattered nation and the time is come when we must stop in our tracks or travel beyond the sound of each others cries if we travel beyond the hearing of our people soon will our children learn tongues that ojebway ears cannot understand the mother talks to her child and the child learns her words but no child can hear across a great lake once we lived near the rising sun where are we now some of our young men say they have seen the sun go down in the lakes of sweet water there can be no huntinggrounds beyond that spot and if we would live we must stand still in our tracks how to do this we have met to consider  brothers many wise chiefs and braves are seated at this council fire it is pleasant to my eyes to look upon them ottawas chippeways pottawattamies menominees hurons and all our father at quebec has dug up the hatchet against the yankees the warpath is open between detroit and all the villages of the red men the prophets are speaking to our people and we listen one is here he is about to speak the council will have but a single sense which will be that of hearing  thus concluding bears meat took his seat in the same composed and dignified manner as that in which he had risen and deep silence succeeded so profound was the stillness that taken in connection with the dark lineaments the lustrous eyeballs that threw back the light of the fire the terrific paint and the armed hands of every warrior present the picture might be described as imposing to a degree that is seldom seen in the assemblies of the civilized in the midst of this general but portentous calm peter arose the breathing of the circle grew deeper so much so as to be audible the only manner in which the intensity of the common expectation betrayed itself peter was an experienced orator and knew how to turn every minutiae of his art to good account his every movement was deliberate his attitude highly dignifiedeven his eye seemed eloquent  oratory what a power art thou wielded as is so often the case as much for evil as for good the very reasoning that might appear to be obtuse or which would be over looked entirely when written and published issuing from the mouth aided by the feelings of sympathy and the impulses of the masses seems to partake of the wisdom of divinity thus is it also with the passions the sense of wrong the appeals to vengeance and all the other avenues of human emotion let them be addressed to the cold eye of reason and judgment in the form of written statements and the mind pauses to weigh the force of arguments the justice of the appeals the truth of facts but let them come upon the ear aided by thy art with a power concentrated by sympathy and the torrent is often less destructive in its course than that of the whirlwind that thou canst awaken  chiefs of the great ojebway nation i wish you well said peter stretching out his arms toward the circle as if desirous of embracing all present the manitou has been good to me he has cleared a path to this spring and to this councilfire i see around it the faces of many friends why should we not all be friendly why should a red man ever strike a blow against a red man the great spirit made us of the same color and placed us on the same huntinggrounds he meant that we should hunt in company not take each others scalps how many warriors have fallen in our family wars who has counted them who can say perhaps enough had they not been killed to drive the palefaces into the sea  here peter who as yet had spoken only in a low and barely audible voice suddenly paused in order to allow the idea he had just thrown out to work on the minds of his listeners that it was producing its effect was apparent by the manner in which one stern face turned toward another and eye seemed to search in eye some response to a query that the mind suggested though no utterance was given to it with the tongue as soon however as the orator thought time sufficient to impress that thought on the memories of the listeners had elapsed he resumed suffering his voice gradually to increase in volume as he warmed with his subject  yes he continued the manitou has been very kind who is the manitou has any indian ever seen him every indian has seen him no one can look on the huntinggrounds on the lakes on the prairies on the trees on the game without seeing his hand his face is to be seen in the sun at noonday his eyes in the stars at night has any indian ever heard the manitou when it thunders he speaks when the crash is loudest then he scolds some indian has done wrong perhaps one red man has taken another red mans scalp  another pause succeeded briefer and less imposing than the first but one that sufficed to impress on the listeners anew the great evil of an indians raising his hand against an indian  yes there is no one so deaf as not to hear the voice of the great spirit when he is angry resumed peter ten thousands of buffalo bulls roaring together do not make as much noise as his whisper spread the prairies and the openings and the lakes before him and he can be heard in all and on all at the same time  here is a medicinepriest of the palefaces he tells me that the voice of the manitou reaches into the largest villages of his people beneath the rising sun when it is heard by the red man across the great lakes and near the rocks of the setting sun it is a loud voice woe to him who does not remember it it speaks to all colors and to every people and tribe and nation  brothers that is a lying tradition which says there is one manitou for a sac and another for the ojebwayone manitou for the red man and another for the paleface in this we are alike one great spirit made all governs all rewards all punishes all he may keep the happy huntinggrounds of an indian separate from the white mans heaven for he knows that their customs are different and what would please a warrior would displease a trader and what would please a trader would displease a warrior he has thought of these things and has made several places for the spirits of the good let their colors be what they may is it the same with the places of the spirits of the bad i think not to me it would seem best to let them go together that they may torment one another a wicked indian and a wicked paleface would make a bad neighborhood i think the manitou will let them go together  brothers if the manitou keeps the good indian and the good pale face apart in another world what has brought them together in this if he brings the bad spirits of all colors together in another world why should they come together here before their time a place for wicked spirits should not be found on earth this is wrong it must be looked into  brothers i have now done this paleface wishes to speak and i have said that you would hear his words when he has spoken his mind i may have more to tell you now listen to the stranger he is a medicinepriest of the white men and says he has a great secret to tell our peoplewhen he has told it i have another for their ears too mine must be spoken when there is no one near but the children of red clay  having thus opened the way for the missionary peter courteously took his seat producing a little disappointment among his own admirers though he awakened a lively curiosity to know what this medicinepriest might have to say on an occasion so portentous the indians in the regions of the great lakes had long been accustomed to missionaries and it is probable that even some of their own traditions so far as they related to religious topics had been insensibly colored by if not absolutely derived from men of this character for the first whites who are known to have penetrated into that portion of the continent were jesuits who carried the cross as their standard and emblem of peace blessed emblem that any should so confound their own names and denunciatory practices with the revealed truth as to imagine that a standard so appropriate should ever be out of season and place when it is proper for man to use aught at all that is addressed to his senses in the way of symbols rites and ceremonies to the jesuits succeeded the less ceremonious and less imposing priesthood of america as america peculiarly was in the first years that followed the revolution there is reason to believe that the spirit of god in a greater or less degree accompanied all for all were self denying and zealous though the fruits of near two centuries of labor have as yet amounted to little more than the promise of the harvest at some distant day enough however was known of the missionaries and their views in general to prepare the council in some small degree for the forthcoming exhibition  parson amen had caught some of the habits of the indians in the course of years of communication and intercourse like them he had learned to be deliberate calm and dignified in his exterior and like them he had acquired a sententious mode of speaking  my children he said for he deemed it best to assume the parental character in a scene of so great moment as peter has told you the spirit of god is among you christians know that such has he promised to be always with his people and i see faces in this circle that i am ready to claim as belonging to those who have prayed with me in days that are long past if your souls are not touched by divine love it does not kill the hope i entertain of your yet taking up the cross and calling upon the redeemers name but not for this have i come with peter this night i am now here to lay before you an allimportant fact that providence has revealed to me as the fruit of long labor in the vineyard of study and biblical inquiry it is a traditionand red men love traditionsit is a tradition that touches your own history and which it will gladden your hearts to hear for it will teach you how much your nation and tribes have been the subject of the especial care and love of the great spirit when my children say speak i shall be ready to speak  here the missionary took his seat wisely awaiting a demonstration on the part of the council ere he ventured to proceed any further this was the first occasion on which he had ever attempted to broach in a direct form his favorite theory of the lost tribes let a man get once fairly possessed of any peculiar notion whether it be on religion political economy morals politics arts or anything else and he sees little beside his beloved principle which he is at all times ready to advance defend demonstrate or expatiate on nothing can be simpler than the two great dogmas of christianity which are so plain that all can both comprehend them and feel their truth they teach us to love god the surest way to obey him and to love our neighbor as ourselves any one can understand this all can see how just it is and how much of moral sublimity it contains it is godlike and brings us near the very essence of the divinity which is love mercy and truth yet how few are content to accept the teachings of the saviour in this respect without embarrassing them with theories that have so much of their origin in human fancies we do not mean by this however that parson amen was so very wrong in bestowing a part of his attention on that wonderful people who so early set apart by the creator as the creatures of his own especial ends have already played so great a part in the history of nations and who are designed so far as we can penetrate revelation yet to enact their share in the sublime drama of human events  as for the council its members were moved by more than ordinary curiosity to hear what further the missionary might have to say though all present succeeded admirably in suppressing the exhibition of any interest that might seem weak and womanly after a decent delay therefore bears meat intimated to the parson that it would be agreeable to the chiefs present to listen to him further  my children i have a great tradition to tell you the missionary resumed as soon as on his feet again a very great and divine tradition not a tradition of mans but one that came direct from the manitou himself peter has spoken truth there is but one great spirit he is the great spirit of all colors and tribes and nations he made all men of the same clay here a slight sensation was perceptible among the audience most of whom were very decidedly of a different opinion on this point of natural history but the missionary was now so far warmed with his subject as to disregard any slight interruption and proceeded as if his listeners had betrayed no feeling and he divided them afterward into nations and tribes it was then he caused the color of his creatures to change some he kept white as he had made them some he put behind a dark cloud and they became altogether black our wise men think that this was done in punishment for their sins some he painted red like the nations on this continent here peter raised a finger in sign that he would ask a question for without permission granted no indian would interrupt the speaker indeed no one of less claims than peter would hardly have presumed to take the step he now did and that because he saw a burning curiosity gleaming in the bright eyes of so many in the dark circle  say on peter answered the missionary to this sign i will reply  let my brother say why the great spirit turned the indian to a red color was he angry with him or did he paint him so out of love  this is more than i can tell you friends there are many colors among men in different parts of the world and many shades among people of the same color there are palefaces fair as the lily and there are palefaces so dark as scarcely to be distinguished from blacks the sun does much of this but no sun nor want of sun will ever make a paleface a redskin or a red skin a paleface  goodthat is what we indians say the manitou has made us different he did not mean that we should live on the same hunting grounds rejoined peter who rarely failed to improve every opportunity in order to impress on the minds of his followers the necessity of now crushing the serpent in its shell  no man can say that answered parson amen unless my people had come to this continent the word of god could not have been preached by me along the shores of these lakes but i will now speak of our great tradition the great spirit divided mankind into nations and tribes when this was done he picked out one for his chosen people the palefaces call that favorite and for a long time muchfavored people jews the manitou led them through a wilderness and even through a salt lake until they reached a promised land where he permitted them to live for many hundred winters a great triumph was to come out of that peoplethe triumphs of truth and of the law over sin and death in the course of time  here a young chief rose made a sign of caution and crossing the circle rapidly disappeared by the passage through which the rill flowed in about a minute he returned showing the way into the centre of the council to one whom all present immediately recognized as a runner by his dress and equipments important news was at hand yet not a man of all that crowd either rose or spoke in impatience to learn what it was     chapter xvii     who will believe that with a smile whose blessing      would like the patriarchs soothe a dying hour    with voice as low as gentle and caressing      as eer won maidens lips in moonlight bower     with look like patient jobs eschewing evil      with motions graceful as the birds in air    thou art in sober truth the veriest devil      that eer clinched fingers in a captives hair                                         hallecks redjacket   although the arrival of the runner was so totally unexpected it scarcely disturbed the quiet of that grave assembly his approaching step had been heard and he was introduced in the manner mentioned when the young chief resumed his seat leaving the messenger standing near the centre of the circle and altogether within the influence of the light he was an ottawa and had evidently travelled far and fast at length he spoke no one having put a single question to him or betrayed the least sign of impatient curiosity  i come to tell the chiefs what has happened said the runner our great father from quebec has sent his young men against the yankees red warriors too were there in hundreds here a murmur of interest was slightly apparent among the chiefstheir path led them to detroit it is taken  a low murmur expressive of satisfaction passed round the circle for detroit was then the most important of all the posts held by the americans along the whole line of the great lakes eye met eye in surprise and admiration then one of the older chiefs yielded to his interest in the subject and inquired  have our young men taken many paleface scalps  so few that they are not worth counting i did not see one pole that was such as an indian loves to look on  did our young men keep back and let the warriors from quebec do all the fighting  no one fought the yankees asked to be made prisoners without using their rifles never before have so many captives been led into the villages with so little to make their enemies look on them with friendly eyes  a gleam of fierce delight passed athwart the dark features of peter it is probable that he fell into the same error on hearing these tidings as that which so generally prevailed for a short time among the natives of the old world at the commencement of both of the two last wars of the republic when the disasters with which they opened induced so many to fall into the fatal error of regarding jonathan as merely a shopkeeper a shopkeeper in a certain sense he may well be accounted but among his wares are arms that he has the head the heart and the hands to use as man has very rarely been known to use them before even at this very instant the brilliant success which has rendered the armed citizens of this country the wonder of europe is reacting on the masses of the old world teaching them their power and inciting them to stand up to the regularly armed bands of their rulers with a spirit and confidence that hitherto has been little known in their histories happy thrice happy will it be if the conquerors use their success in moderation and settle down into the ways of practical reason instead of suffering their minds to be led astray in quest of the political jackolanterns that are certain to conduct their followers into the quagmires of impracticable and visionary theories to abolish abuses to set in motion the car of state on the track of justice and economy and to distinguish between that which is really essential to human happiness and human rights and that which is merely the result of some wild and bootless proposition in political economy are the great selfimposed tasks that the european people seem now to have assumed and god grant that they may complete their labors with the moderation and success with which they would appear to have commenced them  as for peter with the curse of ignorance weighing on his mind it is to be presumed that he fancied his own great task of destroying the whites was so much the lighter in consequence of the feeble defence of the yankees at detroit the runner was now questioned by the different chiefs for details which he furnished with sufficient intelligence and distinctness the whole of that discreditable story is too prominent in history and of too recent occurrence to stand in need of repetition here when the runner had told his tale the chiefs broke the order of their circle to converse the more easily concerning the great events which had just occurred some were not backward in letting their contempt for the yankees be known here were three of their strong places taken in quick succession and almost without a blow detroit the strongest of them all and defended by an army had fallen in a way to bring the blush to the american face seemingly leaving the whole of the northwestern frontier of the country ravished from the red man exposed to his incursions and depredations  what does my father think of this asked bears meat of peter as the two stood apart in a cluster of some three or four of the principal personages present does the news make his heart stronger  it is always strong when this business is before it the manitou has long looked darkly upon the red men but now his face brightens the cloud is passing from before his countenance and we can begin again to see his smile it will be with our sons as it was with our fathers our huntinggrounds will be our own and the buffalo and deer will be plenty in our wigwams the firewater will flow after them that brought it into the country and the red man will once more be happy as in times past  the ignis fatuus of human happiness employs all minds all faculties all pens and all theories just at this particular moment a thousand projects have been broached will continue to be broached and will fail each in its time showing the mistakes of men without remedying the evils of which they complain this is not because a beneficent providence has neglected to enlighten their minds and to show them the way to be happy here and hereafter but because human conceit runs pari passu with human woes and we are too proud to look for our lessons of conduct in that code in which they have been set before us by unerring wisdom and ceaseless love if the political economists and reformers and revolutionists of the age would turn from their speculations to those familiar precepts which all are taught and so few obey they would find rules for every emergency and most of all would they learn the great secret which lies so profoundly hid from them and their philosophy in the contented mind nothing short of this will ever bring the mighty reform that the world needs the press may be declared free but a very brief experience will teach those who fancy that this one conquest will secure the victory that they have only obtained king stork in the lieu of king log a vulgar and most hideous tyrant for one of royal birth and gentle manners they may set up the rule of patriots by profession in place of the dominion of those who have so long pretended that the art of governing descends from male to male according to the order of primogeniture and live to wonder that love of country should have so many weaknesses in common with love of itself they may rely on written charters for their liberties instead of the divine right of kings and come perchance to learn that neither language nor covenants nor signatures nor seals avail much as against the necessities of nations and the policy of rulers do we then regard reform as impossible and society to be doomed to struggle on in its old sloughs of oppression and abuses far from it we believe and hope that at each effort of a sage character something is gained while much more than had been expected is lost and such we think will continue to be the course of events until men shall reach that period in their history when possibly to their wonder they will find that a faultless code for the government of all their affairs has been lying neglected daily and hourly in their very hands for eighteen centuries and a half without their perceiving the allimportant truth in due season this code will supersede all others when the world will for the first time be happy and truly free  there was a marked resemblance between the hopes and expectations of peter in reference to the overthrow of his paleface enemies on the american continent and those of the revolutionists of the old world in reference to the overthrow of their strongintrenched foes on that of europe each fancies success more easy of attainment than the end is likely to show both overlook the terrible power of their adversaries and both take the suggestions of a hope that is lively rather than enlightened as the substitute for the lessons of wisdom  it was some little time ere the council had so far regained its calm as to think of inviting the missionary to resume his discourse the last had necessarily heard the news and was so much troubled by it as to feel no great disposition to proceed but peter intimating that the ears of his friends were open he was of opinion it would be wisest to go on with his traditions  thus it was my children parson amen continued the circle being just as quiet and attentive as if no interruption had occurredthe great spirit selecting from among the nations of the earth one to be his chosen people i cannot stop now to tell you all he did for this nation in the way of wonders and powers but finally he placed them in a beautiful country where milk and honey abounded and made them its masters from that people in his earthly character came the christ whom we missionaries preach to you and who is the great head of our church although the jews or israelites as we call that people were thus honored and thus favored of the manitou they were but men they had the weaknesses of men on more than one occasion they displeased the great spirit and that so seriously as to draw down condign punishment on themselves and on their wives and children in various ways were they visited for their backsliding and sins each time repenting and receiving forgiveness at length the great spirit tired of their forgetfulness and crimes allowed an army to come into their land and to carry away as captives no less than ten of their twelve tribes putting their people in strange huntinggrounds now this happened many thousands of moons since and no one can say with certainty what has become of those captives whom christians are accustomed to call the lost tribes of israel  here the missionary paused to arrange his thoughts and a slight murmur was heard in the circle as the chiefs communed together in interested comments on what had just been said the pause however was short and the speaker again proceeded safe from any ungracious interruption among auditors so trained in selfrestraint  children i shall not now say anything touching the birth of christ the redemption of the world and the history of the two tribes that remained in the land where god had placed his people for that is a part of the subject that comes properly within the scope of my ordinary teaching at present i wish only to speak of yourselves of the red man of america of his probable origin and end and of a great discovery that many of us think we have made on this most interesting topic in the history of the good book does any one present know aught of the ten lost tribes of whom i have spoken  eye met eye and expectation was lively among those primitive and untaught savages at length crowsfeather arose to answer the missionary standing the whole time motionless as if waiting for a reply  my brother has told us a tradition said the pottawattamie it is a good tradition it is a strange tradition red men love to hear such traditions it is wonderful that so many as ten tribes should be lost at the same time and no one know what has become of them my brother asks us if we know what has become of these ten tribes how should poor red men who live on their huntinggrounds and who are busy when the grass grows in getting together food for their squaws and pappooses against a time when the buffalo can find nothing to eat in this part of the world know anything of a people that they never saw my brother has asked a question that he only can answer let him tell us where these ten tribes are to be found if he knows the place we should like to go and look at them  here exclaimed the missionary the instant crowsfeather ceased speaking and even before he was seated herein this councilon these prairiesin these openingshere on the shores of the great lakes of sweet water and throughout the land of america are these tribes to be found the red man is a jew a jew is a red man the manitou has brought the scattered people of israel to this part of the world and i see his power in the wonderful fact nothing but a miracle could have done this  great was the admiration of the indians at this announcement none of their own traditions gave this account of their origin but there is reason to believe on the other hand that none of them contradict it nevertheless here was a medicinepriest of the pale faces boldly proclaiming the fact and great was the wonder of all who heard thereat having spoken the missionary again paused that his words might produce their effect bears meat now became his interrogator rising respectfully and standing during the colloquy that succeeded  my brother has spoken a great tradition said the menominee did he first hear it from his fathers  in part only the history of the lost tribes has come down to us from our fathers it is written in the good book of the palefaces the book that contains the word of the great spirit  does the good book of the palefaces say that the red men are the children of the people he has mentioned  i cannot say that it does while the good book tells us so much it also leaves very much untold it is best that we should look for ourselves that we may find out some of its meanings it is in thus looking that many christians see the great truth which makes the indians of america and the jews beyond the great salt lake one and the same people  if this be so let my brother tell us how far it is from our huntinggrounds to that distant land across the great salt lake  i cannot give you this distance in miles exactly but i suppose it may be eleven or twelve times the length of michigan  will my brother tell us how much of this long path is water and how much of it is dry land  perhaps onefourth is land as the traveller may choose the rest must be water if the journey be made from the rising toward the setting sun which is the shortest path but let the journey be made from the setting toward the rising sun and there is little water to cross rivers and lakes of no great width as is seen here but only a small breadth of salt lake  are there then two roads to that faroff land where the red men are thought to have once lived  even so the traveller may come to this spot from that land by way of the rising sun or by way of the setting sun  the general movement among the members of the council denoted the surprise with which this account was received as the indians until they have had much intercourse with the whites very generally believe the earth to be flat it was not easy for them to comprehend how a given point could be reached by directly opposite routes such an apparent contradiction would be very likely to extort further questions  my brother is a medicineman of the palefaces his hairs are gray observed crowsfeather some of your medicinemen are good and some wicked it is so with the medicinemen of the redskins good and bad are to be found in all nations a medicineman of your people cheated my young men by promising to show them where fire water grows he did not show them he let them smell but he did not let them drink that was a wicked medicineman his scalp would not be safe did my young men see it againhere the beehunter insensibly to himself felt for his rifle making sure that he had it between his legs the corporal being a little surprised at the sudden start he gave his hair does not grow on his head closer than the trees grow to the ground even a tree can be cut down but all medicinemen are not alike my brother is a good medicineman all he says may not be just as he thinks but he believes what he says it is wonderful how men can look two ways but it is more wonderful that they should go to the same place by paths that lead before and behind this we do not understand my brother will tell us how it can be  i believe i understand what it is that my children would know they think the earth is flat but the palefaces know that it is round he who travels and travels toward the setting sun would come to this very spot if he travelled long enough the distance would be great but the end of every straight path in this world is the place of starting  my brother says this he says many curious things i have heard a medicineman of his people say that the palefaces have seen their great spirit talked with him walked with him it is not so with us indians our manitou speaks to us in thunder only we are ignorant and wish to learn more than we now know has my brother ever travelled on that path which ends where it begins once on the prairies i lost my way there was snow and glad was i to find tracks i followed the tracks but one traveller had passed after walking an hour two had passed another hour and the three had passed then i saw the tracks were my own and that i had been walking as the squaws reason round and round but not going ahead  i understand my friend but he is wrong it is no matter which path the lost tribes travelled to get here the main question is whether they came at all i see in the red men in their customs their history their looks and even in their traditions proof that they are these jews once the favored people of the great spirit  if the manitou so well loves the indians why has he permitted the palefaces to take away their huntinggrounds why has he made the red man poor and the white man rich brother i am afraid your tradition is a lying tradition or these things would not be so  it is not given to men to understand the wisdom that cometh from above that which seemeth so strange to us may be right the lost tribes had offended god and their scattering and captivity and punishment are but so many proofs of his displeasure but if lost we have reason to believe that one day they will be found yes my children it will be the pleasure of the great spirit one day to restore you to the land of your fathers and make you again what you once were a great and glorious people  as the wellmeaning but enthusiastic missionary spoke with great fervor the announcement of such an event coming as it did from one whom they respected even while they could not understand him did not fail to produce a deep sensation if their fortunes were really the care of the great spirit and justice was to be done to them by his love and wisdom then would the projects of peter and those who acted and felt with him be unnecessary and might lead to evil instead of to good that sagacious savage did not fail to discover this truth and he now believed it might be well for him to say a word in order to lessen the influence parson amen might otherwise obtain among those whom it was his design to mould in a way entirely to meet his own wishes so intense was the desire of this mysterious leader to execute vengeance on the palefaces that the redemption of the tribes from misery and poverty unaccompanied by this part of his own project would have given him pain in lieu of pleasure his very soul had got to be absorbed in this one notion of retribution and of annihilation for the oppressors of his race and he regarded all things through a medium of revenge thus created by his feelings much as the missionary endeavored to bend every fact and circumstance connected with the indians to the support of his theory touching their jewish origin  when peter arose therefore fierce and malignant passions were at work in his bosom such as a merciful and a benignant deity never wishes to see in the breast of man whether civilized or savage the selfcommand of the tribeless however was great and he so far succeeded in suppressing the volcano that was raging within as to speak with his usual dignity and an entire calmness of exterior  my brothers have heard what the medicineman had to say peter commenced he has told them that which was new to them he has told them an indian is not an indian that a red man is a paleface and that we are not what we thought we were it is good to learn it makes the difference between the wise and the foolish the palefaces learn more than the redskins that is the way they have learned how to get our huntinggrounds that is the way they have learned to build their villages on the spots where our fathers killed the deer that is the way they have learned how to come and tell us that we are not indians but jews i wish to learn though old my mind craves to know more that i may know more i will ask this medicine man questions and my brothers can open their ears and learn a little too by what he answers perhaps we shall believe that we are not redskins but palefaces perhaps we shall believe that our true huntinggrounds are not near the great lakes of sweet water but under the rising sun perhaps we shall wish to go home and to leave these pleasant openings for the pale faces to put their cabins on them as the smallpox that they have also given to us puts its sores on our bodies brother turning toward the missionary listen you say we are no longer indians but jews is this true of all red men or only of the tribes whose chiefs are here  of all red men as i most sincerely believe you are now red but once all of your people were fairer than the fairest of the pale faces it is climate and hardships and sufferings that have changed your color  if suffering can do that returned peter with emphasis i wonder we are not black when all our huntinggrounds are covered with the farms of your people i think we shall be black  signs of powerful disgust were now visible among the listeners an indian having much of the contempt that seems to weigh so heavily on that unfortunate class for all of the color mentioned at the south as is known the red man has already made a slave of the descendants of the children of africa but no man has ever yet made a slave of a son of the american forests that is a result which no human power has yet been able to accomplish early in the settlement of the country attempts were indeed made by sending a few individuals to the islands but so unsuccessful did the experiment turn out to be that the design was soon abandoned whatever may be his degradation and poverty and ignorance and savage ferocity it would seem to be the settled purpose of the american indians of our own territoriesunlike the aborigines who are to be found farther southto live and die free men  my children answered the missionary i pretend not to say what will happen except as it has been told to us in the word of god you know that we palefaces have a book in which the great spirit has told us his laws and foretold to us many of the things that are to happen some of these things have happened while some remain to happen the loss of the ten tribes was foretold and has happened but their being found again has not yet happened unless indeed i am so blessed as to be one of those who have been permitted to meet them in these openings here is the bookit goes where i go and is my companion and friend by day and by night in good and evil in season and out of season to this book i cling as to my great anchor that is to carry me through the storms in safety every line in it is precious every word true  perhaps half the chiefs present had seen books before while those who now laid eyes on one for the first time had heard of this art of the palefaces which enabled them to set down their traditions in a way peculiar to themselves even the indians have their records however though resorting to the use of natural signs and a species of hieroglyphics in lieu of the more artistical process of using words and letters in a systemized written language the bible too was a book of which all had heard more or less though not one of those present had ever been the subject of its influence a christian indian indeedand a few of those were to be found even at that daywould hardly have attended a council convened for the objects which had caused this to be convened still a strong but regulated curiosity existed to see and touch and examine the great medicinebook of the palefaces there was a good deal of superstition blended with the indian manner of regarding the sacred volume some present having their doubts about touching it even while most excited by admiration and a desire to probe its secrets  peter took the little volume which the missionary extended as if inviting any one who might so please to examine it also it was the first time the wary chief had ever suffered that mysterious book to touch him among his other speculations on the subject of the manner in which the white men were encroaching from year to year on the lands of the natives it had occurred to his mind that this extraordinary volume which the palefaces all seemed to reverence even to the drunkards of the garrisons might contain the great elements of their power perhaps he was not very much out of the way in this supposition though they who use the volume habitually are not themselves aware onehalf the time why it is so  on the present occasion peter saw the great importance of not betraying apprehension and he turned over the pages awkwardly as one would be apt to handle a book for the first time but boldly and without hesitation encouraged by the impunity that accompanied this hardihood peter shook the leaves open and held the volume on high in a way that told his own people that he cared not for its charms or power there was more of seeming than of truth however in this bravado for never before had this extraordinary being made so heavy a draft on his courage and selfcommand as in the performance of this simple act he did not could not know what were the virtues of the book and his imagination very readily suggested the worst as the great medicinevolume of the palefaces it was quite likely to contain that which was hostile to the red men and this fact so probable to his eyes rendered it likely that some serious evil to himself might follow from the contact it did not however and a smile of grim satisfaction lighted his swarthy countenance as turning to the missionary he said with point  let my brother open his eyes i have looked into his medicinebook but do not see that the red man is anything but a red man the great spirit made him and what the great spirit makes lasts the pale faces have made their book and it lies  no nopeter peter thou utterest wicked words but the lord will pardon thee since thou knowest not what thou sayest give me the sacred volume that i may place it next my heart where i humbly trust so many of its divine precepts are already entrenched  this was said in english under the impulse of feeling but being understood by peter the latter quietly relinquished the bible preparing to follow up the advantage he perceived he had gained on the spot  my brother has his medicinebook again said peter and the red men live this hand is not withered like the dead branch of the hemlock yet it has held his word of the great spirit it may be that a redskin and a paleface book cannot do each other harm i looked into my brothers great charm but did not see or hear a tradition that tells me we are jews there is a beehunter in these openings i have talked with him he has told me who these jews are he says they are people who do not go with the palefaces but live apart from them like men with the smallpox it is not right for my brother to come among the red men and tell them that their fathers were not good enough to live and eat and go on the same paths as his fathers  this is all a mistake petera great and dangerous mistake the beehunter has heard the jews spoken of by those who do not sufficiently read the good book they have been and are still the chosen people of the great spirit and will one day be received back to his favor would that i were one of them only enlightened by the words of the new testament no real christian ever can or does now despise a son of israel whatever has been done in times past it is an honor and not a disgrace to be what i have said my friends are  if this be so why do not the palefaces let us keep out hunting grounds to ourselves we are content we do not wish to be jews our canoes are too small to cross the great salt lake they are hardly large enough to cross the great lakes of sweet water we should be tired of paddling so far my brother says there is a rich land under the rising sun which the manitou gave to the red men is this so  beyond all doubt it was given to the children of israel for a possession forever and though you have been carried away from it for a time there the land still is open to receive you and waiting the return of its ancient masters in good season that return must come for we have the word of god for it in our christian bible  let my brother open his ears very wide and hear what i have to say we thank him for letting us know that we are jews we believe that he thinks what he says still we think we are red men and injins and not jews we never saw the place where the sun rises we do not wish to see it our huntinggrounds are nearer to the place where he sets if the palefaces believe we have a right to that distant land which is so rich in good things we will give it to them and keep these openings and prairies and woods we know the game of this country and have found out how to kill it we do not know the game under the rising sun which may kill us go to your friends and say the injins will give you that land near the rising sun if you will let them alone on their huntinggrounds where they have so long been they say that your canoes are larger than their canoes and that one can carry a whole tribe they have seen some of your big canoes on the great lakes and have measured them fill all you have got with your squaws and pappooses put your property in them and go back by the long path through which you came then will the red man thank the paleface and be his friend the white man is welcome to that faroff land let him take it and build his villages on it and cut down its trees this is all the injins ask if the palefaces can take away with them the smallpox and the firewater it will be better still they brought both into this country it is right that they should take them away will my brother tell this to his people  it would do no good they know that the land of judea is reserved by god for his chosen people and they are not jews none but the children of israel can restore that land to its ancient fertility it would be useless for any other to attempt it armies have been there and it was once thought that a christian kingdom was set up on the spot but neither the time nor the people had come jews alone can make judea what it was and what it will be again if my people owned that land they could not use it there are also too many of us now to go away in canoes  did not the fathers of the palefaces come in canoes demanded peter a little sternly  they did but since that time their increase has been so great that canoes enough to hold them could not be found no the great spirit for his own wise ends has brought my people hither and here must they remain to the end of time it is not easy to make the pigeons fly south in the spring  this declaration quietly but distinctly made as it was the habit of the missionary to speak had its effect it told peter and those with him as plainly as language could tell them that there was no reason to expect the palefaces would ever willingly abandon the country and seemed the more distinctly in all their uninstructed minds to place the issue on the armed hand it is not improbable that some manifestation of feeling would have escaped the circle had not an interruption to the proceedings occurred which put a stop to all other emotions but those peculiar to the lives of savages     chapter xviii       nearer the mount stood moses in his hand      the rod which blasted with strange plagues the realm      of misraim and from its timeworn channels      upturned the arabian sea fair was his broad      high front and forth from his soulpiercing eye      did legislation look which full he fixed      upon the blazing panoply undazzled                                     hillhouse  it often happens in the recesses of the wilderness that in the absence of men the animals hunt each other the wolves in particular following their instincts are often seen in packs pressing upon the heels of the antelope deer and other creatures of that family which depend for safety more on their speed than on their horns on the present occasion a fine buck with a pack of fifty wolves close after it came bounding through the narrow gorge that contained the rill and entered the amphitheatre of the bottom land its headlong career was first checked by the sight of the fire then arose a dark circle of men each armed and accustomed to the chase in much less time than it has taken to record the fact that little piece of bottomland was crowded with wolves deer and men the headlong impetuosity of the chase and flight had prevented the scent from acting and all were huddled together for a single instant in a sort of inextricable confusion brief as was this melee it sufficed to allow of a young hunters driving his arrow through the heart of the buck and enabled others among the indians to kill several of the wolves some with arrows others with knives etc no rifle was used probably from a wish not to give an alarm  the wolves were quite as much astonished at this unexpected rencontre as the indians they were not a set of hungry and formidable beasts that famine might urge to any pass of desperation but a pack hunting like gentlemen for their own amusement their headlong speed was checked less by the crowd of men than by the sight of fire in their impetuosity it is probable that they would have gone clean through five hundred men but no wild beast will willingly encounter fire three or four of the chiefs aware of this dread seized brands and throwing themselves without care into the midst of the pack the animals went howling off scattering in all directions unfortunately for its own welfare one went directly through the circle plunged into the thicket beyond and made its way quite up to the fallen tree on which the beehunter and the corporal had taken their stations this was altogether too much for the training or for the philosophy of hive perceiving a recognized enemy rushing toward him that noble mastiff met him in a small cleared spot openmouthed and for a few moments a fierce combat was the consequence dogs and wolves do not fight in silence and loud were the growls and yells on this occasion in vain did le bourdon endeavor to drag his mastiff off the animal was on the highroad to victory when it is ever hard to arrest the steps of the combatant almost as a matter of course some of the chiefs rushed toward the spot when the presence of the two spectators first became known to them at the next moment the wolf lay dead at the feet of hive and the parties stood gazing at each other equally taken by surprise and equally at a loss to know what to do next  it was perhaps fortunate for the beehunter that neither crowsfeather nor any other of the pottawattamies was present at this first rencontre or he might have fallen on the spot a victim to their disappointed hopes of drinking at a whiskeyspring the chiefs present were strangers to le bourdon and they stared at him in a way to show that his person was equally unknown to them but it was necessary now to follow the indians back to their circle where the whole party soon collected again the wolves having gone off on their several routes to put up some other animal and run him to death  during the whole of that excited and tumultuous scene which would probably now be termed a stampede in the mexicanamericoenglish of the day peter had not stirred familiar with such occurrences he felt the importance of manifesting an unmoved calm as a quality most likely to impress the minds of his companions with a profound sense of his dignity and selfcommand while all around him was in a tumult he stood in his tracks motionless as a statue even the fortitude of the worthy missionary was shaken by the wild tempest that momentarily prevailed and the good man forgot the jews in his alarm at wolves forgot the mighty past in his apprehensions for the uncomfortable and illboding present time all this however was soon over and order and quiet and a dignified calm once more reigned in the circle fagots were thrown on the fire and the two captives or spectators stood as near it the observed of all observers as the heat rendered comfortable it was just then that crowsfeather and his companions first recognized the magician of the whiskeyspring  peter saw the discovery of the two spectators with some uneasiness the time had not come when he intended to strike his blow and he had seen signs among those pottawattamies when at the mouth of the river which had told him how little they were disposed to look with favor on one who had so grievously trifled with their hopes his first care therefore was to interpose his authority and influence between le bourdon and any project of revenge which crowsfeathers young men might be apt to devise as soon as they too laid eyes on the offender this was done in a characteristic and wily manner  does my brother love honey asked the tribeless chief of the leader of the pottawattamies present who sat near him gazing on le bourdon much as the cat looks upon the mouse ere it makes it its prey some injins are fond of that sweet food if my brother is one of that sort i can tell him how to fill his wigwam with honey with little trouble  at this suggestion coming from such a source crowsfeather could not do less than express his thanks and his readiness to hear what further might be in reserve for him peter then alluded to le bourdons art describing him as being the most skilful beehunter of the west so great was his art in that way that no indian had ever yet seen his equal it was peters intention to make him exercise his craft soon for the benefit of the chiefs and warriors present who might then return to their village carrying with them stores of honey to gladden the hearts of their squaws and pappooses this artifice succeeded for the indians are not expert in taking this article of food which so much abounds in the forests both on account of the difficulty they find in felling the trees and on account of the angleing part of the process which much exceeds their skill in mathematics on the other hand the last is just the sort of skill a common white american would be likely to manifest his readiness and ingenuity in all such processes almost amounting to an instinct  having thus thrown his mantle around le bourdon for the moment peter then deemed it the better course to finish the historical investigation in which the council had been so much interested when the strange interruption by the wolves occurred with this view therefore he rose himself and recalled the minds of all present to this interesting subject by a short speech this he did especially to prevent any premature attack on the person of le bourdon  brothers said this mysterious chief it is good for injins to learn when they learn a thing they know it then they may learn another it is in this way that the palefaces do it makes them wise and puts it in their power to take away our huntinggrounds a man that knows nothing is only a child that has grown up too fast he may be bigmay take long stepsmay be strong enough to carry burdensmay love venison and buffaloes humps but his size is only in the way his steps he does not know where to direct his burdens he does not know how to choose and he has to beg food of the squaws instead of carrying it himself to their wigwams he has not learned how to take game we must all learn it is right when we have learned how to take game and how to strike the enemy and how to keep the wigwam filled then we may learn traditions traditions tell us of our fathers we have many traditions some are talked of even to the squaws some are told around the fires of the tribes some are known only to the aged chiefs this is right too injins ought not to say too much nor too little they should say what is wisewhat is best but my brother the medicineman of the pale faces says that our traditions have not told us everything something has been kept back if so it is best to learn that too if we are jews and not injins we ought to know it if we are injins and not jews our brother ought to know it and not call us by a wrong name let him speak we listen  here peter slowly resumed his seat as the missionary understood all that had been said he next arose and proceeded to make good as far as he was able and in such language as his knowledge of indian habits suggested his theory of the lost tribes  i wish my children to understand resumed the missionary that it is an honor to be a jew i have not come here to lessen the red men in their own eyes but to do them honor i see that bears meat wishes to say something my ears are open and my tongue is still  i thank my brother for the opportunity to say what is on my mind returned the chief mentioned it is true i have something to say it is this i wish to ask the medicineman if the palefaces honor and show respect to the jews  this was rather an awkward question for the missionary but he was much too honest to dissemble with a reverence for truth that proceeded from his reverence for the father of all that is true he replied honestly though not altogether without betraying how much he regretted the necessity of answering at all both remained standing while the dialogue proceeded or in parliamentary language each may be said to have had the floor at the same time  my brother wishes to know if the palefaces honor the jews returned the missionary i wish i could answer yes but the truth forces me to say no the palefaces have traditions that make against the jews and the judgments of god weigh heavy on the children of israel but all good christians now look with friendly eyes on this dispersed and persecuted people and wish them well it will give the white men very great pleasure to learn that i have found the lost tribes of israel in the red men of america  will my brother tell us why this will give his people pleasure is it because they will be glad to find old enemies poor living on narrow huntinggrounds off which the villages and farms of the palefaces begin to push them still nearer to the setting sun and toward whom the smallpox has found a path to go but none to come from  nay nay bears meat think not so unkindly of us of the white race in crossing the great salt lake and in coming to this quarter of the world our fathers were led by the finger of god we do but obey the will of the great spirit in pressing forward into this wilderness directed by his wisdom how to spread the knowledge of his name among those who as yet have never heard it or having heard have not regarded it in all this the wisest men are but babes not being able to say whither they are to go or what is to be done  this is strange returned the unmoved indian it is not so with the red men our squaws and pappooses do know the huntingground of one tribe from the huntingground of another when they put their feet on strange huntinggrounds it is because they intended to go there and to steal game this is sometimes right if it is right to take the scalp of an enemy it is right to get his deer and his buffalo too but we never do this without knowing it if we did we should be unfit to go at large unfit to sit in council this is the first time i have heard that the palefaces are so weak and they have such feeble minds too that they do not know where they go  my brother does not understand me no man can see into the future no man can say what will happen tomorrow the great spirit only can tell it is for him then to guide his children in their wanderings when our fathers first came out of their canoes upon the land on this side of the great salt lake not one among them knew anything of this country between the great lakes of sweet water they did not know that red men lived here the great spirit did know and intended then that i should this night stand up in this council and speak of his power and of his name and do him reverence it was the great spirit that put it into my mind to come among the indians and it is the great spirit who has led me step by step as warriors move toward the graves of their fathers to make the discovery that the indians are in truth the children of israel a part of his own chosen and once muchfavored people let me ask my friends one or two questions do not your traditions say that your fathers once came from a faroff land  bears meat now took his seat not choosing to answer a question of this nature in the presence of a chief so much respected as peter he preferred to let the last take up the dialogue where he now saw fit to abandon it as the other very well understood the reason of this sudden movement he quietly assumed the office of spokesman the whole affair proceeding much as if there had been no change  our traditions do tell us that our fathers came from a faroff land answered peter without rising  i thought soi thought so exclaimed the simpleminded and confiding missionary how wonderful are the ways of god yes my brother judea is a faroff land and your traditions say that your fathers came from such a distance this then is something proved do not your traditions say that once your tribes were more in favor with the great spirit than they are now  our traditions do say this once our tribes did not see the face of the manitou looking dark upon them as it now does that was before the palefaces came in their big canoes across the great salt lake to drive the indians from their huntinggrounds it was when the smallpox had not found the path to their villages when firewater was unknown to them and no indian had ever burned his throat with it  oh but i speak of a time much more distant than that of a time when your prophets stood face to face with god and talked with the creator since that day a great change has come over your people then your color was light like that of the fairest and handsomest of the circassian race now it has become red when even the color is changed it is not wonderful that men should no longer be the same in other particulars yes once all the races of men were of the same color and origin  this is not what our traditions say we have heard from our fathers that the great spirit made men of different colors some he made light like the palefaces some red like the injins some black like the palefaces slaves to some he gave high noses to some low noses to some flat noses to the palefaces he gave eyes of many colors this is the reason why they see so many things and in so many different ways to the red men he gave eyes of the same color and they always see things of the same color to a red man there is no change our fathers have always been red this we know if them jews of whom my brother speaks were ever white they have not been our fathers we tell this to the medicineman that he may know it too we do not wish to lead him on a crooked path or to speak to him with a forked tongue what we have said is so now the road is open to the wigwam of the palefaces and we wish them safe on their journey home we injins have a council to hold around this fire and will stay longer  at this plain intimation that their presence was no longer desirable it became necessary for them to depart the missionary filled with zeal was reluctant to go for in his eyes the present communications with the savages promised him not only the conversion of pagans but the restoration of the jews nevertheless he was compelled to comply and when le bourdon and the corporal took their departure he turned and pronounced in solemn tone the christian benediction on the assembly the meaning of this last impressive office was understood by most of the chiefs and they rose as one man in acknowledgment  the three white men on retiring from the circle held their way toward castle meal hive followed his master having come out of the combat but little injured as they got to a point where a last look could be had of the bottomland of the council each turned to see what was now in the course of proceeding the fire glimmered just enough to show the circlet of dark faces but not an indian spoke or moved there they all sat patiently waiting for the moment when the strangers might withdraw to a sufficient distance to permit them to proceed with their own private affairs without fear of interruption  this has been to me a most trying scene observed the missionary as the three pursued their way toward the garrison how hard it is to convince men against their wishes now i am as certain as a man can be that every one of these injins is in fact a jew and yet you have seen how small has been my success in persuading them to be of the right way of thinking on this subject  i have always noticed that men stick even to their defects when theyre natral returned the beehunter even a nigger will stand up for his color and why shouldnt an injin you began wrong parson had you just told these chiefs that they were jews they might have stood that poor creatures for they hardly know how mankind looks upon a jew but you went to work to skin them in a lump making so many poor wishywashy palefaces of all the red skins in a body you and i may fancy a white face better than one of any other color but nature colors the eye when it colors the body and theres not a nigger in america who doesnt think black the pink of beauty  perhaps it was proceeding too fast to say anything about the change of color bourdon but what can a christian minister do unless he tell the truth adam could have been but of one color and all the races on earth one excepted must have changed from that one color  aye and my life on it that all the races on arth believe that one color to have been just that which has fallen to the luck of each particlar shade hang me if i should like to be persuaded out of my color any more than these injins in america color goes for a great deal and it may count for as much with an injin as among us whites no no parson you should have begun with persuading these savages into the notion that theyre jews if you could get along with that the rest might be all the easier  you speak of the jews not as if you considered them a chosen people of the lord but as a despised and hateful race this is not right bourdon i know that christians are thus apt to regard them but it does not tell well for their charity or their knowledge  i know very little about them parson amen not being certain of ever having seen a jew in my life still i will own that i have a sort of grudge against them though i can hardly tell you why of one thing i feel certainno man breathing should ever persuade me into the notion that im a jew lost or found ten tribes or twenty what say you corporal to this idea  just as you say bourdon jews turks and infidels i despise so was i brought up and so i shall remain  can either of you tell me why you look in this uncharitable light on so many of your fellowcreatures it cannot be christianity for such are not its teachings or feelings nor is either of you very remarkable for his observance of the laws of god as they have been revealed to christian people my heart yearns toward these injins who are infidels instead of entertaining any of the feelings that the corporal has just expressed  i wish there were fewer of them and that them few were farther from castle meal put in le bourdon with point i have known all along that peter meant to have a great council but will own now that i have seen something of it i do not find it quite as much to my mind as i had expected it would be  theres a strong force on em said the corporal and a hard set be they to look at when a mans a young soldier all this paint and shaving of heads and rings in noses and ears makes some impression but a campaign or two agin the fellows soon brings all down to one color and one uniform if their naked hides can be so called i told em off bourdon and reconnitred em pretty well while they was a making speeches and in my judgment we can hold good the garrison agin em all if so be we do not run short of water provisions and water is what a body may call fundamentals in a siege  i hope we shall have no need of forcenay i feel persuaded there will not be said parson amen peter is our friend and his command over these savages is wonderful never before have i seen red men so completely under the control of a chief your men at fort dearborn corporal were scarcely more under the orders of their officers than these redskins are under the orders of this chief  i will not go to compare riglars with injins mr parson answered the corporal a little stiffly they be not of the same natur at all and ought not to be put on a footing in any particular these savages may obey their orders after a fashion of their own but i should like to see them manoeuvre under fire ive fit injins fourteen times in my day and have never seen a decent line or a good honest manly standup charge made by the best among em in any field far or near trees and covers is necessary to their constitutions just as sartain as a deer chased will take to water to throw off the scent put em up with the baggonet and theyll not stand a minute  how should they corporal interrupted le bourdon laughing when theyve no baggonets of their own to make a stand with you put one in mind of what my father used to say he was a soldier in revolution times and sarved his seven years with washington the english used to boast that the americans wouldnt stand up to the rack if the baggonet was set to work but this was before we got our own toothpicks said the old man as soon as they gave us baggonets too there was no want of standing up to the work it seems to me corporal you overlook the fact that injins carry no baggonets  every army uses its own weapons if an injin prefers his knife and his tomahawk to a baggonet it is no affair of mine i speak of a charge as i see it and the soldier who relies on a tomahawk instead of a baggonet should stand in his tracks and give tomahawk play no no bourdon seeing is believing these redskins can do nothing with our people when our people is properly regimented well officered and thoroughly drilled theyre skeary to new beginners that i must acknowledgebut beyond that i set them down as nothing remarkable as military men  good or bad i wish there were fewer of them and that they were farther off this man peter is a mystery to me sometimes he seems quite friendly then agin he appears just ready to take all our scalps do you know much of his past history mr amen  not as much as i wish i did the missionary replied no one can tell me aught concerning peter beyond the fact of his being a sort of a prophet and a chief of commanding influence even his tribe is unknown a circumstance that points us to the ancient history of the jews for the explanation it is my own opinion that peter is of the race of aaron and that he is designed by divine providence to play an important part in the great events on which we touch all that is wanting is to persuade him into this belief himself once persuade a man that he is intended to be something and your work is half done to your hands but the world is so full of illdigested and random theories that truth has as much as it can do to obtain a sober and patient hearing  thus is it with poor human nature let a man get a crotchet into his headhowever improbable it may be however little supported by reason or fact however ridiculous indeedand he becomes indisposed to receive any evidence but that which favors his theory to see any truths but such as he fancies will harmonize with his truths or to allow of any disturbing causes in the great workings of his particular philosophy this notion of parson amens concerning the origin of the north american savage did not originate with that simpleminded enthusiast by any means in this way are notions formed and nurtured the missionary had read somewhat concerning the probability that the american indians were the lost tribes of israel and possessed with the idea everything he saw was tortured into evidence in support of his theory there is just as much reason for supposing that any and all of the heathen savages that are scattered up and down the earth have this origin as to ascribe it to our immediate tribes but to this truth the good parson was indifferent simply because it did not come within the circle of his particular belief  thus too was it with the corporal unless courage and other military qualities were manifested precisely in the way in which he had been trained they were not courage and military qualities at all every virtue has its especial and conventional accessories according to this school of morals nothing of the sort remaining as it came from above in the simple abstract qualities of right and wrong on such feelings and principles as these do men get to be dogmatical narrowminded and conceited  our three white men pursued their way back to the garrison conversing as they went much in the manner they did in the dialogue we have just recorded neither parson amen nor the corporal seemed to apprehend anything notwithstanding the extraordinary scene in which one had been an actor and of which the other had been a witness their wonder and apprehensions no doubt were much mitigated by the fact that it was understood peter was to meet a large collection of the chiefs in the openings and the minds of all were more or less prepared to see some such assemblage as had that night got together the free manner in which the mysterious chief led the missionary to the circle was of itself some proof that he did not desire concealment and even le bourdon admitted when they came to discuss the details that this was a circumstance that told materially in favor of the friendliness of his intentions still the beehunter had his doubts and most sincerely did he wish that all in castle meal blossom in particular were safe within the limits of civilized settlements  on reaching the garrison all was safe whiskey centre watched the gatea sober man now perforce if not by inclination for being in the openings in this respect is like being at sea with an empty spiritroom he was aware that several had passed out but was surprised to learn that peter was of the number that gate peter had not passed of a certainty and how else he could quit the palisades was not easily understood it was possible to climb over them it is true but the feat would be attended with so great an exertion and would be so likely to lead to a noise which would expose the effort that all had great difficulty in believing a man so dignified and reserved in manner as this mysterious chief would be apt to resort to such means of quitting the place  as for the chippewa gershom reported his return a few minutes before and the beehunter entered to look for that tried friend as soon as he learned the fact he found pigeonswing laying aside his accoutrements previously to lying down to take his rest  so chippewa you have come back have you exclaimed le bourdon so many of your redskin brethren are about that i didnt expect to see you again for these two or three days  no want to eat den eh how you all eat if hunter dont do he duty spose squaw dont cook vittles you no like it eh juss so wid hunterno kill vittles dont like it nudder  this is true enough still so many of your people are about just now that i thought it probable you might wish to remain outside with them for a day or two  how know red man about eh you see himyou count him eh  i have seen something like fifty and may say i counted that many they were chiefs however and i take it for granted a goodly number of common warriors are not far off am i right pigeonswing  spose dont knowden cant tell only tell what he know  sometimes an injin guesses and comes as near the truth as a white man who has seen the thing with his own pigeonswing made no answer though le bourdon fancied from his manner that he had really something on his mind and that too of importance which he wished to communicate  i think you might tell me some news that i should like to hear chippewa if you was so minded  why you stay here eh demanded the indian abruptly got plenty honeybess go home now always bess go home when hunt up home good place when hunter well tired  my home is here in the openings pigeonswing when i go into the settlements i do little but loaf about among the farmhouses on the detroit river having neither squaw nor wigwam of my own to go to i like this place well enough if your red brethren will let me keep it in peace  dis bad place for paleface juss now better go home dan stay in openin if dont know short path to detroit i show you bess go soon as can and bess go alone no good to be trouble wid squaw when in hurry  the countenance of le bourdon changed at this last intimation though the indian might not have observed it in the darkness after a brief pause the first answered in a very determined way  i believe i understand you chippewa he said i shall do nothing of the sort however if the squaws cant go too i shall not quit them would you desert your squaws because you thought them in trouble  ant your squaw yet bess not have squaw at all when openin so full of injin where you tink is two buck i shoot dis mornin eh skin em cut em up hang em on tree where wolf cant get em well go on after anudder kill him too dere he is inside of palisade but no tudder two he bot gone when i get back to tree two good buck as ever see how you like dat eh  i care very little about it since we have food enough and are not likely to want so the wolves got your venison from the trees after all your care ha pigeonswing  wolf dont touch himwolf cant touch him moccasin been under tree see him mark bess do as i tell you go home soon as ever can short path to detroit ant two hundred paleface mile  i see how it is pigeonswing i see how it is and thank you for this hint while i honor your good faith to your own people but i cannot go to detroit in the first place for that town and fort have fallen into the hands of the british it might be possible for a canoe to get past in the night and to work its way through into lake erie but i cannot quit my friends if you can put us all in the way of getting away from this spot i shall be ready to enter into the scheme why cant we all get into the canoe and go down stream as soon as another night sets in before morning we could be twenty miles on our road  no do any good returned pigeonswing coldly if cant go alone cant go at all squaw no keep up when so many be on trail no good to try canoe catch you in two dayspraps one well i go to sleepcant keep eye open all night  hereupon pigeonswing coolly repaired to his skins lay down and was soon fast asleep the beehunter was fain to do the same the night being now far advanced but he lay awake a long time thinking of the hint he had received and pondering on the nature of the danger which menaced the security of the family at length sleep asserted its power over even him and the place lay in the deep stillness of night     chapter xix       and stretching out on either hand      oer all that wide and unshorn land      till weary of its gorgeousness      the aching and the dazzled eye      rests gladdened on the calm blue sky                                          whittier   no other disturbance occurred in the course of the night with the dawn le bourdon was again stirring and as he left the palisades to repair to the run in order to make his ablutions he saw peter returning to castle meal the two met but no allusion was made to the manner in which the night had passed the chief paid his salutations courteously and instead of repairing to his skins he joined le bourdon seemingly as little inclined to seek for rest as if just arisen from his lair when the beehunter left the spring this mysterious indian for the first time spoke of business  my brother wanted today to show injin how to find honey said peter as he and bourdon walked toward the palisades within which the whole family was now moving i nebber see honey find myself ole as i be  i shall be very willing to teach your chiefs my craft answered the beehunter and this so much the more readily because i do not expect to practyse it much longer myself not in this part of the country at least  how dat happenexpec go away soon demanded peter whose keen restless eye would at one instant seem to read his companions soul and then would glance off to some distant object as if conscious of its own startling and fiery expression now brish got detroit where my broder go bess stay here i tink  i shall not be in a hurry peter but my season will soon be up and i must get ahead of the bad weather you know or a bark canoe will have but a poor time of it on lake huron when am i to meet the chiefs to give them a lesson in finding bees  tell byemby no hurry for dat want to sleep fuss see so much better when i open eye so you tink of makin journey on long path if cant go to detroit where can go to  my proper home is in pennsylvania on the other side of lake erie it is a long path and im not certain of getting safely over it in these troubled times perhaps it would be best for me however to shape at once for ohio if in that state i might find my way round the end of erie and so go the whole distance by land  the beehunter said this by way of throwing dust into the indians eyes for he had not the least intention of travelling in the direction named it is true it was his most direct course and the one that prudence would point out to him under all the circumstances had he been alone but le bourdon was no longer alonein heart and feelings at least margery now mingled with all his views for the future and he could no more think of abandoning her in her present situation than he could of offering his own person to the savages for a sacrifice it was idle to think of attempting such a journey in company with the females and most of all to attempt it in defiance of the ingenuity perseverance and hostility of the indians the trail could not be concealed and as for speed a party of the young men of the wilderness would certainly travel two miles to margerys one  le bourdon notwithstanding pigeonswings remonstrances still had his eye on the kalamazoo he remembered the saying that water leaves no trail and was not without hopes of reaching the lake again where he felt he should be in comparative security his own canoe as well as that of gershom being large well fitted and not altogether unsuited to those waters in the summer months as it would be of the last importance however to get several hours start of the indians in the event of his having recourse to such a mode of flight it was of the utmost importance also to conceal his intentions and if possible to induce peter to imagine his eyes were turned in another direction  well spose go dat way answered the chief quietly as if suspecting no artifice set bout him byemby today muss teach injin how to find honey dat make him good friend and maybe he help my paleface broders back to deir country been better for ebbery body if none come here at all  thus ended the discourse for that moment peter was not fond of much talking when he had not his great object in view but rather kept his mind occupied in observation for the next hour every one in and about castle meal was engaged in the usual morning avocations that of breaking their fasts included and then it was understood that all were to go forth to meet the chiefs that le bourdon might give a specimen of his craft  one ignorant of the state of political affairs on the american continent and who was not aware of the vicinity of savages would have seen nothing that morning as the party proceeded on its little excursion in and around that remote spot but a picture of rural tranquillity and peace a brighter day never poured its glories on the face of the earth and the openings and the glades and even the dark and denser forests were all bathed in the sunlight as that orb is known to illuminate objects in the softer season of the year and in the fortythird degree of latitude even the birds appeared to rejoice in the beauties of the time and sang and fluttered among the oaks in numbers greater than common nature usually observes a stern fitness in her adaptation of means to ends birds are to be found in the forests on the prairies and in the still untenanted openings of the westand often in countless numbers more especially those birds which fly in flocks and love the security of unoccupied regionsunoccupied by man is meant wherein to build their nests obey the laws of their instincts and fulfil their destinies thus myriads of pigeons and ducks and geese etc are to be found in the virgin woods while the companionable and friendly robin the little melodious wren the thrush the lark the swallow the marten and all those pleasant little winged creatures that flit about our dwellings and grounds and seem to be sent by providence expressly to chant their morning and evening hymns to god in our ears most frequent the peopled districts it has been said by europeans that the american birds are mute in comparison with those of the old world this is true to a certain extent as respects those which are properly called forest birds which do in general appear to partake of the sombre character that marks the solemn stillness of their native haunts it is not true however with the birds which live in our fields and grounds and orchards each of which sings its song of praise and repeats its calls and its notes as richly and as pleasantly to the ear as the birds of other lands one large class indeed possesses a faculty that enables it to repeat every note it has ever heard even to some of the sounds of quadrupeds nor is this done in the discordant tones of the parrot but in octaves and trills and in rich contraaltos and all the other pleasing intonations known to the most gifted of the feathered race thus it is that one american mockingbird can outsing all the birds of europe united  it seemed that morning as if every bird that was accustomed to glean its food from the neighborhood of castle meal was on the wing and ready to accompany the party that now sallied forth to catch the bee this party consisted of le bourdon himself as its chief and leader of peter the missionary and the corporal margery too went along for as yet she had never seen an exhibition of bodens peculiar skill as for gershom and his wife they remained behind to make ready the noontide meal while the chippewa took his accoutrements and again sallied out on a hunt the whole time of this indian appeared to be thus taken up though in truth venison and bears meat both abounded and there was much less necessity for those constant efforts than he wished to make it appear in good sooth more than half his time was spent in making those observations which had led to the advice he had been urging on his friend the beehunter in order to induce him to fly had pigeonswing better understood peter and had he possessed a clearer insight into the extent and magnitude of his plans of retributive vengeance it is not probable his uneasiness at the moment would have been so great or the urgency for an immediate decision on the part of le bourdon would have appeared as urgently pressing as it now seemed to be  the beehunter took his way to a spot that was at some distance from his habitation a small prairie of circular form that is now generally known in that region of the country by the name of prairie round three hours were necessary to reach it and this so much the more because margerys shorter steps were to be considered margery however was no laggard on a path young active light of foot and trained in exertions of this nature her presence did not probably retard the arrival many minutes  the extraordinary part of the proceedings was the circumstance that the beehunter did not tell any one whither he was going and that peter did not appear to care about putting the question to him notwithstanding this reserve on one side and seeming indifference on the other when the party reached prairie round every one of the chiefs who had been present at the council of the previous night was there before it the indians were straggling about but remained sufficiently near the point where the beehunter and his followers reached the prairie to assemble around the group in a very few minutes after it made its appearance  all this struck le bourdon as fearfully singular since it proved how many secret means of communication existed between the savages that the inmates of the habitations were closely observed and all their proceedings noted he could not but suspect even before receiving this proof of peters power but he was not aware until now how completely he and all with him were at the mercy of these formidable foes what hope could there be for escape when hundreds of eyes were thus watching their movements and every thicket had its vigilant and sagacious sentinel yet must flight be attempted in some way or other or margery and her sister would be hopelessly lostto say nothing of himself and the three other men  but the appearance of the remarkable little prairie that he had just reached and the collection of chiefs now occupied all the present thoughts of le bourdon as for the first it is held in repute even at the present hour as a place that the traveller should see though covered with farms and the buildings that belong to husbandry it is still visited as a picture of ancient civilization placed in the setting of a new country it is true that very little of this part of michigan wears much if any of that aspect of a rough beginning including stubs stumps and circled trees that it has so often fallen to our share to describe there are dense forests and those of considerable extent and wherever the axe is put into them the progress of improvement is marked by the same steps as elsewhere but the lovely openings form so many exceptions as almost to compose the rule  on prairie round there was even a higher stamp of seeming civilizationseeming since it was nature after all that had mainly drawn the picture in the first place the spot had been burnt so recently as to leave the entire expanse covered with young grasses and flowers the same as if it were a wellkept park this feature at that advanced period of the summer was in some degree accidental the burning of the prairies depending more or less on contingencies of that sort we have now less to do with the cause than with its consequences these were most agreeable to the eye as well as comfortable to the foot the grass nowhere being of a height to impede movement or what was of still more importance to le bourdons present pursuit to overshadow the flowers aware of this fact he had led his companions all that distance to reach this scene of remarkable rural beauty in order that he might make a grand display of his art in presence of the assembled chiefs of that region the beehunter had pride in his craft the same as any other skilful workman who had gained a reputation by his cunning and he now trod the prairie with a firmer step and a more kindling eye than was his wont in the commoner haunts of his calling men were there whom it might be an honor to surprise and pretty margery was there also she who had so long desired to see this very exhibition  but to revert once more to the prairie ere we commence the narrative of what occurred on it this wellknown area is of no great extent possessing a surface about equal to that of one of the larger parks of europe its name was derived from its form which without being absolutely regular had so near an approach to a circle as to justify the use of the appellation the face of this charming field was neither waving or what is called rolling nor a dead flat as often occurs with river bottoms it had just enough of undulation to prevent too much moisture and to impart an agreeable variety to its plain as a whole it was clear of the forest quite as much so as if the axe had done its work there a thousand years before though wood was not wanting on the contrary enough of the last was to be seen in addition to that which formed the frame of this charming landscape to relieve the view from all appearance of monotony and to break it up into copses thickets trees in small clusters and in most of the varieties that embellish native scenery one who had been unexpectedly transferred to the spot might well have imagined that he was looking on the site of some old and longestablished settlement from which every appliance of human industry had been suddenly and simultaneously abstracted of houses outbuildings fences stacks and husbandry there were no signs unless the even and verdant sward that was spread like a vast carpet sprinkled with flowers could have been deemed a sign of the last there were the glades vistas irregular lawns and woods shaped with the pleasing outlines of the free hand of nature as if consummate art had been endeavoring to imitate our great mistress in one of her most graceful moods  the indians present served largely to embellish this scene of late years horses have become so common among the western tribes the vast natural meadows of those regions furnishing the means necessary to keep them that one can now hardly form a picture of those savages without representing them mounted and wielding the spear but such was not the fact with the time of which we are writing nor was it ever the general practice to go mounted among the indians in the immediate vicinity of the great lakes not a hoof of any sort was now visible with the exception of those which belonged to a herd of deer that were grazing on a favorite spot less than a league distant from the place where le bourdon and his companions reached the prairie all the chiefs were on foot and very few were equipped with more than the knife and tomahawk the sidearms of a chief the rifles having been secreted as it might be in deference to the festivities and peaceful character of the occasion as le bourdons party was duly provided with rifles the missionary and margery excepted this was a sign that no violence was contemplated on that occasion at least contemplated however is a word very expressive when used in connection with the outbreakings of human passions as they are wont to exhibit themselves among the ignorant and excited it matters not whether the scene be the capital of some ancient european monarchy or the wilds of america the workings of such impulses are much the same now a throne is overturned perhaps before they who do it are yet fully aware of what they ought to set up in its place and now the deadly rifle or the murderous tomahawk is used more in obedience to the incentives of demons than in furtherance of justly recognized rules of conduct le bourdon was aware of all this and did not so far confide in appearances as to overlook the watchfulness that he deemed indispensable  the beehunter was not long in selecting a place to set up his apparatus in this particular he was mainly governed by a lovely expanse of sweetscented flowers among which bees in thousands were humming sipping of their precious gifts at will le bourdon had a care also not to go far from the forests which encircled the prairies for among its trees he knew he had to seek the habitations of the insects instead of a stump or a fallen tree he had prepared a light framework of lath which the corporal bore to the field for him and on which he placed his different implements as soon as he had selected the scene of operations  it will not be necessary for us to repeat the process which has already been described in our opening chapters but we shall only touch such parts of it as have a direct connection with the events of the legend as le bourdon commenced his preparations however the circle of chiefs closed around him in mute but close attention to everything that passed although every one of them had heard of the beehunters of the palefaces and most of them had heard of this particular individual of their number not an indian present had ever seen one of these men practise his craft this may seem strange as respects those who so much roamed the woods but we have already remarked that it exceeded the knowledge of the red man to make the calculations that are necessary to take the bee by the process described usually when he obtains honey it is the result of some chance meeting in the forest and not the fruits of that farsighted and persevering industry which enables the white man to lay in a store large enough to supply a neighborhood in the course of a few weeks hunting  never was a juggler watched with closer attention than was le bourdon while setting up his stand and spreading his implements every grave dark countenance was turned toward him and each keen glistening eye was riveted on his movements as the vessel with the comb was set down the chiefs nearest recognizing the substance murmured their admiration for to them it seemed as if the operator were about to make honey with honey then the glass was a subject of surprise for half of those present had never seen such an utensil before though many of the chiefs present had visited the garrisons of the northwest both american and english many had not and of those who had not one in ten got any clear idea of the commonest appliances of civilized life thus it was then that almost every article used by the beehunter though so simple and homely was the subject of a secret but wellsuppressed admiration  it was not long ere le bourdon was ready to look for his bee the insects were numerous on the flowers particularly on the white clover which is indigenous in america springing up spontaneously wherever grasses are permitted to grow the great abundance of the bees however had its usual effect and our hero was a little difficult to please at length a fine and already halfloaded little animal was covered by the glass and captured this was done so near the group of indians that each and all noted the process it was curious and it was inexplicable could the palefaces compel bees to reveal the secret of their hives and was that encroaching race about to drive all the insects from the woods and seize their honey as they drove the indians before them and seized their lands such was the character of the thoughts that passed through the minds of more than one chief that morning though all looked on in profound stillness  when the imprisoned bee was put over the comb and le bourdons cap was placed above all these simpleminded children of the woods and the prairies gazed as if expecting a hive to appear beneath the covering whenever the latter should be removed it was not long before the bee settled and not only the cap but the tumbler was taken away for the first time since the exhibition commenced le bourdon spoke addressing himself to peter  if the tribeless chief will look sharply he said he will soon see the bee take flight it is filling itself with honey and the moment it is loadedlooklookit is about to risethere it is upsee it circling around the stand as if to take a look that it may know it againthere it goes  there it did go of a truth and in a regular beeline or as straight as an arrow of all that crowd the beehunter and margery alone saw the insect in its flight most of those present lost sight of it while circling around the stand but the instant it darted away to the remainder it seemed to vanish into air not so with le bourdon and margery however the former saw it from habit the latter from a quick eye intense attention and the wish not to miss anything that le bourdon saw fit to do for her information or amusement the animal flew in an airline toward a point of wood distant fully half a mile and on the margin of the prairie  many low exclamations arose among the savages the bee was gone but whither they knew not or on what errand could it have been sent on a message by the paleface or had it flown off to give the alarm to its companions in order to adopt the means of disappointing the beehunter as for the last he went coolly to work to choose another insect and he soon had three at work on the comball in company and all uncovered had the number anything to do with the charm or were these three to be sent to bring back the one that had already gone away such was the sort of reasoning and such the queries put to themselves by several of the stern children of nature who were drawn up around the stand  in the mean time le bourdon proceeded with his operations in the utmost simplicity he now called peter and bears meat and crowsfeather nearer to his person where they might share with margery the advantage of more closely seeing all that passed as soon as these three chiefs were near enough ben pointed to one bee in particular saying in the indian dialect  my brothers see that bee in the centrehe is about to go away if he go after the one that went before him i shall soon know where to look for honey  how can my brother tell which bee will first fly away demanded bears meat  the beehunter was able to foresee this by knowing which insect had been longest on the comb but so practised had his eye become that he knew with tolerable accuracy by the movements of the creatures those that had filled themselves with honey from those that had not as it did not suit his purpose however to let all the minutiae of his craft be known his answer was evasive just at that moment a thought occurred to him which it might be well to carry out in full he had once saved his life by necromancy or what seemed to the simple children of the woods to be necromancy and why might he not turn the cunning of his regular art to account and render it the means of rescuing the females as well as himself from the hands of their captors this sudden impulse from that moment controlled his conduct and his mind was constantly casting about for the means of effecting what was now his one great purpose escape instead of uttering in reply to bears meats question the simple truth therefore he rather sought for such an answer as might make the process in which he was engaged appear imposing and mystical  how do the injins know the path of the deer he asked by way of reply they look at the deer get to know him and understand his ways this middle bee will soon fly  which way will he go asked peter can my brother tell us that  to his hive returned le bourdon carelessly as if he did not fully understand the question all of them go to their hives unless i tell them to go in another direction see the bee is up  the chiefs now looked with all their eyes they saw indeed that the bee was making its circles above the stand presently they lost sight of the insect which to them seemed to vanish though le bourdon distinctly traced its flight for a hundred yards it took a direction at right angles to that of the first bee flying off into the prairie and shaping its course toward an island of wood which might have been of three or four acres in extent and distant rather less than a mile  while le bourdon was noting this flight another bee arose this creature flew toward the point of forest already mentioned as the destination of the insect that had first risen no sooner was this third little animal out of sight than the fourth was up humming around the stand ben pointed it out to the chiefs and this time they succeeded in tracing the flight for perhaps a hundred feet from the spot where they stood instead of following either of its companions this fourth bee took a course which led it off the prairie altogether and toward the habitations  the suddenly conceived purpose of le bourdon to attempt to mystify the savages and thus get a hold upon their minds which he might turn to advantage was much aided by the different directions taken by these several bees had they all gone the same way the conclusion that all went home would be so very natural and obvious as to deprive the discovery of a hive of any supernatural merit at least and to establish this was just now the great object the bee hunter had in view as it was the indians were no wiser now all the bees were gone than they had been before one of them had flown on the contrary they could not understand how the flights of so many insects in so many different directions should tell the bee hunter where honey was to be found le bourdon saw that the prairie was covered with bees and well knew that such being the fact the inmates of perhaps a hundred different hives must be present all this however was too novel and too complicated for the calculations of savages and not one of those who crowded near as observers could account for so many of the bees going different ways  le bourdon now intimated a wish to change his ground he had noted two of the bees and the only question that remained to be decided as it respected them was whether they belonged to the precise points toward which they had flown or to points beyond them the reader will easily understand that this is the nature of the fact determined by taking an angle the point of intersection between any two of the lines of flight being necessarily the spot where the hive is to be found so far from explaining this to those around him however boden kept it a secret in his own breast margery knew the whole process for to her he had often gone over it in description finding a pleasure in instructing one so apt and whose tender liquid blue eyes seemed to reflect every movement of his own soul and feelings margery he could have taught forever or fancied for the moment he could which is as near the truth as men under the influence of love often get but as for the indians so far from letting them into any of his secrets his strong desire was now to throw dust into their eyes in all possible ways and to make their wellestablished character for superstition subservient to his own projects  boden was far from being a scholar even for one in his class in life down to this hour the neglect of the means of public instruction is somewhat of a just ground of reproach against the venerable and respectable commonwealth of which he was properly a member though her people have escaped a knowledge of a great deal of small philosophy and low intriguing which it is fair to presume that evil spirits thrust in among the leaves of a more legitimate information when the book of knowledge is opened for the instruction of those who by circumstances are prevented from doing more than bestowing a few hurried glances at its contents still ben had read everything about bees on which he could lay his hands he had studied their habits personally and he had pondered over the various accounts of their communitiesa sort of limited monarchy in which the prince is deposed occasionally or when matters go very wrongsome written by really very observant and intelligent persons and others again not a little fanciful among other books that had thus fallen in le bourdons way was one which somewhat minutely described the uses that were made of bees by the ancient soothsayers in their divinations our hero had no notion of reviving those rites or of attempting to imitate the particular practices of which he had read and heard but the recollection of them occurred most opportunely to strengthen and encourage the design so suddenly entertained of making his present operation aid in opening the way to the one great thing of the houran escape into lake michigan  a bee knows a great deal said le bourdon to his nearest companions while the whole party was moving some distance to take up new ground a bee often knows more than a man  more than paleface demanded bears meat a chief who had attained his authority more by means of physical than of intellectual qualities  sometimes palefaces have gone to bees to ask what will happen let me ask our medicineman this question parson amen have you any knowledge of the soothsayers of old using bees when they wished to know what was about to happen  now the missionary was not a learned man any more than the bee hunter but many an unlearned man has heard of this and he happened to be one of the number of virgil for instance parson amen knew but little though in the progress of a very loose but industrious course of reading he had learned that the soothsayers put great faith in bees his answer was given in conformity with this fact and in the most perfect good faith for he had not the smallest suspicion of what boden wished to establish  certainlymost certainly answered the wellmeaning missionary the fortunetellers of old times often went to their bees when they wished to look into the future it has been a subject much talked of among christians to account for the soothsaying and witchcraft and other supernatural dealings of those who lived in the times of the prophets and most of them have held the opinion that evil spirits have beennay still are permitted to work their will on certain men in the flesh but bees were in much favor with the soothsayers of old  this answer was given in english and little of it was comprehended by peter and the others who had more or less knowledge of that language beyond the part which asserted the agency of bees in witchcraft luckily this was all le bourdon desired and he was well satisfied at seeing that the idea passed from one chief to another those who did not know the english at all being told by those who had some knowledge of the tongue that bees were thought to be medicine among the palefaces  le bourdon gained a great deal of ground by this fortunate corroboration of his own still more fortunate thought matters were pretty nearly desperate with him and with all his friends should peter really meditate evil and as desperate diseases notoriously require remedies of the same character he was ready to attempt anything that promised even the smallest chance of success  yes yes the beehunter pursued the discourse by sayingbees know a great deal i have sometimes thought that bees know more than bears and my brother must be able to tell something of them  yes my name is bears meat answered that chief complacently injin always give name that mean someting kill so many bear one winter got dat name  a good name it is to kill a bear is the most honorable thing a hunter can do as we all know if my brother wishes to hear it i will ask my bees when he is to kill another  the savage to whom this was addressed fairly started with delight he was eagerly signifying his cheerful assent to the proposal when peter quietly interposed and changed the discourse to himself in a way that he had and which would not easily admit of denial it was apparent to le bourdon that this mysterious indian was not content that one so direct and impetuous in his feelings as bears meat and who was at the same time so little qualified to manage his portion of an intellectual conversation should be foremost any longer for that reason he brought himself more into the foreground leaving to his friend the capacity of listener and observer rather than that of a speaker and actor what took place under this new arrangement will appear as the narrative proceeds     chapter xx       therefore go with me      ill give the fairies to attend on thee      and they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep      peasblossom cobweb moth and mustardseed                                     midsummernights dream   as le bourdon kept moving across the prairie while the remarks were made that have been recorded in the preceding chapter he soon reached the new position where he intended to again set up his stand here he renewed his operations peter keeping nearest his person in jealous watchfulness of the least movement he made bees were caught and scarce a minute elapsed ere the beehunter had two of them on the piece of comb uncovered and at liberty the circumstance that the cap was momentarily placed over the insects struck the savages as a piece of necromancy in particular the reader will understand that this is done in order to darken the tumbler and induce the bee to settle down on the honey so much the sooner to one who understood the operation and its reason the whole was simple enough but it was a very different matter with men as little accustomed to prying into the habits of creatures as insignificant as bees had deer or bisons or bears or any of the quadrupeds of those regions been the subject of the experiment it is highly probable that individuals could have been found in that attentive and wondering crowd who could have enlightened the ablest naturalists on the subject of the animals under examination but when the inquiry descended to the bee it went below the wants and usages of savage life  where you tink dis bee go demanded peter in english as soon as le bourdon raised the tumbler  one will go in this direction the other in that answered the beehunter pointing first toward the corner of the woods then toward the island in the prairiethe two points toward which two of the other bees had flown  the predictions might or might not prove true if they did the effect must be great if they did not the failure would soon be forgotten in matters of more interest our hero therefore risked but little while he had the chance of gaining a very great advantage by a fortunate coincidence the result completely justified the prediction a bee rose made its circles around the stand and away it went toward the islandlike copse in the prairie while its companion soon imitated its example but taking the other prescribed direction this time peter watched the insects so closely that he was a witness of their movements and with his own eyes he beheld the flight as well as the direction taken by each  you tell bee do dis demanded peter with a surprise that was so sudden as well as so great that it overcame in some slight degree his habitual selfcommand  to be sure i did replied le bourdon carelessly if you wish to see another you may  here the young man coolly took another bee and put it on the comb indifferent as he appeared however he used what was perhaps the highest degree of his art in selecting this insect it was taken from the bunch of flowers whence one of his former captives had been taken and there was every chance of its belonging to the same hive as its companion which direction it might take should it prove to be a bee from either of the two hives of which the positions were now known it altogether exceeded bodens art to tell so he dexterously avoided committing himself it was enough that peter gazed attentively and that he saw the insect dart away disappearing in the direction of the island by this time more of the savages were on the alert and now knowing how and where to look for the bee they also saw its course  you tell him agin go dere asked peter whose interest by this time was so manifest as to defy all attempts at concealment  to be sure i did the bees obey me as your young men obey you i am their chief and they know me i will give you further proof of this we will now go to that little bit of wood when you shall all see what it contains i have sent three of my bees there and here one of them is already back to let me know what he has seen  sure enough a bee was buzzing around the head of le bourdon probably attracted by some fragment of comb and he cunningly converted it into a messenger from the copse all this was wonderful to the crowd and it even greatly troubled peter this man was much less liable to the influence of superstition than most of his people but he was very far from being altogether above it this is the fact with very few civilized men perhaps with no man whatever let his philosophy and knowledge be what they may and least of all is it true with the ignorant there is too much of the uncertain of the conjectural in our condition as human beings to raise us altogether above the distrusts doubts wonder and other weaknesses of our present condition to these simple savages the manner in which the bees flew seemingly at le bourdons bidding to this or that thicket was quite as much a matter of astonishment as any of our most elaborate deceptions are wonders to our own ignorant and vulgar ignorant and where is the line to be drawn that is to place men beyond the pale of ignorance each of us fails in some one if not in very many of the important branches of the knowledge that is even reduced to rules among us here is seen the man of books so ignorant of the application of his own beloved theories as to be a mere child in practice and there again can be seen the expert in practice who is totally unacquainted with a single principle of the many that lie at the root of his very handicraft let us not then deride these poor children of the forest because that which was so entirely new to them should also appear inexplicable and supernatural  as for peter he was more confounded than convinced his mind was so much superior to those of the other chiefs as to render him far more difficult to mislead though even he was not exempt from the great weaknesses of ignorance superstition and its concomitants credulity and a love of the marvellous his mind was troubled as was quite apparent to ben who watched him quite as narrowly as he was observed himself in all he did willing to deepen the impression our artist now determined to exhibit some of the higher fruits of his skill the production of a considerable quantity of honey would of itself be a sort of peaceoffering and he now prepared to turn the certainty of there being a hive in the little wood to accountcertainty because three bees had taken wing for it and a very distinct angle had been made with two of them  does my brother wish any honey asked le bourdon carelessly or shall i send a bee across lake michigan to tell the injins further west that detroit is taken  can bourdon find honey now demanded peter  easily several hives are within a mile of us the bees like this prairie which is so well garnished with flowers and i am never at a loss for work in this neighborhood this is my favorite bee ground and i have got all the little creatures so that they know me and are ready to do everything that i tell them as i see that the chiefs love honey and wish to eat some we will now go to one of my hives  thus saying le bourdon prepared for another march he moved with all his appliances margery keeping close at his side carrying the honeycomb and honey as the girl walked lightly in advance of the indians some fifteen or twenty bees attracted by the flavor of what she carried kept circling around her head and consequently around that of boden and peter did not fail to observe the circumstance to him it appeared as if these bees were so many accompanying agents who attended their master in order to do his bidding in a word peter was fast getting into that frame of mind when all that is seen is pressed into the support of the theory we have adopted the beehunter had some mysterious connection with and control over the bees and this was one among the many other signs of the existence of his power all this however boden himself disregarded his mind was bent on throwing dust into the eyes of the indians and he was cogitating the means of so doing on a much larger scale than any yet attempted  why dem bee fly round young squaw demanded peterand fly round you too  they know us and go with us to their hive just as injins would come out of their villages to meet and honor visitors  this was a ready reply but it scarcely satisfied the wily savage to whom it was given just then crowsfeather led peter a little aside and began talking earnestly to that chief both continuing on with the crowd le bourdon felt persuaded that the subject of this private conference was some of his own former backslidings in the character of conjuror and that the pottawattamie would not deal very tenderly with his character nevertheless it was too late to retrace his steps and he saw the necessity of going on  i wish you had not come out with us the beehunter found an occasion to say to margery i do not half like the state of things and this conjuration about the bees may all fall through  it is better that i should be here bourdon returned the spirited girl my being here may make them less unfriendly to you when i am by peter always seems more human and less of a savage they all tell me than when i am not by  no one can be more willing to own your power margery than i but injins hold the squaws too cheap to give you much influence over this old fellow  you do not knowhe may have had a daughter of about my age or size or appearance or with my laugh or voice or something else that reminds him of her when he sees me one thing i am sure of peter is no enemy of mine  i hope this may prove to be true i do not see after all why an injin should not have the feelins you name he is a man and must feel for his wife and children the same as other  bourdon what ails the dog look at the manner in which hive is behaving  sure enough the appearance of hive was sufficiently obvious to attract his masters attention by this time the crowd had got within twenty rods of the little islandlike copse of wood the mastiff being nearly half that distance in advance instead of preceding the party however hive had raised his form in a menacing manner and moved cautiously from side to side like one of his kind that scents a foe there was no mistaking these movements and all the principal chiefs soon had their attention also drawn to the behavior of the dog  why he do so asked peter he fraid of bee eh  he waits for me to come up answered le bourdon let my brother and two other chiefs come with me and let the rest stay here bees do not like crowds corporal i put margery in your keeping and parson amen will be near you i now go to show these chiefs what a bee can tell a man  thus saying le bourdon advanced followed by peter bears meat and crowsfeather our hero had made up his mind that something more than bees were to be found in the thicket for the place being a little marshy bushes as well as trees were growing on it and he fully expected a rencontre with bears the creatures most disposed to prey on the labors of the beeman excepted being well armed and accompanied by men accustomed to such struggles he had no apprehensions and led the way boldly feeling the necessity of manifesting perfect confidence in all his own acts in order to command the respect of the observers as soon as the beehunter passed the dog the latter growled showed his teeth fiercely and followed keeping closely at his side the confidence and alacrity with which le bourdon moved into the thicket compelled his companions to be on the alert though the first broke through the belt of hazels which enclosed the more open area within a few instants before the indians reached the place then it was that there arose such a yell such screechings and cries as reached far over the prairie and might have appalled the stoutest heart the picture that was soon offered to the eye was not less terrific than the sounds which assailed the ear hundreds of savages in their warpaint armed and in a crowded maze arose as it might be by one effort seemingly out of the earth and began to leap and play their antics amid the trees the sudden spectacle of a crowd of such beings nearly naked frightfully painted and tossing their arms here and there while each yelled like a demon was enough to overcome the nerves of a very resolute man but le bourdon was prepared for a conflict and even felt relieved rather than alarmed when he saw the savages his ready mind at once conceived the truth this band belonged to the chiefs and composed the whole or a principal part of the force which he knew they must have outlying somewhere on the prairies or in the openings he had sufficiently understood the hints of pigeonswing to be prepared for such a meeting and at no time of late had he approached a cover without remembering the possibility of its containing indians  instead of betraying alarm therefore when this cloud of phantom like beings rose before his eyes le bourdon stood firm merely turning toward the chiefs behind him to ascertain if they were taken by surprise as well as himself it was apparent that they were for understanding that a medicineceremony was to take place on the prairie these young men had preceded the party from the hut and had ununknown to all the chiefs got possession of this copse as the best available cover whence to make their observations on what was going on  my brother sees his young men said le bourdon quietly the instant a dead calm had succeeded to the outcries with which he had been greeted i thought he might wish to say something to them and my bees told me where to find them does my brother wish to know anything else  great was the wonder of the three chiefs at this exhibition of medicine power so far from suspecting the truth or of detecting the lucky coincidence by which le bourdon had been led to the cover of their warriors it all appeared to them to be pure necromancy such an art must be of great service and how useful it would be to the warrior on his path to be accompanied by one who could thus command the vigilance of the bees  you find enemy all same as friend demanded peter letting out the thought that was uppermost in the question  to be sure it makes no difference with a bee he can find an enemy as easily as he can find a friend  no whiskeyspring dis time put in crowsfeather a little inopportunely and with a distrust painted in his swarthy face that le bourdon did not like  pottawattamie you do not understand medicinemen ought i to have shown your young men where whiskey was to be had for nothing ask yourself that question did you wish to see your young men wallowing like hogs in such a spring what would the great medicinepriest of the palefaces who is out yonder have said to that  this was a coup de maitre on the part of the beehunter until that moment the affair of the whiskeyspring had weighed heavily in the balance against him but now it was suddenly changed over in the scales and told as strongly in his favor even a savage can understand the morality which teaches men to preserve their reason and not to lower themselves to the level of brutes by swallowing firewater and crowsfeather suddenly saw a motive for regarding our hero with the eyes of favor instead of those of distrust and dislike  what the paleface says is true observed peter to his companion had he opened his spring your warrior would have been weaker than women he is a wonderful medicineman and we must not provoke him to anger how could he know but through his bees that our young men were here  this question could not be answered and when the chiefs followed by the whole band of warriors some three or four hundred in number came out upon the open prairie all that had passed was communicated to those who awaited their return in a few brief but clear explanations le bourdon found a moment to let margery comprehend his position and views while parson amen and the corporal were put sufficiently on their guard not to make any unfortunate blunder the last was much more easily managed than the first so exceedingly sensitive was the conscience of the priest that had he clearly understood the game le bourdon was playing he might have revolted at the idea of necromancy as touching on the province of evil spirits but he was so well mystified as to suppose all that passed was regularly connected with the art of taking bees in this respect he and the indians equally resembled one of those familiar pictures in which we daily see men in masses contributing to their own deception and subjection while they fondly but blindly imagine that they are not only inventors but masters this trade of mastery after all is the property of a very few minds and no precaution of the prudent no forethought of the wary nor any expedient of charters constitutions or restrictions will prevent the few from placing their feet on the neck of the many we may revive the fable of king log and king stork as often and in as many forms as we will it will ever be the fable of king log and king stork we are no admirers of political aristocracies as a thousand paragraphs from our pen will prove and as for monarchs we have long thought they best enact their parts when most responsible to opinion but we cannot deceive ourselves on the subject of the atrocities that are daily committed by those who are ever ready to assume the places of both making their fellow creatures in masses their dupes and using those that they affect to serve  ben boden was now a sort of gouvernement provisoire among the wondering savages who surrounded him he had got them to believe in necromancya very considerable step toward the exercise of despotic power it is true he hardly knew himself what was to be done next but he saw quite distinctly that he was in a dilemma and must manage to get out of it by some means or other if he could only succeed in this instance as well as he had succeeded in his former essay in the black art all might be well and margery be carried in triumph into the settlements margery pro haec vice was his goddess of liberty and he asked for no higher reward than to be permitted to live the remainder of his days in the sunshine of her smiles liberty a word that is just now in all mens mouths but in how few hearts in its purity and truth what a melancholy mistake moreover to suppose that could it be enjoyed in that perfection with which the imaginations of men love to cheat their judgments it is the great good of life one hour spent in humble veneration for the being that gave it in common with all of earth its vacillating and uncertain existence is of more account than ages passed in its service and he who fancies that in worshipping liberty he answers the great end of his existence hugs a delusion quite as weak and infinitely more dangerous than that which now came over the minds of peter and his countrymen in reference to the intelligence of the bee it is a good thing to possess the defective and qualified freedom which we term liberty but it is a grave error to set it up as an idol to be worshipped  what my brother do next demanded bears meat who being a somewhat vulgarminded savage was all for striking and wonder working exhibitions of necromancy praps he find some honey now  if you wish it chief what says petershall i ask my bees to tell where there is a hive  as peter very readily assented le bourdon next set about achieving this new feat in his art the reader will recollect that the positions of two hives were already known to the beehunter by means of that very simple and everyday process by which he earned his bread one of these hives was in the point of wood already mentioned that lay along the margin of the prairie while the other was in this very copse where the savages had secreted themselves boden had now no thought of giving any further disturbance to this lastnamed colony of insects for an insight into their existence might disturb the influence obtained by the jugglery of the late discovery and he at once turned his attention toward the other hive indicated by his bees  nor did le bourdon now deem it necessary to resort to his usual means of carrying on his trade these were not necessary to one who knew already where the hive was to be found while it opened the way to certain mummeries that might be made to tell well in support of his assumed character catching a bee then and keeping it confined within his tumbler ben held the last to his ear as if listening to what the fluttering insect had to say having seemingly satisfied himself on this point he desired the chiefs once more to follow him having first let the bee go with a good deal of ceremony this set all in motion again the party being now increased by the whole band of savages who had been put up from their cover  by this time margery began to tremble for the consequences she had held several short conferences with le bourdon as they walked together and had penetrated far enough into his purposes to see that he was playing a ticklish game it might succeed for a time but she feared it must fail in the end and there was always the risk of incurring the summary vengeance of savages perhaps she did not fully appreciate the power of superstition and the sluggishness of the mind that once submits to its influence while her womans heart made her keenly alive to all those frightful consequences that must attend an exposure nevertheless nothing could now be done to avert the consequences it was too late to recede and things must take their course even at all the hazards of the case that she might not be wholly useless when her lover was risking so much for herselfmargery well understanding that her escape was the only serious difficulty the beehunter apprehendedthe girl turned all her attention to peter in whose favor she felt that she had been daily growing and on whose pleasure so much must depend changing her position a little she now came closer to the chief than she had hitherto done  squaw like medicineman asked peter with a significance of expression that raised a blush in margerys cheek  you mean to ask me if i like to see medicinemen perform answered margery with the readiness of her sex white women are always curious they sayhow is it with the women of the red men  juss sofull of curosity squaw is squawno matter what color  i am sorry peter you do not think better of squaws perhaps you never had a squawno wife or daughter  a gleam of powerful feeling shot athwart the dark countenance of the indian resembling the glare of the electric fluid flashing on a cloud at midnight but it passed away as quickly as it appeared leaving in its stead the hard condensed expression which the intensity of a purpose so long entertained and cultivated had imprinted there as indelibly as if cut in stone  all chief have squawall chief have pappoose was the answer that came at last what he good for eh  it is always good to have children peter especially when the children themselves are good  good for paleface maybeno good for injin paleface glad when pappoose bornredskin sorry  i hope this is not so why should an injin be sorry to see the laugh of his little son  laugh when he littlepraps so he little and dont know what happen but injin dont laugh any more when he grow up game gone land gone cornfield gone no more room for injinpaleface want all paleface young man laughredskin young man cry dat how it is  oh i hope not peter i should be sorry to think it was so the red man has as good a rightnay he has a better right to this country than we whites and god forbid that he should not always have his full share of the land  margery probably owed her life to that honest natural burst of feeling which was uttered with a warmth and sincerity that could leave no doubt that the sentiment expressed came from the heart thus singularly are we constructed a minute before and no exemption was made in the mind of peter in behalf of this girl in the plan he had formed for cutting off the whites on the contrary he had often bethought him of the number of young palefaces that might be as it were strangled in their cradles by including the beehunter and his intended squaw in the contemplated sacrifice all this was changed as in the twinkling of an eye by margerys honest and fervent expression of her sense of right on the great subject that occupied all of peters thoughts these sudden impulses in the direction of love for our species the second of the high lessons left by the redeemer to his disciples are so many proofs of the creation of man in the image of his maker they exert their power often when least expected and are ever stamped by the same indelible impression of their divine origin without these occasional glimpses at those qualities which are so apt to lie dormant we might indeed despair of the destinies of our race we are however in safe and merciful hands and all the wonderful events that are at this moment developing themselves around us are no other than the steps taken by providence in the progress it is steadily making toward the great and glorious end some of the agencies will be corrupt others deluded and no one of them all perhaps will pursue with unerring wisdom the precise path that ought to be taken but even the crimes errors and delusions will be made instrumental in achieving that which was designed before the foundations of this world were laid  does my daughter wish this returned peter when margery had thus frankly and sincerely given vent to her feelings can a paleface squaw wish to leave an injin any of his huntinggrounds  thousands of us wish it peter and i for one often and often have we talked of this around our family fire and even gershom when his head has not been affected by firewater has thought as we all have thought i know that bourdon thinks so too and i have heard him say that he thought congress ought to pass a law to prevent white men from getting any more of the injins lands  the face of peter would have been a remarkable study during the few moments that his fierce will was in the process of being brought in subjugation to the influence of his better feelings at first he appeared bewildered then compunction had its shade and human sympathy came last asserting its long dormant but inextinguishable power margery saw some of this though it far exceeded her penetration to read all the workings of that stern and savage mind yet she felt encouraged by what she did see and understand  while an almighty and divine providence was thus carrying out its own gracious designs in its own way the beehunter continued bent on reaching a similar end by means of his own little did he imagine how much had been done for him within the last few moments and how greatly all he had in view was jeoparded and put at risk by his own contrivancescontrivances which seemed to him so clever but which were wanting in the unerring simplicity and truth that render those that come from above infallible still the expedients of le bourdon may have had their agency in bringing about events and may have been intended to be a part of that moral machinery which was now at work in the breast of peter for good  it will be remembered that the beehunter habitually carried a small spyglass as a part of the implements of his calling it enabled him to watch the bees as they went in and came out of the hives on the highest trees and often saved him hours of fruitless search this glass was now in his hand for an object on a dead tree that rose a little apart from those around it and which stood quite near the extreme point in the forest toward which they were all proceeding had caught his attention the distance was still too great to ascertain by the naked eye what that object was but a single look with the glass showed that it was a bear this was an old enemy of the beehunter who often encountered the animal endeavoring to get at the honey and he had on divers occasions been obliged to deal with these plunderers before he could succeed in his own plans of pilfering the bear now seen continued in sight but an instant the height to which he had clambered being so great most probably as to weary him with the effort and to compel him to fall back again all this was favorable to le bourdons wishes who immediately called a halt the first thing that bourdon did when all the dark eyes were gleaming on him in fierce curiosity was to catch a bee and hold it to his ear as it buzzed about in the tumbler  you tink dat bee talk peter asked of margery in a tone of confidence as if a newlyawakened principle now existed between them  bourdon must think so peter the girl evasively answered or he would hardly listen to hear what it says  its strange bee should talk almos as strange as paleface wish to leave injin any land sartain bee talk eh  i never heard one talk peter unless it might be in its buzzing that may be the tongue of a bee for anything i know to the contrary  by this time le bourdon seemed to be satisfied and let the bee go the savages murmuring their wonder and admiration  do my brothers wish to hunt asked the beehunter in a voice so loud that all near might hear what he had to say  this question produced a movement at once skill in hunting next to success on the warpath constitutes the great merit of an indian and it is ever his delight to show that he possesses it no sooner did le bourdon throw out his feeler therefore than a general exclamation proclaimed the readiness of all the young men in particular to join in the chase  let my brothers come closer said ben in an authoritative manner i have something to put into their ears they see that point of wood where the dead basswood has fallen on the prairie near that basswood is honey and near that honey are bears this my bees have told me now let my brothers divide and some go into the woods and some stay on the prairie then they will have plenty of sweet food  as all this was very simple and easily to be comprehended not a moment was lost in the execution with surprising order and aptitude the chiefs led off their parties one line of dark warriors penetrating the forest on the eastern side of the basswood and another on its western while a goodly number scattered themselves on the prairie itself in its front in less than a quarter of an hour signals came from the forest that the battue was ready and peter gave the answering sign to proceed  down to this moment doubts existed among the savages concerning the accuracy of le bourdons statement how was it possible that his bees should tell him where he could find bears to be sure bears were the great enemies of beesthis every indian knewbut could the bees have a faculty of thus arming one enemy against another these doubts however were soon allayed by the sudden appearance of a drove of bears eight or ten in number that came waddling out of the woods driven before the circle of shouting hunters that had been formed within  now commenced a scene of wild tumult and of fierce delight the warriors on the prairie retired before their enemies until all of their associates were clear of the forest when the circle swiftly closed again until it had brought the bears to something like close quarters bears meat as became his appellation led off the dance letting fly an arrow at the nearest animal astounded by the great number of their enemies and not a little appalled by their yells the poor quadrupeds did not know which way to turn occasionally attempts were made to break through the circle but the flight of arrows aimed directly at their faces invariably drove the creatures back firearms were not resorted to at all in this hunt spears and arrows being the weapons depended on several ludicrous incidents occurred but none that were tragical one or two of the more reckless of the hunters ambitious of shining before the representatives of so many tribes ran rather greater risks than were required but they escaped with a few smart scratches in one instance however a young indian had a still narrower squeeze for his life literally a squeeze it was for suffering himself to get within the grasp of a bear he came near being pressed to death ere his companions could dispatch the creature as for the prisoner the only means he had to prevent his being bitten was to thrust the head of his spear into the bears mouth where he succeeded in holding it spite of the animals efforts to squeeze him into submission by the time this combat was terminated the field was strewn with the slain every one of the bears having been killed by hunters so much practised in the art of destroying game     chapter xxi

birth and her first love                                                      rogers    during the hunt there was little leisure for reflection on the seemingly extraordinary manner in which the beehunter had pointed out the spot where the bears were to be found no one of the indians had seen him apply the glass to his eye for leading the party he had been able to do this unobserved but had they witnessed such a procedure it would have been as inexplicable as all the rest it is true crowsfeather and one or two of his companions had taken a look through that medicineglass but it rather contributed to increase the conjurors renown than served to explain any of the marvels he performed  peter was most struck with all that had just occurred he had often heard of the skill of those who hunted bees and had several times met with individuals who practised the art but this was the first occasion on which he had ever been a witness in his own person of the exercise of a craft so wonderful had the process been simply that of catching a bee filling it with honey letting it go and then following it to its hive it would have been so simple as to require no explanation but peter was too intelligent as well as too observant not to have seen that a great deal more than this was necessary on the supposition that the bee flew toward the forest as had been the fact with two of the bees taken that morning in what part of that forest was the hunter to look for the beetree it was the angle that perplexed peter as it did all the indians for that angle to be understood required a degree of knowledge and calculation that entirely exceeded all he had ever acquired thus is it with us ever the powers and faculties and principles that are necessary fully to comprehend all that we see and all that surrounds us exist and have been bestowed on man by his beneficent creator still it is only by slow degrees that he is to become their master acquiring knowledge step by step as he has need of its services and learns how to use it such seems to be the design of providence which is gradually opening to our inquiries the arcana of nature in order that we may convert their possession into such uses as will advance its own wise intentions happy are they who feel this truth in their character of individuals thrice happy the nations which can be made to understand that the surest progress is that which is made on the clearest principles and with the greatest caution the notion of setting up anything new in morals is as fallacious in theory as it will be found to be dangerous in practice  it has been said that a sudden change had come over the fierce purposes of peter for some time the nature artlessness truth feminine playfulness and kindness not to say personal beauty of margery had been gradually softening the heart of this stern savage as it respected the girl herself nothing of a weak nature was blended with this feeling which was purely the growth of that divine principle that is implanted in us all the quiet earnest manner in which the girl had that day protested her desire to see the rights of the red man respected completed her conquest and so far as the great chief was concerned secured her safety it may seem singular however that peter with all his influence was unable to say that even one that he was so much disposed to favor should be spared by means of his own eloquence and perseverance and deep desire for vengeance however he had aroused a spirit among his followers that was not so easily quelled on several occasions he had found it difficult to prevent the younger and more impetuous of the chiefs from proceeding at once to secure the scalps of those who were in their power and this he had done only by promising to increase the number of the victims how was he then to lessen that number and that too when circumstances did not seem likely to throw any more immediately into his power as he had once hoped this council must soon be over and it would not be in his power to send the chiefs away without enumerating the scalps of the palefaces present among those which were to make up the sum of their race  taking the perplexity produced by the beehunters necromancy and adding it to his concern for margery peter found ample subject for all his reflections while the young men were dressing their bears and making the preparations for a feast he walked apart like a man whose thoughts had little in common with the surrounding scene even the further proceedings of le bourdon who had discovered his bee tree had felled it and was then distributing the honey among the indians could not draw him from his meditations the great council of all was to be held that very daythere on prairie roundand it was imperative on peter to settle the policy he intended to pursue previously to the hour when the fire was to be lighted and the chiefs met in final consultation  in the mean time le bourdon by his distribution of the honey no less than by the manner in which he had found it was winning golden opinions of those who shared in his bounty one would think that the idea of property is implanted in us by nature since men in all conditions appear to entertain strong and distinct notions of this right natural it may not be in the true signification of the term but it is a right so interwoven with those that are derived from nature and more particularly with our wants as almost to identify it with the individual being it is certain that all we have of civilization is dependent on a just protection of this right for without the assurance of enjoying his earnings who would produce beyond the supply necessary for his own immediate wants among the american savages the rights of property are distinctly recognized so far as their habits and resources extend the huntingground belongs to the tribe and occasionally the field but the wigwam and the arms and the skins both for use and for market and often the horses and all other movables belong to the individual so sacred is this right held to be that not one of those who stood by and saw le bourdon fell his tree and who witnessed the operation of bringing to light its stores of honey appeared to dream of meddling with the delicious store until invited so to do by its lawful owner it was this reserve and this respect for a recognized principle that enabled the beehunter to purchase a great deal of popularity by giving away liberally an article so much prized none indeed was reserved boden seeing the impossibility of carrying it away happy would he have been most happy could he have felt the assurance of being able to get margery off without giving a second thought to any of his effects whether present or absent  as has been intimated the beehunter was fast rising in the favor of the warriors particularly of those who had a weakness on the score of the stomach this is the first great avenue to the favor of manthe belly ruling all the other members the brains included all this peter noted and was now glad to perceive for in addition to the favor that margery had found in his eyes that wary chief had certain very serious misgivings on the subject of the prudence of attempting to deal harshly with a medicine man of bodens calibre touching the whiskeyspring he had been doubtful from the first even crowsfeathers account of the wonderful glass through which that chief had looked and seen men reduced to children and then converted into giants had failed to conquer his scepticism but he was not altogether proof against what he had that day beheld with his own eyes these marvels shook his previous opinion touching the other matters and altogether the effect was to elevate the bee hunter to a height that it really appeared dangerous to assail  while peter was thus shaken with doubtsand that too on a point on which he had hitherto stood as firm as a rockthere was another in the crowd who noted the growing favor of le bourdon with deep disgust this man could hardly be termed a chief though he possessed a malignant power that was often wielded to the discomfiture of those who were he went by the significant appellation of the weasel a sobriquet that had been bestowed on him for some supposed resemblance to the little pilfering prowling quadruped after which he was thus named in person and in physical qualities generally this individual was mean and illfavored and squalid habits contributed to render him even less attractive than he might otherwise have been he was moreover particularly addicted to intemperance lying wallowing like a hog for days at a time whenever his tribe received any of the ample contribution of firewater which it was then more the custom than it is today to send among the aborigines a warrior of no renown a hunter so indifferent as to compel his squaw and pappooses often to beg for food in strange lodges of mean presence and a drunkard it may seem extraordinary that the weasel should possess any influence amid so many chiefs renowned for courage wisdom deeds in arms on the hunt and for services around the councilfire it was all due to his tongue ungque or the weasel was eloquent in a high degree possessing that variety of his art which most addresses itself to the passions and strange as it may seem men are oftener and more easily led by those who do little else than promise than by those who actually perform a lying and fluent tongue becomes a power of itself with the masses subverting reason looking down justice browbeating truth and otherwise placing the wrong before the right this quality the weasel possessed in a high degree and was ever willing to use on occasions that seemed most likely to defeat the wishes of those he hated among the last was peter whose known ascendancy in his own particular tribe had been a source of great envy and uneasiness to this indian he had struggled hard to resist it and had even dared to speak in favor of the palefaces and in opposition to the plan of cutting them all off purely with a disposition to oppose this mysterious stranger it had been in vain however the current running the other way and the fiery eloquence of peter proving too strong even for him now to his surprise from a few words dropped casually this man ascertained that their greatest leader was disposed so far to relent as not to destroy all the palefaces in his power whom and how many he meant to spare ungque could not tell but his quick practised discernment detected the general disposition and his ruthless tendency to oppose caused him to cast about for the means of resisting this sudden inclination to show mercy with the weasel the moving principle was ever that of the demagogue it was to flatter the mass that he might lead it and he had an innate hostility to whatever was frank manly and noble  the time had now come when the indians wished to be alone at this council it was their intention to come to an important decision and even the young men unless chiefs were to be merely distant spectators peter sent for le bourdon accordingly and communicated his wish that all the whites would return to the castle whither he promised to join them about the setting of the sun or early the succeeding day  one of you you knowdat my wigwam said the grim chief smiling on margery with a friendly eye and shaking hands with the bee hunter who thought his manner less constrained than on former similar occasions get good supper for ole injin young squaw dat juss what squaw good for  margery laughingly promised to remember his injunction and went her way closely attended by her lover the corporal followed armed to the teeth and keeping at just such a distance from the young people as might enable them to converse without being overheard as for the missionary he was detained a moment by peter the others moving slowly in order to permit him to come up ere they had gone their first mile of course the mysterious chief had not detained parson amen without a motive  my brother has told me many curious things said peter when alone with the missionary and speaking now in the language of the ojebwaysmany very curious things i like to listen to them once he told me how the paleface young men take their squaws  i remember to have told you this we ask the great spirit to bless our marriages and the ceremony is commonly performed by a priest this is our practice peter though not necessary i think it good  yes good alway for paleface to do paleface fashion and for injin to do injin fashion dont want medicineman to get redskin squaw open wigwam door and she come in dat nough if she dont wish to come in cant make her squaw go to warrior she likes warrior ask squaw he likes but it is best for paleface to take his wife in paleface fashion does not my brother see a young man of his people and a young maiden that he had better bring together and bless  you must mean bourdon and margery answered the missionary in english after a moments reflection the idea is a new one to me for my mind has been much occuoccupied of late with other and more important matters though i now plainly see what you mean  that flower of the openings would soon fade if the young bee hunter should leave it alone on the prairies this is the will of the great spirit he puts it into the minds of the young squaws to see all things well that the hunters of their fancy do why he has made the young with this kindness for each other perhaps my brother knows he is wise and has books the poor injins have none they can see only with the eyes they got from injins like themselves but one thing they know what the great spirit has commanded is good injins cant make it any better they can do it harm but they can do it no good let my brother bless the couple that the manitou has brought together  i believe i understand you peter and will think of this and now that i must leave you for a little while let me beg you to think of this matter of the origin of your tribes candidly and with care everything depends on your peoples not mistaking the truth in this great matter it is as necessary for a nation to know its duties as for a single man promise me to think of this peter  my brothers words have come into my earsthey are good returned the indian courteously we will think of them at the council if my brother will bless his young man and young maiden according to the law of his people  i will promise to do this peter or to urge bourdon and margery to do it if you will promise to speak today in council of the history of your forefathers and to take into consideration once more the great question of your being hebrews  i will speak as my brother wisheslet him do as i wish let him tell me that i can say to the chiefs before the sun has fallen the length of my arm that the young paleface beehunter has taken the young paleface squaw into his wigwam  i do not understand your motive peter but that which you ask is wise and according to gods laws and it shall be done fare you well then for a season when we again meet bourdon and margery shall be one if my persuasions can prevail and you will have pressed this matter of the lost tribes again home to your people fare you well peter fare you well  they separated the indian with a cold smile of courtesy but with his ruthless intentions as respected the missionary in no degree changed boden and margery alone were exempt from vengeance according to his present designs an unaccountable gentleness of feeling governed him as connected with the girl while superstition and the dread of an unknown power had its full influence on his determination to spare her lover there might be some faint ray of human feeling glimmering among the fierce fires that so steadily burned in the breast of this savage but they were so much eclipsed by the brighter light that gleamed around them as to be barely perceptible even to himself the result of all these passions was a determination in peter to spare those whom he had advised the missionary to unitemaking that union a mysterious argument in favor of margeryand to sacrifice all the rest the red american is so much accustomed to this species of ruthless proceeding that the anguish he might occasion the very beings to whom he now wished to be merciful gave the stern chief very little concern leaving the indians in the exclusive possession of prairie round we will return to the rest of the party  the missionary hastened after his friends as fast as he could go boden and margery had much to say to each other in that walk which had a great deal about it to bring their thoughts within the circle of their own existence as has been said the fire had run through that region late and the grasses were still young offering but little impediment to their movements as the day was now near its heat le bourdon led his spirited but gentle companion through the groves where they had the benefit of a most delicious shade a relief that was now getting to be very grateful twice had they stopped to drink at cool clear springs in which the water seemed to vie with the air in transparency as this is not the general character of the water of that region though marked exceptions exist margery insisted that the water was eastern and not western water  why do we always think the things we had in childhood better than those we enjoy afterward asked margery after making one of these comparisons somewhat to the disadvantage of the part of the country in which she then was i can scarce ever think of homewhat i call home and which was so long a home to mewithout shedding tears nothing here seems as good of its kind as what i have left behind me do you have the same longings for pennsylvania that i feel for the seacoast and for the rocks about quincy  sometimes when i have been quite alone for two or three months i have fancied that an apple or a potato or even a glass of cider that came from the spot where i was born would be sweeter than all the honey bees ever gathered in michigan  to me it has always seemed strange bourdon that one of your kind feelings should ever wish to live alone at all yet i have heard you say that a love of solitude first drew you to your trade  it is these strong cases which get a man under as it might be and almost alter his nature one man will pass his days in hunting deer another in catching fish my taste has been for the bees and for such chances with other creatures as may offer what between hunting and hiving and getting the honey to market i have very little time to long for company but my taste is altering margery has altered  the girl blushed but she also smiled and moreover she looked pleased  i am afraid that you are not as much altered as you think she answered laughingly however it may seem so now but when you come to live in the settlements again you will get tired of crowds  then i will come with you margery into these openings and we can live together here surely as well or far better than i can live here alone you and gershoms wife have spoiled my housekeeping i really did not know until you came up here how much a woman can do in a chiente  why bourdon you have lived long enough in the settlements to know that  that is true but i look upon the settlements as one thing and on the openings as another what will do there isnt needed here and what will do here wont answer there but these last few days have so changed castle meal that i hardly know it myself  perhaps the change is for the worse and you wish it undone bourdon observed the girl in the longing she had to hear an assurance to the contrary at the very moment she felt certain that assurance would be given  no no margery woman has taken possession of my cabin and woman shall now always command there unless you alter your mind and refuse to have me i shall speak to the missionary to marry us as soon as i can get him alone his mind is running so much on the jews that he has hardly a moment left for us christians  the color on margerys cheek was not lessened by this declaration though to admit the truth she looked none the less pleased she was a warmhearted and generous girl and sometimes hesitated about separating herself and her fortunes from those of gershom and dorothy but the beehunter had persuaded her this would be unnecessary though she did accept him for a husband the point had been settled between them on previous occasions and much conversation had already passed in that very walk which was confined to that interesting subject but margery was not now disposed to say more and she adroitly improved the hint thrown out by boden to change the discourse  it is the strangest notion i ever heard of she cried laughing to believe injins to be jews  he tells me he is by no means the first who has fancied it many writers have said as much before him and all he claims is to have been among them and to have seen these hebrews with his own eyes but here he comes and can answer for himself  just as this was said parson amen joined the party corporal flint closing to the front as delicacy no longer required him to act as a rearguard the good missionary came up a little heated and in order that he might have time to cool himself the rate of movement was slightly reduced in the mean time the conversation did not the less proceed  we were talking of the lost tribes said margery half smiling as she spoke and of your idea mr amen that these injins are jews it seems strange to me that they should have lost so much of their ancient ways and notions and appearances if they are really the people you think  lost it is rather wonderful that after the lapse of two thousand years and more so much should remain whichever way i look signs of these peoples origin beset me you have read your bible margerywhich i am sorry to say all on this frontier have notbut you have read your bible and one can make an allusion to you with some satisfaction now let me ask you if you remember such a thing as the scapegoat of the ancient jews it is to be found in leviticus and is one of those mysterious customs with which that extraordinary book is full  leviticus is a book i never read but once for we do not read it in our new england schools but i do remember that the jews were commanded to let one of two goats go from which practice it has i believe been called a scapegoat  well said le bourdon simply what a thing is larnin now this is all news to me though i have heard of scapegoats and talked of scapegoats a thousand times theres a meanin to everything i find and i do not look upon this idea of the lost tribes as half as strange as i did before i larnt this  margery had not fallen in love with the beehunter for his biblical knowledge else might her greater information have received a rude shock by this mark of simplicity but instead of dwelling on this proof of le bourdons want of schooling her active mind was more disposed to push the allusion to scapegoats to some useful conclusion  and what of the goat mr amen she asked and how can it belong to anything here  why were all those goats turned into the woods and deserts in the olden time margery doubtless to provide food for the ten tribes when these should be driven forth by conquerors and hard task masters time and climate and a difference of food has altered them as they have changed the jews themselves though they still retain the cleft hoof the horns the habits and the general characteristics of the goats of arabia yes naturalists will find in the end that the varieties of the deer of this continent particularly the antelope are nothing but the scapegoats of the ancient world altered and perhaps improved by circumstances  as this was much the highest flight the good missionary had ever yet taken not trifling was the astonishment of his young friends thereat touching the jews le bourdon did not pretend to or in fact did not possess much knowledge but when the question was reduced down to one of venison or bears meat or bisons humps with the exception of the professed hunters and trappers few knew more about them all than he did himself that the deer or even the antelopes of america ever had been goats he did not believe nor was he at all backward in letting his dissent to such a theory be known  im sorry parson amen youve brought in the deer he cried had you stuck to the jews i might have believed all that you fancy in this business but the deer have spoiled all as for scapegoats since margery seems to agree with you i suppose you are right about them though my notion of such creatures has been to keep clear of them instead of following them up as you seem to think these hebrews have done but if you are no nearer right in your doctrine about the injins than you are about their game youll have to change your religion  do not think that my religion depends on any thread so slight bourdon a man may be mistaken in interpreting prophecy and still be a devout christian there are more reasons than you may at first suppose for believing in this theory of the gradual change of the goat into the deer and especially into the antelope we do not any of us believe that noah had with him in the ark all the animals that are now to be found but merely the parentstems in each particular case which would be reducing the number many fold if all men came from adam bourdon why could not all deer come from goats  why this matter about men has a good deal puzzled me parson and i hardly know what answer to give still men are men wherever you find them they may be lighter or darker taller or shorter with hair or wool and yet you can see they are men perhaps food and climate and manner of living may have made all the changes we see in them but lord parson a goat has a beard  what has become of the thousands of scapegoats that the ancient hebrews must have turned loose in the wilderness answer me that bourdon  you might as well ask me sir what has become of the thousands of hebrews who turned them loose i suppose all must be dead a thousand years ago scapegoats are creatures that even injins would not like  all this is a great mystery bourdona much greater mystery than our friend peter whom you have so often said was a man so unaccountable by the way he has given me a charge to perform an office between you and margery that i had almost forgotten from what he said to me i rather think it may have some connection with our safety we have enemies among these savages i feel very certain though i believe we have also warm friends  but what have you in charge that has anything to do with bourdon and me asked the wondering margery who was quick to observe the connection though utterly at a loss to comprehend it  the missionary now called a halt and finding convenient seats he gradually opened the subject with which he had been charged by peter to his companions the reader is probably prepared to learn that there was no longer any reserve between le bourdon and margery on the subject of their future marriage the young man had already pressed an immediate union as the wisest and safest course to be pursued although the savage american is little addicted to abusing his power over female captives and seldom takes into his lodge an unwilling squaw the beehunter had experienced a good deal of uneasiness on the score of what might befall his betrothed margery was sufficiently beautiful to attract attention even in a town and more than one fiercelooking warrior had betrayed his admiration that very day though it was in a very indianlike fashion rhapsody and gallant speeches and sonnets form no part of indian courtship but the language of admiration is so very universal through the eyes that it is sufficiently easy of comprehension it was possible that some chief whose band was too formidable to be opposed might take it into his head to wish to see a paleface squaw in his wigwam and while it was not usual to do much violence to a females inclinations on such occasions it was not common to offer much opposition to those of a powerful warrior the married tie if it could be said to exist at all however was much respected and it was far less likely that margery a wife would thus be appropriated than margery unmarried it is true cases of unscrupulous exercise of power are to be found among indians as well as among civilized men but they are rare and usually are much condemned  the beehunter consequently was well disposed to second peters project as for margery herself she had half yielded all her objections to her lovers unaided arguments and was partly conquered before this reinforcement was brought into the field against her peters motive was much canvassed no one of them all being able to penetrate it boden however had his private opinion on the subject nor was it so very much out of the way he fancied that the mysterious chief was well disposed to margery and wished to put her as far as possible beyond the chances of an indian wigwam marriage being the step of all others most likely to afford her this protection now this was not exactly true but it was right enough in the main peters aim was to save the life of the girl her gentle attractions and kind attentions to himself having wrought this much in her favor and he believed no means of doing so as certain as forming a close connection for her with the great medicinebeehunter judging of them by himself he did not think the indians would dare to include so great a conjurer in their schemes of vengeance and was willing himself that le bourdon should escape provided margery could go free and unharmed with him as for the beehunters powers he had many misgivings they might be dangerous to the red men and they might not on this subject he was in the painful doubts of ignorance and had the wide area of conjecture open before his mind he saw but it was as in a glass darkly  margery was disposed to delay the ceremony at least until her brother and sister might be present but to this le bourdon himself was not much inclined it had struck him that gershom was opposed to an early marriage most probably because he fancied himself more secure of the beehunters ingenious and important aid in getting back to the settlements so long as this strong inducement existed to cling to himself than if he should release his own hold of margery by giving her at once to her lover right or wrong such was the impression taken up by le bourdon and he was glad when the missionary urged his request to be permitted to pronounce the nuptial benediction on the spot  little ceremony is generally used in an american marriage in a vast many cases no clergyman is employed at all and where there is most of the sects have no ring no giving away nor any of those observances which were practised in the churches of old there existed no impediment therefore and after a decent interval spent in persuasions margery consented to plight her vows to the man of her heart before they left the spot she would fain have had dorothy present for woman loves to lean on her own sex on such occasions but submitted to the necessity of proceeding at once as the bee hunter and the missionary chose to term it  a better altar could not have been selected in all that vast region it was one of natures own erecting and le bourdon and his pretty bride placed themselves before it with feelings suited to the solemnity of the occasion the good missionary stood within the shade of a burr oak in the centre of those parklike openings every object looking fresh and smiling and beautiful the sward was gieen and short as that of a welltended lawn the flowers were like the bride herself soft modest and sweet while charming rural vistas stretched through the trees much as if art had been summoned in aid of the great mistress who had designed the landscape when the parties knelt in prayerwhich all present did not excepting the worthy corporalit was on the verdant ground with first the branches of the trees and then the deep fathomless vault of heaven for a canopy in this manner was the marriage benediction pronounced on the beehunter and margery waring in the venerable oak openings no gothic structure with its fretted aisles and clustered columns could have been onehalf as appropriate for the union of such a couple     chapter xxii       no shrift the gloomy savage brooks      as scowling on the priest he looks      cowesasscowesasstawkich wessasseen      let my father look on bornazeen      my fathers heart is the heart of a squaw      but mine is so hard that it does not thaw                                     whittier   leaving the newlymarried couple to pursue their way homeward it is now our province to return to prairie round one accustomed to such scenes would easily have detected the signs of divided opinions and of agitating doubts among the chiefs though nothing like contention or dispute had yet manifested itself peters control was still in the ascendant and he had neglected none of his usual means of securing influence perhaps he labored so much the harder from the circumstance that he now found himself so situated as to be compelled to undo much that he had previously done  on the other hand ungque appeared to have no particular cause of concern his manner was as much unoccupied as usual and to his habit of referring all his influence to sudden and powerful bursts of eloquence if design of any sort was entertained he left his success  we pass over the details of assembling the council the spot was not exactly on the prairie but in a bit of lovely opening on its margin where the eye could roam over a wide extent of that peculiar natural meadow while the body enjoyed the shades of the wood the chiefs alone were in the circle while the braves and the young men generally formed a group on the outside near enough to hear what passed and to profit by it if so disposed the pipe was smoked and all the ordinary customs observed when bears meat arose the first speaker on that momentous occasion  brothers he said this is the great council on prairie round to which we have been called we have met before but not here this is our first meeting here we have travelled a long path to get here some of our brethren have travelled farther they are at detroit they went there to meet our great canada father and to take yankee scalps how many scalps they have taken i do not know or i would tell you it is pleasant to me to count yankee scalps i would rather count them than count the scalps of red men there are still a great many left the yankees are many and each yankee has a scalp there should not be so many when the buffaloes came in the largest droves our fathers used to go out to hunt them in the strongest parties their sons should do the same we are the sons of those fathers they say we look like them talk like them live like themwe should act like them let another speak for i have done  after this brief address which bore some resemblance to a chairmans calling a meeting of civilized men to order there was more smoking it was fully expected that peter would next arise but he did not perceiving this and willing to allow time to that great chief to arrange his thoughts crowsfeather assumed the office of filling the gap he was far more of a warrior than of an orator and was listened to respectfully but less for what he said than for what he had done a good deal of indian boasting quite naturally was blended with his discourse  my brother has told you of the yankee scalps he commenced he says they are many he says there ought to be fewer he did not remember who sat so near him perhaps he does not know that there are three less now than there were a moon since crowsfeather took three at chicago many scalps were taken there the yankees must be plentier than the buffaloes on the great prairies if they can lose so many scalps often and send forth their warriors i am a pottawattamie my brothers know that tribe it is not a tribe of jews but a tribe of injins it is a great tribe it never was lost it cannot be lost no tribe better knows all the paths and all the best routes to every point where it wishes to go it is foolish to say you can lose a pottawattamie a duck would be as likely to lose itself as a pottawattamie i do not speak for the ottawas i speak for the pottawattamies we are not jews we do not wish to be jews and what we do not wish to be we will not be our father who has come so far to tell us that we are not injins but jews is mistaken i never heard of these jews before i do not wish to hear of them again when a man has heard enough he does not keep his ears open willingly it is then best for the speaker to sit down the pottawattamies have shut their ears to the great medicinepriest of the palefaces what he says may be true of other tribes but it is not true of the pottawatttamies we are not lost we are not jews i have done  this speech was received with general favor the notion that the indians were not indians but jews was far from being agreeable to those who had heard what had been said on the subject and the opinions of crowsfeather possessed the great advantage of reflecting the common sentiment on this interesting subject when this is the case a very little eloquence or logic goes a great way and on the whole the address of the last speaker was somewhat better received than that of the first  it was now confidently believed that peter would rise but he did not that mysterious chief was not yet prepared to speak or he was judiciously exciting expectation by keeping back there were at least ten minutes of silent smoking ere a chief whose name rendered into english was bough of the oak arose evidently with a desire to help the time along taking his cue from the success of crowsfeather he followed up the advantage obtained by that chief assailing the theory of the missionary from another quarter  i am an injin said bough of the oak my father was an injin and my mother was the daughter of an injin all my fathers were red men and all their sons why should i wish to be anything else i asked my brother the medicinepriest and he owned that jews are pale faces this he should not have owned if he wished the injins to be jews my skin is red the manitou of my fathers so painted it and their child will not try to wash out the color were the color washed out of my face i should be a paleface there would not be paint enough to hide my shame no i was born red and will die a red man it is not good to have two faces an injin is not a snake to cast his skin the skin in which he was born he keeps he plays in it when a child he goes in it to his first hunt the bears and the deer know him by it he carries it with him on the warpath and his enemies tremble at the sight of it his squaw knows him by that skin when he comes back to his wigwam and when he dies he is put aside in the same skin inwhich he was born there is but one skin and it has but one color at first it is little the pappoose that wears it is little there is not need of a large skin but it grows with the pappoose and the biggest warrior finds his skin around him this is because the great spirit fitted it to him whatever the manitou does is good  my brothers have squawsthey have pappooses when the pappoose is put into their arms do they get the paintstones and paint it red they do not it is not necessary the manitou painted it red before it was born how this was done i do not know i am nothing but a poor injin and only know what i see i have seen that the pappooses are red when they are born and that the warriors are red when they die they are also red while living it is enough their fathers could never have been palefaces or we should find some white spots on their children there are none  crowsfeather has spoken of the jews as lost i am not surprised to hear it it seems to me that all palefaces get lost they wander from their own huntinggrounds into those of other people it is not so with injins the pottawattamie does not kill the deer of the iowa nor the ottawa the deer of the menomenees each tribe knows its own game this is because they are not lost my paleface father appears to wish us well he has come on a long and weary path to tell us about his manitou for this i thank him i thank all who wish to do me good them that wish to do me harm i strike from behind it is our injin custom i do not wish to hurt the medicine priest because i think he wishes to do me good and not to do me harm he has a strange law it is to do good to them that do harm to you it is not the law of the red men it is not good law i do not wonder that the tribes which follow such a law get lost they cannot tell their friends from their enemies they can have no people to scalp what is a warrior if he cannot find someone to scalp no such a law would make women of the bravest braves in the openings or on the prairie it may be a good law for jews who get lost but it is a bad law for injins who know the paths they travel let another speak  this brief profession of faith on the subject that had been so recently broached in the council seemed to give infinite satisfaction all present evidently preferred being red men who knew where they were than to be palefaces who had lost their road ignorance of his path is a species of disgrace to an american savage and not a man there would have confessed that his particular division of the great human family was in that dilemma the idea that the yankees were lost and had got materially astray was very grateful to most who heard it and bough of the oak gained a considerable reputation as an orator in consequence of the lucky hits made on this occasion  another long ruminating pause and much passing of the pipe of peace succeeded it was near half an hour after the last speaker had resumed his seat ere peter stood erect in that long interval expectation had time to increase and curiosity to augment itself nothing but a very great event could cause this pondering this deliberation and this unwillingness to begin when however the time did come for the mysterious chief to speak the man of many scalps to open his mouth profound was the attention that prevailed among all present even after he had arisen the orator stood silently looking around him as if the throes of his thoughts had to be a little suppressed before he could trust his tongue to give them utterance  what is the earth commenced peter in a deep guttural tone of voice which the deathlike stillness rendered audible even to the outermost boundaries of the circle of admiring and curious countenances it is one plain adjoining another river after river lake after lake prairie touching prairie and pleasant woods that seem to have no limits all given to men to dwell in it would seem that the great spirit parcelled out this rich possession into huntinggrounds for all he colored men differently his dearest children he painted red which is his own color them that he loved less he colored less and they had red only in spots them he loved least he dipped in a dark dye and left them black these are the colors of men if there are more i have not seen them some say there are i shall think so too when i see them  brothers this talk about lost tribes is a foolish talk we are not lost we know where we are and we know where the yankees have come to seek us my brother has well spoken if any are lost it is the yankees the yankees are jews they are lost the time is near when they will be found and when they will again turn their eyes toward the rising sun they have looked so long toward the setting sun that they cannot see clearly it is not good to look too long at the same object the yankees have looked at our huntinggrounds until their eyes are dim they see the huntinggrounds but they do not see all the warriors that are in them in time they will learn to count them  brothers when the great spirit made man he put him to live on the earth our traditions do not agree in saying of what he was made some say it was of clay and that when his spirit starts for the happy huntinggrounds his body becomes clay again i do not say that this is so for i do not know it is not good to say that which we do not know to be true i wish to speak only the truth this we do know if a warrior die and we put him in the earth and come to look for him many years afterward nothing but bones are found all else is gone i have heard old men say that in time even these bones are not to be found it is so with trees it may be so with men but it is not so with huntinggrounds they were made to last forever  brothers you know why we have come together on this prairie it was to count the palefaces and to think of the way of making their number less now is a good time for such a thing they have dug up the hatchet against each other and when we hear of scalps taken among them it is good for the red men i do not think our canada father is more our friend than the great yankee uncle sam it is true he gives us more powder and blankets and tomahawks and rifles than the yankee but it is to get us to fight his battles we will fight his battles they are our battles too for this reason we will fight his enemies  brothers it is time to think of our children a wise chief once told me how many winters it is since a paleface was first seen among red men it was not a great while ago injins are living who have seen injins whose own fathers saw the first palefaces they were few they were like little children then but now they are grown to be men medicinemen are plenty among them and tell them how to raise children the injins do not understand this smallpox firewater bad hunting and frosts keep us poor and keep our children from growing as fast as the children of the palefaces brothers all this has happened within the lives of three aged chiefs one told to another and he told it to a third three chiefs have kept that tradition they have given it to me i have cut notches on this stick holding up a piece of ash neatly trimmed as a record for the winters they told me and every winter since i have cut one more see there are not many notches some of our people say that the palefaces are already plentier than leaves on the trees i do not believe this these notches tell us differently it is true the palefaces grow fast and have many children and smallpox does not kill many of them and their wars are few but look at this stick could a canoefull of men become as many as they say in so few winters no it is not so the stories we have heard are not true a crooked tongue first told them we are strong enough still to drive these strangers into the great salt lake and get back all our huntinggrounds this is what i wish to have done  brothers i have taken many scalps this stick will tell the number here one of those terrible gleams of ferocity to which we have before alluded passed athwart the dark countenance of the speaker causing all present to feel a deeper sympathy in the thoughts he would express there are many every one has come from the head of a paleface it is now twenty winters since i took the scalp of a red man i shall never take another we want all of our own warriors to drive back the strangers  brothers some injins tell us of different tribes they talk about distant tribes as strangers i tell you we are all children of the same father all our skins are red i see no difference between an ojebway and a sac or a sioux i love even a cherokee here very decided signs of dissatisfaction were manifested by several of the listeners parties of the tribes of the great lakes having actually marched as far as the gulf of mexico to make war on the indians of that region who were generally hated by them with the most intense hatred he has the blood of our fathers in him we are brothers and should live together as brothers if we want scalps the pale faces have plenty it is sweet to take the scalp of a paleface i know it my hand has done it often and will do it again if every injin had taken as many scalps as i have taken few of these strangers would now remain  brothers one thing more i have to say i wish to hear others and will not tell all i know this time one thing more i have to say and i now say it i have told you that we must take the scalps of all the palefaces who are now near us i thought there would have been more but the rest do not come perhaps they are frightened there are only six six scalps are not many i am sorry they are so few but we can go where there will be more one of these six is a medicineman i do not know what to think it may be good to take his scalp it may be bad medicinemen have great power you have seen what this beehunter can do he knows how to talk with bees them little insects can fly into small places and see things that injins cannot see the great spirit made them so when we get back all the land we shall get the bees with it and may then hold a council to say what it is best to do with them until we know more i do not wish to touch the scalp of that beehunter it may do us great harm i knew a medicineman of the palefaces to lose his scalp and smallpox took off half the band that made him prisoner and killed him it is not good to meddle with medicinemen a few days ago and i wanted this young mans scalp very much now i do not want it it may do us harm to touch it i wish to let him go and to take his squaw with him the rest we can scalp  peter cunningly made no allusion to margery until just before he resumed his seat though now deeply interested in her safety as for le bourdon so profound was the impression he had made that morning that few of the chiefs were surprised at the exemption proposed in his favor the superstitious dread of witchcraft is very general among the american savages and it certainly did seem to be hazardous to plot the death of a man who had even the bees that were humming on all sides of them under his control he might at that very moment be acquainted with all that was passing and several of the grimlooking and veteran warriors who sat in the circle and who appeared to be men able and willing to encounter aught human did not fail to remember the probability of a medicine mans knowing who were his friends and who his enemies  when peter sat down there was but one man in the circle of chiefs who was resolved to oppose his design of placing boden and margery without the pale of the condemned several were undecided scarce knowing what to think of so sudden and strange a proposition but could not be said to have absolutely adhered to the original scheme of cutting off all the exception was ungque this mana chief by a sort of sufferance rather than as a rightwas deadly hostile to peters influence as has been said and was inclined to oppose all his plans though compelled by policy to be exceedingly cautious how he did it here however was an excellent opportunity to strike a blow and he was determined not to neglect it still so wily was this indian so much accustomed to put a restraint on his passions and wishes that he did not immediately arise with the impetuous ardor of frank impulses to make his reply but awaited his time  an indian is but a man after all and is liable to his weaknesses notwithstanding the selfcommand he obtains by severe drilling bough of the oak was to supply a proof of this truth he had been so unexpectedly successful in his late attempt at eloquence that it was not easy to keep him off his feet now that another good occasion to exhibit his powers offered he was accordingly the next to speak  my brothers said bough of the oak i am named after a tree you all know that tree it is not good for bows or arrows it is not good for canoes it does not make the best fire though it will burn and is hot when well lighted there are many things for which the tree after which i am named is not good it is not good to eat it has no sap that injins can drink like the maple it does not make good brooms but it has branches like other trees and they are tough tough branches are good the boughs of the oak will not bend like the boughs of the willow or the boughs of the ash or the boughs of the hickory  brothers i am a bough of the oak i do not like to bend when my mind is made up i wish to keep it where it was first put my mind has been made up to take the scalps of all the palefaces who are now in the openings i do not want to change it my mind can break but it can not bend it is tough  having uttered this brief but sententious account of his view of the matter at issue the chief resumed his seat reasonably well satisfied with this his second attempt to be eloquent that day his success this time was not as unequivocal as on the former occasion but it was respectable several of the chiefs saw a reasonable if not a very logical analogy between a mans name and his mind and to them it appeared a tolerably fair inference that a man should act up to his name if his name was tough he ought to be tough too in this it does not strike us that they argued very differently from civilized beings who are only too apt to do that which their better judgments really condemn because they think they are acting in character as it is termed  ungque was both surprised and delighted with this unexpected support from bough of the oak he knew enough of human nature to understand that a newborn ambition that of talking against the great mysterious chief peter was at the bottom of this unexpected opposition but with this he was pleased rather than otherwise an opposition that is founded in reason may always be reasoned down if reasons exist therefor but an opposition that has its rise in any of the passions is usually somewhat stubborn all this the meanlooking chief or the weasel understood perfectly and appreciated highly he thought the moment favorable and was disposed to strike while the iron was hot rising after a decent interval had elapsed this wily indian looked about him as if awed by the presence in which he stood and doubtful whether he could venture to utter his thoughts before so many wise chiefs having made an impression by this air of diffidence he commenced his harangue  i am called the weasel he said modestly my name is not taken from the mightiest tree of the forest like that of my brother it is taken from a sort of ratan animal that lives by its wits i am well named when my tribe gave me that name it was just all injins have not names my great brother who told us once that we ought to take the scalp of every white man but who now tells us that we ought not to take the scalp of every white man has no name he is called peter by the palefaces it is a good name but it is a paleface name i wish we knew the real name of my brother we do not know his nation or his tribe some say he is an ottawa some an iowa some even think him a sioux i have heard he was a delaware from toward the rising sun some but they must be injins with forked tongues think and say he is a cherokee i do not believe this it is a lie it is said to do my brother harm wicked injins will say such things but we do not mind what they say it is not necessary  my brothers i wish we knew the tribe of this great chief who tells us to take scalps and then tells us not to take scalps then we might understand why he has told us two stories i believe all he says but i should like to know why i believe it it is good to know why we believe things i have heard what my brother has said about letting this beehunter go to his own people but i do not know why he believes this is best it is because i am a poor injin perhaps and because i am called the weasel i am an animal that creeps through small holes that is my nature the bison jumps through open prairies and a horse is wanted to catch him it is not so with the weasel he creeps through small holes but he always looks where he goes  the unknown chief who belongs to no tribe talks of this bee hunters squaw he is afraid of so great a medicineman and wishes him to go and take all in his wigwam with him he has no squaw there is a young squaw in his lodge but she is not his squaw there is no need of letting her go on his account if we take her scalp he cannot hurt us in that my brother is wrong the bees have buzzed too near his ears weasels can hear as well as other animals and i have heard that this young squaw is not this bee hunters squaw  if injins are to take the scalps of all the palefaces why should we not begin with these who are in our hands when the knife is ready and the head is ready nothing but the hand is wanting plenty of hands are ready too and it does not seem good to the eyes of a poor miserable weasel who has to creep through very small holes to catch his game to let that game go when it is taken if my great brother who has told us not to scalp this beehunter and her he calls his squaw will tell us the name of his tribe i shall be glad i am an ignorant injin and like to learn all i can i wish to learn that perhaps it will help us to understand why he gave one counsel yesterday and another today there is a reason for it i wish to know what it is  ungque now slowly seated himself he had spoken with great moderation as to manner and with such an air of humility as one of our own demagogues is apt to assume when he tells the people of their virtues and seems to lament the whole time that he himself was one of the meanest of the great human family peter saw at once that he had a cunning competitor and had a little difficulty in suppressing all exhibition of the fiery indignation he actually felt at meeting opposition in such a quarter peter was artful and practised in all the wiles of managing men but he submitted to use his means to attain a great end the virtual extinction of the white race was his object and in order to effect it there was little he would have hesitated to do now however when for the first time in many years a glimmering of human feeling was shining on the darkness of his mind he found himself unexpectedly opposed by one of those whom he had formerly found so difficult to persuade into his own dire plans had that one been a chief of any renown the circumstances would have been more tolerable but here was a man presuming to raise his voice against him who so far as he knew anything of his past career had not a single claim to open his mouth in such a council with a volcano raging within that such a state of things would be likely to kindle in the breast of a savage who had been for years a successful and nearly unopposed leader the mysterious chief rose to reply  my brother says he is a weasel observed peter looking round at the circle of interested and grave countenances by which he was surrounded that is a very small animal it creeps through very small holes but not to do good it is good for nothing when it goes through a small hole it is not to do the injins a service but for its own purposes i do not like weasels  my brother is not afraid of a beehunter can he tell us what a bee whispers if he can i wish he would tell us let him show our young men where there is more honeywhere they can find bears meat for another feastwhere they can find warriors hid in the woods  my brother says the beehunter has no squaw how does he know this has he lived in the lodge with thempaddled in the same canoeeat of the same venison a weasel is very small it might steal into the beehunters lodge and see what is there what is doing what is eaten who is his squaw and who is nothas this weasel ever done so i never saw him there  brothers the great spirit has his own way of doing things he does not stop to listen to weasels he knows there are such animals there are snakes and toads and skunks the great spirit knows them all but he does not mind them he is wise and hearkens only to his own mind so should it be with a council of great chiefs it should listen to its own mind that is wisdom to listen to the mind of a weasel is folly  brothers you have been told that this weasel does not know the tribe of which i am born why should you know it injins once were foolish while the palefaces were getting one huntingground after another from them they dug up the hatchet against their own friends they took each others scalps injin hated injintribe hated tribe i am of no tribe and no one can hate me for my people you see my skin it is red that is enough i scalp and smoke and talk and go on weary paths for all injins and not for any tribe i am without a tribe some call me the tribeless it is better to bear that name than to be called a weasel i have done  peter had so much success by this argumentum ad hominem that most present fancied that the weasel would creep through some hole and disappear not so however with ungque he was a demagogue after an indian fashion and this is a class of men that ever make capital of abuses as we americans say in our moneygetting habits instead of being frightened off the ground he arose to answer as promptly as if a practised debater though with an air of humility so profound that no one could take offence at his presumption  the unknown chief has answered he said i am glad i love to hear his words my ears are always open when he speaks and my mind is stronger i now see that it is good he should not have a tribe he may be a cherokee and then our warriors would wish him ill this was a homethrust most artfully concealed a cherokee being the indian of all others the most hated by the chiefs presentthe carthaginians of those western romans it is better he should not have a tribe than be a cherokee he might better be a weasel  brothers we have been told to kill all the palefaces i like that advice the land cannot have two owners if a paleface owns it an injin cannot if an injin owns it a paleface cannot but the chief without a tribe tells us not to kill all he tells us to kill all but the beehunter and his squaw he thinks this beehunter is a medicine beehunter and may do us injins great harm he wishes to let him go  brothers this is not my way of thinking it is better to kill the beehunter and his squaw while we can that there may be no more such medicine beehunters to frighten us injins if one beehunter can do so much harm what would a tribe of beehunters do i do not want to see any more it is a dangerous thing to know how to talk with bees it is best that no one should have that power i would rather never taste honey again than live among palefaces that can talk with bees  brothers it is not enough that the palefaces know so much more than the red men but they must get the bees to tell them where to find honey to find bears to find warriors no let us take the scalp of the beetalker and of his squaw that there may never be such a medicine again i have spoken  peter did not rise again he felt that his dignity was involved in maintaining silence various chiefs now uttered their opinions in brief sententious language for the first time since he began to preach his crusade the current was setting against the mysterious chief the weasel said no more but the hints he had thrown out were improved on by others it is with savages as with civilized men a torrent must find vent peter had the sagacity to see that by attempting further to save le bourdon and margery he should only endanger his own ascendancy without effecting his purpose here he completely overlaid the art of ungque turning his own defeat into an advantage after the matter had been discussed for fully an hour and this mysterious chief perceived that it was useless to adhere to his new resolution he gave it up with as much tact as the sagacious wellington himself could manifest in yielding catholic emancipation or parliamentary reform or just in season to preserve an appearance of floating in the current and with a grace that disarmed his opponents  brothers said peter by way of closing the debate i have not seen straight fog sometimes gets before the eyes and we cannot see i have been in a fog the breath of my brother has blown it away i now see clearly i see that beehunters ought not to live let this one dielet his squaw die too  this terminated the discussion as a matter of course it was solemnly decided that all the palefaces then in the openings should be cut off in acquiescing in this decision peter had no mental reservations he was quite sincere when after sitting two hours longer in order to arrange still more important points the council arose it was with his entire assent to the decision the only power he retained over the subject was that of directing the details of the contemplated massacre     chapter xxiii       why is that graceful female here      with yon red hunter of the deer      of gentle mien and shape she seems      for civil halls designd      yet with the stately savage walks      as she were of his kind                             pinkney   the family at castle meal saw nothing of any indian until the day that succeeded the council gershom and dorothy received the tidings of their sisters marriage with very little emotion it was an event they expected and as for bridecake and ceremonies of one there was none at all and of the other no more than has been mentioned the relatives of margery did not break their hearts on account of the neglect with which they had been treated but received the young couple as if one had given her away and the other had pulled off her glove as young ladies now express it in deference to the act that generally gives the coup de grace to youthful female friendships on the openings neither time nor breath is wasted in useless compliments and all was held to be well done on this occasion because it was done legally a question might have been raised indeed whether that marriage had taken place under the american or under the english flag for general hull in surrendering detroit had included the entire territory of michigan as well as troops present troops absent and troops on the march to join him had he been in possession of peters ruthless secret which we happen to know he was not he could not have been more anxious to throw the mantle of british authority around all of his race on that remote frontier than he proved himself to be still it is to be presumed that the marriage would have been regarded as legal conquered territories usually preserving their laws and usages for a time at least a little joking passed as a matter of course for this is de rigueur in all marriages except in the cases of the most cultivated and certainly neither the corporal nor gershom belonged to the elite of human society  about the hour of breakfast pigeonswing came in as if returning from one of his ordinary hunts he brought with him venison as well as several wild ducks that he had killed in the kalamazoo and three or four prairie hens the chippewa never betrayed exultation at the success of his exertions but on this occasion he actually appeared sad dorothy received his game and as she took the ducks and other fowls she spoke to him  thank you pigeonswing said the young matron no paleface could be a better provider and many are not onehalf as good  what provider mean eh demanded the literalminded savage mean good mean bad eh  oh it means good of course i could say nothing against a hunter who takes so good care of us all  what he mean den  it means a man who keeps his wife and children well supplied with food  you get nough eh  i get enough pigeonswing thanks to your industry such as it is injin diet however is not always the best for christian folk though a body may live on it i miss many things out here in the openings to which i have been used all the early part of my life  what squaw miss eh praps injin find him sometime  i thank you pigeonswing with all my heart and am just as grateful for your good intentions as i should be was you to do all you wish it is the mind that makes the marcy and not always the deed but you can never find the food of a paleface kitchen out here in the openings of michigan when a body comes to reckon up all the good things of ameriky she dont know where to begin or where to stop i miss tea as much as anything and milk comes next then theres buckwheat and coffeethough things may be found in the woods to make coffee of but tea has no substitute then i like wheaten bread and butter and potatoes and many other such articles that i was used to all my life until i came out here close to sunset as for pies and custards i cant bear to think of em now  pigeonswing looked intently at the woman as she carefully enumerated her favorites among the dishes of her homekitchen when she had ended he raised a finger looked still more significantly at her and said  why dont go back get all dem good tings better for paleface to eat paleface food and leave injin injin food  for my part pigeonswing i wish such had ever been the law venison and prairiefowls and wild ducks and trout arid bears meat and wild pigeons and the fish that are to be found in these western rivers are all good for them that was brought up on em but they tire an eastern palate dreadfully give me roast beef any day before buffalos hump and a good barnyard fowl before all the gamebirds that ever flew  yes dat de way paleface squaw feel bess go back and get what she like bess go quick as she cango today  im in no such hurry pigeonswing and i like these openings well enough to stay a while longer and see what all these injins that they tell me are about em mean to do now we are fairly among your people and on good terms with them it is wisest to stay where we are these are wartimes and travelling is dangerous they tell me when gershom and bourdon are ready to start i shall be ready  bess get ready now rejoined pigeonswing who having given this advice with point as to manner proceeded to the spring where he knelt and slaked his thirst the manner of the chippewa was such as to attract the attention of the missionary who full of his theory imagined that this desire to get rid of the whites was in some way or other connected with a reluctance in the indians to confess themselves jews he had been quite as much surprised as he was disappointed with the backwardness of the chiefs in accepting this tradition and was now in a state of mind that predisposed him to impute everything to this one cause  i hope pigeonswing he said to the chippewa whom he had followed to the springi hope pigeonswing that no offence has been taken by the chiefs on account of what i told them yesterday concerning their being jews it is what i think and it is an honor to belong to gods chosen people and in no sense a disgrace i hope no offence has been taken on account of my telling the chief they are jews  dont care any ting bout it answered the literal indian rising from his kneeling position and wiping his mouth with the back of his hand dont care wedder jew or wedder indian  for my own part gladly would i have it to say that i am descended from israel  why dont say him if he make you grad good to be grad all injin love to be grad  because i cannot say it with truth no i come of the gentiles and not of the hebrews else would i glory in saying i am a jew in the sense of extraction though not now in the sense of faith i trust the chiefs will not take offence at my telling them just what i think  tell you he dont care returned pigeonswing a little crustily dont care if jewdont care if injin know dat make no difference huntingground just samegame just samescalps just same make no difference and dont care  i am glad of thisbut why did you advise dorothy to quit the openings in the hasty manner you did if all is right with the chiefs it is not good to start on a journey without preparation and prayer why then did you give this advice to dorothy to quit the openings so soon  bess for squaw to go home when injin dig up hatchet openin full of warriorprairie full of warriorwood full of warrior when dat so bess for squaw to go home  this would be true were the indians our enemies heaven be praised they are our friends and will not harm us peter is a great chief and can make his young men do what he tells them and peter is our friend with peter to stand by us and a merciful providence to direct us where when and how to go we can have nothing to fear i trust in divine providence  who he be asked pigeonswing innocently for his knowledge of english did not extend far enough to comprehend a phrase so complicated though so familiar to ourselves he know all paths eh  yes and directs us on all pathsmore especially such as are for our good  bess get him to tell you path into detroit dat good path now for all palefaces  on uttering this advice which he did also somewhat pointedly the chippewa left the spring and walked toward the kennel of hive where the beehunter was busy feeding his old companion  youre welcome back pigeonswing the last cordially remarked without pausing in his occupation however i saw that you came in loaded as usual have you left any dead game in the openings for me to go and back in with you  you open ear bourdonyou know what injin say returned the chippewa earnestly when dog get nough come wid me got someting to tell bess hear it when he can hear it  youll find me ready enough in a minute there hive my good fellow that ought to satisfy any reasonable dog and ive never found you unreasonable yet well chippewa here i am with my ears wide openstop ive a bit of news first for your ears do you know pigeonswing my good fellow that i am married  marry eh got squaw eh where you get him  here to be surewhere else should i get her there is but one girl in these openings that i would ask to be my wife and she has been asked and answered yes parson amen married us yesterday on our way in from

white squawbess home at work  i believe i understand what you mean pigeon well home we mean to go before the winter sets in and when matters have a little settled down between the english and yankees it isnt safe travelling just now in michiganyou must own that yourself my good fellow  the indian appeared at a loss now how to express himself further on one side was his faith to his color and his dread of peter and the great chiefs on the other his strong regard for the bee hunter he pondered a moment and then took his own manner of communicating that which he wished to say the fact that his friend was married made no great difference in his advice for the indian was much too shrewd an observer not to have detected the bee hunters attachment he had not supposed it possible to separate his friend from the family of gershom though he did suppose there would be less difficulty in getting him to go on a path different from that which the missionary and corporal might take his own great purpose was to serve le bourdon and how many or how few might incidentally profit by it he did not care the truth compels us to own that even margerys charms and nature and warmhearted interest in all around her had failed to make any impression on his marblelike feelings while the beehunters habits skill in his craft and close connection with himself at the mouth of the river and more especially in liberating him from his enemies had united him in a comrades friendship with her husband it was a little singular that this chippewa did not fall into peters superstitious dread of the beehunters necromancy though he was aware of all that had passed the previous day on the prairie either on account of his greater familiarity with le bourdons habits or because he was in the secret of the trick of the whiskeyspring or from a closer knowledge of white men and their ways this young indian was freer from apprehensions of this nature perhaps than any one of the same color and origin within many miles of the spot in a word pigeonswing regarded the beehunter as his friend while he looked upon the other palefaces as so many persons thrown by accident in his company now that margery had actually become his friends squaw his interest in her was somewhat increased though she had never obtained that interest in his feelings that she had awakened in the breast of peter by her attentions to him her gentleness lighthearted gayety and womanly care and all without the least design on her own part  no answered the chippewa after a moments reflection no very safe for yankee or yankee injin dont tink my scalp very safe if chief knowd im yankee runner bess alway to keep scalp safe dem pottawattamie i take care not to see know all about em too know what he sayknow what he doblieve i know what

take em asleep dat bess way wid sich injin catch em some time but your ear open bourdon  wide open my good friendwhat have you to whisper in it  you look hard at peter when he come in if he tink good deal and dont say much when he do speak mind what he say if he smile and very much friend must hab his scalp  chippewa peter is my friend lives in my cabin and eats of my bread the hand that touches him touches me  which bess ehhis scalp or yourn if he very much friend when he comes in his scalp muss come off or yourn yes juss so dat de way know injin better dan you know him bourdon you good bee hunter but poor injin ebbery body hab his wayinjin got his peter laugh and very much friend when he come home den he mean to hab your scalp if dont smile and dont seem very much friend but look down and tink tink tink den he no mean to hurt you but try to get you out of hand of chiefs dat all  as pigeonswing concluded he walked coolly away leaving his friend to ruminate on the alternative of scalp or no scalp the beehunter now understood the chippewa perfectly he was aware that this man had means of his own to ascertain what was passing around him in the openings and he had the utmost confidence in his integrity and good wishes if a red man is slow to forget an injury he never forgets a favor in this he was as unlike as possible to most of the pale faces who were supplanting his race for these last had and have as extraordinary a tenacity in losing sight of benefits as they have in remembering wrongs  by some means or other it was now clear that pigeonswing foresaw that a crisis was at hand had le bourdon been as disconnected and solitary as he was when he first met the chippewa it is not probable that either the words or the manner of his friend would have produced much impression on him so little accustomed was he to dwell on the hazards of his frontier position but the case was now altogether changed margery and her claims stood foremost in his mind and through margery came dolly and her husband there was no mistaking pigeonswings intention it was to give warning of some immediate danger and a danger that in some way was connected with the deportment of peter it was easy enough to comprehend the allusions to the mysterious chiefs smiles and melancholy and the beehunter understood that he was to watch that indians manner and take the alarm or bestow his confidence accordingly  le bourdon was not left long in doubt peter arrived about halfan hour after pigeonswing had gone to seek his rest and from the instant he came in sight our hero discerned the thoughtful eye and melancholy manner these signs were still more obvious when the tribeless indian came nearer so obvious indeed as to strike more than one of those who were interested observers of all that this extraordinary being said and did among others margery was the first to see this change and the first to let it influence her own manner this she did notwithstanding le bourdon had said nothing to her on the subject and in defiance of the bashful feelings of a bride which under circumstances less marked might have induced her to keep more in the background as peter stopped at the spring to quench his thirst margery was in truth the first to approach and to speak to him  you seem weary peter said the young wife somewhat timidly as to voice and air but with a decided and honest manifestation of interest in what she was about nor had margery gone emptyhanded she took with her a savory dish one of those that the men of the woods lovemeat cooked in its own juices and garnished with several little additions that her skill in the arts of civilized life enabled her to supply  you seem tired peter and if i did not fear to say it i should tell you that you also seem sad said margery as she placed her dish on a rude table that was kept at the spot for the convenience of those who seldom respected hours or regularity of any sort in their meals here is food that you like which i have cooked with my own hands  the indian looked intently at the timid and charming young creature who came forward thus to contribute to his comforts and the saddened expression of his countenance deepened he was fatigued and hungry and he ate for some time without speaking beyond uttering a brief expression of his thanks when his appetite was appeased however and she who had so sedulously attended to his wants was about to remove the remains of the dish he signed with his finger for her to draw nearer intimating that he had something to say margery obeyed without hesitation though the color flitted in her face like the changes in an evening sky but so much good will and confidence had been awakened between these two that a daughter would not have drawn near to a father with more confidence than margery stood before peter  medicineman do what i tell him young squaw eh demanded peter smiling slightly and for the first time since they had met  by medicineman do you mean mr amen or bourdon the bride asked in her turn her whole face reflecting the confusion she felt scarcely knowing why  bot one medicineman say his prayer todder medicineman take young squaws hand and lead her into his wigwam dat what i mean  i am married to bourdon returned margery dropping her eyes to the ground if that be what you wish to know i hope you think i shall have a good husband peter  hope so toonebber know till time come all good for little whileinjin good squaw good juss like weadder sometime rain sometime stormsometime sunshine juss so wid injin juss so wid paleface no difference all same you see dat cloudhe little now but let wind blow he grow big and you see nuttin but cloud let him have plenty of sunshine and he go away den all clear over head dat bess way to live wid husband  and that is the way which bourdon and i will always live together when we get back among our own people peter and are living comfortably in a paleface wigwam with paleface food and pale face drinks and all the other good things of paleface housekeeping about us then i hope you will come and see how happy we are and pass some time with us every year i wish you to come and see us and to bring us venison and bourdon will give you powder and lead and blankets and all you may want unless it be firewater fire water he has promised never again to give to an injin  no find any more whiskeyspring eh demanded peter greatly interested in the young womans natural and warmhearted manner of proposing her hospitalities so bessso bess great curse for injin plenty honey no firewater all dat good and i come if  here peter stopped nor could all margerys questions induce him to complete the sentence his gaze at the earnest countenance of the bride was such as to give her an indefinite sort of uneasiness not to say a feeling of alarm  still no explanation passed between them margery remained near peter for some time administering to his wants and otherwise demeaning herself much as a daughter might have done at length le bourdon joined them the salutations were friendly and the manner in which the mysterious chief regarded the equally mysterious bee hunter was not altogether without a certain degree of awe boden perceived this and was not slow to comprehend that he owed this accession of influence to the scene which had occurred on the prairie  is the great council ended peter asked the beehunter when the little interval of silence had been observed  yes it over no more council now on prairie round  and the chiefshave they all gone on their proper paths what has become of my old acquaintance crowsfeather and all the rest of thembears meat in particular  all gone no more council now agree what to do and so go away  but are red men always as good as their words do they perform always what they promise  sartain ebbery man ought do what he say dat injin lawno pale face law eh  it may be the law peter and a very good law it is but we white men do not always mind our own laws  dat badgreat spirit dont like dat returned peter looking grave and slowly shaking his head dat very bad when injin say he do it den he do it if he can if cant no help for it send squaw away now bourdonbess not to let squaw hear what men say or will always want to hear  le bourdon laughed as he turned to margery and repeated these words the young wife colored but she took it in good part and ran up toward the palisaded lodge like one who was glad to be rid of her companions peter waited a few moments then turning his head slowly in all directions to make sure of not being overheard he began to lay open his mind  you been on prairie round bourdonyou see injin derechief warrior young men hunter all dere  i saw them all peter and a goodly sight it waswhat between paint and medals and bows and arrows and tomahawks and all your bravery  you like to see him eh yes he fine ting to look at well dat council call togedder by meyou know dat too bourdon  i have heard you say that such was your intention and i suppose you did it chief they tell me you have great power among your own people and that they do very much as you tell them to do  peter looked graver than ever at this remark and one of his startling gleams of ferocity passed over his dark countenance then he answered with his customary selfcommand  sometime so he said sometime not so yesterday not so dere is chief dat want to put peter under his foot he try but he no do it i know peter well and know dat chief too  this is news to me peter and i am surprised to hear it i did think that even the great tecumthe was scarcely as big a chief as you are yourself  yes pretty big chief dat true but among injin ebbery man can speak and nebber know which way council go sometime he go one way sometime he go tudder you hear bough of oak speak eh tell me dat  you will remember that i heard none of your speakers on prairie round peter i do not remember any such orator as this bough of oak  he great rascal said peter who had picked up some of the garrison expressions among those from whom he acquired the knowledge of english he possessed such as it was listen bourdon nebber bess stand too much in peters way  the beehunter laughed freely at this remark for his own success the previous day and the impression he had evidently made on that occasion emboldened him to take greater liberties with the mysterious chief than had been his wont  i should think that peter cried the young man gaylyi should think all that for one i should choose to get out of it the path you travel is your own and all wise men will leave you to journey along it in your own fashion  yes dat bess way answered the great chief with admirable simplicity dont like when he says yes to hear anudder chief say no dat ant good way to do business  these were expressions caught from the trading whites and were often used by those who got their english from them i tell you one ting bourdondat bough of oak very foolish injin if he put foot on my path  this is plain enough peter rejoined le bourdon who was unconcernedly repairing some of the tools of his ordinary craft by the way i am greatly in your debt i learn for one thing they tell me ive got my squaw in my wigwam a good deal sooner by your advice than i might have otherwise done margery is now my wife i suppose you know and i thank you heartily for helping me to get married so much sooner than i expected to be  here peter grasped bourdon by the hand and poured out his whole soul secret hopes fears and wishes on this occasion he spoke in the indian dialectone of those that he knew the beehunter understood and we translate what he said freely into english preserving as much of the original idiom as the change of language will permit  listen hunter of the bee the great medicine of the palefaces and hear what a chief that knows the red men is about to tell you let my words go into your ears let them stay in your mind they are words that will do you good it is not wise to let such words come out again by the hole through which they have just entered  my young friend knows our traditions they do not tell us that the injins were jews they tell us that the manitou created them red men they tell us that our fathers used these huntinggrounds ever since the earth was placed on the back of the big tortoise which upholds it the palefaces say the earth moves if this be true it moves as slowly as the tortoise walks it cannot have gone far since the great spirit lifted his hand off it if it move the hunting grounds move with it and the tribes move with their own hunting grounds it may be that some of the palefaces are lost but no injin is lostthe medicinepriest is mistaken he has looked so often in his book that he sees nothing but what is there he does not see what is before his eyes at his side behind his back ail around him i have known such injins they see but one thing even the deer jump across their paths and are not seen  such are our traditions they tell us that this land was given to the red men and not to palefaces that none but red men have any right to hunt here the great spirit has laws he has told us these laws they teach us to love our friends and to hate our enemies you dont believe this bourdon observing the beehunter to wince a little as if he found the doctrine bad  this is not what our priests tell us answered le bourdon they tell us that the white mans god commands us to love all aliketo do good to our enemies to love them that wish us harm and to treat all men as we would wish men to treat us  peter was a good deal surprised at this doctrine and it was nearly a minute before he resumed the discourse he had recently heard it several times and it was slowly working its way into his mind  such are our traditions and such are our laws look at me fifty winters have tried to turn my hair white time can do that the hair is the only part of an injin that ever turns white all the rest of him is red that is his color the game knows an injin by his color the tribes know him everything knows him by his color he knows the things which the great spirit has given him in the same way he gets used to them and they are his acquaintances he does not like strange things he does not like strangers white men are strangers and he does not like to see them on his huntingground if they come singly to kill a few buffaloes or to look for honey or to catch beaver the injins would not complain they love to give of their abundance the palefaces do not come in this fashion they do not come as guests they come as masters they come and they stay each year of my fifty have i heard of new tribes that have been driven by them toward the setting sun  bourdon for many seasons i have thought of this i have tried to find a way to stop them there is but one that way must the injins try or give up their huntinggrounds to the strangers no nation likes to give up its huntinggrounds they come from the manitou and one day he may ask to have them back again what could the red men say if they let the palefaces take them away no this we cannot do we will first try the one thing that is to be done  i believe i understand you peter observed le bourdon finding that his companion paused you mean war war in the injin mode of redressing all wrongs war against man woman and child  peter nodded in acquiescence fixing his glowing eyes on the bee hunters face as if to read his soul  am i to understand then that you and your friends the chiefs and their followers that i saw on prairie round mean to begin with us halfadozen whites of whom two are women who happen to be here in your powerthat our scalps are to be the first taken  firstno bourdon peters hand has taken a great many years since he has got a name for his deeds and no longer dare go to the white mens forts he does not look for yankees he looks for pale faces when he meets a paleface on the prairies or in the woods he tries to get his scalp this has he done for years and many has he taken  this is a bloody account you are giving of yourself peter and i would rather you should not have told it some such account i have heard before but living with you and eating and drinking and sleeping and travelling in your company i had not only hoped but begun to think it was not true  it is true my wish is to cut off the palefaces this must be done or the palefaces will cut off the injins there is no choice one nation or the other must be destroyed i am a red man my heart tells me that the palefaces should die they are on strange huntinggrounds not the red men they are wrong we are right but bourdon i have friends among the palefaces and it is not natural to scalp our friends i do not understand a religion that tells us to love our enemies and to do good to them that do harm to usit is a strange religion i am a poor injin and do not know what to think i shall not believe that any do this till i see it i understand that we ought to love our friends your squaw is my daughter i have called her daughtershe knows it and my tongue is not forked like a snakes what it says i mean once i meant to scalp your young squaw because she was a paleface squaw and might be the mother of more now i do not mean to scalp her my hand shall never harm her my wisdom shall tell her to escape from the hands of red men who seek her scalp you too now you are her husband and are a great medicineman of the bees my hand shall not hurt you either open your ears wide for big truths must go into them  peter then related in full his attempt to procure a safe passage for le bourdon and margery into the settlements and its total failure he owned that by his previous combinations he had awakened a spirit among the indians that his present efforts could not quell in a word he told the whole story as it must have been made apparent to the reader and he now came with his plans to defeat the very schemes that he had himself previously projected one thing however that he did not conceal filled the mind of his listener with horror and created so strong an aversion to acting in concert with one who could even allude to it so coolly that there was danger of breaking off all communications between the parties and placing the result purely on force a course that must have proved totally destructive to all the whites the difficulty arose from a naive confession of peters that he did not even wish to save any but le bourdon and margery and that he still desired the deaths of all the others himself     chapter xxiv       for thou wert born of woman thou didst come      o holiest to this world of sin and gloom      not in thy dread omnipotent array      and not by thunders strewed      was thy tempestuous road      nor indignation burnt before thee on thy way      but thee a soft and naked child      thy mother undefiled      in the rude manger laid to rest      from off her virgin breast   the blood of the beehunter curdled in his veins as he listened to peters businesslike and direct manner of treating this terrible subject putting the most favorable view on his situation it was frightful to look on admitting that this fanatical savage were sincere in all his professions of a wish to save him and margery and le bourdon did not nay could not doubt this after his calm but ferocious revelations but admitting all this to be true how was he to escape with his charming bride environed as they were by so large a band of hostile indians then the thought of abandoning his other companions and attempting in cold selfishness to escape with margery alone was more than he could bear never before in his adventurous and bold life had le bourdon been so profoundly impressed with a sense of his danger or so much overcome  still our hero was not unmanned he saw all the hazards as it were at a glance and felt how terrible might be the result should they really fall into the hands of the warriors excited to exercise their ingenuity in devising the means of torture and he gazed into the frightful perspective with a manly steadiness that did him credit even while he sickened at the prospect  peter had told his story in a way to add to its horrible character there was a manner of truth of directness of work if one may use such an expression on such a subject that gave a graphic reality to all he said as if his task was done the mysterious chief now coolly arose and moved away to a little grove in which the missionary and the corporal had thrown themselves on the grass where they lay speculating on the probable course that the bands in their neighborhood would next pursue so thoroughly possessed was the clergyman with his one idea however that he was expressing regret at his failure in the attempt to convince the savages that they were jews when peter joined them  you tiredyou lie down in daytime like sick squaw eh asked the indian in a slightly satirical manner bess be up sich fine day and go wid me to see some more chief  most gladly peter returned the missionary springing to his feet with alacrityand i shall have one more opportunity to show your friends the truth of what i have told them  yes injin love to hear truthate to hear lie can tell em all you want to say he go too eh pointing to the corporal who rather hung back as if he saw that in the invitation which was not agreeable to him  i will answer for my friend returned the confiding missionary cheerfully lead on peter and we will follow  thus pledged the corporal no longer hesitated but he accompanied parson amen as the latter fell into the tracks of the chief and proceeded rapidly in the direction of the spring in the piece of bottomland where the council first described had been held this spot was about two miles from the palisaded house and quite out of view as well as out of reach of sound as they walked side by side taking the footsteps of the great chief for their guides the corporal however expressed to his companion his dislike of the whole movement  we ought to stand by our garrison in times like these mr amen said the wellmeaning soldier a garrison is a garrison and injins seldom do much on a wellbuilt and boldlydefended spot of that natur they want artillery without which their assaults are never very formidable  why talk you of warlike means corporal when we are in the midst of friends is not peter our known and welltried associate one with whom you and i have travelled far and do we not know that we have friends among these chiefs whom we are now going to visit the lord has led me into these distant and savage regions to carry his word and to proclaim his name and a most unworthy and unprofitable servant should i prove were i to hesitate about approaching them i am appointed to teach no no fear nothing i will not say that you carry caesar and his fortunes as i have heard was once said of old but i will say you follow one who is led of god and who marches with the certainty of being divinely commanded  the corporal was ashamed to oppose so confident an enthusiasm and he offered no further resistance together the two followed their leader who turning neither to the right hand nor to the left soon had them out of sight of the castle and well on their way toward the spring when about half the distance was made the direction took the party through a little thicket or rather along its margin and the missionary a good deal to his surprise saw pigeonswing within the cover seemingly preparing for another hunt this young warrior had so lately returned from one excursion of this nature that he was not expected to go forth so soon on another nor was he accustomed to go out so early in the day this was the hour in which he ordinarily slept but there he was beyond a question and apparently looking at the party as it passed so cold was his manner however and so indifferent did he seem that no one would have suspected that he knew aught of what was in contemplation having satisfied himself that his friend the beehunter was not one of those who followed peter the chippewa turned coldly away and began to examine the flint of his rifle the corporal noted this manner and it gave him additional confidence to proceed for he could not imagine that any human being would manifest so much indifference when sinister designs existed  peter turned neither to the right hand nor to the left until he had led the way down upon the little arena of bottomland already described and which was found well sprinkled with savages a few stood or sat about in groups earnestly conversing but most lay extended at length on the green sward in the indolent repose that is so grateful to an indian warrior in his hours of inaction the arrival of peter however instantly put a new face on the appearance of matters every man started to his feet and additions were made to those who were found in the arena by those who came out of the adjacent thickets until some two or three hundred of the red men were assembled in a circle around the newlyarrived palefaces  there said peter sternly fastening his eye with a hostile expression on bough of the oak and ungque in particularthere are your captives do with them as you will as for them that have dared to question my faith let them own that they are liars  this was not a very amicable salutation but savages are accustomed to plain language bough of the oak appeared a little uneasy and ungques countenance denoted dissatisfaction but the last was too skilful an actor to allow many of the secrets of his plotting mind to shine through the windows of his face as for the crowd at large gleams of content passed over the bright red faces illuminating them with looks of savage joy murmurs of approbation were heard and crowsfeather addressed the throng there where it stood encircling the two helpless and as yet but halfalarmed victims of so fell a plot  my brothers and my young men can now see said this pottawattamie that the tribeless chief has an injin heart his heart is not a paleface heartit is that of a red man some of our chiefs have thought that he had lived too much with the strangers and that he had forgotten the traditions of our fathers and was listening to the song of the medicine priest some thought that he believed himself lost and a jew and not an injin this is not so peter knows the path he is on he knows that he is a redskin and he looks on the yankees as enemies the scalps he has taken are so numerous they cannot be counted he is ready to take more here are two that he gives to us when we have done with these two captives he will bring us more he will continue to bring them until the palefaces will be as few as the deer in their own clearings such is the will of the manitou  the missionary understood all that was said and he was not a little appalled at the aspect of things for the first time he began to apprehend that he was in danger so much was this devout and well intentioned servant of his church accustomed to place his dependence on a superintending providence that apprehension of personal suffering seldom had any influence on his exertions he believed himself to be an object of especial care though he was ever ready to admit that the wisdom which human minds cannot compass might order events that at first sight would seem to be opposed to that which ought to be permitted to come to pass in this particular parson amen was a model of submission firmly believing that all that happened was in furtherance of the great scheme of mans regeneration and eventual salvation  with the corporal it was very different accustomed to war with red men and most acquainted with them in their worst character he ever suspected treachery and had followed peter with a degree of reluctance he had not cared to express he now thoroughly took the alarm however and stood on his guard although he did not comprehend more than half of that which peter had said he understood quite enough to see that he and the missionary were surrounded by enemies if not by executioners  we have fallen into a sort of ambush here parson amen cried the corporal rattling his arms as he looked to their condition and its high time we beat the general if there were four on us we might form a square but being only two the best thing we can do will be to stand back to back and for one to keep an eye on the right flank while he natrally watches all in front and for the other to keep an eye on the left flank while he sees to the rear place your back close to mine and take the left flank into your part of the lookout closer closer my good sir we must stand solid as rooted trees to make anything of a stand  the missionary in his surprise permitted the corporal to assume the position described though conscious of its uselessness in their actual condition as for the indians the corporals manner and the rattling of his arms induced the circle to recede several paces though nothing like alarm prevailed among them the effect nevertheless was to leave the two captives space for their evolutions and a sort of breathing time this little change had the appearance of something like success and it greatly encouraged the corporal he began to think it even possible to make a retreat that would be as honorable as any victory  steadykeep shoulder to shoulder parson amen and take care of your flank our movement must be by our left flank and everything depends on keeping that clear i shall have to give you my baggonet for youre entirely without arms which leaves my rear altogether exposed  think nothing of your arms brother flintthey would be useless in my hands in any case and were we made of muskets they could be of no use against these odds my means of defence come from on high my armor is faith and my only weapon prayer i shall not hesitate to use the last on this as on all other occasions  the missionary then called on the circle of curious savages by whom he was surrounded and who certainly contemplated nothing less than his death in common with those of all his white companions to unite with him in addressing the throne of grace accustomed to preach and pray to these people in their own dialect the worthy parson made a strong appeal to their charities while supplicating the favors of divine providence in behalf of himself and his brother captive he asked for all the usual benedictions and blessings on his enemies and made a very happy exposition of those sublime dogmas of christianity which teach us to bless them that curse us and to pray for those who despitefully use us peter for the first time in his life was now struck with the moral beauty of such a sentiment which seldom fails when duly presented of producing an effect on even the dullest minds his curiosity was touched and instead of turning coldly as had been his intention and leaving the captives in the hands of those to whom he had delivered them he remained in the circle and paid the closest attention to all of the proceedings he had several times previously heard the missionary speak of this duty as a command of gods but never before had he deemed it possible to realize such a thing in practice  the indians if not absolutely awestruck by the singular spectacle before them seemed well disposed to let the missionary finish his appeal some wondering others doubting and all more or less at a loss to know what to make of an exhibition so unusual there stood the corporal with his back pressed closely to that of his companion his musket at make ready and his whole mien that of a man with every nerve screwed to the stickingpoint while the missionary the other side of the picture with outstretched arms was lifting his voice in prayer to the throne of the most high as this extraordinary scene continued the corporal grew excited and ere long his voice was occasionally heard blended with that of the clergyman in terms of advice and encouragement  blaze away mr amen shouted the soldier give em another volleyyoure doing wonders and their front has given ground one more such volley as the last and well make a forward movement ourselvesattentionprepare to march by the left flank as soon as there is a good opening  that good opening however was never made the savages though astonished were by no means frightened and had not the smallest idea of letting their captives escape on the contrary bears meat who acted as commanderinchief on this occasion was quite self possessed and so far from being impressed with the missionarys prayer he listened to it only in the hope of hearing some admission of weakness escape but the excitement of the corporal soon produced a crisis his attempts to make a movement by the left flank caused his column of defence to be broken and obtaining no assistance from parson amen who was still pouring out his soul in prayer while endeavoring to bring things back to their original state he suddenly found himself surrounded and disarmed from that instant the corporal changed his tactics so long as he was armed and comparatively free he had bethought him only of the means of resistance now that these were denied him he submitted and summoned all his resolution to bear the penalties of his captivity in a manner that might not do discredit to his regiment this was the third time that corporal flint had been a prisoner among the indians and he was not now to learn the nature of their tender mercies his forebodings were not of the most pleasant character but that which could not be helped he was disposed to bear with manly fortitude his greatest concern at that fearful moment was for the honor of his corps  all this time parson amen continued his prayer so completely was his spirit occupied with the duty of offering up his petition that he was utterly unconscious of what else had passed nor had he heard one of the corporals appeals for attention and to be steady and to march by the left flank in a word the whole man was intent on prayer and when thus employed a sixpounder discharged in the circle would hardly have disconcerted him he persevered therefore uninterrupted by his conquerors until he concluded in his own way having thus fortified his soul and asked for succor where he had now so long been accustomed to seek and to find it the worthy missionary took his seat quietly on a log on which the corporal had been previously placed by his captors  the time had arrived for the chiefs to proceed in the execution of their purposes peter profoundly struck with the prayers of the missionary in behalf of his enemies had taken a station a little on one side where he stood ruminating on what he had just heard if ever precept bore the stamp of a divine origin it is this the more we reflect on it the clearer do our perceptions of this truth become the whole scheme of christs redemption and future existence is founded in love and such a system would be imperfect while any were excluded from its benefits to love those who reciprocate our feelings is so very natural that the sympathies which engender this feeling are soonest attracted by a knowledge of their existence love producing love as power increases power but to love those who hate us and to strive to do good to those who are plotting evil against ourselves greatly exceeds the moral strength of man unaided from above this was the idea that puzzled peter and he now actually interrupted the proceedings in order to satisfy his mind on a subject so totally new to him previously however to taking this step he asked the permission of the principal chiefs awakening in their bosoms by means of his explanations some of the interest in this subject that he felt himself  brother medicineman said the mysterious chief drawing nearer to the missionary accompanied himself by bears meat crowsfeather and one or two more you have been talking to the great spirit o the palefaces we have heard your words and think them well they are good words for a man about to set out on the path that leads to the unknown lands thither we must all go some time and it matters little when we may not all travel the same path i do not think the manitou will crowd tribes of different colors together there as they are getting to be crowded together here  brother you are about to learn how all these things really are if red men and palefaces and black men are to live in the same land after death you will shortly know it my brother is about to go there he and his friend this warrior of his people will travel on that long path in company i hope they will agree by the way and not trouble each other it will be convenient to my brother to have a hunter with him the path is so long he will be hungry before he gets to the end this warrior knows how to use a musket and we shall put his arms with him in his grave  brother before you start on this journey from which no traveller ever returns let his color be what it may we wish to hear you speak further about loving our enemies this is not the indian rule the red men hate their enemies and love their friends when they ask the manitou to do anything to their enemies it is to do them harm this is what our fathers taught us it is what we teach our children why should we love them that hate us why should we do good to them that do us harm tell us now or we may never hear the reason  tell you i will peter and the lord so bless my words that they may soften your hearts and lead you all to the truth and to dependence on the mediation of his blessed son we should do good to them that do evil to us because the great spirit has commanded us so to do ask your own heart if this is not right if they sound like words that are spoken by any but those who have been taught by the manitou himself the devils tell us to revenge but god commands us to forgive it is easy to do good to them that do good to us but it tries the heart sorely to do good to them that do us evil i have spoken to you of the son of the great spirit he came on earth and told us with his own mouth all these great truths he said that next to the duty of loving the manitou was the duty of loving our neighbors no matter whether friend or enemy it was our duty to love them and do them all the good we can if there is no venison in their wigwams we should take the deer off our own poles and carry it and put on theirs why have i come here to tell you this when at home i lived under a good roof eat of abundance and slept in a soft and warm bed you know how it is here we do not know today what we shall eat tomorrow our beds are hard and our roofs are of bark i come because the son of the manitou he who came and lived among men told us to do all this his commands to his medicinemen were to go forth and tell all nations and tribes and colors the truthto tell them to love them that sought to do them harm and to do good for evil  parson amen pausing a moment to take breath ungque who detected the wavering of peters mind and who acted far more in opposition to the mysterious and tribeless chief than from any other motive profited by the occasion thus afforded to speak without this pause however the breeding of an indian would have prevented any interruption  i open my mouth to speak said the weasel in his humblest manner what i say is not fit for the wise chiefs to hear it is foolish but my mind tells me to say it does the medicineman of the pale faces tell us that the son of the great spirit came upon earth and lived among men  i do such is our belief and the religion we believe and teach cometh directly from his mouth  let the medicineman tell the chiefs how long the son of the great spirit stayed on earth and which way he went when he left it  now this question was put by ungque through profound dissimulation he had heard of the death of christ and had obtained some such idea of the great sacrifice as would be apt to occur to the mind of a savage he foresaw that the effect of the answer would be very likely to destroy most of the influence that the missionary had just been building up by means of his doctrine and his prayers parson amen was a man of singular simplicity of character but he had his misgivings touching the effect of this reply still he did not scruple about giving it or attempt in any manner to mystify or to deceive  it is a humiliating and sad story my brethren and one that ought to cause all heads to be bowed to the earth in shame he answered the son of the great spirit came among men he did nothing but good told those who heard him how to live and how to die in return for all this wicked and unbelieving men put him to death after death his body was taken up into heaventhe region of departed spirits and the dwellingplace of his fatherwhere he now is waiting for the time when he is to return to the earth to reward the good and to punish the wicked that time will surely come nor do i believe the day to be very distant  the chiefs listened to this account with grave attention some of them had heard outlines of the same history before accounts savoring of the christian history had got blended with some of their own traditions most probably the fruits of the teachings of the earlier missionaries but were so confused and altered as to be scarcely susceptible of being recognized to most of them however the history of the incarnation of the son of god was entirely new and it struck them as a most extraordinary thing altogether that any man should have injured such a being it was perhaps singular that no one of them all doubted the truth of the tradition itself this they supposed to have been transmitted with the usual care and they received it as a fact not to be disputed the construction that was put on its circumstances will best appear in the remarks that followed  if the palefaces killed the son of the great spirit said bough of the oak pointedly we can see why they wish to drive the red men from their lands evil spirits dwell in such men and they do nothing but what is bad i am glad that our great chief has told us to put the foot on this worm and crush it while yet the indian foot is large enough to do it in a few winters they would kill us as they killed the spirit that did them nothing but good  i am afraid that this mighty tradition hath a mystery in it that your indian minds will scarcely be willing to receive resumed the missionary earnestly i would not for a thousand worlds or to save ten thousand lives as worthless as my own place a straw in the way of the faith of any yet must i tell the thing as it happened this son of the great spirit was certainly killed by the jews of that day so far as he could be killed he possessed two natures as indeed do all men the body and soul in his body he was man as we all are men in his soul he was a part of the great spirit himself this is the great mystery of our religion we cannot tell how it can happen but we believe it we see around us a thousand things that we cannot understand and this is one of them  here bears meat availed himself of another pause to make a remark this he did with the keenness of one accustomed to watch words and events closely but with a simplicity that showed no vulgar disposition to scepticism  we do not expect that all the great spirit does can be clear to us indians he said we know very little he knows everything why should we think to know all that he knows we do not that part of the tradition gives us no trouble indians can believe without seeing they are not squaws that wish to look behind every bush but my brother has told too much for his own good if the palefaces killed their great spirit they can have no manitou and must be in the hands of the evil spirit this is the reason they want our huntinggrounds i will not let them come any nearer to the setting sun it is time to begin to kill them as they killed their great spirit the jews did this my brother wishes us to think that red men are jews no red men never harmed the son of the great spirit they would receive him as a friend and treat him as a chief accursed be the hand that should be raised to harm him this tradition is a wise tradition it tells us many things it tells us that injins are not jews they never hurt the son of the great spirit it tells us that the red men have always lived on these huntinggrounds and did not come from toward the rising sun it tells us that palefaces are not fit to live they are too wicked let them die  i would ask a question put in peter this tradition is not new i have heard it before it entered but a little way into my ears i did not think of it it has now entered deeper and i wish to hear more why did not the son of the great spirit kill the jewswhy did he let the jews kill him will my brother say  he came on earth to die for man whose wickedness was so deep that the great spirits justice could not be satisfied with less why this is so no one knows it is enough that it should be so instead of thinking of doing harm to his tormentors and murderers he died for them and died asking for benefits on them and on their wives and children for all time to come it was he who commanded us to do good to them that do harm to us  peter gave the utmost attention to this answer and when he had received it he walked apart musing profoundly it is worthy of being observed that not one of these savages raised any hollow objections to the incarnation of the son of the great spirit as would have been the case with so many civilized men to them this appeared no more difficult and incomprehensible than most of that which they saw around them it is when we begin to assume the airs of philosophy and to fancy because we know a little that the whole book of knowledge is within our grasp that men become sceptics there is not a human being now in existence who does not daily hourly see that which is just as much beyond his powers of comprehension as this account of the incarnation of the deity and the whole doctrine of the trinity and yet he acquiesces in that which is before his eyes because it is familiar and he sees it while he cavils at all else though the same unknown and inexplicable cause lies behind everything the deepest philosophy is soon lost in this general mystery and to the eye of a meek reason all around us is a species of miracle which must be referred to the power of the deity  while thus disposed to receive the paleface traditions with respect however the red men did not lose sight of their own policy and purposes the principal chiefs now stepped aside and held a brief council though invited to do so peter did not join them leaving to bough of the oak ungque and bears meat the control of the result the question was whether the original intention of including this medicinepriest among those to be cut off should or should not be adhered to one or two of the chiefs had their doubts but the opinion of the council was adverse  if the palefaces killed the son of their great spirit why should we hesitate about killing them the weasel asked with malicious point for he saw that peter was now sorely troubled at the probability of his own design being fully carried out there is no difference this is a medicinepriestin the wigwam is a medicine beehunter and that warrior may be a medicinewarrior we do not know we are poor injins that know but little it is not so with the palefaces they talk with the conjurers bees and know much we shall not have ground enough to take even a muskrat soon unless we cut off the strangers the manitou has given us these let us kill them  as no one very strenuously opposed the scheme the question was soon decided and ungque was commissioned to communicate the result to the captives one exception however was to be made in favor of the missionary his object appeared to be peaceful and it was determined that he should be led a short distance into the surrounding thicket and be there put to death without any attempt to torture or aggravate his sufferings as a mark of singular respect it was also decided not to scalp him  as ungque and those associated with him led the missionary to the place of execution the former artfully invited peter to follow this was done simply because the weasel saw that it would now be unpleasant to the man he hatedhated merely because he possessed an influence that he coveted for himself  my father will see a pleasant sight said the wily weasel as he walked at peters side toward the indicated spot he will see a paleface die and know that his foot has been put upon another worm  no answer was made to this ironical remark but peter walked in silence to the place where the missionary was stationed surrounded by a guard ungque now advanced and spoke  it is time for the medicinepriest of the palefaces to start after the spirits of his people who have gone before him he said the path is long and unless he walks fast and starts soon he may not overtake them i hope he will see some of them that helped to kill the son of his great spirit starving and footsore on the way  i understand you returned the missionary after a few moments passed in recovering from the shock of this communication my hour is come i have held my life in my hand ever since i first put foot in this heathen region and if it be the creators will that i am now to die i bow to the decree grant me a few minutes for prayer to my god  ungque signed that the delay should be granted the missionary uncovered his head knelt and again lifted up his voice in prayer at first the tones were a little tremulous but they grew firmer as he proceeded soon they became as serene as usual he first asked mercy for himself threw all his hopes on the great atonement and confessed how far he was from that holiness which alone could fit him to see god when this duty was performed he prayed for his enemies the language used was his mother tongue but peter comprehended most of that which was said he heard his own people prayed for he heard his own name mentioned as the condemned man asked the mercy of the manitou in his behalf never before was the soul of this extraordinary savage so shaken the past seemed like a dream to him while the future possessed a light that was still obscured by clouds here was an exemplification in practice of that divine spirit of love and benevolence which had struck him already as so very wonderful there could be no mistake there was the kneeling captive and his words clear distinct and imploring ascended through the cover of the bushes to the throne of god  as soon as the voice of the missionary was mute the mysterious chief bowed his head and moved away he was then powerless no authority of his could save the captive and the sight that so lately would have cheered his eyes was now too painful to bear he heard the single blow of the tomahawk which brained the victim and he shuddered from head to foot it was the first time such a weakness had ever come over him as for the missionary in deference to his pursuits his executioners dug him a grave and buried him unmutilated on the spot where he had fallen     chapter xxv       brutal alike in deed and word      with callous heart and hand of strife      how like a fiend may man be made      plying the foul and monstrous trade      whose harvestfield is human life                                  whittier   a veil like that of oblivion dropped before the form of the missionary the pious persons who had sent him forth to preach to the heathen never knew his fate a disappearance that was so common to that class of devoted men as to produce regret rather than surprise even those who took his life felt a respect for him and strange as it may seem it was to the eloquence of the man who now would have died to save him that his death was alone to be attributed peter had awakened fires that he could not quench and aroused a spirit that he could not quell in this respect he resembled most of those who under the guise of reform or revolution in moments of doubt set in motion a machine that is found impossible to control when it is deemed expedient to check exaggeration by reason such is often the case with even well intentioned leaders who constantly are made to feel how much easier it is to light a conflagration than to stay its flames when raging  corporal flint was left seated on the log while the bloody scene of the missionarys death was occurring he was fully alive to all the horrors of his own situation and comprehended the nature of his companions movements the savages usually manifested so much respect for missionaries that he was in no degree surprised parson amen had been taken apart for his execution and when those who had caused his removal returned the corporal looked anxiously for the usual but revolting token of his late companions death as has been said however the missionary was suffered to lie in his wild grave without suffering a mutilation of his remains  notwithstanding this moderation the indians were getting to be incited by this taste of blood the principal chiefs became sterner in their aspects and the young men began to manifest some such impatience as that which the still untried pup betrays when he first scents his game all these were ominous symptoms and were well understood by the captive  perhaps it would not have been possible in the whole range of human feelings to find two men under influences more widely opposed to each other than were the missionary and the corporal in this their last scene on earth the manner of parson amens death has been described he died in humble imitation of his divine master asking for blessings on those who were about to destroy him with a heart softened by christian graces and a meekness that had its origin in the consciousness of his own demerits on the other hand the corporal thought only of vengeance escape he knew to be impossible and he would fain take his departure like a soldier or as he conceived a soldier should die in the midst of fallen foes  corporal flint had a salutary love of life and would very gladly escape did the means offer but failing of these all his thoughts turned toward revenge some small impulses of ambition or what it is usual to dignify with that term showed themselves even at that serious moment he had heard around the campfires and in the garrisons so many tales of heroism and of fortitude manifested by soldiers who had fallen into the hands of the indians that a faint desire to enroll his own name on the list of these worthies was beginning to arise in his breast but truth compels us to add that the predominant feeling was the wish to revenge his own fate by immolating as many of his foes as possible to this last purpose therefore his thoughts were mainly directed during that interval which his late companion had employed in prayers for those under whose blows he was about to fall such is the difference in man with his heart touched or untouched by the power of the holy spirit  it was however much easier for the corporal to entertain designs of the nature mentioned than to carry them out unarmed surrounded by watchful enemies and totally without support of any sort the chances of effecting his purpose were small indeed once for a minute only the veteran seriously turned his thoughts to escape it occurred to him that he might possibly reach the castle could he get a little start and should the indians compel him to run the gauntlet as was often their practice he determined to make an effort for life in that mode agreeably to the code of frontier warfare a successful flight of this nature was scarcely less creditable than a victory in the field  half an hour passed after the execution of the missionary before the chiefs commenced their proceedings with the corporal the delay was owing to a consultation in which the weasel had proposed despatching a party to the castle to bring in the family and thus make a common destruction of the remaining palefaces known to be in that part of the openings peter did not dare to oppose this scheme himself but he so managed as to get crowsfeather to do it without bringing himself into the foreground the influence of the pottawattamie prevailed and it was decided to torture this one captive and to secure his scalp before they proceeded to work their will on the others ungque who had gained ground rapidly by his late success was once more commissioned to state to the captive the intentions of his captors  brother commenced the weasel placing himself directly in front of the corporal i am about to speak to you a wise warrior opens his ears when he hears the voice of his enemy he may learn something it will be good for him to know it will be good for you to know what i am about to say  brother you are a paleface and we are injins you wish to get our huntinggrounds and we wish to keep them to keep them it has become necessary to take your scalp i hope you are ready to let us have it  the corporal had but an indifferent knowledge of the indian language but he comprehended all that was uttered on this occasion interest quickened his faculties and no part of what was said was lost the gentle slow deliberate manner in which the weasel delivered himself contributed to his means of understanding he was fortunately prepared for what her heard and the announcement of his approaching fate did not disturb him to the degree of betraying weakness this last was a triumph in which the indians delighted though they ever showed the most profound respect for such of their victims as manifested a manly fortitude it was necessary to reply which the corporal did in english knowing that several present could interpret his words with a view to render this the more easy he spoke in fragments of sentences and with great deliberation  injins returned the corporal you surrounded me and i have been taken prisonerhad there been a platoon on us you mightnt have made out quite so well its no great victory for three hundred warriors to overcome a single man i count parson amen as worse than nothing for he looked to neither rear nor flank if i could have half an hours work upon you with only half of our late company i think we should lower your conceit but that is impossible and so you may do just what you please with me i ask no favors  although this answer was very imperfectly translated it awakened a good deal of admiration a man who could look death so closely in the face with so much steadiness became a sort of hero in indian eyes and with the north american savage fortitude is a virtue not inferior to courage murmurs of approbation were heard and ungque was privately requested to urge the captive further in order to see how far present appearances were likely to be maintained  brother i have said that we are injins resumed the weasel with an air so humble and a voice so meek that a stranger might have supposed he was consoling instead of endeavoring to intimidate the prisoner it is true we are nothing but poor ignorant injins we can only torment our prisoners after injin fashion if we were pale faces we might do better we did not torment the medicinepriest we were afraid he would laugh at our mistakes he knew a great deal we know but little we do as well as we know how  brother when injins do as well as they know how a warrior should forget their mistakes we wish to torment you in a way to prove that you are all over man we wish so to torment you that you will stand up under the pain in such a way that it will make our young men think your mother was not a squawthat there is no woman in you we do this for our own honor as well as for yours it will be an honor to us to have such a captive it will be an honor to you to be such a captive we shall do as well as we know how  brother it is most time to begin the tormenting will last a long time we must not let the medicinepriest get too great a start on the path to the happy huntinggrounds of your  here a most unexpected interruption occurred that effectually put a stop to the eloquence of ungque in his desire to make an impression the savage approached within reach of the captives arm while his own mind was intent on the words that he hoped would make the prisoner quail the corporal kept his eye on that of the speaker charming him as it were into a riveted gaze in return watching his opportunity he caught the tomahawk from the weasels belt and by a single blow felled him dead at his feet not content with this the old soldier now bounded forward striking right and left inflicting six or eight wounds on others before he could be again arrested disarmed and bound while the last was doing peter withdrew unobserved  many were the hughs and other exclamations of admiration that succeeded this display of desperate manhood the body of the weasel was removed and interred while the wounded withdrew to attend to their hurts leaving the arena to the rest assembled there as for the corporal he was pretty well blown and in addition to being now bound hand and foot his recent exertions which were terrific while they lasted effectually incapacitated him from making any move so long as he was thus exhausted and confined  a council was now held by the principal chiefs ungque had few friends in this he shared the fate of most demagogues who are commonly despised even by those they lead and deceive no one regretted him much and some were actually glad of his fate but the dignity of the conquerors must be vindicated it would never do to allow a paleface to obtain so great an advantage and not take a signal vengeance for his deeds after a long consultation it was determined to subject the captive to the trial by saplings and thus see if he could bear the torture without complaining  as some of our readers may not understand what this fell mode of tormenting is it may be necessary to explain  there is scarcely a method of inflicting pain that comes within the compass of their means that the north american indians have not essayed on their enemies when the infernal ingenuity that is exercised on these occasions fails of its effect the captives themselves have been heard to suggest other means of torturing that they have known practised successfully by their own people there is often a strange strife between the tormentors and the tormented the one to manifest skill in inflicting pain and the other to manifest fortitude in enduring it as has just been said quite as much renown is often acquired by the warrior in setting all the devices of his conquerors at defiance while subject to their hellish attempts as in deeds of arms it might be more true to say that such was the practice among the indians than to say at the present time that such is for it is certain that civilization in its approaches while it has in many particulars even degraded the red man has had a silent effect in changing and mitigating many of his fiercer customsthis perhaps among the rest it is probable that the more distant tribes still resort to all these ancient usages but it is both hoped and believed that those nearer to the whites do not  the torture by saplings is one of those modes of inflicting pain that would naturally suggest themselves to savages young trees that do not stand far apart are trimmed of their branches and brought nearer to each other by bending their bodies the victim is then attached to both trunks sometimes by his extended arms at others by his legs or by whatever part of the frame cruelty can suggest when the saplings are released and permitted to resume their upright positions of course the sufferer is lifted from the earth and hangs suspended by his limbs with a strain on them that soon produces the most intense anguish the celebrated punishment of the knout partakes a good deal of this same character of suffering bough of the oak now approached the corporal to let him know how high an honor was in reserve for him  brother said this ambitious orator you are a brave warrior you have done well not only have you killed one of our chiefs but you have wounded several of our young men no one but a brave could have done this you have forced us to bind you lest you might kill some more it is not often that captives do this your courage has caused us to consult how we might best torture you in a way most to manifest your manhood after talking together the chiefs have decided that a man of your firmness ought to be hung between two young trees we have found the trees and have cut off their branches you can see them if they were a little larger their force would be greater and they would give you more painwould be more worthy of you but these are the largest saplings we could find had there been any larger we would have let you have them we wish to do you honor for you are a bold warrior and worthy to be well tormented  brother look at these saplings they are tall and straight when they are bent by many hands they will come together take away the hands and they will become straight again your arms must then keep them together we wish we had some pappooses here that they might shoot arrows into your flesh that would help much to torment you you cannot have this honor for we have no pappooses we are afraid to let our young men shoot arrows into your flesh they are strong and might kill you we wish you to die between the saplings as is your right being so great a brave  brother we think much better of you since you killed the weasel and hurt our young men if all your warriors at chicago had been as bold as you blackbird would not have taken that fort you would have saved many scalps this encourages us it makes us think the great spirit means to help us and that we shall kill all the pale faces when we get further into your settlements we do not expect to meet many such braves as you they tell us we shall then find men who will run and screech like women it will not be a pleasure to torment such men we had rather torment a bold warrior like you who makes us admire him for his manliness we love our squaws but not in the warpath they are best in the lodges here we want nothing but men you are a mana bravewe honor you we think notwithstanding we shall yet make you weak it will not be easy yet we hope to do it we shall try we may not think quite so well of you if we do it but we shall always call you a brave a man is not a stone we can all feel and when we have done all that is in our power no one can do more it is so with injins we think it must be so with palefaces we mean to try and see how it is  the corporal understood very little of this harangue though he perfectly comprehended the preparations of the saplings and bough of the oaks allusions to them he was in a cold sweat at the thought for resolute as he was he foresaw sufferings that human fortitude could hardly endure in this state of the case and in the frame of mind he was in he had recourse to an expedient of which he had often heard and which he thought might now be practised to some advantage it was to open upon the savages with abuse and to exasperate them by taunts and sarcasm to such a degree as might induce some of the weaker members of the tribe to dispatch him on the spot as the corporal with the perspective of the saplings before his eyes manifested a good deal of ingenuity on this occasion we shall record some of his efforts  dye call yourselves chiefs and warriors he began upon a pretty high key i call ye squaws there is not a man among ye dogs would be the best name you are poor injins a long time ago the pale faces came here in two or three little canoes they were but a handful and you were plentier than prairie wolves your bark could be heard throughout the land well what did this handful of pale faces it drove your fathers before them until they got all the best of the huntinggrounds not an injin of you all now ever get down on the shores of the great salt lake unless to sell brooms and baskets and then he goes sneaking like a wolf after a sheep you have forgotten how clams and oysters taste your fathers had as many of them as they could eat but not one of you ever tasted them the palefaces eat them all if an injin asked for one they would throw the shell at his head and call him a dog  do you think that my chiefs would hang one of you between two such miserable saplings as these no they would scorn to practice such pitiful torture they would bring the tops of two tall pines together trees a hundred and fifty feet high and put their prisoner on the topmost boughs for the crows and ravens to pick his eyes out but you are miserable injins you know nothing if you knowd any better would you act such poor torment agin a great brave i spit upon ye and call you squaws the palefaces have made women of ye they have taken out your hearts and put pieces of dogs flesh in their places  here the corporal who delivered himself with an animation suited to his language was obliged to pause literally for want of breath singular as it may seem this tirade excited great admiration among the savages it is true that very few understood what was said perhaps no one understood all but the manner was thought to be admirable when some of the language was interpreted a deep but smothered resentment was felt more especially at the taunts touching the manner in which the whites had overcome the red men truth is hard to be borne and the individual or people who will treat a thousand injurious lies with contempt feel all their ire aroused at one reproach that has its foundation in fact nevertheless the anger that the corporals words did in truth awaken was successfully repressed and he had the disappointment of seeing that his life was spared for the torture  brother said bough of the oak again placing himself before the captive you have a stout heart it is made of stone and not of flesh if our hearts be of dogs meat yours is of stone what you say is true the palefaces did come at first in two or three canoes and there were but few of them we are ashamed for it is true a few palefaces drove toward the setting sun many injins but we cannot be driven any further we mean to stop here and begin to take all the scalps we can a great chief who belongs to no one tribe but belongs to all tribes who speaks all tongues has been sent by the great spirit to arouse us he has done it you know him he came from the head of the lake with you and kept his eye on your scalp he has meant to take it from the first he waited only for an opportunity that opportunity has come and we now mean to do as he has told us we ought to do this is right squaws are in a hurry warriors know how to wait we would kill you at once and hang your scalp on our pole but it would not be right we wish to do what is right if we are poor injins and know but little we know what is right it is right to torment so great a brave and we mean to do it it is only just to you to do so an old warrior who has seen so many enemies and who has so big a heart ought not to be knocked in the head like a pappoose or a squaw it is his right to be tormented we are getting ready and shall soon begin if my brother can tell us a new way of tormenting we are willing to try it should we not make out as well as palefaces my brother will remember who we are we mean to do our best and we hope to make his heart soft if we do this great will be our honor should we not do it we cannot help it we shall try  it was now the corporals turn to put in a rebutter  this he did without any failure in will or performance by this time he was so well warmed as to think or care very little about the saplings and to overlook the pain they might occasion  dogs can do little but bark specially injin dogs he said injins themselves are little better than their own dogs they can bark but they dont know how to bite you have many great chiefs here some are panthers and some bears and some buffaloes but where are your weasels i have fit you now these twenty years and never have i known ye to stand up to the baggonet its not injin natur to do that  here the corporal without knowing it made some such reproach to the aboriginal warriors of america as the english used to throw into the teeth of ourselvesthat of not standing up to a weapon which neither party possessed it was matter of great triumph that the americans would not stand the charge of the bayonet at the renowned fight on breeds for instance when it is well known that not one man in five among the colonists had any such weapon at all to stand up with a different story was told at guildford and stony point and eutaw and bennington and bemis heights and fifty other places that might be named after the troops were furnished with bayonets then it was found that the americans could use them as well as others and so might it have proved with the red men though their discipline or mode of fighting scarce admitted of such systematic charges all this however the corporal overlooked much as if he were a regular historian who was writing to make out a case  harkee brother since you will call me brother though heaven be praised not a drop of nigger or injin blood runs in my veins resumed the corporal harkee friend redskin answer me one thing did you ever hear of such a man as mad anthony he was the tickler for your infernal tribes you pulled no saplings together for him he put you up with the longknives and leatherstockings and you outrun his fleetest horses i was with him and saw more naked backs than naked faces among your people that day your great bear got a rap on his nose that sent him to his village yelping like a cur  again was the corporal compelled to stop to take breath the allusion to wayne and his defeat of the indians excited so much ire that several hands grasped knives and tomahawks and one arrow was actually drawn nearly to the head but the frown of bears meat prevented any outbreak or actual violence it was deemed prudent however to put an end to this scene lest the straightforward corporal who laid it on heavily and who had so much to say about indian defeats might actually succeed in touching some festering wound that would bring him to his death at once it was accordingly determined to proceed with the torture of the saplings without further delay  the corporal was removed accordingly and placed between the two bended trees which were kept together by withes around their tops an arm of the captive was bound tightly at the wrist to the top of each tree so that his limbs were to act as the only tie between the saplings as soon as the withes should be cut the indians now worked in silence and the matter was getting to be much too serious for the corporal to indulge in any more words the cold sweat returned and many an anxious glance was cast by the veteran on the fell preparations still he maintained appearances and when all was ready not a man there was aware of the agony of dread which prevailed in the breast of the victim it was not death that he feared as much as suffering a few minutes the corporal well knew would make the pain intolerable while he saw no hope of putting a speedy end to his existence a man might live hours in such a situation then it was that the teachings of childhood were revived in the bosom of this hardened man and he remembered the being that died for him in common with the rest of the human race on the tree the seeming similarity of his own execution struck his imagination and brought a tardy but faint recollection of those lessons that had lost most of their efficacy in the wickedness and impiety of camps his soul struggled for relief in that direction but the present scene was too absorbing to admit of its lifting itself so far above his humanity  warrior of the palefaces said bough of the oak we are going to cut the withe you will then be where a brave man will want all his courage if you are firm we will do you honor if you faint and screech our young men will laugh at you this is the way with injins they honor braves they point the finger at cowards  here a sign was made by bears meat and a warrior raised the tomahawk that was to separate the fastenings his hand was in the very act of descending when the crack of a rifle was heard and a little smoke rose out of the thicket near the spot where the bee hunter and the corporal himself had remained so long hid on the occasion of the council first held in that place the tomahawk fell however the withes were parted and up flew the saplings with a violence that threatened to tear the arms of the victim out of their sockets  the indians listened expecting the screeches and groansthey gazed hoping to witness the writhings of their captive but they were disappointed there hung the body its arms distended still holding the tops of the saplings bowed but not a sign of life was seen a small line of blood trickled down the forehead and above it was the nearly imperceptible hole made by the passage of a bullet the head itself had fallen forward and a little on one shoulder the corporal had escaped the torments reserved for him by this friendly blow  it was so much a matter of course for an indian to revenge his own woundsto alleviate his smarts by retaliating on those who inflicted themthat the chiefs expressed neither surprise nor resentment at the manner of the corporals death there was some disappointment it is true but no anger was manifested since it was supposed that some one of those whom the prisoner had wounded had seen fit in this mode to revenge his own hurts in this however the indians deceived themselves the wellintentioned and deadly shot that saved the corporal from hours of agony came from the friendly hand of pigeonswing who had no sooner discharged his rifle than he stole away through the thicket and was never discovered this he did too at the expense of ungques scalp on which he had set his heart  as for the indians perceiving that their hopes of forcing a captive to confess his weakness were frustrated they conferred together on the course of future proceedings there was an inquiry for peter but peter was not to be found bough of the oak suggested that the mysterious chief must have gone to the palisaded hut in order to get the remaining scalps his passion for this symbol of triumphs over palefaces being well known it was therefore incumbent on the whole band to follow with the double view of sharing in the honor of the assault and of rendering assistance  abandoning the body of the corporal where it hung away went these savages by this time keenly alive to the scent of blood something like order was observed however each chief leading his own particular part of the band in his own way but on a designated route bears meat acted as commanderinchief the subordinate leaders following his instructions with reasonable obedience some went in one direction others in another until the verdant bottom near the sweet spring was deserted  in less than half an hour the whole band was collected around castle meal distant however beyond the range of a rifle the different parties as they arrived announced their presence by whoops which were intended to answer the double purpose of signals and of striking terror to the hearts of the besieged the north american indians making ample use of this great auxiliary in war  all this time no one was seen in or about the fortified hut the gate was closed as were the doors and windows manifesting preparations for defence but the garrison kept close nor was peter to be seen he might be a prisoner or he might not have come in this direction it was just possible that he might be stealing up to the building to get a nearer view and a closer scout  indian warfare is always stealthy it is seldom indeed that the aboriginal americans venture on an open assault of any fortified place however small and feeble it may be ignorant of the use of artillery and totally without that allimportant arm their approaches to any cover whence a bullet may be sent against them are ever wary slow and well concerted they have no idea of trenchesdo not possess the means of making them indeedbut they have such substitutes of their own as usually meet all their wants more particularly in portions of the country that are wooded in cases like this before our present band they had to exercise their wits to invent new modes of effecting their purposes  bears meat collected his principal chiefs and after a considerable amount of consultation it was determined in the present instance to try the virtue of fire the only sign of life they could detect about the hut was an occasional bark from hive who had been taken within the building most probably to protect him from the bullets and arrows of the enemy even this animal did not howl like a dog in distress but he barked as if aware of the vicinity of strangers the keenest scrutiny could not detect an outlet of any sort about the hut everything was tightly closed and it was impossible to say when or whence a bullet might not be sent against the unwary  the plan was soon formed and was quite as rapidly executed bough of the oak himself supported by two or three other braves undertook to set the buildings on fire this was done by approaching the kitchen dodging from tree to tree making each movement with a rapidity that defeated aim and an irregularity that defied calculation in this way the kitchen was safely reached where there was a log cover to conceal the party here also was fire the food for dinner being left just as it had been put over to boil not long before the indians had prepared themselves with arrows and light wood and soon they commenced sending their flaming missiles toward the roof of the hut arrow after arrow struck and it was not long before the roof was on fire  a yell now arose throughout the openings far and near the indians exulted at their success the wood was dry and it was of a very inflammable nature the wind blew and in half an hour castle meal was in a bright blaze hive now began to howl a sign that he knew his peril still no human being appeared presently the flaming roof fell in and the savages listened intently to hear the screeches of their victims the howls of the dog increased and he was soon seen with his hair burned from his skin leaping on the unroofed wall and thence into the area within the palisades a bullet terminated his sufferings as he alighted  bears meat now gave the signal and a general rush was made no rifle opposed them and a hundred indians were soon at the palisades to the surprise of all the gate was found unfastened rushing within the door of the hut was forced and a view obtained of the blazing furnace within the party had arrived in sufficient season to perceive fragments of le bourdons rude furniture and stores yet blazing but nowhere was a human corpse visible poles were got and the brands were removed in the expectation of finding bones beneath them but without success it was now certain that no paleface had perished in that hut then the truth flashed on the minds of all the savages le bourdon and his friends had taken the alarm in time and had escaped     chapter xxvi       behold o lord the heathen tread       the branches of thy fruitful vine      that its luxurious tendrils spread       oer all the hills of palestine      and now the wild boar comes to waste      even us the greenest boughs and last      that drinking of its choicest dew      on zions hill in beauty grew                                   milman   the change in peter had been gradually making itself apparent ever since he joined the party of the beehunter when he entered the kalamazoo in the company of the two men who had now fallen the victims of his own designs his heart was full of the fell intention of cutting off the whole white race margery had first induced him to think of exceptions he had early halfdecided that she should be spared to be carried to his own lodge as an adopted daughter when he became aware of the state of things between his favorite and her lover there was a severe struggle in his breast on the subject of sparing the last he saw how strongly the girl was attached to him and something like human sentiments forced their way among his savage plans the mysterious communication of le bourdon with the bees however had far more influence in determining him to spare so great a medicineman than margerys claims and he had endeavored to avail himself of a marriage as a means of saving the bride instead of saving the bridegroom all the indians entertained a species of awe for le bourdon and all hesitated about laying hands on one who appeared so gifted it was therefore the expectation of this extraordinary being that the wife might be permitted to escape with the husband the effect of the weasels cunning has been described such was the state of peters mind when he met the band in the scenes last described there he had been all attention to the demeanor of the missionary a hundred times had he seen warriors die uttering maledictions on their enemies but this was the first occasion on which he had ever known a man to use his latest breath in asking for blessings on those who persecuted him at first peter was astounded then the sublime principles had their effect and his heart was deeply touched with what he heard how far the holy spirit aided these better feelings it might be presumptuous on the one hand to say while on the other it will be equally presuming to think of denying the possibilitynay the probability that the great change which so suddenly came over the heart of peter was produced by more than mere human agencies we know that this blessed spirit is often poured out in especial cases with affluent benevolence and there can be no sufficient reason for supposing this savage might not have been thus signally favored as soon as the avenues of his heart opened to the impulses of a generous humanity the very qualities that would induce such a being to attempt the wild and visionary scheme of vengeance and retribution that had now occupied his sleeping and waking thoughts for years might under a better direction render him eminently fit to be the subject of divine grace a latent sense of right lay behind all his seeming barbarity and that which to us appears as a fell ferocity was in his own eyes no less than a severe justice  the words the principles the prayers and more than all the example of the missionary wrought this great change so far as human agencies were employed but the power of god was necessary to carry out and complete this renewal of the inner man we do not mean that a miracle was used in the sudden conversion of this indian to better feelings for that which is of hourly occurrence and which may happen to all comes within the ordinary workings of a divine providence and cannot thus be designated with propriety but we do wish to be understood as saying that no purely human power could have cleared the moral vision changed all the views and softened the heart of such a man as was so promptly done in the case of peter the way had been gradually preparing perhaps by the means already described but the great transformation came so suddenly and so powerfully as to render him a different being as it might almost be in the twinkling of an eye such changes often occur and though it may suit the selfsufficiency of the worldling to deride them he is the wisest who submits in the meekest spirit to powers that exceed his comprehension  in this state of mind then peter left the band as soon as the fate of the missionary was decided his immediate object was to save the whites who remained gershom and dorothy now having a place in his good intentions as well as le bourdon and margery although he moved swiftly and nearly by an airline his thoughts scarce kept company with his feet during that rapid walk he was haunted with the image of a man dying while he pronounced benedictions on his enemies  there was little in common between the natural objects of that placid and rural scene and the fell passions that were so actively at work among the savages the whole of the landscape was bathed in the light of a clear warm summers day these are the times when the earth truly seems a sanctuary in spots remote from the haunts of men and least exposed to his abuses the bees hum around the flowers the birds carol on the boughs and from amid their leafy arbors while even the leaping and shining waters appear to be instinct with the life that extols the glory of god  as for the family near the palisaded hut happiness had not for many a month been so seated among them as on this very occasion dorothy sympathized truly in the feelings of the youthful and charming bride while gershom had many of the kind and affectionate wishes of a brother in her behalf the last was in his best attire as indeed were the females who were neatly though modestly clad and gershom had that air of decent repose and of quiet enjoyment which is so common of a sabbath with the men of his class among the people from whom he sprung the fears lately excited were momentarily forgotten everything around them wore an air so placid the vault above them was so profoundly tranquil the light of day was so soft and yet so bright the openings seemed so rural and so much like pictures of civilization that apprehension had been entirely forgotten in present enjoyment such was the moment when peter suddenly stood before le bourdon and margery as the young couple sat beneath the shade of the oaks near the spring one instant the indian regarded this picture of young wedded life with a gleam of pleasure on his dark face then he announced his presence by speaking  cant sit here lookin at young squaw said this literal being get up and put thing in canoe time come to go on path dat lead to paleface country  what has happened peter demanded the beehunter springing to his feet you come like a runner rushing in with his bad tidings has anything happened to give an alarm  up and off tell you no use talkin now put all he can in canoe and paddle away fast as can there was no mistaking peters manner the beehunter saw the uselessness of questioning such a man at a time like that and he called to gershom to join him  here is the chief to warn us to move said the beehunter endeavoring to appear calm in order that he might not needlessly alarm the females and what he advises we had better do i know there is danger by what has fallen from pigeonswing as well as from himself so let us lose no time but stow the canoes and do as he tells us  as gershom assented it was not two minutes ere all were at work for several days each canoe had been furnished with provisions for a hasty flight it remained only to add such of the effects as were too valuable and necessary to be abandoned and which had not been previously exposed without the palisades for half an hour le bourdon and gershom worked as for life no questions were asked nor was a single moment lost in a desire to learn more the manner in which peter bore himself satisfied boden that the emergency was pressing and it is seldom that more was done by so few hands in so short a period fortunately the previous preparation greatly aided the present object and nearly everything of any value was placed in the canoes within the brief space mentioned it then became necessary to decide concerning the condition in which castle meal was to be left peter advised closing every aperture shutting the gate and leaving the dog within there is no doubt that these expedients prevented the parties falling early into the hands of their enemies for the time lost by the savages in making their approaches to the hut was very precious to the fugitives  just as the canoes were loaded pigeonswing came in he announced that the whole band was in motion and might be expected to reach the grove in ten minutes placing an arm around the slender waist of margery le bourdon almost carried her to his own canoe gershom soon had dorothy in his little bark while peter entered that to the ownership of which he may be said to have justly succeeded by the deaths of the corporal and the missionary pigeonswing remained behind in order to act as a scout having first communicated to peter the course the last ought to steer before the chippewa plunged into the cover in which it was his intention to conceal himself he made a sign that the band was already in sight  the heart of le bourdon sunk within him when he learned how near were the enemy to him escape seemed impossible and he now regretted having abandoned the defences of his late residence the river was sluggish for more than a mile at that spot and then occurred a rift which could not be passed without partly unloading the canoes and where there must necessarily be a detention of more than an hour thus it was scarcely possible for canoes descending that stream to escape from so large a band of pursuers the sinuosities themselves would enable the last to gain fifty points ahead of them where ambushes or even open resistance must place them altogether at the mercy of the savages  peter knew all this as well as the beehunter and he had no intention of trusting his new friends in a flight down the river pigeonswing with the sententious brevity of an indian had made an important communication to him while they were moving for the last time toward the canoes and he now determined to profit by it taking the lead therefore with his own canoe peter paddled up instead of down the stream going in a direction opposite to that which it would naturally be supposed the fugitives had taken in doing this also he kept close under the bank which would most conceal the canoes from those who approached it on its southern side  it will be remembered that the trees for the palisades had been cut from a swamp a short distance above the beehunters residence they had grown on the margin of the river which had been found serviceable in floating the logs to their point of destination the tops of many of these trees resinuous and suited by their nature to preserve their leaves for a considerable time lay partly in the stream and partly on its banks and pigeonswing foreseeing the necessity of having a place of refuge had made so artful a disposition of several of them that while they preserved all the appearance of still lying where they had fallen it was possible to haul canoes up beneath them between the branches and the bank in a way to form a place of perfect concealment no indian would have trusted to such a hidingplace had it not been matter of notoriety that the trees had been felled for a particular purpose or had their accidental disposition along the bank been discernibly deranged but such was not the case the hand of pigeonswing having been so skilfully employed that what he had done could not be detected he might be said to have assisted nature instead of disturbing her  the canoes were actually paddling close under the bank in the castle meal reach of the river when the band arrived at the grove and commenced what might be called the investment of the place had not all the attention of the savages been drawn toward the hut it is probable that some wandering eye might have caught a glimpse of some one of them as inequalities in the bank momentarily exposed each in succession to view this danger however passed away and by turning a point the fugitives were effectually concealed from all who did not actually approach the river at that particular point here it was however that the swamp commenced and the ground being wet and difficult no one would be likely to do this the stream flowed through this swamp having a dense wood on each side though one of no great extent the reach moreover was short making a completely sheltered haven of the kalamazoo within its limits  once in this wooded reach peter tossed an arm and assumed an air of greater security he felt infinitely relieved and knew that they were safe for a time unless some wanderer should have taken to the swampa most improbable thing of itself when high enough he led the way across the stream and entering below he soon had all the canoes in their place of concealment  dis good place observed the great chief as soon as all were fast bess take care dough bess not make track too much on land injin got sharp eye and see ebbery ting now i go and talk wid chief come back byemby you stay here goodbye  stop peterone word before we part if you see parson amen or the corporal it might be well to tell them where we are to be found they would be glad to know  peter looked grave even sad he did not answer for fully a minute when he did it was in a low suppressed voice such as one is apt to use when there is a weight felt on his mind  nebber know any ting agin returned the chief both dem pale face dead  dead echoed all within hearing  juss so injin kill him mean to kill you toodat why i run away saw medicinepriest die what you tink blossomwhat you tink bourdondat man die asking great spirit to do good to injin  i can believe it peter for he was a good man and such are our christian laws though few of us obey them i can easily believe that parson amen was an exception however  yes peter such are our christian laws put in margery earnestly when christ the son of god came on earth to redeem lost men he commanded his followers to do good to them that did evil to us and to pray for them that tried to harm us we have his very words written in our bibles  you got him said peter with interest see you read him ofen got dat book here  to be sure i haveit is the last thing i should have forgotten dolly has one and i have another we read in them every day and we hope that before long brother and bourdon will read in them too  why im no great scholar margery returned her husband scratching his full curling head of hair out of pure awkwardness to please you however id undertake even a harder job it was so with the bees when i began i thought i should never succeed in lining the first bee to his hive but since that time i think ive lined a thousand  its easy its easy dear benjamin if you will only make a beginning returned the much interested young wife when we get to a place of safety if it be gods will that we ever shall i hope to have you join me in reading the good book daily see peter i keep it in this little bag where it is safe and always at hand  you read dem word for me blossom i want to hear him out of dis book himself  margery did as he desired she was very familiar with the new testament and turning to the wellknown and godlike passage she read several verses in a steady earnest voice perhaps the danger they were in and the recent communication of the death of their late companions increased her earnestness and solemnity of manner for the effect produced on peter was scarcely less than that he had felt when he witnessed a practical obedience to these sublime principles in the death of the missionary tears actually started to this stern savages eyes and he looked back on his late projects and endeavors to immolate a whole race with a shudder taking margerys hand he courteously thanked her and prepared to quit the place previously to leaving his friends however peter gave a brief account of the manner of the missionarys death and of the state in which he had left the corporal pigeonswing had told him of the fate of the last as well as of the eagerness with which the band had set out in quest of more white scalps  peter we can count on you for a friend i hope said the bee hunter as the two were about to part on the bank of the river i fear you were once our enemy  bourdon said peter with dignity and speaking in the language of his own people listen there are good spirits and there are bad spirits our traditions tell us this our own minds tell us this too for twenty winters a bad spirit has been whispering in my ear i listened to him and did what he told me to do i believed what he said his words werekill your enemiesscalp all the palefaces do not leave a squaw or a pappoose make all their hearts heavy this is what an injin should do so has the bad spirit been whispering to me for twenty winters i listened to him what he said i did it was pleasant to me to take the scalps of the pale faces it was pleasant to think that no more scalps would be left among them to take i was scalping peter  bourdon the good spirit has at last made himself heard his whisper is so low that at first my ears did not hear him they hear him now when he spoke loudest it was with the tongue of the medicinepriest of your people he was about to die when we are about to die our voices become strong and clear so do our eyes we see what is before and we see what is behind we feel joy for what is beforewe feel sorrow for what is behind your medicinepriest spoke well it sounded in my ears as if the great spirit himself was talking they say it was his son i believe them blossom has read to me out of the good book of your people and i find it is so i feel like a child and could sit down in my wigwam and weep  bourdon you are a paleface and i am an injin you are strong and i am weak this is because the son of the great spirit has talked with your people and has not talked with mine i now see why the palefaces overrun the earth and take the huntinggrounds they know most and have been told to come here and to tell what they know to the poor ignorant injins i hope my people will listen what the son of the great spirit says must be true he does not know how to do wrong  bourdon once it seemed sweet to me to take the scalps of my enemies when an injin did me harm i took his scalp this was my way i could not help it then the wicked spirit told me to do this the son of the manitou has now told me better i have lived under a cloud the breath of the dying medicinepriest of your people has blown away that cloud i see clearer i hear him telling the manitou to do me good though i wanted his scalp he was answered in my heart then my ears opened wider and i heard what the good spirit whispered the ear in which the bad spirit had been talking for twenty winters shut and was deaf i hear him no more i do not want to hear him again the whisper of the son of the manitou is very pleasant to me it sounds like the wren singing his sweetest song i hope he will always whisper so my ear shall never again be shut to his words  bourdon it is pleasant to me to look forward it is not pleasant to me to look back i see how many things i have done in one way that ought to have been done in another way i feel sorry and wish it had not been so then i hear the son of the manitou asking his father who liveth above the clouds to do good to the jews who took his life i do not think injins are jews in this my brother was wrong it was his own notion and it is easy for a man to think wrong it is not so with the son of the manitou he thinketh always as his father thinketh which is right  bourdon i am no longer peteri must be another injin i do not feel the same a scalp is a terrible thing in my eyesi wish never to take anothernever to see anothera scalp is a bad thing i now love the yankees i wish to do them good and not to do them harm i love most the great spirit that let his own son die for all men the medicinepriest said he died for injins as well as for pale faces this we did not know or we should have talked of him more in our traditions we love to talk of good acts but we are such ignorant injins the son of the manitou will have pity on us and tell us oftener what we ought to do in time we shall learn now i feel like a child i hope i shall one day be a man  having made this confession of faith one that would have done credit to a christian church peter shook the beehunter kindly by the hand and took his departure he did not walk into the swamp though it was practicable with sufficient care but he stepped into the river and followed its margin knowing that water leaves no trail nor did peter follow the direct route toward the now blazing hut the smoke from which was rising high above the trees but he ascended the stream until reaching a favorable spot he threw aside all of his light dress made it into a bundle and swam across the kalamazoo holding his clothes above the element with one hand on reaching the opposite shore he moved on to the upper margin of the swamp where he resumed his clothes then he issued into the openings carrying neither rifle bow tomahawk nor knife all his weapons he had left in his canoe fearful that they might tempt him to do evil instead of good to his enemies neither bears meat nor bough of the oak was yet regarded by peter with the eye of love he tried not to hate them and this he found sufficiently difficult conscious of this difficulty he had laid aside his arms accordingly this mighty change had been gradually in progress ever since the chiefs close communication with margery but it had received its consummation in the last acts and last words of the missionary  having got out into the openings it was not difficult for peter to join his late companions without attracting observation from whence he came he kept as much under cover as was convenient and reached the kitchen just as the band broke into the defences and burst open the door of the blazing and already roofless hut here peter paused unwilling to seem inactive in such a scene yet averse to doing anything that a sensitively tender conscience might tell him was wrong he knew there was no human being there to save and cared little for the few effects that might be destroyed he did not join the crowd therefore until it was ascertained that the beehunter and his companions had escaped  the palefaces have fled said bears meat to the great chief when the last did approach him we have looked for their bones among the ashes but there are none that medicinebeehunter has told them that their scalps were wanted and they have gone off  have any of the young men been down to the river to look for their canoes quietly demanded peter if the canoes are gone too they have taken the route toward the great lake  this was so obvious and probable that a search was immediately set on foot the report was soon made and great was the eagerness to pursue the kalamazoo was so crooked that no one there doubted of overtaking the fugitives and parties were immediately organized for the chase this was done with the customary intelligence and shrewdness of indians the canoes that belonged to crowsfeather and his band had been brought up the river and they lay concealed in rushes not a mile from the hut a party of warriors brought them to the landing and they carried one division of the party to the opposite shore it being the plan to follow each bank of the river keeping close to the stream even to its mouth should it prove necessary two other parties were sent in direct lines one on each side of the river also to lay in ambush at such distant points ahead as would be almost certain to anticipate the arrival of the fugitives the canoes were sent down the stream to close the net against return while bears meat bough of the oak crowsfeather and several others of the leading chiefs remained near the still burning hut with a strong party to examine the surrounding openings for footprints and trails it was possible that the canoes had been sent adrift in order to mislead them while the palefaces had fled by land  it has been stated that the openings had a beautiful sward near castle meal this was true of that particular spot and was the reason why le bourdon had selected it for his principal place of residence the abundance of flowers drew the bees there a reason of itself why he should like the vicinity lest the reader should be misled however it may be well to explain that an absence of sward is characteristic of these openings rather than the reverse it being to a certain degree a cause of complaint now that the country is settled that the lands of the oak openings are apt to be so light that the grasses do not readily form as firm a turf as is desirable for meadows and pastures we apprehend this is true however less as a rule than as exceptions there being variety in the soils of these openings as well as in other quarters  nevertheless the savages were aware that the country around the burned hut for a considerable extent differed in this particular from most of that which lay farther east or more inland on the last a trail would be much more easily detected than on the first and a party under the direction of a particularly experienced leader was dispatched several miles to the eastward to look for the usual signs of the passage of any toward detroit taking that route this last expedient troubled peter exceedingly since it placed a body of enemies in the rear of the fugitives thereby rendering their position doubly perilous there was no help for the difficulty however and the great chief saw the party depart without venturing on remonstrance advice or any other expedient to arrest the movement bears meat now called the head chiefs who remained into a circle and asked for opinions concerning the course that ought next to be taken  what does my brother the tribeless chief say he asked looking at peter in a way to denote the expectation which all felt that he ought to be able to give useful counsel in such a strait we have got but two scalps from six heads and one of them is buried with the medicinepriest  scalps cannot be taken from them that get off returned peter evasively we must first catch these palefaces when they are found it will be easy to scalp them if the canoes are gone i think the medicinebeehunter and his squaws have gone in them we may find the whole down the river  to this opinion most of the chiefs assented though the course of examining for a trail farther east was still approved the band was so strong while the palefaces were so few that a distribution of their own force was of no consequence and it was clearly the most prudent to send out young men in all directions every one however expected that the fugitives would be overtaken on or near the river and bears meat suggested the propriety of their moving down stream themselves very shortly  when did my brother last see the palefaces asked crowsfeather this beehunter knows the river well and may have started yesterday or even after he came from the great council of the prairie  this was a new idea but one that seemed probable enough all eyes turned toward peter who saw at once that such a notion must greatly favor the security of the fugitives and felt a strong desire to encourage it he found evasion difficult however and well knew the danger of committing himself instead of giving a straightforward answer therefore he had recourse to circumlocution and subterfuge  my brother is right he answered the palefaces have had time to get far down the stream as my brothers know i slept among them at the round prairie today they know i was with them at the council of the spring of gushing waters  all this was true as far as it went although the omissions were very material no one seemed to suspect the great chief whose fidelity to his own principles was believed to be of a character amounting to enthusiasm little did any there know of the power of the unseen spirit of god to alter the heart producing what religionists term the new birth we do not wish however to be understood that peter had as yet fully experienced this vast change it is not often the work of a moment though well authenticated modern instances do exist in which we have every reason to believe that men have been made to see and feel the truth almost as miraculously as was st paul himself as for this extraordinary savage he had entered into the strait and narrow way though he was not far advanced on its difficult path  when men tell us of the great progress that the race is making toward perfection and point to the acts which denote its wisdom its power to control its own affairs its tendencies toward good when most left to its own selfcontrol our minds are filled with scepticism the everyday experience of a life now fast verging toward threescore contradicts the theory and the facts we believe not in the possibility of mans becoming even a strictly rational being unaided by a power from on high and all that we have seen and read goes to convince us that he is most of a philosopher the most accurate judge of his real state the most truly learned who most vividly sees the necessity of falling back on the precepts of revelation for all his higher principles and practice we conceive that this mighty truth furnishes unanswerable proof of the unceasing agency of a providence and when we once admit this we concede that our own powers are insufficient for our own wants  that the world as a whole is advancing toward a better state of things we as firmly believe as we do that it is by ways that have not been foreseen by man and that whenever the last has been made the agent of producing portions of this improvement it has oftener been without design or calculation than with it who for instance supposes that the institutions of this country of which we boast so much could have stood as long as they have without the conservative principles that are to be found in the union and who is there so vain as to ascribe the overshadowing influence of this last great power to any wisdom in man we all know that perfectly fortuitous circumstances or what appear to us to be such produced the federal government and that its strongest and least exceptionable features are precisely those which could not be withstood much less invented as parts of the theory of a polity  a great and spasmodic political movement is at this moment convulsing christendom that good will come of it we think is beyond a question but we greatly doubt whether it will come in the particular form or by the specified agencies that human calculations would lead us to expect it must be admitted that the previous preparations which have induced the present effort are rather in opposition to than the consequences of calculated agencies overturning in their progress the very safeguards which the sagacity of men had interposed to the advance of those very opinions that have been silently and by means that would perhaps baffle inquiry preparing the way for the results that have been so suddenly and unexpectedly obtained if the course is onward it is more as the will of god than from any calculations of man and it is when the last are the most active that there is the greatest reason to apprehend the consequences  of such a dispensation of the providence of almighty god do we believe peter to have been the subject among the thousand ways that are employed to touch the heart he had been most affected by the sight of a dying mans asking benedictions on his enemies it was assailing his besetting sin attacking the very citadel of his savage character and throwing open at once an approach into the deepest recesses of his habits and dispositions it was like placing a masterkey in the hands of him who would go through the whole tenement for the purpose of purifying it     chapter xxvii       thou to whom every faun and satyr flies      for willing service whether to surprise      the squatted hare while in half sleeping fits      or upward ragged precipices flit      to save poor lambkins from the eagles maw      or by mysterious enticement draw      bewildered shepherds to their path again                                       keats   it can easily be understood that the party with the canoes were left by peter in a state of great anxiety the distance between the site of the hut and their place of concealment was but little more than a quarter of a mile and the yell of the savages had often reached their ears notwithstanding the cover of the woods this proximity of itself was fearful but the uncertainty that le bourdon felt on the subject of peters real intentions added greatly to his causes of concern of course he knew but little of the sudden change that had come over this mysterious chiefs feelings nor is it very likely that he would have been able to appreciate it even had the fact been more fully stated our hero had very little acquaintance with the dogmas of christianity and would have most probably deemed it impossible that so great a revolution of purpose could have been so suddenly wrought in the mind of man had the true state of the case been communicated to him he would have been ready enough to allow that with god nothing is impossible but might have been disposed to deny the influence of his holy spirit as exhibited in this particular form for a reason no better than the circumstance that he himself had never been the subject of such a power all that peter had said therefore served rather to mystify him than to explain in its true colors what had actually occurred with margery it was different her schooling had been far better than that of any other of the party and while she admired the manly appearance and loved the free generous character of her husband she had more than once felt pained at the passing thoughts of his great indifference to sacred things this feeling in le bourdon however was passive rather than active and gave her a kind interest in his future welfare rather than any present pain through acts and words  but as respects their confidence in peter this young couple were much farther apart than in their religious notions the beehunter had never been without distrust though his apprehensions had been occasionally so far quieted as to leave him nearly free of them altogether while his wife had felt the utmost confidence in the chief from the very commencement of their acquaintance it would be useless perhaps to attempt to speculate on the causes but it is certain that there are secret sources of sympathy that draw particular individuals toward each other and antipathies that keep them widely separated men shall meet for the first time and feel themselves attracted toward each other like two drops of water or repelled like the corks of an electric machine  the former had been the case with peter and margery they liked each other from the first and kind orifices had soon come to increase this feeling the girl had now seen so much of the indians as to regard them much as she did others or with the discriminations and tastes or distastes with which we all regard our fellowcreatures feeling no particular cause of estrangement it is true that margery would not have been very likely to fall in love with a young indian had one come in her way of a suitable age and character for her american notions on the subject of color might have interposed difficulties but apart from the tender sentiments she could see good and bad qualities in one of the aborigines as well as in a white man as a consequence of this sympathy between peter and margery the last had ever felt the utmost confidence in the protection and friendship of the first this she did even while the struggle was going on in his breast on the subject of including her in his fell designs or of making an exception in her favor it shows the waywardness of our feelings that margery had never reposed confidence in pigeonswing who was devotedly the friend of le bourdon and who remained with them for no other reason than a general wish to be of use something brusque in his manner which was much less courteous and polished than that of peter had early rendered her dissatisfied with him and once estranged she had never felt disposed to be on terms of intimacy sufficient to ascertain his good or bad qualities  the great change of feeling in peter was not very clearly understood by margery any more than it was by her husband though had her attention been drawn more strictly to it she would have best known how to appreciate it but this knowledge was not wanting to put her perfectly at peace so far as apprehension of his doing her harm was concerned this sense of security she now manifested in a conversation with le bourdon that took place soon after peter had left them  i wish we werent in the hands of this redskin margery said her husband a little more off his guard than was his wont  of peter you surprise me benjamin i think we could not be in better hands since we have got this risk to run with the savages if it was pigeonswing that you feared i could understand it  i will answer for pigeonswing with my life  i am glad to hear you say so for i do not half like him perhaps i am prejudiced against him the scalp he took down at the mouth of the river set me against him from the first  do you not know margery that your great friend goes by the name of scalping peter  yes i know it very well but i do not believe he ever took a scalp in his life  did he ever tell you as much as that  i cant say that he did but he has never paraded anything of the sort before my eyes like pigeonswing i do not half like that chippewa dear bourdon  no fear of him margery nor when i come to think it all over do i see why peter should have brought us here if he means anything wrong the man is so mysterious that i cannot line him down to his hole  my word for it bourdon that when you do it will take you to a friendly hive i have put almost as much faith in peter as in you or gershom you heard what he said about parson amen and the corporal  and how coolly he took it all answered her husband shaking his head it has been a sudden departure for them and one would think even an injin might have felt it more  margerys cheek grew pale and her limbs trembled a little it was a minute ere she could pursue the discourse  this is terrible but i will not cannot believe it she said im sure bourdon we ought to be very thankful to peter for having brought us here remember how earnestly he listened to the words of the saviour  if he has brought us here with a good intention i thank him for it but i scarce know what to think pigeonswing has given me many a hint which i have understood to mean that we ought not to trust this unknown injin too much  so has he given me some of his hints though i would sooner trust peter than trust him any time  our lives are in the care of providence i see if we can really rely on these two injins all may be well for peter has brought us to an admirable cover and he says that the chippewa prepared it  the young husband and his wife now landed and began to examine more particularly into the state of the swamp near their place of concealment just at that spot the bank of the river was higher than in most of the low land and was dry with a soil that approached sand this was the place where the few young pines had grown the dry ground might have covered four or five acres and so many trees having been felled light and air were admitted in a way to render the place comparatively cheerful the branches of the felled trees made a sufficient cover in all directions though the swamp itself was more than that almost a defence toward the openings the beehunter found it was possible though it was exceedingly difficult to make his way through it he ascertained the fact however since it might be important to their future movements to know it  in a word le bourdon made a complete reconnaissance of his position he cleared a spot for the females and made a sort of hut that would serve as a protection against rain and in which they all might sleep at night there was little doubt that this place must be occupied for some days if peter was acting in good faith since an early movement would infallibly lead to detection time must be given to the indians to precede them or the great numbers of the savages would scarce leave a hope of escape a greater sense of security succeeded this examination and these arrangements the danger was almost entirely to be apprehended on the side of the river a canoe passing upstream might indeed discover their place of concealment but it was scarcely to be apprehended that one would wade through the mud and water of the swamp to approach them in any other direction  under these circumstances le bourdon began to feel more security in their position could he now be certain of peter his mind would be comparatively at ease and he might turn his attention altogether to making the party comfortable margery who seldom quitted his side reasoned with him on the subject of the mysterious chiefs good faith and by means of her own deep reliance on him she came at last to the point of instilling some of her own confidence into the mind of her husband from that time he worked at the shelter for the females and the other little arrangements their situation rendered necessary with greater zest and with far more attention to the details so long as we are in doubt of accomplishing good we hesitate about employing our energies but once let hope revive within us in the shape of favorable results and we become new men bracing every nerve to the task and working with redoubled spirit even should it be at the pump of the sinking ship which we believe ranks the highest among the toils that are inflicted on the unfortunate  for three days and nights did le bourdon and his friends remain on that dry land of the swamp without hearing or seeing anything of either peter or pigeonswing the time was growing long and the party anxious though the sense of security was much increased by this apparent exemption from danger still uncertainty and the wish to ascertain the precise state of things in the openings were gradually getting to be painful and it was with great satisfaction that the beehunter met his young wife as she came running toward him on the morning of the fourth day to announce that an indian was approaching by wading in the margin of the river keeping always in the water so as to leave no trail hurrying to a point whence their visitor might be seen le bourdon soon perceived it was no other than pigeonswing in a few minutes this indian arrived and was gladly received by all four of the fugitives who gathered around him eager to hear the news  you are welcome chippewa cried le bourdon shaking his friend cordially by the hand we were half afraid we might never see you again do you bring us good or evil tidings  mustnt be squaw and ask too much question bourdon returned the redskin carefully examining the priming of his rifle in order to make sure it was not wet got plenty venison eh  not much venison is left but we have caught a good many fish which have helped us along i have killed a dozen large squirrels too with your bow and arrows which i find you left in your canoe but  yes he good bow datmight kill humminbird wid dat bow fish good here eh  they are eatable when a body can get no better but now i should think pigeonswing you might give us some of the news  mustnt be squaw bourdonbad for warrior be squaw alway bess be man and be patient like man what you tink bourdon got him at last  got what my good fellow i see nothing about you but your arms and ammunition  got scalp of dat weasel wasnt dat well done nebber no young warrior take more scalp home dan pigeonswing carry dis time got tree all hid where bears meat nebber know take em away when he get ready to march  well well chippewai suppose it will not be easy to reason you out of this feelinbut what has become of the redskins who burned my cabin and who killed the missionary and the corporal  all aboutdough must go down river look here bourdon some of dem chief fool enough to tink bee carry you off on his wing  here the chippewa looked his contempt for the credulity and ignorance of the others though he did not express it after the boisterous manner in which a white man of his class might have indulged to him le bourdon was a good fellow but no conjuror and he understood the taking of the bee too well to have any doubts as to the character of that process his friend had let him amuse himself by the hour in looking through his spyglass so that the mind of this one savage was particularly well fortified against the inroads of the weaknesses that had invaded those of most of the members of the great council consequently he was amused with the notion taken up by some of the others that le bourdon had been carried off by bees though he manifested his amusement in a very indianlike fashion  so much the better answered le bourdon and i hope they have followed to line me down to my hive in the settlements  most on em goyes dat true but some dont go plenty of injins still about dis part of opening  what are we then to do we shall soon be in want of food the fish do not bite as they did and i have killed all the squirrels i can find you know i dare not use a rifle  dont be squaw bourdon when injin get marry he grows good deal like squaw at fuss but dat soon go away i spose its just so wid paleface mustnt be squaw bourdon dat bad for warrior what you do for eat why see dere pointing to an object that was floating slowly down the river the current of which was very sluggish just in that reach dere as fat buck as ever did see eh  sure enough the indian had killed a deer of which the openings were full and having brought it to the river he had constructed a raft of logs and placing the carcase on it he had set his game adrift taking care to so far precede it as to be in readiness to tow it into port when this last operation was performed it was found that the chippewa did not heedlessly vaunt the quality of his prize what was more so accurately had he calculated the time and the means of subsistence in the possession of the fugitives that his supply came in just as it was most needed in all this he manifested no more than the care of an experienced and faithful hunter next to the warpath the huntingground is the great field for an indians glory deeds and facts so far eclipsing purely intellectual qualifications with savages as to throw oratory though much esteemed by them and wisdom at the council fires quite into the shade in all this we find the same propensity among ourselves the common mind ever subject to these impulses looks rather to such exploits as address themselves to the senses and the imagination than to those qualities which the reason alone can best appreciate and in this ignorance asserts its negative power over all conditions of life  pigeonswing now condescended to enter on such explanations as the state of the case rendered necessary his account was sufficiently clear and it manifested throughout the sagacity and shrewdness of a practised hunter and scout we shall not attempt to give his words which would require too much space but the substance of his story was briefly this  as has been alluded to already the principal chiefs on a suggestion of bears meat had followed the young men down the kalamazoo dividing themselves by a part of their bodys crossing the stream at the first favorable spot in this way the indians proceeded sweeping the river before them and examining every place that seemed capable of concealing a canoe runners were kept in constant motion between the several parties in order to let the state of the search be known to all and feigning to be one of these very men pigeonswing had held communication with several whom he purposely met and to whom he imparted such invented information as contributed essentially to send the young men forward on a false scent in this way the main body of the savages descended the river some sixty miles following its windings in the first day and a half here pigeonswing left them turning his own face up stream in order to rejoin his friends of peter he had no knowledge neither knowing nor otherwise learning what had become of the great chief on his way up stream pigeonswing met several more indians runners like himself or as he seemed to be or scouts kept on the lookout for the fugitives he had no difficulty in deceiving these men none of them had been of crowsfeathers party and he was a stranger to them all ignorant of his real character they received his information without distrust and the orders he pretended to convey were obeyed by them without the smallest hesitation in this way then pigeonswing contrived to send all the scouts he met away from the river by telling them that there was reason to think the pale faces had abandoned the stream and that it was the wish of bears meat that their trail should be looked for in the interior this was the false direction that he gave to all thereby succeeding better even than he had hoped in clearing the banks of the kalamazoo of observers and foes nevertheless many of those whom he knew to be out some quite in the rear of the party and others in its front and at no great distance from them he did not meet of course he could not get his false directions to their ears there were in fact so many of the indians and so few of the whites that it was an easy matter to cover the path with young warriors any one party of whom would be strong enough to capture two men and as many women  having told the tale of his own doings pigeonswing next came to his proposition for the mode of future proceeding he proposed that the family should get into the canoes that very night and commence its flight by going down the stream directly toward its foes this sounded strangely but there did not seem to be any alternative a march across the peninsula would be too much for the females and there was the certainty that their trail would be found it may seem strange to those who are unacquainted with the american indian and his habits to imagine that in so large an expanse the signs of the passage of so small a party might not escape detection but such was the case to one unaccustomed to the vigilance and intelligence of these savages it must appear just as probable that the vessel could be followed through the wastes of the ocean by means of its wake as that the footprints should be so indelible as to furnish signs that can be traced for days such however is the fact and no one understood it better than the chippewa he was also aware that the country toward ohio whither the fugitives would naturally direct their course now that the english were in possession of detroit must soon be a sort of battleground to which most of the warriors of that region would eagerly repair under all the circumstances therefore he advised the flight by means of the river le bourdon reasoned on all he heard and still entertaining some of his latent distrust of peter and willing to get beyond his reach he soon acquiesced in the proposition and came fully into the plan  it was now necessary to reload the canoes this was done in the course of the day and every arrangement was made so as to be ready for a start as soon as the darkness set in everybody was glad to move though all were aware of the extent of the hazard they ran the females in particular felt their hearts beat as each in her husbands canoe issued out of the cover into the open river pigeonswing took the lead paddling with a slow but steady sweep of his arm and keeping as close as was convenient to one bank by adopting this precaution he effectually concealed the canoes from the eyes of all on that side of the river unless they stood directly on its margin and had the aid of the shadows to help conceal them from any who might happen to be on the other in this way then the party proceeded passing the site of the hut and the grove of openings around it undetected as the river necessarily flowed through the lowest land its banks were wooded much of the way which afforded great protection to the fugitives and this so much the more because these woods often grew in swamps where the scouts would not be likely to resort  about midnight the canoes reached the first rift an hour was lost in unloading and in reloading the canoes and in passing the difficulties at that point as soon as this was done the party re embarked and resorted once more to the use of the paddle in order to gain a particular sheltered reach of the river previously to the return of light this was effected successfully and the party landed  it now appeared that pigeonswing had chosen another swamp as a place of concealment for the fugitives to use during the day these swamps through which the river wound its way in short reaches were admirably adapted to such purposes dark sombre and hardly penetrable on the side of the land they were little likely to be entered after a first examination nor was it at all probable that females in particular would seek a refuge in such a place but the chippewa had found the means to obviate the natural obstacles of the low land there were several spots where the water from the river set back into the swamp forming so many little creeks and into the largest of one of these he pushed his canoe the others following where he led by resorting to such means the shelter now obtained was more complete perhaps than that previously left  pigeonswing forced his light boat up the shallow inlet until he reached a bit of dry land where he brought up announcing that as the abidingplace during the day glad enough was every one to get on shore in a spot that promised security after eight hours of unremitting paddling and of painful excitement notwithstanding the rifts and carryingplaces they had met and been obliged to overcome le bourdon calculated that they had made as many as thirty miles in the course of that one night this was a great movement and to all appearances it had been made without detection as for the chippewa he was quite content and no sooner was his canoe secured than he lighted his pipe and sat down to his enjoyment with an air of composure and satisfaction  and here you think pigeonswing that we shall be safe during the day demanded le bourdon approaching the fallen tree on which the indian had taken his seat  sartainno pottawattamie come here too wet dont like wet ant duck or gooselike dry land juss like squaw dis good baccy bourdonhope you got more for friend  i have enough for us all pigeonswing and you shall have a full share now tell me what will be your next move and where do you intend to pass the morrow  juss like diss plenty of swamp bourdon on kekalamazoo footnote this is the true indian word though the whites have seen fit to omit the first syllable run canoe in swamp den safe nough injins wont look ere cause he dont know whereabout look dont like swamp great danger down at mouth of river  so it has seemed to me chippewa the injins must be there in a strong force and we shall find it no easy matter to get through them how do you propose to do it  go by in night no udder way when cant see cant see dere plenty of rush dere dat good ting and praps dat help us rush good cover for canoe expec when we get down ere to get some scalp too plenty of pottawattamie about dat lodge sartain and it very hard if dont get some on him scalp you mean stop and dig up cache eh bourdon  the cool quiet manner in which pigeonswing revealed his own plans and inquired into those of his friend had at least the effect to revive the confidence of le bourdon he could not think the danger very great so long as one so experienced as the chippewa felt so much confidence in his own future proceedings and after talking a short time longer with this man the beehunter went to seek margery in order to impart to her a due portion of his own hopes  the sisters were preparing the breakfast this was done without the use of fire it being too hazardous to permit smoke to rise above the tops of the trees many is the camp that has been discovered by the smoke which can be seen at a great distance and it is a certain sign of the presence of man when it ascends in threads or such small columns as denote a domestic fire beneath this is very different from the clouds that float above the burning prairies and which all at once impute to their true origin the danger of using fire had been so much guarded against by our fugitives that the cooking of the party had been done at night the utmost caution having been used to prevent the fire itself from being seen and care taken to extinguish it long before the return of day a supply of cold meat was always on hand and had it not been the fugitives would have known how to live on berries or at need to fast anything was preferable being exposed to certain capture  as soon as the party had broken their fast arrangements were made for recruiting nature by sleep as for pigeonswing indianlike he had eaten enormously no reasonable quantity of venison sufficing to appease his appetite and when he had eaten he lay down in the bottom of his canoe and slept similar dispositions were made of their persons by the rest and half an hour after the meal was ended all there were in a profound sleep no watch was considered necessary and none was kept  the rest of the weary is sweet long hours passed ere any one there awoke but no sooner did the chippewa move than all the rest were afoot it was now late in the day and it was time to think of taking the meal that was to sustain them through the toil and fatigues of another arduous night this was done the necessary preparations being made for a start ere the sun had set the canoes were then shoved as near the mouth of the inlet as it was safe to go while the light remained here they stopped and a consultation took place as to the manner of proceeding  no sooner did the shades of evening close around the place than the fugitives again put forth the night was clouded and dark and so much of the way now lay through forests that there was little reason to apprehend detection the chief causes of delay were the rifts and the portages as had been the case the night before luckily le bourdon had been up and down the stream so often as to be a very tolerable pilot in its windings he assumed the control and by midnight the greatest obstacle to that evenings progress was overcome at the approach of day pigeonswing pointed out another creek in another swamp where the party found a refuge for the succeeding day in this manner four nights were passed on the river and as many days in swamps without discovery the chippewa had nicely calculated his time and his distances and not the smallest mistake was made each morning a place of shelter was reached in sufficient season and each night the fugitives were ready for the start as the day shut in in this manner most of the river was descended until a distance that could be easily overcome in a couple of hours of paddling alone remained between the party and the mouth of the stream extreme caution was now necessary for signs of indians in the neighborhood had been detected at several points in the course of the last nights work on one occasion indeed the escape was so narrow as to be worth recording  it was at a spot where the stream flowed through a forest denser than common that pigeonswing heard voices on the river ahead of him one indian was calling to another asking to be set across the stream in a canoe it was too late to retreat and so much uncertainty existed as to the nearness or distance of the danger that the chippewa deemed it safest to bring all three of his canoes together and to let them float past the point suspected or rather known to be occupied by enemies this was done with the utmost care the plan succeeded though not without running a very great risk the canoes did float past unseen though there was a minute of time when le bourdon fancied by the sounds that savages were talking to each other within a hundred feet of his ears additional security however was felt in consequence of the circumstance since the pursuers must imagine the river below them to be free from the pursued  the halt that morning was made earlier than had been the practice previously this was done because the remaining distance was so small that in continuing to advance the party would have incurred the risk of reaching the mouth of the river by daylight this was to be avoided on every account but principally because it was of great importance to conceal from the savages the direction taken were the chiefs certain that their intended victims were on lake michigan it would be possible for them to send parties across the isthmus that should reach points on lake huron days in advance of the arrival of the beehunter and his friends in the vicinity of saginaw or pointe aux barques for instance and where the canoes would be almost certain to pass near the shore laying their ambushes to accomplish these ends it was thought very material therefore to conceal the movements even after the lake might be reached though le bourdon had not a doubt of his canoes much outsailing those of the savages the indians are not very skilful in the use of sails while the bee hunter knew how to manage a bark canoe in rough water with unusual skill in the common acceptation he was no sailor but in his own peculiar craft there was not a man living who could excel him in dexterity or judgment  the haltingplace that morning was not in a swamp for none offered at a suitable distance from the mouth of the river on the contrary it was in a piece of opening that was tolerably well garnished with trees however and through which ran a small brook that poured its tribute into the kalamazoo the chippewa had taken notice of this brook which was large enough to receive the canoes where they might be concealed in the rushes a favorable copse surrounded with elders afforded a covered space on shore and these advantages were improved for an encampment  instead of seeking his rest as usual on reaching this cover pigeonswing left the party on a scout he walked up the brook some distance in order to conceal his trail and then struck across the opening taking the direction westward or toward the rivers mouth as for le bourdon and his friends they ate and slept as usual undisturbed but arose some hours before the close of day  thus far a great work had been accomplished the canoes had descended the stream with a success that was only equalled by the hardihood of the measure conducted by an intelligence that really seemed to amount to an instinct pigeonswing carried a map of the kalamazoo in his head and seemed never at a loss to know where to find the particular place he sought it is true he had roamed through those openings ever since he was a child and an indian seldom passes a place susceptible of being made of use to his habits that he does not take such heed of its peculiarities as to render him the master of all its facilities  margery was now full of hope while the beehunter was filled with apprehensions she saw all things couleur de rose for she was young happy and innocent but he better understood that they were just approaching the most serious moment of their flight he knew the vigilance of the american savage and could not deceive himself on the subject of the danger they must run the mouth of the river was just the place that of all others would be the closest watched and to pass it would require not only all their skill and courage but somewhat of the fostering care of providence it might be done with success though the chances were much against     chapter xxviii       yes we have need to bid our hopes repose      on some protecting influence here confined      life hath no healing balm for mental woes      earth is too narrow for the immortal mind      our spirits burn to mingle with the day      as exiles panting for their native coast      yet lured by every wildflower from their way      and shrinking from the gulf that

disposition to pry into unknown things which is said to mark her sex and which was the weakness assailed by the serpent when he deluded eve into disobedience that now tempted margery to go beyond the limits which pigeonswing had set for her with a view to explore and ascertain what might be found without in doing this however she did not neglect a certain degree of caution and avoided exposing her person as much as possible  margery had got to the very verge of prudence so far as the cover was concerned when her steps were suddenly arrested by a most unexpected and disagreeable sight an indian was seated on a rock within twenty feet of the place where she stood his back was toward her but she was certain it could not be pigeonswing who had gone in a contrary direction while the frame of this savage was much larger and heavier than that of the chippewa his rifle leaned against the rock near his arm and the tomahawk and knife were in his belt still margery thought so far as she could ascertain that he was not in his warpaint as she knew was the fact with those whom she had seen at prairie round the attitude and whole deportment of this stranger too struck her as remarkable although our heroine stood watching him for several minutes almost breathless with terror and anxiety to learn his object he never stirred even a limb in all that time there he sat motionless as the rock on which he had placed himself a picture of solitude and reflection  it was evident moreover that this stranger also sought a species of concealment as well as the fugitives it is true he had not buried himself in a cover of bushes but his seat was in a hollow of the ground where no one could have seen him from the rear or on either side at a distance a very little greater than that at which margery stood while his front was guarded from view by a line of bushes that fringed the margin of the stream marius pondering on the mutations of fortune amid the ruins of carthage could scarcely have presented a more striking object than the immovable form of this stranger at length the indian slightly turned his head when his observer to her great surprise saw the hard red but noble and expressive profile of the wellknown features of peter  in an instant all margerys apprehensions vanished and her hand was soon lightly laid on the shoulder of her friend notwithstanding the suddenness of this touch the great chief manifested no alarm he turned his head slowly and when he saw the bright countenance of the charming bride his smile met hers in pleased recognition there was no start no exclamation no appearance of surprise on the contrary peter seemed to meet his pretty young friend much as a matter of course and obviously with great satisfaction  how lucky this is peter exclaimed

want bourdon scalp much as any  a slight exclamation from his companion which could scarcely be called a scream caused the indian to cease speaking when the two looked toward each other and their eyes met margery however saw none of those passing gleams of ferocity which had so often troubled her in the first few weeks of their acquaintance in their stead an expression of subdued anxiety and an earnestness of inquiry that seemed to say how much the chiefs heart yearned to know more on that mighty subject toward which his thoughts had lately been turned the mutual glance sufficed to renew the confidence our heroine was very reluctant to relinquish while it awakened afresh all of peters parental concern in the welfare of the interesting young woman at his side  but this feeling has left you peter and you no longer wish bourdons scalp said margery hastily now he is my husband he is your son  dat good praps answered the injin but dat not a reason nudder blossom you right too dont want

on my own account though i will own that i have sometimes feared that the dreadful cruel stories which are told of your enmity to my color are not altogether without truth now you tell me you are the white mans friend and that you no longer wish to injure him these are blessed words peter and humbly do i thank god through his blessed son that i have lived to hear them  dat son make me feel so

teaches you to see and feel the beauty of such an act without the aid of that spirit we are helpless as children with it strong as giants i do not wonder at all that the good missionary was able to pray for his enemies with his dying breath god gave him strength to do so  margery spoke as she felt earnestly and with emphasis her cheeks flushed with the strength of her feelings and peter gazed on her with a species of reverence and wonder the beauty of this charming young woman was pleasing rather than brilliant depending much on expression for its power a heightened color greatly increased it and when as in this instance the eyes reflected the tints of the cheeks one might have journeyed days in older regions without finding her equal in personal attractions much as he admired her however peter had now that on his mind which rendered her beauty but a secondary object with him his soul had been touched by the unseen but omnipresent power of the holy spirit and his companions language and fervor contributed largely in keeping alive his interest in what he felt  nebber know injin do dat said peter in a slow deliberative sort of way no nebber know injin do so always curse and hate his enemy and most when about to lose his scalp den feelins hottest den most want to use tomahawk on his enemy den most feel dat he hate him but not so wid medicinepriest pray for injin ask great

great spirit love injin may be so tink he love ebbery body but he cant love injin as much as he love pale face or he wouldnt let red man know so little dont count wigwams and canoes and powder and lead as proof of great spirits love paleface got more of dese dan injin dat i see and know and dat i feel but it no matter injin used to be poor and dont care when used to be poor den used to it when used to be rich den it hard not to be rich all use injin dont care but it bad not to know im warriorim hunterim great chief you squawyou youngyou know so much as squaw of chief but you know most i feel ashamed to know so little want to know more want to know most how e son of great spirit die for all tribe and pray to his fader to bless em dat kill him dat what peter now want most to know  i wish i was better able to teach you peter from the bottom of my heart but the little i do know you shall hear i would not deny you for a thousand worlds for i believe the holy spirit has touched your heart and that you will become a new man christians believe that all must become new men who are to live in the other world in the presence of god  how can dat be peter soon be olehow can ole man grow young agin  the meaning of this is that we must so change in feelings as no longer to be the same persons the things that we loved we must hate and the things that we hated or at least neglected we must love when we feel this change in our hearts then may we hope that we love and reverence the great spirit and are living under his holy care  peter listened with the attention of an obedient and respectful child if meekness humility a wish to learn the truth and a devout sentiment toward the creator are so many indications of the new birth then might this savage be said to have been truly born again certainly he was no longer the same man in a moral point of view and of this he was himself entirely conscious to him the wonder was what had produced so great and so sudden a change but the reply he made to margery will of itself sufficiently express his views of his own case  an injin like a child he said meekly nebber know even pale face squaw know more dan great chief nebber feel as do now heart soft as young squaws dont hate any body no more wish well to all tribe and color and nation dont hate brish dont hate yankee dont hate cherokee even wish em all well dont know dat heart is strong enough to ask great spirit to do em all good if dey want my scalpprap dat too much for poor injin but dont want nobodys scalp myself dat sometin i hope for me  it is indeed peter and if you will get down on your knees and humble your thoughts and pray to god to strengthen you in these good feelings he will be sure to do it and make you altogether a new man  peter looked wistfully at margery and then turned his eyes toward the earth after sitting in a thoughtful mood for some time he again regarded his companion saying with the simplicity of a child  dont know how to do dat blossom hear medicinepriest of pale faces pray sometime but poor injin dont know enough to speak to great spirit you speak to great spirit for him he know your voice blossom and listen to what you say but he wont hear peter who has so long hated his enemy praps he angry if he hear peter speak  in that you are mistaken peter the ears of the lord are ever open to our prayers when put up in sincerity as i feel certain that yours will now be but after i have told you the meaning of what i am about to say i will pray with you and for you it is best that you should begin to do this as soon as you can  margery then slowly repeated to peter the words of the lords prayer she gave him its history and explained the meaning of several of its words that might otherwise have been unintelligible to him notwithstanding his tolerable proficiency in englisha proficiency that had greatly increased in the last few weeks in consequence of his constant communications with those who spoke it habitually the word trespasses in particular was somewhat difficult for the indian to comprehend but margery persevered until she succeeded in giving her scholar tolerably accurate ideas of the meaning of each term then she told the indian to kneel with her and for the first time in his life that man of the openings and prairies lifted his voice in prayer to the one god it is true that peter had often before mentally asked favors of his manitou but the requests were altogether of a worldly character and the being addressed was invested with attributes very different from those which he now understood to belong to the lord of heaven and earth nor was the spirit in asking at all the same we do not wish to be understood as saying that this indian was already a full convert to christianity which contains many doctrines of which he had not the most distant idea but his heart had undergone the first step in the great change of conversion and he was now as humble as he had once been proud as meek as he had formerly been fierce and he felt that certain proof of an incipient love of the creator in a similar feeling toward all the works of his hands  when peter arose from his knees after repeating the prayer to margerys slow leading it was with the dependence of a child on the teaching of its mother physically he was the man he ever had been he was as able to endure fatigue as sinewy in his frame and as capable of fasting and of sustaining fatigue as in his most warlike days but morally the change was great indeed instead of the obstinate confidence in himself and his traditions which had once so much distinguished this chief there was substituted an humble distrust of his own judgment that rendered him singularly indisposed to rely on his personal views in any matter of conscience and he was truly become a child in all that pertained to his religious belief in good hands and under more advantageous circumstances the moral improvement of peter would have been great but situated as he was it could not be said to amount to much more than a very excellent commencement  all this time both peter and margery had been too intent on their feelings and employment to take much heed to the precautions necessary to their concealment the sun was setting ere they arose and then it was that peter made the important discovery that they were observed by two of the young men of the pottawattamiesscouts kept out by bears meat to look for the fugitives  the time was when peter would not have hesitated to use his rifle on these unwelcome intruders but the better spirit that had come over him now led him to adopt a very different course motioning to the young men he ordered them to retire while he led margery within the cover of the bushes formerly peter would not have scrupled to resort to deception in order to throw these two young men on a wrong scent and get rid of them in that mode but now he had a reluctance to deceive and no sooner did they fall back at his beckoning than he followed margery to the camp the latter was giving her husband a hurried account of what had just happened as peter joined them  our camp is known exclaimed the beehunter the instant he beheld the indian  juss so pottawattamie see squaw and go and tell his chief dat sartain answered peter  what is there to be donefight for our lives or fly  get in canoe quick as can it take dem young men halfhour to reach place where chief be in dat halfhour we muss go as far as we can no good to stay here injin come in about one hour  le bourdon knew his position well enough to understand this nevertheless there were several serious objections to an immediate flight pigeonswing was absent and the beehunter did not like the notion of leaving him behind for various reasons then it was not yet dark and to descend the river by daylight appeared like advancing into the jaws of the lion designedly nor was le bourdon at his ease on the subject of peter his sudden appearance the insufficient and far from clear account of margery and the extraordinary course advised served to renew ancient distrusts and to render him reluctant to move but of one thing there could be no doubt their present position must be known for margery had seen the two strange indians with her own eyes and a search might soon be expected under all the circumstances therefore our hero reluctantly complied with margerys reiterated solicitations and they all got into the canoes  i do not like this movement peter said le bourdon as he shoved his own light craft down the brook previously to entering the river i hope it may turn out to be better than it looks and that you can keep us out of the hands of our enemies remember it is broad daylight and that red men are plenty two or three miles below us  yes know dat but muss go injin too plenty here soon yes muss go bourdon why you cant ask bee now what bess ting for you to do eh good time now ask bee to tell what he know  the beehunter made no reply but his pretty wife raised her hand involuntarily as if to implore the indian to forbear peter was a little bewildered for as yet he did not understand that a belief in necromancy was not exactly compatible with the notions of the christian providence in his ignorance how much was he worse off than the wisest of our race will any discreet man who has ever paid close attention to the power of the somnambule deny that there is a mystery about such a person that exceeds all our means of explanation that there are degrees in the extent of this power that there are false as well as true somnambulesall who have attended to the subject must allow but a deriding disbeliever in our own person once we have since seen that which no laws known to us can explain and which we are certain is not the subject of collusion as we must have been a party to the fraud ourselves were any such practised to deny the evidence of our senses is an act of greater weakness than to believe that there are mysteries connected with our moral and physical being that human sagacity has not yet been able to penetrate and we repudiate the want of manliness that shrinks from giving its testimony when once convinced through an apprehension of being derided as weaker than those who withhold their belief we know that our own thoughts have been explained and rendered by a somnambule under circumstances that will not admit of any information by means known to us by other principles and whatever others may think on the subject we are perfectly conscious that no collusion did or could exist why then are we to despise the poor indian because he still fancied le bourdon could hold communication with his bees we happen to be better informed and there may be beings who are aware of the as yet hidden laws of animal magnetismhidden as respects ourselves though known to themand who fully comprehend various mistakes and misapprehensions connected with our impressions on this subject that escape our means of detection it is not surprising therefore that peter in his emergency turned to those bees in the hope that they might prove of assistance or that margery silently rebuked him for the weakness in the manner mentioned  although it was still light the sun was near setting when the canoes glided into the river fortunately for the fugitives the banks were densely wooded and the stream of great widtha little lake in factand there was not much danger of their being seen until they got near the mouth nor then even should they once get within the cover of the wild rice and of the rushes there was no retreat however and after paddling some distance in order to get beyond the observation of any scout who might approach the place where they had last been seen the canoes were brought close together and suffered to float before a smart breeze so as not to reach the mouth of the stream before the night closed around them everything appeared so tranquil the solitude was so profound and their progress so smooth and uninterrupted that a certain amount of confidence revived in the breasts of all and even the beehunter had hopes of eventual escape  a conversation now occurred in which peter was questioned concerning the manner in which he had been occupied during his absence an absence that had given le bourdon so much concern had the chief been perfectly explicit he would have confessed that fully onehalf of his waking thoughts had been occupied in thinking of the death of the son of god of the missionarys prayer for his enemies and of the sublime morality connected with such a religion it is true peter did notcould not indeedenter very profoundly into the consideration of these subjects nor were his notions either very clear or orthodox but they were sincere and the feelings to which they gave birth were devout peter did not touch on these circumstances however confining his explanations to the purely material part of his proceedings he had remained with bears meat crowsfeather and the other leading chiefs in order to be at the fountainhead of information and to interpose his influence should the palefaces unhappily fall into the hands of those who were so industriously looking for them nothing had occurred to call his authority out but a strange uncertainty seemed to reign among the warriors concerning the manner in which their intended victims eluded their endeavors to overtake them no trail had been discovered scout after scout coming in to report a total want of success in their investigations inland this turned the attention of the indians still more keenly on the rivers mouth it being certain that the canoes could not have passed out into the lake previously to the arrival of the two or three first parties of their young men who had been sent so early to watch that particular outlet  peter informed le bourdon that his cache had been discovered opened and rifled of its stores this was a severe loss to our hero and one that would have been keenly felt at any other time but just then he had interests so much more important to protect that he thought and said little about this mishap the circumstance which gave him the most concern was this peter stated that bears meat had directed about a dozen of his young men to keep watch day and night in canoes near the mouth of the river lying in wait among the wild rice like so many snakes in the grass  the party was so much interested in this conversation that almost insensibly to themselves they had dropped down to the beginning of the rushes and rice and had got rather dangerously near to the critical point of their passage as it was still daylight peter now proposed pushing the canoes in among the plants and there remaining until it might be safer to move this was done accordingly and in a minute or two all three of the little barks were concealed within the cover  the question now was whether the fugitives had been observed but suffered to advance as every foot they descended the stream was taking them nearer to their foes peter did not conceal his apprehension on this point since he deemed it improbable that any reach near the mouth of the kalamazoo was without its lookouts at a moment so interesting such was indeed the fact as was afterward ascertained but the young men who had seen peter and margery had given the alarm passing the word where the fugitives were to be found and the sentinels along this portion of the stream had deserted their stations in order to be in at the capture by such delicate and unforeseen means does providence often protect those who are the subjects of its especial care baffling the calculations of art by its own quiet control of events  the beehunter had a feverish desire to be moving after remaining in the cover about half an hour he proposed that they should get the canoes into one of the open passages of which there were many among the plants and proceed peter had more of the patience of an indian and deemed the hour too early but le bourdon was not yet entirely free from distrust of his companion and telling gershom to follow he began paddling down one of the passages mentioned this decisive step compelled the rest to follow or to separate from their companions they chose to do the first  had le bourdon possessed more selfcommand and remained stationary a little longer he would in all probability have escaped altogether from a very serious danger that he was now compelled to run although there were many of the open places among the plants they did not always communicate with each other and it became necessary to force the canoes through little thickets in order to get out of one into another keeping the general direction of descending the river it was while effecting the first of these changes that the agitation of the tops of the plants caught the eye of a lookout on the shore by signals understood among themselves this man communicated his discovery to a canoe that was acting as one of the guardboats thus giving a general alarm along the whole line of sentinels as well as to the chiefs down at the hut or at the mouth of the river the fierce delight with which this news was received after so long a delay became ungovernable and presently yells and cries filled the air proceeding from both sides of the stream as well as from the river itself  there was not a white person in those canoes who did not conceive that their party was lost when this clamor was heard with peter it was different instead of admitting of alarm he turned all his faculties to use while le bourdon himself was nearly in despair peter was listening with his nice ears to catch the points on the river whence the yells arose for the banks he cared nothing the danger was from the canoes by the keenness of his faculties the chief ascertained that there were four canoes out and that they would have to run the gauntlet between them or escape would be hopeless by the sounds he also became certain that these four canoes were in the rice two on each side of the river and there they would probably remain in expectation that the fugitives would be most likely to come down in the cover  the decision of peter was made in a moment it was now quite dark and those who were in canoes within the rice could not well see the middle of the stream even by daylight he determined therefore to take the very centre of the river giving his directions to that effect with precision and clearness the females he ordered to lie down each in her own canoe while their husbands alone were to remain visible peter hoped that in the darkness le bourdon and gershom might pass for indians on the lookout and under his own immediate command  one very important fact was ascertained by le bourdon as soon as these arrangements were explained and completed the wind on the lake was blowing from the south and of course was favorable to those who desired to proceed in the opposite direction this he communicated to margery in a low tone endeavoring to encourage her by all the means in his power in return the young wife muttered a few encouraging words to her husband every measure was understood between the parties in the event of a discovery the canoes were to bury themselves in the rice taking different directions each man acting for himself a place of rendezvous was appointed outside at a headland known to gershom and le bourdon and signals were agreed on by which the latest arrival might know that all was safe there these points were settled as the canoes floated slowly down the stream  peter took and kept the lead the night was starlit and clear but there was no moon on the water this made but little difference objects not being visible at any material distance the chief governed the speed which was moderate but regular at the rate he was now going it would require about an hour to carry the canoes into the lake but nearly all of that hour must pass in the midst of enemies  half of the period just mentioned elapsed positively without an alarm of any sort by this time the party was abreast of the spot where gershom and le bourdon had secreted the canoes in the former adventure at the mouth of the river on the shores however a very different scene now offered then the fire burned brightly in the hut and the savages could be seen by its light now all was not only dark but still as death there was no longer any cry sound alarm or footfall audible the very air seemed charged with uncertainty and its offspring apprehension  as they approached nearer and nearer to what was conceived to be the most critical point in the passage the canoes got closer together so close indeed that le bourdon and gershom might communicate in very guarded tones the utmost care was taken to avoid making any noise since a light and careless blow from a paddle on the side of a canoe would be almost certain now to betray them margery and dorothy could no longer control their feelings and each rose in her seat raising her body so as to bring her head above the gunwale of the canoe if a bark canoe can be said to have a gunwale at all they even whispered to each other endeavoring to glean encouragement by sympathy at this instant occurred the crisis in their attempt to escape     chapter xxix       for an indian isle she shapes her way      with constant mind both night and day      she seems to hold her home in view      and sails as if the path she knew      so calm and stately in her motion      across the unfathomed trackless ocean                                             wilson   it has been said that peter was in advance when his canoe was nearly abreast of the usual landing at the hut he saw two canoes coming out from among the rice and distant from him not more than a hundred yards at a greater distance indeed it would not have been easy to distinguish such an object on the water at all instead of attempting to avoid these two canoes the chief instantly called to them drawing the attention of those in them to himself speaking so loud as to be easily overheard by those who followed  my young men are too late he said the palefaces have been seen in the openings above by our warriors and must soon be here let us land and be ready to meet them at the wigwam  peters voice was immediately recognized the confident quiet natural manner in which he spoke served to mislead those in the canoes and when he joined them and entered the passage among the rice that led to the landing preceding the others the last followed him as regularly as the colt follows its dam le bourdon heard the conversation and understood the movement though he could not see the canoes peter continued talking aloud as he went up the passage receiving answers to all he said from his new companions his voice serving to let the fugitives know precisely where they were all this was understood and improved by the last who lost no time in turning the adventure to account  the first impulse of le bourdon had been to turn and fly up stream but ascertaining that these dangerous enemies were so fully occupied by peter as not to see the canoes behind he merely inclined a little toward the other side of the channel and slackened his rate of movement in order not to come too near the instant he was satisfied that all three of the canoes in advance had entered the passage mentioned and were moving toward the landing he let out and glided down stream like an arrow it required but half a minute to cross the opening of the passage but peters conversation kept his followers looking ahead which greatly lessened the risk le bourdons heart was in his mouth several times while thus running the gauntlet as it might be but fortune favored them or as margery more piously understood the circumstances a divine providence led them in safety past the danger  at the mouth of the river both le bourdon and gershom thought it highly probable that they should fall in with more lookouts and each prepared his arms for a fight but no canoe was there and the fugitives were soon in the lake michigan is a large body of water and a bark canoe is but a frail craft to put to sea in when there is any wind or commotion on the present occasion there was a good deal of both so much as greatly to terrify the females of all the craft known however one of these eggshells is really the safest if properly managed among breakers or amid the combing of seas we have ourselves ridden in them safely through a surf that would have swamped the best manofwar cutter that ever floated and done it too without taking on board as much water as would serve to wash ones hands the light vessel floats on so little of the element indeed that the foam of a large sea has scarce a chance of getting above it or aboard it the great point in the handling being to prevent the canoe from falling broadside to by keeping it end on to the sea in our opinion a smart gale might be weathered in one of these craft provided the endurance of a man could bear up against the unceasing watchfulness and incessant labor of sweeping with the paddle in order to prevent broaching to  le bourdon it has been said was very skilful in the management of his craft and gershom now perforce a sober and useful man was not much behind him in this particular the former had foreseen this very difficulty and made all his arrangements to counteract it no sooner therefore did he find the canoes in rough water than he brought them together side by side and lashed them there this greatly lessened the danger of capsizing though it increased the labor of managing the craft when disposed to turn broadside to it only remained to get sail on the catamaran for some such thing was it now in order to keep ahead of the sea as much as possible light cotton lugs were soon spread one in each canoe and away they went as sailors term it wing and wing  it was now much easier steering though untiring vigilance was still necessary a boat may appear to fly and yet the send of the sea shall glance ahead of it with the velocity of a bird nothing that goes through or on the waterand the last is the phrase best suited to the floating of a bark canoecan ever be made to keep company with that feathery foam which under the several names of whitecapsan inshore and lubbers termcombs breaking of the seas the wash etc etc glances by a vessel in a blow or comes on board her even when she is running before it we have often watched these clouds of water as they have shot ahead of us when ploughing our own ten or eleven knot through the brine and they have ever appeared to us as so many useful admonishers of what the power of god is as compared to the power of man the last shall construct his ship fit her with all the appliances of his utmost art sail her with the seamans skill and force her through her element with something like railroad speed yet will the seas send their feathery crests past her like so many dolphins or porpoises sporting under her forefoot it is this following sea which becomes so very dangerous in heavy gales and which compels the largest ships frequently to heave to in order that they may present their bows to its almost resistless power  but our adventurers had no such gales as those we mean or any such seas to withstand the wind blew fresh from the south and michigan can get up a very respectable swell at need like the seas in all the great lakes it was short and all the worse for that the larger the expanse of water over which the wind passes the longer is the sea and the easier is it for the ship to ride on it those of lake michigan however were quite long enough for a bark canoe and glad enough were both margery and dorothy when they found their two little vessels lashed together and wearing an air of more stability than was common to them le bourdons sail was first spread and it produced an immediate relief from the washing of the waves the drift of a bark canoe in a smart blow is considerable it having no hold on the water to resist it but our adventurers fairly flew as soon as the cotton cloth was opened the wind being exactly south by steering due north or dead before it it was found possible to carry the sail in the other canoe borne out on the opposite side and from the moment that was opened all the difficulty was reduced to steering so small as seamen term it as to prevent one or the other of the lugs from jibing had this occurred however no very serious consequences would have followed the precaution taken of lashing the craft together rendering capsizing next to impossible  the kalamazoo and its mouth were soon far behind and le bourdon no longer felt the least apprehension of the savages left in it the indians are not bold navigators and he felt certain that the lake was too rough for the savages to venture out while his own course gradually carried him off the land and out of the track of anything that kept near the shore a short time produced a sense of security and the wind appearing to fall instead of increasing in violence it was soon arranged that one of the men should sleep while the other looked to the safety of the canoes  it was about nine oclock when the fugitives made sail off the mouth of the kalamazoo and at the return of light seven hours later they were more than forty miles from the place of starting the wind still stood with symptoms of growing fresher again as the sun rose and the land could just be seen in the eastern board the coast in that direction having made a considerable curvature inland this had brought the canoes farther from the land than le bourdon wished to be but he could not materially change his course without taking in one of his sails as much variation was made however as was prudent and by nine oclock or twelve hours after entering the lake the canoes again drew near to the shore which met them ahead by the bee hunters calculations they were now about seventy miles from the mouth of the kalamazoo having passed the outlets of two or three of the largest streams of those regions  the fugitives selected a favorable spot and landed behind a headland that gave them a sufficient lee for the canoes they had now reached a point where the coast trends a little to the eastward which brought the wind in a slight degree off the land this change produced no very great effect on the seas but it enabled the canoes to keep close to the shore making something of a lee for them this they did about noon after having lighted a fire caught some fish in a small stream killed a deer and dressed it and cooked enough provisions to last for two or three days the canoes were now separated again it being easier to manage them in that state than when lashed together besides enabling them to carry both sails the farther north they got the more of a lee was found though it was in no place sufficient to bring smooth water  in this manner several more hours were passed and six times as many more miles were made in distance when le bourdon again landed which he did shortly before the sun set he calculated his distance from the mouth of the kalamazoo to be rather more than a hundred miles his principal object was to ascend a bluff and to take a look at the coast in order to examine it for canoes this his glass enabled him to do with some accuracy and when he rejoined the party he was rejoiced to have it in his power to report that the coast was clear after refreshing themselves the canoes were again brought together in order to divide the watches and a new start was made for the night in this manner did our adventurers make their way to the northward for two nights and days landing often to fish hunt rest and cook as well as to examine the coast at the end of the time mentioned the celebrated straits of the michillimackinac or mackinaw as they are almost universally termed came in sight the course had been gradually changing toward the eastward and luckily for the progress of the fugitives the wind with it leaving them always a favorable breeze but it was felt to be no longer safe to use a sail and recourse was had to the paddles until the straits and island were passed this caused some delay and added a good deal to the labor but it was deemed so dangerous to display their white cotton sails objects that might be seen for a considerable distance that it was thought preferable to adopt this caution nor was it useless in consequence of this foresight a fleet of canoes was passed in safety which were crossing from the post at mackinaw to ward the main land of michigan the number of the canoes in this fleet could not have been less than fifty but getting a timely view of them le bourdon hid his own craft in a cove and remained there until the danger was over  the course now changed still more while the wind got quite round to the westward this made a fair wind at first and gave the canoes a good lee as they advanced lake huron which was the water the fugitives were now on lies nearly parallel to michigan and the course was southeasterly as le bourdon had often passed both ways on these waters he had his favorite harbors and knew those signs which teach navigators how to make their prognostics of the weather on the whole the fugitives did very well though they lost two days between mackinaw and saginaw bay one on account of the strength of the wind and one on account of rain during the last they remained in a hut that le bourdon had himself constructed in one of his many voyages and which he had left standing these empty cabins or chientes are of frequent occurrence in new countries being used like the refuges in the alps by every traveller as he has need of them  the sight of the fleet of canoes in the straits of michillimackinac caused the fugitives the only real trouble they had felt between the time when they left the mouth of the kalamazoo and the ten days that succeeded by the end of that period the party had crossed saginaw and was fast coming up with point au barques a landmark for all who navigate the waters of huron when a canoe was seen coming out from under the land steering as if to intercept them this sight gave both concern and pleasure concern as it might lead to a hostile encounter and pleasure because the beehunter hoped for information that might be useful in governing his future course here his glass came in play with good effect by means of that instrument it was soon ascertained that the strange canoe contained but two men both indians and as that was just their own force no great danger was apprehended from the meeting the craft therefore continued to approach each other le bourdon keeping his glass levelled on the strangers much of the time  as i live yonder are peter and pigeonswing suddenly exclaimed our hero they have crossed the peninsula and have come out from the point in that canoe to meet us  with important news then depend on it benjamin answered the wife tell this to brother that he and dolly may not feel more alarm than is necessary  the beehunter called out to his friends in the other canoe and communicated the discovery just made the two craft keeping always within hailing distance of each other  them injins are not here for nothing answered dorothy you will find they have something serious to say  we shall soon know called out le bourdon ten minutes will bring us alongside of them  the ten minutes did that much and before the expiration of the short space the three canoes were fastened together that of peter being in the centre the beehunter saw at a glance that the expedition of the indians had been hurried for their canoe besides being of very indifferent qualities was not provided with the implements and conveniences usual to a voyage of any length still he would not ask a question but lighting his pipe after a few puffs he passed it courteously over to peter the great chief smoked a while and gave it to pigeonswing in his turn who appeared to enjoy it quite as much as any of the party  my father does not believe he is a jew said le bourdon smiling willing to commence a discourse though still determined not to betray a womanish curiosity  we are poor injins bourdon just as the great spirit made us dat bess cant help what manitou do if he dont make us jew cant be jew if he make us injin muss be injin for my part blieve im injin and dont want to be paleface can love paleface now juss as well as love injin  oh i hope this is true peter exclaimed margery her handsome face flushing with delight at hearing these words so long as your heart tells you this be certain that the spirit of god is in you  peter made no answer but he looked profoundly impressed with the novel feeling that had taken possession of his soul as for the bee hunter he did not meddle with margerys convictions or emotions on such subjects resembling in this particular most men who however indifferent to religion in their own persons are never sorry to find that their wives profoundly submit to its influence after a short pause a species of homage involuntarily paid to the subject he thought he might now inquire into the circumstances that brought the indians on their route without incurring the imputation of a weak and impatient curiosity in reply peters story was soon told he had rejoined the chiefs without exciting distrust and all had waited for the young men to bring in the captives as soon as it was ascertained that the intended victims had escaped and by water parties proceeded to different points in order to intercept them some followed in canoes but being less bold in their navigation than the beehunter they did not make the straits until some time after the fugitives had passed peter himself had joined bears meat and some twenty warriors who had crossed the peninsula procured canoes at the head of saginaw bay and had come out at point au barques the very spot our party was now approaching three days before its arrival  tired with waiting and uncertain whether his enemies had not got the start of him bears meat had gone into the river below intending to keep his watch there leaving peter at the point with three young men and one canoe to have a lookout these young men the great chief had found an excuse for sending to the head of the bay in quest of another canoe which left him of course quite alone on the point scarce had the young man got out of sight ere pigeonswing joined his confederate for it seems that this faithful friend had kept on the skirts of the enemy the whole time travelling hundreds of miles and enduring hunger and fatigue besides risking his life at nearly every step in order to be of use to those whom he considered himself pledged to serve  of course peter and pigeonswing understood each other one hour after they joined company the canoes of the fugitives came in sight and were immediately recognized by their sails they were met as has been mentioned and the explanations that we have given were made before the party landed at the point  it was something to know where the risk was to be apprehended but le bourdon foresaw great danger he had brought his canoes already quite five hundred miles along a hazardous coastthough a little craft like one of those he navigated ran less risk perhaps than a larger vessel since a shelter might at any time be found within a reasonable distance for it from pointe au barques to the outlet of the lake was less than a hundred miles more this outlet was a river as it is calleda strait in factwhich communicates with the small shallow lake of st clair by a passage of some thirty miles in length then the lake st clair was to be crossed about an equal distance when the canoes would come out in what is called the detroit river a strait again as its name indicates some six or eight miles down this passage and on its western side stands the city of detroit then a village of no great extent with a fort better situated to repel an attack of the savages than to withstand a siege of white men this place was now in the possession of the british and according to le bourdons notion it was scarcely less dangerous to him than the hostility of bears meat and his companions  delay however was quite as dangerous as anything else after cooking and eating therefore the canoes continued their course peter and pigeonswing accompanying them though they abandoned their own craft peter went with the beehunter and margery while the chippewa took a seat and a paddle in the canoe of gershom this change was made in order to put a double power in each canoe since it was possible that downright speed might become the only means of safety  the wind still stood at the westward and the rate of sailing was rapid about the close of the day the party drew near to the outlet when peter directed the sails to be taken in this was done to prevent their being seen a precaution that was now aided by keeping as near to the shore as possible where objects so small and low would be very apt to be confounded with others on the land  it was quite dark when the canoes entered the st clair river favored by the current and the wind their progress was rapid and ere the day returned changing his direction from the course ordinarily taken peter entered the lake by a circuitous passage one of the many that lead from the river to the lake among aquatic plants that form a perfect shelter this detour saved the fugitives from falling into the hands of one party of their enemies as was afterward ascertained by the indians bears meat had left two canoes each manned by five warriors to watch the principal passages into lake st clair not anticipating that any particular caution would be used by the beehunter and his friends at this great distance from the place where they had escaped from their foes but the arrival of peter his sagacity and knowledge of indian habits prevented the result that was expected the canoes got into the lake unseen and crossed it a little diagonally so as to reach the canada shore in the middle of the afternoon of the succeeding day using their sails only when far from land and not exposed to watchful eyes  the beehunter and his friends landed that afternoon at the cabin of a canadian frenchman on the shore of the lake and at a safe distance from the outlet which led still farther south here the females were hospitably received and treated with that kindness which marks the character of the canadian french it mattered little to these simple people whether the travellers were of the hostile nation or not it is true they did not like the yankees as all americans are termed by them but they were not particularly in love with their english masters it was well enough to be repossessed of both banks of the detroit for both banks were then peopled principally by their own race the descendants of frenchmen of the time of louis xiv and who still preserved much of the language and many of the usages of the french of that period they spoke then as now only the language of their fathers  the beehunter left the cottage of these simple and hospitable people as soon as the night was fairly set in or rather as soon as a young moon had gone down peter now took the command steering the canoe of le bourdon while gershom followed so close as to keep the bow of his little craft within reach of the indians arm in less than an hour the fugitives reached the opening of the river which is here divided into two channels by a large island on that very island and at that precise moment was bears meat lying in wait for their appearance provided with three canoes each having a crew of six men it would have been easy for this chief to go to detroit and give the alarm to the savages who were then collected there in a large force and to have made such a disposition of the canoes as would have rendered escape by water impossible but this would have been robbing himself and his friends of all the credit of taking the scalps and throwing away what is termed honor among others as well as among savages he chose therefore to trust to his own ability to succeed and supposing the fugitives would not be particularly on their guard at this point had little doubt of intercepting them here should they succeed in eluding those he had left above  the beehunter distrusted that island and used extra caution in passing it in the first place the two canoes were brought together so as to give them in the dark the appearance of only one while the four men added so much to the crew as to aid the deception in the end it proved that one of bears meats canoes that was paddling about in the middle of the river had actually seen them but mistook the party for a canoe of their own which ought to have been near that spot with precisely six persons in it just at that time these six warriors had landed and gone up among the cottages of the french to obtain some fruit of which they were very fond and of which they got but little in their own villages owing to this lucky coincidence which the pretty margery ever regarded as another special interposition of providence in their favor the fugitives passed the island without molestation and actually got below the last lookouts of bears meat though without their knowledge  it was by no means a difficult thing to go down the river now that so many canoes were in motion on it at all hours the beehunter knew what points were to be avoided and took care not to approach a sentinel the river or strait is less than a mile wide and by keeping in the centre of the passage the canoes favored by both wind and current drove by the town then an inconsiderable village without detection as soon as far enough below the canoes were again cast loose from each other and sail was made on each the water was smooth and some time before the return of light the fugitives were abreast of malden but in the american channel had it been otherwise the danger could not have been great so completely were the americans subdued by hulls capitulation and so numerous were the indian allies of the british that the passage of a bark canoe more or less would hardly have attracted attention at that time michigan was a province of but little more than a name the territory was wide to be sure but the entire population was not larger than that of a moderately sized english market town and detroit was then regarded as a distant and isolated point it is true that mackinac and chicago were both more remote and both more isolated but an english force in possession of detroit could be approached by the americans on the side of the land only by overcoming the obstacles of a broad belt of difficult wilderness this was done the succeeding year it is true but time is always necessary to bring out jonathans latent military energies when aroused they are not trifling as all his enemies have been made to feel but a good deal of miscalculation pretending ignorance and useless talking must be expended before the really efficient are allowed to set about serving the country in their own way  in this respect thanks to west point a wellorganized staff and welleducated officers matters are a little improving congress has not been able to destroy the army in the present war though it did its best to attain that end and all because the nucleus was too powerful to be totally eclipsed by the gas of the usual legislative tail of the great national comet of which neither the materials nor the orbit can any man say he knows one day it declares war with a hurrah the next it denies the legislation necessary to carry it on as if it distrusted its own acts and already repented of its patriotism and this is the body soulless the very school of faction as a whole of very questionable quality in the outset that according to certain expounders of the constitution is to perform all the functions of a government which is not only to pass laws but is to interpret them which is to command the army aye even to wheeling its platoons which reads the constitution as an abbe mumbles his aves and paters or looking at everything but his texts and which is never to have its acts vetoed unless in cases where the supreme court would spare the executive that trouble we never yet could see either the elements or the fruits of this great sanctity in the national council in our eyes it is scarcely ever in its proper place on the railway of the union has degenerated into a mere electioneering machine performing the little it really does convulsively by sudden impulses equally without deliberation or a sense of responsibility in a word we deem it the power of all others in the state that needs the closest watching and were we what is termed in this country politicians we should go for the executive who is the most ready to apply the curb to these vagaries of faction and interested partisans vetoes would to heaven we could see the days of good queen bess revived for one session of congress at least and find that more laws were sent back for the second thoughts of their framers than were approved then indeed might the country be brought back to a knowledge of the very material constitutional facts that the legislature is not commander inchief does not negotiate or make treaties and has no right to do that which it has done so oftenappoint to office by act of congress  as a consequence of the little apprehension entertained by the english of being soon disturbed in their new conquests le bourdon and his friends got out of the detroit river and into lake erie without discovery or molestation there still remained a long journey before them in that day the american side of the shores of all the great lakes was little more than a wilderness there were exceptions at particular points but these were few and far asunder the whole coast of ohiofor ohio has its coast as well as bohemia footnote see shakespearewinters talewas mostly in a state of nature as was much of those of pennsylvania and new york on the side of the fresh water the port which the beehunter had in view was presque isle now known as erie a harbor in pennsylvania that has since become somewhat celebrated in consequence of its being the port out of which the american vessels sailed about a year later than the period of which we are writing to fight the battle that gave them the mastery of the lake this was a little voyage of itself of near two hundred miles following the islands and the coast but it was safely made in the course of the succeeding week once in lake erie and on the american side our adventurers felt reasonably safe against all dangers but those of the elements it is true that a renowned annalist whose information is sustained by the collected wisdom of a state historical society does tell us that the enemy possessed both shores of lake erie in 1814 but this was so small a mistake compared with some others that this nestor in history had made that we shall not stop to explain it le bourdon and his party found all the south shore of lake erie in possession of the americans so far as it was in the possession of any one and consequently ran no risks from this blunder of the historian and his highly intelligent associates  peter and pigeonswing left their friends before they reached presque isle the beehunter gave them his own canoe and the parting was not only friendly but touching in the course of their journey and during their many stops margery had frequently prayed with the great chief his constant and burning desire now was to learn to read that he might peruse the word of the great spirit and regulate his future life by its wisdom and tenets margery promised should they ever meet again and under circumstances favorable to such a design to help him attain his wishes  pigeonswing parted from his friend with the same lighthearted vivacity as he had manifested in all their intercourse le bourdon gave him his own rifle plenty of ammunition and various other small articles that were of value to an indian accepting the chippewas arms in return the exchange however was greatly to the advantage of the savage as for peter he declined all presents he carried weapons now indeed merely for the purpose of hunting but the dignity of his character and station would have placed him above such compensations had the fact been otherwise     chapter xxx             come to the land of peace      come where the tempest hath no longer sway      the shadow passes from the

the events recorded in this legend occurred this third of a century has been a period of mighty changes in america ages have not often brought about as many in other portions of the earth as this short period of time has given birth to among ourselves we had written thus far on the evidence of documents sent to us when an occasion offered to verify the truth of some of our pictures at least by means of personal observation  quitting our own quiet and secluded abode in the mountains in the pleasant month of june and in this current year of 1848 we descended into the valley of the mohawk got into the cars and went flying by rails toward the setting sun well could we remember the time when an entire day was required to pass between that point on the mohawk where we got on the rails and the little village of utica on the present occasion we flew over the space in less than three hours and dined in a town of some fifteen thousand souls  we reached buffalo at the foot of lake erie in about twenty hours after we had entered the cars this journey would have been the labor of more than a week at the time in which the scene of this tale occurred now the whole of the beautiful region teeming with its towns and villages and rich with the fruits of a bountiful season was almost brought into a single landscape by the rapidity of our passage  at buffalo we turned aside to visit the cataract thither too we went on rails thirtyeight years had passed away since we had laid eyes on this wonderful fall of water in the intervening time we had travelled much and had visited many of the renowned falls of the old world to say nothing of the great number which are to be found in other parts of our own land did this visit then produce disappointment  did time and advancing years and feelings that had become deadened by experience contribute to render the view less striking less grand in any way less pleasing than we had hoped to find it so far from this all our expectations were much more than realized in one particular touching which we do not remember ever to have seen anything said we were actually astonished at the surpassing glory of niagara it was the character of sweetness if we can so express it that glowed over the entire aspect of the scene we were less struck with the grandeur of this cataract than with its sublime softness and gentleness to water in agitation use had so long accustomed us perhaps as in some slight degree to lessen the feeling of awe that is apt to come over the novice in such scenes but we at once felt ourselves attracted by the surpassing loveliness of niagara the gulf below was more imposing than we had expected to see it but it was italian in hue and softness amid its wildness and grandeur not a drop of the water that fell down that precipice inspired terror for everything appeared to us to be filled with attraction and love like italy itself notwithstanding so much that is grand and imposing the character of softness and the witchery of the gentler properties is the power we should ascribe to niagara in preference to that of its majesty we think this feeling too is more general than is commonly supposed for we find those who dwell near the cataract playing around it even to the very verge of its greatest fall with a species of affection as if they had the fullest confidence in its rolling waters thus it is that we see the little steamer the maid of the mist paddling up quite near to the green sheet of the horseshoe itself and gliding down in the current of the vortex as it is compelled to quit the eddies and come more in a line with the main course of the stream wires too are suspended across the gulf below and men pass it in baskets it is said that one of these inventions is to carry human beings over the main fall so that the adventurer may hang suspended in the air directly above the vortex in this way do men and even women prove their love for the place all of which we impute to its pervading character of sweetness and attraction  at buffalo we embarked in a boat under the english flag which is called the canada this shortened our passage to detroit by avoiding all the stops at lateral ports and we had every reason to be satisfied with our selection boat commander and the attendance were such as would have done credit to any portion of the civilized world there were many passengers a motley collection as usual from all parts of the country  our attention was early drawn to one party by the singular beauty of its females they seemed to us to be a grandmother in a well preserved green old age a daughter but a matron of little less than forty and two exceedingly pretty girls of about eighteen and sixteen whom we took to be children of the last the strong family likeness between these persons led us early to make this classification which we afterward found was correct  by occasional remarks i gathered that the girls had been to an eastern boardingschool that particular feature in civilization not yet flourishing in the northwestern states it seemed to us that we could trace in the dialect of the several members of this family the gradations and peculiarities that denote the origin and habits of individuals thus the grandmother was not quite as western in her forms of speech as her matronly daughter while the grandchildren evidently spoke under the influence of boardingschool correction or like girls who had been often lectured on the subject first rate and yes sir and thats a fact were often in the mouth of the pleasing mother and even the grandmother used them all though not as often as her daughter while the young people looked a little concerned and surprised whenever they came out of the mouth of their frankspeaking mother that these persons were not of a very high social class was evident enough even in their language there was much occasion to mention new york we found and they uniformly called it the city by no accident did either of them happen to use the expression that she had been in town as one of us would be apt to say hes gone to the city or shes in the city are awkward phrases and tant soit peu vulgar but even our pretty young boardingschool eleves would use them we have a horror of the expression city and are a little fastidious perhaps touching its use  but these little peculiarities were spots on the sun the entire family taken as a whole was really charming and long before the hour for retiring came we had become much interested in them all we found there was a fifth person belonging to this party who did not make his appearance that night from the discourse of these females however it was easy to glean the following leading facts this fifth person was a male he was indisposed and kept his berth and he was quite aged several nice little dishes were carried from the table into his stateroom that evening by one or the other of the young sisters and each of the party appeared anxious to contribute to the invalids comfort all this sympathy excited our interest and we had some curiosity to see this old man long ere it was time to retire as for the females no name was mentioned among them but that of a mrs osborne who was once or twice alluded to in full it was grandma and ma and dolly and sis we should have liked it better had it been mother and grandmother and that the sis had been called betsey or molly but we do not wish to be understood as exhibiting these amiable and goodlooking strangers as models of refinement ma and sis did well enough all things considered though mamma would have been better if they were not sufficiently polished to say mother  we had a pleasant night of it and all the passengers appeared next morning with smiling faces it often blows heavily on that lake but light airs off the land were all the breezes we encountered we were among the first to turn out and on the upper deck forward a place where the passengers are fond of collecting as it enables them to look ahead we found a single individual who immediately drew all of our attention to himself it was an aged man with hair already as white as snow still there was that in his gait attitudes and all his movements which indicated physical vigor not to say the remains at least of great elasticity and sinewy activity aged as he was and he must have long since passed his fourscore years his form was erect as that of a youth in stature he was of rather more than middle height and in movements deliberate and dignified his dress was quite plain being black and according to the customs of the day the color of his face and hands however as well as the bold outlines of his countenance and the still keen restless black eye indicated the indian  here then was a civilized red man and it struck us at once that he was an ancient child of the forest who had been made to feel the truths of the gospel one seldom hesitates about addressing an indian and we commenced a discourse with our venerable fellow passenger with very little circumlocution or ceremony  goodmorning sir we observed a charming time we have of it on the lake  yesgood time returned my red neighbor speaking short and clipped like an indian but pronouncing his words as if long accustomed to the language  these steamboats are great inventions for the western lakes as are the railroads for this vast inland region i dare say you can remember lake erie when it was an unusual thing to see a sail of any sort on it and now i should think we might count fifty  yesgreat changegreat change friendall change from ole time  the traditions of your people no doubt give you reason to see and feel all this  the predominant expression of this red mans countenance was that of love on everything on every human being toward whom he turned his still expressive eyes the looks he gave them would seem to indicate interest and affection this expression was so decided and peculiar that we early remarked it and it drew us closer and closer to the old chief the longer we remained in his company that expression however slightly changed when we made this allusion to the traditions of his people and a cloud passed before his countenance this change nevertheless was as transient as it was sudden the benevolent and gentle look returning almost as soon as it had disappeared he seemed anxious to atone for this involuntary expression of regrets for the past by making his communications to me as free as they could be  my tradition say a great deal was the answer it say some good some bad  may i ask of what tribe you are  the red man turned his eyes on us kindly as if to lessen anything ungracious there might be in his refusal to answer and with an expression of benevolence that we scarcely remember ever to have seen equalled indeed we might say with truth that the love which shone out of this old mans countenance habitually surpassed that which we can recall as belonging to any other human face he seemed to be at peace with himself and with all the other children of adam  tribe make no difference he answered all children of same great spirit  red men and palefaces i asked not a little surprised with his reply  red man and paleface christ die for all and his fadder make all no difference excep in color color only skin deep  do you then look on us palefaces as having a right here do you not regard us as invaders as enemies who have come to take away your lands  injin dont own arth arth belong to god and he send whom he like to live on it one time he send injin now he send paleface his arth and he do what he please wid it nobody any right to complain bad to find fault wid great spirit all he do right nebber do anyting bad his blessed son die for all color and all color muss bow down at his holy name dat what dis good book say showing a small pocket bible and what dis good book say come from great spirit himself  you read the holy scriptures thenyou are an educated indian  no cant read at all dont know how try hard but too ole to begin got young eyes however to help me he added with one of the fondest smiles i ever saw light a human face as he turned to meet the pretty dollys goodmorning peter and to shake the hand of the elder sister she read good book for old injin when he want her and when she off at school in city den her mudder or her granmudder read for him fuss begin wid granmudder now get down to grandaghter but good book all de same let who will read it  this then was scalping peter the very man i was travelling into michigan to see but how wonderfully changed the spirit of the most high god had been shed freely upon his moral being and in lieu of the revengeful and vindictive savage he now lived a subdued benevolent christian in every human being he beheld a brother and no longer thought of destroying races in order to secure to his own people the quiet possession of their huntinggrounds his very soul was love and no doubt he felt himself strong enough to bless those who cursed him and to give up his spirit like the good missionary whose death had first turned him toward the worship of the one true god praying for those who took his life  the ways of divine providence are past the investigations of human reason how often in turning over the pages of history do we find civilization the arts moral improvement nay christianity itself following the bloody train left by the conquerors car and good pouring in upon a nation by avenues that at first were teeming only with the approaches of seeming evils in this way there is now reason to hope that america is about to pay the debt she owes to africa and in this way will the invasion of the forests and prairies and openings of the red man be made to atone for itself by carrying with it the blessings of the gospel and a juster view of the relations which man bears to his creator possibly mexico may derive lasting benefits from the hard lesson that she has so recently been made to endure  this then was peter changed into a civilized man and a christian i have found subsequently that glimmerings of the former being existed in his character but they showed themselves only at long intervals and under very peculiar circumstances the study of these traits became a subject of great interest with us for we now travelled in company the rest of our journey the elder lady or grandma was the margery of our tale still handsome spirited and kind the younger matron was her daughter and only child and sis another margery and dorothy were her grandchildren there was also a son or a grandson rather ben who was on prairie round with the general the general was our old friend le bourdon who was still as often called general bourdon as general boden this matter of generals at the west is a little overdone as all ranks and titles are somewhat apt to be in new countries it causes one often to smile at the east and no wonder that an eastern habit should go down in all its glory beneath the setting sun in afterdays generals will not be quite as plenty as blackberries  no sooner did mrs boden or margery to use her familiar name learn that we were the very individual to whom the general had sent the notes relative to his early adventures which had been prepared by the rev mr varse of kalamazoo than she became as friendly and communicative as we could possibly desire  her own life had been prosperous and her marriage happy her brother however had fallen back into his old habits and died ere the war of 1812 was ended dorothy had returned to her friends in massachusetts and was still living in a comfortable condition owing to a legacy from an uncle the beehunter had taken the field in that war and had seen some sharp fighting on the banks of the niagara no sooner was peace made however than he returned to his beloved openings where he had remained growing with the country as it is termed until he was now what is deemed a rich man in michigan he has a plenty of land and that which is good a respectable dwelling and is out of debt he meets his obligations to an eastern man just as promptly as he meets those contracted at home and regards the united states and not michigan as his country all these were good traits and we were glad to learn that they existed in one who already possessed so much of our esteem at detroit we found a fine flourishing town of a healthful and natural growth and with a population that was fast approaching twenty thousand the shores of the beautiful strait on which it stands and which by a strange blending of significations and languages is popularly called the detroit river were alive with men and their appliances and we scarce know where to turn to find a more agreeable landscape than that which was presented to us after passing the island of bobolo bois blanc near maiden altogether it resembled a miniature picture of constantinople without its eastern peculiarities  at detroit commenced our surprise at the rapid progress of western civilization it will be remembered that at the period of our tale the environs of detroit excepted the whole peninsula of michigan lay in a state of nature nor did the process of settlement commence actively until about twenty years since but owing to the character of the country it already possesses many of the better features of a longinhabited region there are stumps of course for new fields are constantly coming into cultivation but on the whole the appearance is that of a middleaged rather than that of a new region  we left detroit on a railroad rattling away toward the setting sun at a good speed even for that mode of conveyance it seemed to us that our route was well garnished with large villages of which we must have passed through a dozen in the course of a few hours railing these are places varying in size from one to three thousand inhabitants the vegetation certainly surpassed that of even west new york the trees alone excepted the whole country was a wheatfield and we now began to understand how america could feed the world our road lay among the openings much of the way and we found them undergoing the changes which are incident to the passage of civilized men as the periodical fires had now ceased for many years underbrush was growing in lieu of the natural grass and in so much those groves are less attractive than formerly but one easily comprehends the reason and can picture to himself the aspect that these pleasant woods must have worn in times of old  we left the railroad at kalamazooan unusually pretty village on the banks of the stream of that name those who laid out this place some fifteen years since had the taste to preserve most of its trees and the houses and grounds that stand a little apart from the busiest streetsand they are numerous for a place of rather more than two thousand soulsare particularly pleasant to the eye on account of the shade and the rural pictures they present here mrs boden told us we were within a mile or two of the very spot where once had stood castle meal chateau au miel though the general had finally established himself at schoolcraft on prairie ronde  the first prairie we had ever seen was on the road between detroit and kalamazoo distant from the latter place only some eight or nine miles the axe had laid the country open in its neighborhood but the spot was easily to be recognized by the air of cultivation and age that pervaded it there was not a stump on it and the fields were as smooth as any on the plains of lombardy and far more fertile rich as the last are known to be in a word the beautiful perfection of that little natural meadow became apparent at once though seated amid a landscape that was by no means wanting in interest of its own  we passed the night at the village of kalamazoo but the party of females with old peter proceeded on to prairie round as that particular part of the country is called in the dialect of michigan it being a corruption of the old french name of la prairie ronde the round meadow does not sound as well as prairie round and the last being quite as clear a term as the other though a mixture of the two languages we prefer to use it indeed the word prairie may now be said to be adopted into the english meaning merely a natural instead of an artificial meadow though one of peculiar and local characteristics we wrote a note to general boden as i found our old acquaintance ben boden was universally termed letting him know i should visit schoolcraft next day not wishing to intrude at the moment when that charming family was just reunited after so long a separation  the next day accordingly we got into a buggy and went our way the road was slightly sandy a good part of the twelve miles we had to travel though it became less so as we drew near to the celebrated prairie and celebrated and that by an abler pen than ours does this remarkable place deserve to be we found all our expectations concerning it fully realized and drove through the scene of abundance it presented with an admiration that was not entirely free from awe  to get an idea of prairie round the reader must imagine an oval plain of some fiveandtwenty or thirty thousand acres in extent of the most surpassing fertility without an eminence of any sort almost without an inequality there are a few small cavities howevers in which there are springs that form large pools of water that the cattle will drink this plain so far as we saw it is now entirely fenced and cultivated the fields are large many containing eighty acres and some one hundred and sixty most of them being in wheat we saw several of this size in that grain farmhouses dotted the surface with barns and the other accessories of rural life in the centre of the prairie is an island of forest containing some five or six hundred acres of the noblest native trees we remember ever to have seen in the centre of this wood is a little lake circular in shape and exceeding a quarter of a mile in diameter the walk in this woodwhich is not an opening but an oldfashioned virgin forestwe found delightful of a warm summers day one thing that we saw in it was characteristic of the country some of the nearest farmers had drawn their manure into it where it lay in large piles in order to get it out of the way of doing any mischief its effect on the land it was thought would be to bring too much straw  on one side of this island of wood lies the little village or large hamlet of schoolcraft here we were most cordially welcomed by general boden and all of his fine descendants the head of this family is approaching seventy but is still hale and hearty his head is as white as snow and his face as red as a cherry a finer old man one seldom sees temperance activity the open air and a good conscience have left him a noble ruin if ruin he can yet be called he owes the last blessing as he told us himself to the fact that he kept clear of the whirlwind of speculation that passed over this region some ten or fifteen years since his means are ample and the harvest being about to commence he invited me to the field  the peculiar ingenuity of the american has supplied the want of laborers in a country where agriculture is carried on by wholesale especially in the cereals by an instrument of the most singular and elaborate construction this machine is drawn by sixteen or eighteen horses attached to it laterally so as to work clear of the standing grain and who move the whole fabric on a moderate but steady walk a path is first cut with the cradle on one side of the field when the machine is dragged into the open place here it enters the standing grain cutting off its heads with the utmost accuracy as it moves forks beneath prepare the way and a rapid vibratory motion of a great number of twoedged knives effect the object the stalks of the grain can be cut as low or as high as one pleases but it is usually thought best to take only the heads afterward the standing straw is burned or fed off upright  the impelling power which causes the great fabric to advance also sets in motion the machinery within it as soon as the heads of the grain are severed from the stalks they pass into a receptacle where by a very quick and simple process the kernels are separated from the husks thence all goes into a fanning machine where the chaff is blown away the clean grain falls into a small bin whence it is raised by a screw elevator to a height that enables it to pass out at an opening to which a bag is attached wagons follow the slow march of the machine and the proper number of men are in attendance bag after bag is renewed until a wagon is loaded when it at once proceeds to the mill where the grain is soon converted into flour generally the husbandman sells to the miller but occasionally he pays for making the flour and sends the latter off by railroad to detroit whence it finds its way to europe possibly to help feed the millions of the old world such at least was the course of trade the past season as respects this ingenious machine it remains only to say that it harvests cleans and bags from twenty to thirty acres of heavy wheat in the course of a single summers day altogether it is a gigantic invention well adapted to meet the necessities of a gigantic country  old peter went afield with us that day there he stood like a striking monument of a past that was still so recent and wonderful on that very prairie which was now teeming with the appliances of civilization he had hunted and held his savage councils on that prairie had he meditated or consented to the deaths of the young couple whose descendants were now dwelling there amid abundance and happy nothing but the prayers of the dying missionary in behalf of his destroyers had prevented the dire consummation  we were still in the field when general bodens attention was drawn toward the person of another guest this too was an indian old like himself but not clad like peter in the vestments of the whites the attire of this sinewy old man was a mixture of that of the two races he wore a huntingshirt moccasins and a belt but he also wore trousers and otherwise had brought himself within the habits of conventional decency it was pigeonswing the chippewa come to pay his annual visit to his friend the beehunter the meeting was cordial and we afterward ascertained that when the old man departed he went away loaded with gifts that would render him comfortable for a twelvemonth  but peter after all was the great centre of interest with us we could admire the generals beehives which were numerous and ingenious could admire his still handsome margery and all their blooming descendants and were glad when we discovered that our old friendmade so by means of a knowledge of his character if not by actual acquaintancewas much improved in mind was a sincere christian and had been a senator of his own state respected and esteemed by all who knew him such a career however has nothing peculiar in america it is one of everyday occurrence and shows the power of man when left free to make his own exertions while that of the scalping peter indicated the power of god there he was living in the midst of the hated race loving and beloved wishing naught but blessings on all colors alike looking back upon his traditions and superstitions with a sort of melancholy interest as we all portray in our memories the scenes legends and feelings of an erring childhood  we were walking in the garden after dinner and looking at the hives there were the general margery peter and ourselves the first was loud in praise of his buzzing friends for whom it was plain he still entertained a lively regard the old indian at first was sad then he smiled and turning to us he spoke earnestly and with some of his ancient fire and eloquence  tell me you make a book he said in dat book tell trut you see
