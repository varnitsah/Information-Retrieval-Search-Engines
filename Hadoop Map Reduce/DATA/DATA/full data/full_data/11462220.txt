his crew  if ever they were dull or sad their captain danced to them like mad or told to make the time pass by droll legends of his infancy  a feather bed had every man warm slippers and hotwater can brown windsor from the captains store a valet too to every four  did they with thirst in summer burn lo seltzogenes at every turn and on all very sultry days cream ices handed round on trays  then

it was their duty and they did    the rival curates    list while the poet trolls of mr clayton hooper who had a cure of souls at spifftonextrasooper  he lived on curds and whey and daily sang their praises and then hed go and play with buttercups and daisies  wild croquet hooper banned and all the sports of mammon he warred with cribbage and he exorcised backgammon  his helmet was a glance that spoke of holy gladness a saintly smile his lance his shield a tear of sadness  his vicar smiled to see this armour on him buckled with pardonable glee he blessed himself and chuckled  in mildness to abound my curates sole design is in all the country round theres none so mild as mine is  and hooper disinclined his trumpet to be blowing yet didnt think youd find a milder curate going  a friend arrived one day at spifftonextrasooper and in this shameful way he spoke to mr hooper  you think your famous name for mildness cant be shaken that none can blot your fame but hooper youre mistaken  your mind is not as blank as that of hopley porter who holds a curates rank at assesmilkcumworter  he plays the airy flute and looks depressed and blighted doves round about him toot and lambkins dance delighted  he labours more than you at worsted work and frames it in old maids albums too sticks seaweedyes and names it  the tempter said his say which pierced him like a needle he summoned straight away his sexton and his beadle  these men were men who could hold liberal opinions on sundays they were good on weekdays they were minions  to hopley porter go your fare i will afford you  deal him a deadly blow and blessings shall reward you  but stayi do not like undue assassination and so before you strike make this communication  ill give him this one chance if hell more gaily bear him play croquet smoke and dance i willingly will spare him  they went those minions true to assesmilkcumworter and told their errand to the reverend hopley porter  what said that reverend gent dance through my hours of leisure smokebathe myself with scent play croquet  oh with pleasure  wear all my hair in curl stand at my door and winkso at every passing girl my brothers i should think so  for years ive longed for some excuse for this revulsion now that excuse has come i do it on compulsion  he smoked and winked away this reverend hopley porter the deuce there was to pay at assesmilkcumworter  and hooper holds his ground in mildness daily growing they think him all around the mildest curate going    only a dancing girl    only a dancing girl with an unromantic style with borrowed colour and curl with fixed mechanical smile with many a hackneyed wile with ungrammatical lips and corns that mar her trips  hung from the flies in air she acts a palpable lie shes as little a fairy there as unpoetical i i hear you asking why why in the world i sing this tawdry tinselled thing  no airy fairy she as she hangs in arsenic green from a highly impossible tree in a highly impossible scene herself not overclean for fays dont suffer im told from bunions coughs or cold  and stately dames that bring their daughters there to see pronounce the dancing thing no better than she should be with her skirt at her shameful knee and her painted tainted phiz ah matron which of us is  and in sooth it oft occurs that while these matrons sigh their dresses are lower than hers and sometimes half as high and their hair is hair they buy and they use their glasses too in a way shed blush to do  but change her gold and green for a coarse merino gown and see her upon the scene of her home when coaxing down her drunken fathers frown in his squalid cheerless den shes a fairy truly then    general john    the bravest names for fire and flames and all that mortal durst were general john and private james of the sixtyseventyfirst  general john was a soldier tried a chief of warlike dons a haughty stride and a withering pride were majorgeneral johns  a sneer would play on his martial phiz superior birth to show pish was a favourite word of his and he often said ho ho  fullprivate james described might be as a man of a mournful mind no characteristic trait had he of any distinctive kind  from the ranks one day cried private james oh majorgeneral john ive doubts of our respective names my mournful mind upon  a glimmering thought occurs to me its source i cant unearth but ive a kind of a notion we were cruelly changed at birth  ive a strange idea that each others names weve each of us here got on such things have been said private james they have sneered general john  my general john i swear upon my oath i think tis so pish proudly sneered his general john and he also said ho ho  my general john my general john my general john quoth he this aristocratical sneer upon your face i blush to see  no truly great or generous cove deserving of them names would sneer at a fixed idea thats drove in the mind of a private james  said general john upon your claims no need your breath to waste if this is a joke fullprivate james its a joke of doubtful taste  but being a man of doubtless worth if you feel certain quite that we were probably changed at birth ill venture to say youre right  so general john as private james fell in parade upon and private james by change of names was majorgeneral john    to a little maidby a policeman    come with me little maid nay shrink not thus afraid ill harm thee not fly not my love from me i have a home for thee a fairy grot where mortal eye can rarely pry there shall thy dwelling be  list to me while i tell the pleasures of that cell oh little maid what though its couch be rude homely the only food within its shade no thought of care can enter there no vulgar swain intrude  come with me little maid come to the rocky shade i love to sing live with us maiden rare come for we want thee there thou elfin thing to work thy spell in some cool cell in stately pentonville    john and freddy    john courted lovely mary ann so likewise did his brother freddy fred was a very soft young man while john though quick was most unsteady  fred was a graceful kind of youth but john was very much the strongest oh dance away said she in truth ill marry him who dances longest  john tries the maidens taste to strike with gay grotesque outrageous dresses and dances comically like clodoche and co at the princesss  but freddy tries another style he knows some graceful steps and does em a breathing poemwomans smile a man all poesy and buzzem  now freddys operatic pas now johnnys hornpipe seems entrapping now freddys graceful entrechats now johnnys skilful cellarflapping  for many hoursfor many days for many weeks performed each brother for each was active in his ways and neither would give in to tother  after a month of this they say the maid was getting bored and moody a wandering curate passed that way and talked a lot of goodygoody  oh my said he with solemn frown i tremble for each dancing frater like unregenerated clown and harlequin at some theayter  he showed that men in dancing do both impiously and absurdly and proved his proposition true with firstly secondly and thirdly  for months both john and freddy danced the curates protests little heeding for months the curates words enhanced the sinfulness of their proceeding  at length they bowed to natures rule their steps grew feeble and unsteady till freddy fainted on a stool and johnny on the top of freddy  decide quoth they let him be named who henceforth as his wife may rank you ive changed my views the maiden said i only marry curates thank you  says freddy here is goings on to bust myself with rage im ready ill be a curate whispers john and i exclaimed poetic freddy  but while they read for it these chaps the curate booked the maiden bonny and when shes buried him perhaps shell marry frederick or johnny    sir guy the crusader    sir guy was a doughty crusader a muscular knight ever ready to fight a very determined invader and dickey de lions delight  lenore was a saracen maiden brunette statuesque the reverse of grotesque her pa was a bagman from aden her mother she played in burlesque  a coryphee pretty and loyal in amber and red the ballet she led her mother performed at the royal lenore at the saracens head  of face and of figure majestic she dazzled the cits ecstaticised pits her troubles were only domestic but drove her half out of her wits  her father incessantly lashed her on water and bread she was grudgingly fed whenever her father he thrashed her her mother sat down on her head  guy saw her and loved her with reason for beauty so bright sent him mad with delight he purchased a stall for the season and sat in it every night  his views were exceedingly proper he wanted to wed so he called at her shed and saw her progenitor whop her her mother sit down on her head  so pretty said he and so trusting you brute of a dad you unprincipled cad your conduct is really disgusting come come now admit its too bad  youre a turbaned old turk and malignant your daughter lenore i intensely adore and i cannot help feeling indignant a fact that i hinted before  to see a fond father employing a deuce of a knout for to bang her about to a sensitive lovers annoying said the bagman crusader get out  says guy shall a warrior laden with a big spiky knob sit in peace on his cob while a beautiful saracen maiden is whipped by a saracen snob  to london ill go from my charmer which he did with his loot seven hats and a flute and was nabbed for his sydenham armour at mr bensamuels suit  sir guy he was lodged in the compter her pa in a rage died dont know his age his daughter she married the prompter grew bulky and quitted the stage    haunted    haunted  ay in a social way by a body of ghosts in dread array but no conventional spectres they appalling grim and tricky i quail at mine as id never quail at a fine traditional spectre pale with a turnip head and a ghostly wail and a splash of blood on the dickey  mine are horrible social ghosts speeches and women and guests and hosts weddings and morning calls and toasts in every bad variety ghosts who hover about the grave of all thats manly free and brave youll find their names on the architrave of that charnelhouse society  black mondayblack as its schoolroom ink with its dismal boys that snivel and think of its nauseous messes to eat and drink and its frozen tank to wash in that was the first that brought me grief and made me weep till i sought relief in an emblematical handkerchief to choke such baby bosh in  first and worst in the grim array ghosts of ghosts that have gone their way which i wouldnt revive for a single day for all the wealth of plutus are the horrible ghosts that schooldays scared if the classical ghost that brutus dared was the ghost of his caesar unprepared im sure i pity brutus  i pass to critical seventeen the ghost of that terrible wedding scene when an elderly colonel stole my queen and woke my dream of heaven no schoolgirl decked in her nurseroom curls was my gushing innocent queen of pearls if she wasnt a girl of a thousand girls she was one of fortyseven  i see the ghost of my first cigar of the thencearising family jar of my maiden brief i was at the bar and i called the judge your wushup of reckless days and reckless nights with wrenchedoff knockers extinguished lights unholy songs and tipsy fights which i strove in vain to hush up  ghosts of fraudulent jointstock banks ghosts of copy declined with thanks of novels returned in endless ranks and thousands more i suffer the only line to fitly grace my humble tomb when ive run my race is reader this is the restingplace of an unsuccessful duffer  ive fought them all these ghosts of mine but the weapons ive used are sighs and brine and now that im nearly fortynine old age is my chiefest bogy for my hair is thinning away at the crown and the silver fights with the wornout brown and a general verdict sets me down as an irreclaimable fogy    the bishop and the busman    it was a bishop bold and london was his see he was short and stout and round about and zealous as could be  it also was a jew who drove a putney bus for flesh of swine however fine he did not care a cuss  his name was hash baz ben and jedediah too and solomon and zabulon this busdirecting jew  the bishop said said he ill see what i can do to christianise and make you wise you poor benighted jew  so every blessed day that bus he rode outside from fulham town both up and down and loudly thus he cried  his name is hash baz ben and jedediah too and solomon and zabulon this busdirecting jew  at first the busman smiled and rather liked the fun he merely smiled that hebrew child and said eccentric one  and gay young dogs would wait to see the bus go by these gay young dogs in striking togs to hear the bishop cry  observe his grisly beard his race it clearly shows he sticks no fork in ham or pork observe my friends his nose  his name is hash baz ben and jedediah too and solomon and zabulon this busdirecting jew  but though at first amused yet after seven years this hebrew child got rather riled and melted into tears  he really almost feared to leave his poor abode his nose and name and beard became a byword on that road  at length he swore an oath the reason he would know ill call and see why ever he does persecute me so  the good old bishop sat on his ancestral chair the busman came sent up his name and laid his grievance bare  benighted jew he said the good old bishop did be christian you instead of jew become a christian kid  ill neer annoy you more indeed replied the jew shall i be freed  you will indeed then done said he with you  the organ which in man between the eyebrows grows fell from his face and in its place he found a christian nose  his tangled hebrew beard which to his waist came down was now a pair of whiskers fair his name adolphus brown  he wedded in a year that prelates daughter jane hes grown quite fairhas auburn hair his wife is far from plain    the troubadour    a troubadour he played without a castle wall within a hapless maid responded to his call  oh willow woe is me alack and welladay if i were only free id hie me far away  unknown her face and name but this he knew right well the maidens wailing came from out a dungeon cell  a hapless woman lay within that dungeon grim that fact ive heard him say was quite enough for him  i will not sit or lie or eat or drink i vow till thou art free as i or i as pent as thou  her tears then ceased to flow her wails no longer rang and tuneful in her woe the prisoned maiden sang  oh stranger as you play i recognize your touch and all that i can say is thank you very much  he seized his clarion straight and blew thereat until a warden oped the gate oh what might be your will  ive come sir knave to see the master of these halls a maid unwillingly lies prisoned in their walls  with barely stifled sigh that porter drooped his head with teardrops in his eye a many sir he said  he stayed to hear no more but pushed that porter by and shortly stood before sir hugh de peckham rye  sir hugh he darkly frowned what would you sir with me the troubadour he downed upon his bended knee  ive come de peckham rye to do a christian task you ask me what would i it is not much i ask  release these maidens sir whom you dominion oer particularly her upon the second floor  and if you dont my lord he here stood bolt upright and tapped a tailors sword come out you cad and fight  sir hugh he calledand ran the warden from the gate go show this gentleman the maid in fortyeight  by many a cell they past and stopped at length before a portal bolted fast the man unlocked the door  he called inside the gate with coarse and brutal shout come step it fortyeight and fortyeight stepped out  they gets it pretty hot the maidens what we cotch two years this ladys got for collaring a wotch  oh ahindeedi see the troubadour exclaimed if i may make so free how is this castle named  the wardens eyelids fill and sighing he replied of gloomy pentonville this is the female side  the minstrel did not wait the warden stout to thank but recollected straight hed business at the bank    ferdinando and elvira or the gentle pieman    part i   at a pleasant evening party i had taken down to supper one whom i will call elvira and we talked of love and tupper  mr tupper and the poets very lightly with them dealing for ive always been distinguished for a strong poetic feeling  then we let off paper crackers each of which contained a motto and she listened while i read them till her mother told her not to  then she whispered to the ballroom we had better dear be walking if we stop down here much longer really people will be talking  there were noblemen in coronets and military cousins there were captains by the hundred there were baronets by dozens  yet she heeded not their offers but dismissed them with a blessing then she let down all her back hair which had taken long in dressing  then she had convulsive sobbings in her agitated throttle then she wiped her pretty eyes and smelt her pretty smellingbottle  so i whispered  dear elvira saywhat can the matter be with you does anything youve eaten darling popsy disagree with you  but spite of all i said her sobs grew more and more distressing and she tore her pretty back hair which had taken long in dressing  then she gazed upon the carpet at the ceiling then above me and she whispered ferdinando do you really really love me  love you said i then i sighed and then i gazed upon her sweetly for i think i do this sort of thing particularly neatly  send me to the arctic regions or illimitable azure on a scientific goosechase with my coxwell or my glaisher  tell me whither i may hie metell me dear one that i may know is it up the highest andes down a horrible volcano  but she said it isnt polar bears or hot volcanic grottoes only find out who it is that writes those lovely cracker mottoes   part ii   tell me henry wadsworth alfred poet close or mister tupper do you write the bon bon mottoes my elvira pulls at supper  but henry wadsworth smiled and said he had not had that honour and alfred too disclaimed the words that told so much upon her  mister martin tupper poet close i beg of you inform us but my question seemed to throw them both into a rage enormous  mister close expressed a wish that he could only get anigh to me and mister martin tupper sent the following reply to me  a fool is bent upon a twig but wise men dread a bandit which i know was very clever but i didnt understand it  seven weary years i wanderedpatagonia china norway till at last i sank exhausted at a pastrycook his doorway  there were fuchsias and geraniums and daffodils and myrtle so i entered and i ordered half a basin of mock turtle  he was plump and he was chubby he was smooth and he was rosy and his little wife was pretty and particularly cosy  and he chirped and sang and skipped about and laughed with laughter hearty he was wonderfully active for so very stout a party  and i said o gentle pieman why so very very merry is it purity of conscience or your oneandseven sherry  but he answered im so happyno profession could be dearer if i am not humming tra la la im singing tirer lirer  first i go and make the patties and the puddings and the jellies then i make a sugar birdcage which upon a table swell is  then i polish all the silver which a suppertable lacquers then i write the pretty mottoes which you find inside the crackers  found at last i madly shouted  gentle pieman you astound me then i waved the turtle soup enthusiastically round me  and i shouted and i danced until hed quite a crowd around him and i rushed away exclaiming i have found him  i have found him  and i heard the gentle pieman in the road behind me trilling tira lira stop him stop him  tra la la the soups a shilling  but until i reached elviras home i never never waited and elvira to her ferdinands irrevocably mated    lorenzo de lardy    dalilah de dardy adored the very correctest of cards lorenzo de lardy a lord he was

invested with the circumstance of old conventional romance exploded theorem  the bard who could all men above inflame my soul with songs of love and with his verse inspire the craven soul who feared to die with all the glow of chivalry and old heroic fire  i found him in a beerhouse tap awaking from a ginborn nap with pipe and sloven dress amusing chums who fooled his bent with muddy maudlin sentiment and tipsy foolishness  the novelist whose painting pen to legions of fictitious men a real existence lends brainpeople whom we rarely fail wheneer we hear their names to hail as old and

is comfortably stowed away at woking how is her hair most usually done and tell me please will she object to smoking the colour of her eyes too you may mention come sibyl prophesyim all attention    the folly of brownby a general agent    i knew a boora clownish card his only friends were pigs and cows and the poultry of a small farmyard who came into two hundred thousand  good fortune worked no change in brown though shes a mighty social chymist he was a clownand by a clown i do not mean a pantomimist  it left him quiet calm and cool though hardly knowing what a crown was you cant imagine what a fool poor rich uneducated brown was  he scouted all who wished to come and give him monetary schooling and i propose to give you some idea of his insensate fooling  i formed a company or two of course i dont know what the rest meant i formed them solely with a view to help him to a sound investment  their objects weretheir only cares to justify their boards in showing a handsome dividend on shares and keep their good promoter going  but nothe lout sticks to his brass though shares at par i freely proffer yetwill it be believedthe ass declines with thanks my wellmeant offer  he adds with bumpkins stolid grin a weakly intellect denoting hed rather not invest it in a company of my promoting  you have two hundred thou or more said i  youll waste it lose it lend it come take my furnished second floor ill gladly show you how to spend it  but will it be believed that he with grin upon his face of poppy declined my aid while thanking me for what he called my philanthroppy  some blind suspicious fools rejoice in doubting friends who wouldnt harm them they will not hear the charmers voice however wisely he may charm them  i showed him that his coat all dust top boots and cords provoked compassion and proved that men of station must conform to the decrees of fashion  i showed him where to buy his hat to coat him trouser him and boot him but nohe wouldnt hear of that he didnt think the style would suit him  i offered him a county seat and made no end of an oration i made it certainty complete and introduced the deputation  but nothe clown my prospect blights the worth of birth it surely teaches why should i want to spend my nights in parliament amaking speeches  i havent never been to school i aint had not no eddication and i should surely be a fool to publish that to all the nation  i offered him a trotting horse no hack had ever trotted faster i also offered him of course a rare and curious old master  i offered to procure him weeds wines fit for one in his position but though an ass in all his deeds hed learnt the meaning of commission  he called me thief the other day and daily from his door he thrusts me much more of this and soon i may begin to think that brown mistrusts me  so deaf to all sound reasons rule this poor uneducated clown is you cannot fancy what a fool poor rich uneducated brown is    sir macklin    of all the youths i ever saw none were so wicked vain or silly so lost to shame and sabbath law as worldly tom and bob and billy  for every sabbath day they walked such was their gay and thoughtless natur in parks or gardens where they talked from three to six or even later  sir macklin was a priest severe in conduct and in conversation it did a sinner good to hear him deal in ratiocination  he could in every action show some sin and nobody could doubt him he argued high he argued low he also argued round about him  he wept to think each thoughtless youth contained of wickedness a skinful and burnt to teach the awful truth that walking out on sundays sinful  oh youths said he i grieve to find the course of life youve been and hit on sit down said he and never mind the pennies for the chairs you sit on  my opening head is kensington how walking there the sinner hardens which when i have enlarged upon i go to secondlyits gardens  my thirdly comprehendeth hyde of secresy the guilts and shameses my fourthlyparkits verdure wide my fifthly comprehends st jamess  that matter settled i shall reach the sixthly in my solemn tether and show that what is true of each is also true of all together  then i shall demonstrate to you according to the rules of whately that what is true of all is true of each considered separately  in lavish stream his accents flow tom bob and billy dare not flout him he argued high he argued low he also argued round about him  ha ha he said you loathe your ways you writhe at these my words of warning in agony your hands you raise and so they did for they were yawning  to twentyfirstly on they go the lads do not attempt to scout him he argued high he argued low he also argued round about him  ho ho he cries you bow your crests my eloquence has set you weeping in shame you bend upon your breasts and so they did for they were sleeping  he proved them thishe proved them that this good but wearisome ascetic he jumped and thumped upon his hat he was so very energetic  his bishop at this moment chanced to pass and found the road encumbered he noticed how the churchman danced and how his congregation slumbered  the hundred and eleventh head the priest completed of his stricture oh bosh the worthy bishop said and walked him off as in the picture    the yarn of the nancy bell    twas on the shores that round our coast from deal to ramsgate span that i found alone on a piece of stone an elderly naval man  his hair was weedy his beard was long and weedy and long was he and i heard this wight on the shore recite in a singular minor key  oh i am a cook and a captain bold and the mate of the nancy brig and a bosun tight and a midshipmite and the crew of the captains gig  and he shook his fists and he tore his hair till i really felt afraid for i couldnt help thinking the man had been drinking and so i simply said  oh elderly man its little i know of the duties of men of the sea and ill eat my hand if i understand however you can be  at once a cook and a captain bold and the mate of the nancy brig and a bosun tight and a midshipmite and the crew of the captains gig  then he gave a hitch to his trousers which is a trick all seamen larn and having got rid of a thumping quid he spun this painful yarn  twas in the good ship nancy bell that we sailed to the indian sea and there on a reef we come to grief which has often occurred to me  and pretty nigh all the crew was drowned there was seventyseven o soul and only ten of the nancys men said here to the musterroll  there was me and the cook and the captain bold and the mate of the nancy brig and the bosun tight and a midshipmite and the crew of the captains gig  for a month wed neither wittles nor drink till ahungry we did feel so we drawed a lot and accordin shot the captain for our meal  the next lot fell to the nancys mate and a delicate dish he made then our appetite with the midshipmite we seven survivors stayed  and then we murdered the bosun tight and he much resembled pig then we wittled free did the cook and me on the crew of the captains gig  then only the cook and me was left and the delicate question which of us two goes to the kettle arose and we argued it out as sich  for i loved that cook as a brother i did and the cook he worshipped me but wed both be blowed if wed either be stowed in the other chaps hold you see  ill be eat if you dines off me says tom yes that says i youll be im boiled if i die my friend quoth i and exactly so quoth he  says he dear james to murder me were a foolish thing to do for dont you see that you cant cook me while i canand willcook you  so he boils the water and takes the salt and the pepper in portions true which he never forgot and some chopped shalot and some sage and parsley too  come here says he with a proper pride which his smiling features tell t will soothing be if i let you see how extremely nice youll smell  and he stirred it round and round and round and he sniffed at the foaming froth when i ups with his heels and smothers his squeals in the scum of the boiling broth  and i eat that cook in a week or less andas i eating be the last of his chops why i almost drops for a wessel in sight i see       and i never larf and i never smile and i never lark nor play but sit and croak and a single joke i havewhich is to say  oh i am a cook and a captain bold and the mate of the nancy brig and a bosun tight and a midshipmite and the crew of the captains gig    the bishop of rumtifoo    from east and south the holy clan of bishops gathered to a man to synod called pananglican in flocking crowds they came among them was a bishop who had lately been appointed to the balmy isle of rumtifoo and peter was his name  his peopletwentythree in sum they played the eloquent tumtum and lived on scalps served up in rum the only sauce they knew when first good bishop peter came for peter was that bishops name to humour them he did the same as they of rumtifoo  his flock ive often heard him tell his name was peter loved him well and summoned by the sound of bell in crowds together came oh massa why you go away oh massa peter please to stay they called him peter people say because it was his name  he told them all good boys to be and sailed away across the sea at london bridge that bishop he arrived one tuesday night and as that night he homeward strode to his pananglican abode he passed along the borough road and saw a gruesome sight  he saw a crowd assembled round a person dancing on the ground who straight began to leap and bound with all his might and main to see that dancing man he stopped who twirled and wriggled skipped and hopped then down incontinently dropped and then sprang up again  the bishop chuckled at the sight this style of dancing would delight a simple rumtifoozleite ill learn it if i can to please the tribe when i get back he begged the man to teach his knack right reverend sir in half a crack replied that dancing man  the dancing man he worked away and taught the bishop every day the dancer skipped like any fay good peter did the same the bishop buckled to his task with battements and pas de basque ill tell you if you care to ask that peter was his name  come walk like this the dancer said stick out your toesstick in your head stalk on with quick galvanic tread your fingers thus extend the attitudes considered quaint the weary bishop feeling faint replied i do not say it aint but time my christian friend  we now proceed to something new dance as the paynes and lauris do like thisone twoone twoone two the bishop never proud but in an overwhelming heat his name was peter i repeat performed the payne and lauri feat and puffed his thanks aloud  another game the dancer planned just take your ankle in your hand and try my lord if you can stand your body stiff and stark if when revisiting your see you learnt to hop on shorelike me the novelty would striking be and must attract remark  no said the worthy bishop no that is a length to which i trow colonial bishops cannot go you may express surprise at finding bishops deal in pride but if that trick i ever tried i should appear undignified in rumtifoozles eyes  the islanders of rumtifoo are wellconducted persons who approve a joke as much as you and laugh at it as such but if they saw their bishop land his leg supported in his hand the joke they wouldnt understand t would pain them very much    the precocious baby  a very true tale    to be sung to the air of the whistling oyster  an elderly persona prophet by trade with his quips and tips on withered old lips he married a young and

laid him up for many days when duty led him to distrain and serving writs although it pays gave him excruciating pain  he made out costs distrained for rent foreclosed and sued with moistened eye no

really i am grieved to think it pains you so i thank you for your sympathy but hang itcomei say you know  but baines lay flat upon the floor convulsed with sympathetic sob the captain toddled off next door and gave the case to mr cobb    thomas winterbottom hance    in all the towns and cities fair on merry englands broad expanse no swordsman ever could compare with thomas winterbottom hance  the dauntless lad could fairly hew a silken handkerchief in twain divide a leg of mutton too and this without unwholesome strain  on whole halfsheep with cunning trick his sabre sometimes hed employ no bar of lead however thick had terrors for the stalwart boy  at dover daily hed prepare to hew and slash behind before which aggravated monsieur pierre who watched him from the calais shore  it caused good pierre to swear and dance the sight annoyed and vexed him so he was the bravest man in france he said so and he ought to know  regardez donc ce cochon gros ce polisson  oh sacre bleu son sabre son plomb et ses gigots comme cela mennuye enfin mon dieu  il sait que les foulards de soie give no retaliating whack les gigots morts nont pas de quoi le plomb dont ever hit you back  but every day the headstrong lad cut lead and mutton more and more and every day poor pierre half mad shrieked loud defiance from his shore  hance had a mother poor and old a simple harmless village dame who crowed and clapped as people told of winterbottoms rising fame  she said ill be upon the spot to see my tommys sabreplay and so she left her leafy cot and walked to dover in a day  pierre had a doating mother who had heard of his defiant rage his ma was nearly ninetytwo and rather dressy for her age  at hances doings every morn with sheer delight his mother cried and monsieur pierres contemptuous scorn filled his mamma with proper pride  but hances powers began to fail his constitution was not strong and pierre who once was stout and hale grew thin from shouting all day long  their mothers saw them pale and wan maternal anguish tore each breast and so they met to find a plan to set their offsprings minds at rest  said mrs hance of course i shrinks from bloodshed maam as youre aware but still theyd better meet i thinks assurement said madame pierre  a sunny spot in sunny france was hit upon for this affair the ground was picked by mrs hance the stakes were pitched by madame pierre  said mrs h your work you see go in my noble boy and win en garde mon fils said madame p allons  go on  en garde  begin  the mothers were of decent size though not particularly tall but in the sketch that meets your eyes ive been obliged to draw them small  loud sneered the doughty man of france ho ho  ho ho  ha ha  ha ha the french for pish said thomas hance said pierre langlais monsieur pour bah  said mrs h come one two three were sittin here to see all fair cest magnifique said madame p mais parbleu ce nest pas la guerre  je scorn un foe si lache que vous said pierre the doughty son of france i fight not coward foe like you said our undaunted tommy hance  the french for pooh our tommy cried langlais pour va the frenchman crowed and so with undiminished pride each went on his respective road    the reverend micah sowls    the reverend micah sowls he shouts and yells and howls he screams he mouths he bumps he foams he rants he thumps  his armour he has buckled on to wage the regulation war against the stage and warns his congregation all to shun the presencechamber of the evil one  the subjects sad enough to make him rant and puff and fortunately too his bishops in a pew  so reverend micah claps on extra steam his eyes are flashing with superior gleam he is as energetic as can be for there are fatter livings in that see  the bishop when its oer goes through the vestry door where micah very red is mopping of his head  pardon my lord your sowls excessive zeal it is a theme on which i strongly feel the sermon somebody had sent him down from london at a charge of halfacrown  the bishop bowed his head and acquiescing said ive heard your wellmeant rage against the modern stage  a modern theatre as i heard you say sows seeds of evil broadcastwell it may but let me ask you my respected son pray have you ever ventured into one  my lord said micah no i never never go what  go and see a play my goodness gracious nay  the worthy bishop said my friend no doubt the stage may be the place you make it out but if my reverend sowls you never go i dont quite understand how youre to know  well really micah said ive often heard and read but never godo you the bishop said i do  that proves me wrong said micah in a trice i thought it all frivolity and vice the bishop handed him a printed card go to a theatre where they play our bard  the bishop took his leave rejoicing in his sleeve the next ensuing day sowls went and heard a play  he saw a dreary person on the stage who mouthed and mugged in simulated rage who growled and spluttered in a mode absurd and spoke an english sowls had never heard  for gaunt was spoken garnt  and haunt transformed to harnt  and wrath  pronounced as rath  and death was changed to dath  for hours and hours that dismal actor walked and talked and talked and talked and talked till lethargy upon the parson crept and sleepy micah sowls serenely slept  he slept away until the farce that closed the bill had warned him not to stay and then he went away  i thought my gait ridiculous said he my elocution faulty as could be i thought i mumbled on a matchless plan i had not seen our great tragedian  forgive me if you can o great tragedian i own it with a sigh youre drearier than i    a discontented sugar broker    a gentleman of city fame now claims your kind attention east india broking was his game his name i shall not mention no one of finelypointed sense would violate a confidence and shall i go and do it  no his name i shall not mention  he had a trusty wife and true and very cosy quarters a manager a

sulky he had one sorrowonly one he was extremely bulky a man must be i beg to state exceptionally fortunate who owns his chief and only grief isbeing very bulky  this load hed say i cannot bear im nineteen stone or twenty henceforward ill go in for air and exercise in plenty most people think that should it come they can reduce a bulging tum to measures fair by taking air and exercise in plenty  in every weather every day dry muddy wet or gritty he took to dancing all the way from brompton to the city you do not often get the chance of seeing sugar brokers dance from their abode in fulham road through brompton to the city  he braved the gay and guileless laugh of children with their nusses the loud uneducated chaff of clerks on omnibuses against all minor things that rack a nicelybalanced mind ill back the noisy chaff and illbred laugh of clerks on omnibuses  his friends who heard his money chink and saw the house he rented and knew his wife could never think what made him discontented it never entered their pure minds that fads are of eccentric kinds nor would they own that fat alone could make one discontented  your riches know no kind of pause your trade is fast advancing you dancebut not for joy because you weep as you are dancing to dance implies that man is glad to weep implies that man is sad but here are you who do the two you weep as you are dancing  his mania soon got noised about and into all the papers his size increased beyond a doubt for all his reckless capers it may seem singular to you but all his friends admit it true the more he found his figure round the more he cut his capers  his bulk increasedno matter that he tried the more to toss it he never spoke of it as fat but adipose deposit upon my word it seems to me unpardonable vanity and worse than that to call your fat an adipose deposit  at length his brawny knees gave way and on the carpet sinking upon his shapeless back he lay and kicked away like winking instead of seeing in his state the finger of unswerving fate he laboured still to work his will and kicked away like winking  his friends disgusted with him now away in silence wended i hardly like to tell you

spectral shape a fine old fiveact fogy the goblin imp a lithe young ape a fine lowcomedy bogy  and as they exercised their joints promoting quick digestion they talked on several curious points and raised this delicate question which of us two is number one the ghostie or the goblin and oer the point they raised in fun they fairly fell asquabblin  theyd barely speak and each in fine grew more and more reflective each thought his own particular line by chalks the more effective at length they settled some one should by each of them be haunted and so arrange that either could exert his prowess vaunted  the quaint against the statuesque by competition lawful the goblin backed the quaint grotesque the ghost the grandly awful now said the goblin heres my plan in attitude commanding i see a stalwart englishman by yonder tailors standing  the very fittest man on earth my influence to try on of gentle praps of noble birth and dauntless as a lion now wrap yourself within your shroud

composure for hours he tried to daunt the youth for days indeed but vainly the stripling smiledto tell the truth the stripling smiled inanely  for weeks the goblin weird and wild that noble stripling haunted for weeks the stripling stood and smiled unmoved and all undaunted the sombre ghost exclaimed your plan has failed you goblin plainly now watch yon hardy hieland man so stalwart and ungainly

for several years the ghostly twain these britons bold have haunted but all their efforts are in vain their victims stand undaunted this very day the imp and ghost whose powers the imp derided stand each at his allotted post the bet is undecided    the phantom curate  a fable    a bishop oncei will not name his see annoyed his clergy in the mode conventional from pulpit shackles never set them free and found a sin where sin was unintentional all pleasures ended in abuse auricular the bishop was so terribly particular  though on the whole a wise and upright man he sought to make of human pleasures clearances and form his priests on that muchlauded plan which pays undue attention to appearances he couldnt do good deeds without a psalm in em although in truth he bore away the palm in em  enraged to find a deacon at a dance or catch a curate at some mild frivolity he sought by open censure to enhance their dread of joining harmless social jollity yet he enjoyed a fact of notoriety the ordinary pleasures of society  one evening sitting at a pantomime forbidden treat to those who stood in fear of him roaring at jokes sans metre sense or rhyme he turned and saw immediately in rear of him his peace of mind upsetting and annoying it a curate also heartily enjoying it  again t was christmas eve and to enhance his childrens pleasure in their harmless rollicking he like a good old fellow stood to dance when something checked the current of his frolicking that curate with a maid he treated loverly stood up and figured with him in the coverley  once yielding to an universal choice the companys demand was an emphatic one for the old bishop had a glorious voice in a quartet he joinedan operatic one harmless enough though neer a word of grace in it when lo that curate came and took the bass in it  one day when passing through a quiet street he stopped awhile and joined a punchs gathering and chuckled more than solemn folk think meet to see that gentleman his judy lathering and heard as punch was being treated penalty that phantom curate laughing all hyaenally  now at a picnic mid fair golden curls bright eyes straw hats bottines that fit amazingly a croquetbout is planned by all the girls and he consenting speaks of croquet praisingly but suddenly declines to play at all in it the curate fiend has come to take a ball in it  next when at quiet seaside village freed from cares episcopal and ties monarchical he grows his beard and smokes his fragrant weed in manner anything but hierarchical he seesand fixes an unearthly stare on it that curates face with half a yard of hair on it  at length he gave a charge and spake this word vicars your curates to enjoyment urge ye may to check their harmless pleasurings absurd what laymen do without reproach my clergy may he spake and lo at this concluding word of him the curate vanishedno one since has heard of him    the sensation captain    no nobler captain ever trod than captain parklebury todd so goodso wiseso brave he but still as all his friends would own he had one follyone alone this captain in the navy  i do not think i ever knew a man so wholly given to creating a sensation or praps i should in justice say to what in an adelphi play is known as situation  he passed his time designing traps to flurry unsuspicious chaps the taste was his innately he couldnt walk into a room without ejaculating boom which startled ladies greatly  hed wear a mask and muffling cloak not you will understand in joke as some assume disguises he did it actuated by a simple love of mystery and fondness for surprises  i need not say he loved a maid his eloquence threw into shade all others who adored her the maid though pleased at first i know found after several years or so her startling lover bored her  so when his orders came to sail she did not faint or scream or wail or with her tears anoint him she shook his hand and said goodbye with laughter dancing in her eye which seemed to disappoint him  but ere he went aboard his boat he placed around her little throat a ribbon blue and yellow on which he hung a doubletooth a simple token this in sooth twas all he had poor fellow  i often wonder he would say when very very far away if angelina wears it a plan has entered in my head i will pretend that i am dead and see how angy bears it  the news he made a messmate tell his angelina bore it well no sign gave she of crazing but steady as the inchcape rock his angelina stood the shock with fortitude amazing  she said some one i must elect poor angelina to protect from all who wish to harm her since worthy captain todd is dead i rather feel inclined to wed a comfortable farmer  a comfortable farmer came bassanio tyler was his name who had no end of treasure he said my noble gal be mine the noble gal did not decline but simply said with pleasure  when this was told to captain todd at first he thought it rather odd and felt some perturbation but very long he did not grieve he thought he could a way perceive to such a situation  ill not reveal myself said he till they are both in the ecclesiastical arena then suddenly i will appear and paralysing them with fear demand my angelina  at length arrived the wedding day accoutred in the usual way appeared the bridal body the worthy clergyman began when in the gallant captain ran and cried behold your toddy  the bridegroom praps was terrified and also possibly the bride the bridesmaids were affrighted but angelina noble soul contrived her feelings to control and really seemed delighted  my bride said gallant captain todd shes mine uninteresting clod my own my darling charmer oh dear said she youre just too late im married to i beg to state this comfortable farmer  indeed the farmer said shes mine youve been and cut it far too fine i see said todd im beaten and so he went to sea once more sensation he for aye forswore and married on her native shore a lady whom hed met before a lovely otaheitan
