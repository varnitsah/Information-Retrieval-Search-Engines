name of our heroine she was born in the last quarter of the nineteenth century at nice in france and she spent the early years of her life in st louis a somewhat conservative old city on the banks of the mississippi river her father was randolph leffingwell and he died in the early flower of his manhood while filling with a grace that many remember the post of united states consul at nice as a linguist he was a phenomenon and his photograph in the tortoiseshell frame proves indubitably to anyone acquainted with the fashions of 1870 that he was a master of that subtlest of all arts dress he had gentle blood in his veins which came from virginia through kentucky in a coach and six and he was the equal in appearance and manners of any duke who lingered beside classic seas  honora has often pictured to herself a gay villa set high above the curving shore the amethyst depths shading into emerald laced with milkwhite foam the vivid colours of the town the gay costumes the excursions the dinnerparties presided over by the immaculate young consul in three languages and the guests chosen from the haute noblesse of europe such was the vision in her youthful mind added to by degrees as she grew into youngladyhood and surreptitiously became familiar with the writings of ouida and the duchess and other literature of an educating cosmopolitan nature  honoras biography should undoubtedly contain a sketch of mrs randolph leffingwell beauty and dash and a knowledge of how to seat a table seem to have been the ladys chief characteristics the only daughter of a carefully dressed and carefully preserved widower likewise a linguistwhose superrefined tastes and the limited straits to which he the remaining scion of an old southern family had been reduced by a gentlemanly contempt for money led him to choose paris rather than new york as a place of residence one of the occasional and carefully planned trips to the riviera proved fatal to the beautiful but reckless myrtle allison she who might have chosen counts or dukes from the tagus to the danube or even crossed the channel took the dashing but impecunious american consul with a faith in his future that was sublime without going over too carefully the upward path which led to the post of their countrys representative at the court of st james neither had the slightest doubt that randolph leffingwell would tread it  it is needless to dwell upon the chagrin of honoras maternal grandfather howard allison esquire over this turn of affairs this unexpected bouleversement as he spoke of it in private to his friends in his parisian club for many years he had watched the personal attractions of his daughter grow and a brougham and certain other delights not to be mentioned had gradually become in his mind synonymous with old age the brougham would have on its panels the allison crest and his distinguished and titled soninlaw would drop in occasionally at the little apartment on the boulevard haussmann alas for visions for legitimate hopes shattered forever on the day that randolph leffingwell led miss allison down the aisle of the english church the vision of the brougham and the other delights faded howard allison went back to his club  three years later while on an excursion with sir nicholas baker and a merry party on the italian aide the horses behind which mr and mrs leffingwell were driving with their host ran away and in the flight managed to precipitate the vehicle and themselves down the side of one of the numerous deep valleys of the streams seeking the mediterranean thus by a singular caprice of destiny honors was deprived of both her parents at a period whichsome chose to believewas the height of their combined glories randolph leffingwell lived long enough to be taken back to nice and to consign his infant daughter and sundry other unsolved problems to his brother tom  brother tomor uncle tom as we must call him with honoracheerfully accepted the charge for his legacies in life had been chiefly blessings in disguise he was paying teller of the prairie bank and the thermometer registered something above 90 deg fahrenheit on the july morning when he stood behind his wicket reading a letter from howard allison esquire relative to his niece mr leffingwell was at this period of his life fortyeight but the habit he had acquired of assuming responsibilities and burdens seemed to have had the effect of making his age indefinite he was six feet tall broadshouldered his mustache and hair already turning his eyebrows were a trifle bushy and his eyes reminded men of one eternal and highly prized qualityhonesty they were blue grey ordinarily they shed a light which sent people away from his window the happier without knowing why but they had been known on rare occasions to flash on dishonesty and fraud like the lightnings of the lord mr isham the president of the bank coined a phrase about him he said that thomas leffingwell was constitutionally honest  although he had not risen above the position of paying teller thomas leffingwell had a unique place in the city of his birth and the esteem in which he was held by capitalists and clerks proves that character counts for something on his fathers failure and death he had entered the prairie bank at eighteen and never left it if he had owned it he could not have been treated by the customers with more respect the city save for a few notable exceptions like mr isham called him mr leffingwell but behind his back often spoke of him as tom  on the particular hot morning in question as he stood in his seersucker coat reading the unquestionably pompous letter of mr allison announcing that his niece was on the high seas he returned the greetings of his friends with his usual kindness and cheer in an adjoining compartment a longlegged boy of fourteen was busily stamping letters  peter said mr leffingwell go ask mr isham if i may see him  it is advisable to remember the boys name it was peter erwin and he was a favourite in the bank where he had been introduced by mr leffingwell himself he was an orphan and lived with his grandmother an impoverished old lady with good blood in her veins who boarded in grahams row on olive street suffice it to add at this time that he worshipped mr leffingwell and that he was back in a twinkling with the information that mr isham was awaiting him  the president was seated at his desk in spite of the thermometer he gave no appearance of discomfort in his frockcoat he had scant sandygrey whiskers a tightly closed and smoothshaven upper lip a nose witha decided ridge and rather small but penetrating eyes in which the blue pigment had been used sparingly his habitual mode of speech was both brief and sharp but people remarked that he modified it a little for tom leffingwell  come in tom he said anything the matter  mr isham i want a week off to go to new york  the request from tom leffingwell took mr ishams breath one of the bank presidents characteristics was an extreme interest in the private affairs of those who came within his zone of influence and especially when these affairs evinced any irregularity  randolph again he asked quickly  tom walked to the window and stood looking out into the street his voice shook as he answered  ten days ago i learned that my brother was dead mr isham  the president glanced at the broad back of his teller mr ishams voice was firm his face certainly betrayed no feeling but a flitting gleam of satisfaction might have been seen in his eye  of course tom you may go he answered  thus came to pass an event in the lives of uncle tom and aunt mary that journey to new york their first of two nights and two days to fetch honora we need not dwell upon all that befell them the first view of the hudson the first whiff of the salt air on this unwonted holiday the sights of this crowded city of wealthall were tempered by the thought of the child coming into their lives they were standing on the pier when the windows were crimson in the early light and at nine oclock on that summers morning the albania was docked and the passengers came crowding down the gangplank prosperous tourists most of them with servants and stewards carrying bags of english design and checked steamer rugs and at last a ruddyfaced bonne with streamers and a bundle of ribbons and laceshonorahonora aged eighteen months gazing at a subjugated world  what a beautiful child exclaimed a woman on the pier  was it instinct or premonition that led them to accost the bonne  oui leffingwell she cried gazing at them in some perplexity three children of various sizes clung to her skirts and a younger nurse carried a goldenhaired little girl of honoras age a lady and gentleman followed the lady was beginning to look matronly and no second glance was required to perceive that she was a person of opinion and character mr holt was smaller than his wife neat in dress and unobtrusive in appearance in the rich mrs holt the friend of the randolph leffingwells aunt mary was prepared to find a more vapidly fashionable personage and had schooled herself forthwith  you are mrs thomas leffingwell she asked well i am relieved the ladys eyes travelling rapidly over aunt marys sober bonnet and brooch and gown made it appear that these features in honoras future guardian gave her the relief in question honora this is your aunt  honora smiled from amidst the laces and aunt mary only too ready to capitulate surrendered she held out her arms tears welled up in the frenchwomans eyes as she abandoned her charge  pauvre mignonne she cried  but mrs holt rebuked the nurse sharply in frencha language with which neither aunt mary nor uncle tom was familiar fortunately perhaps mrs holts remark was to the effect that honora was going to a sensible home  hortense loves her better than my own children said that lady  honora seemed quite content in the arms of aunt mary who was gazing so earnestly into the childs face that she did not at first hear mrs holts invitation to take breakfast with them on madison avenue and then she declined politely while grossing on the steamer mrs holt had decided quite clearly in her mind just what she was going to say to the childs future guardian but there was something in aunt marys voice and manner which made these remarks seem unnecessaryalthough mrs holt was secretly disappointed not to deliver them  it was fortunate that we happened to be in nice at the time she said with the evident feeling that some explanation was due i did not know poor mrs randolph leffingwell veryvery intimately or mr leffingwell it was such a suddensuch a terrible affair but mr holt and i were only too glad to do what we could  we feel very grateful to you said aunt mary quietly  mrs holt looked at her with a still more distinct approval being tolerably sure that mrs thomas leffingwell understood she had cleared her skirts of any possible implication of intimacy with the late mrs randolph and done so with a master touch  in the meantime honora had passed to uncle tom after securing the little trunk and settling certain matters with mr holt they said goodby to her late kind protectors and started off for the nearest streetcars honora pulling uncle toms mustache more than one pedestrian paused to look back at the tall man carrying the beautiful child bedecked like a young princess and more than one passenger in the street cars smiled at them both     chapter ii perdita recalled  saint louis or that part of it which is called by dealers in real estate the choice residence section grew westward and uncle tom might be said to have been in the vanguard of the movement in the days before honora was born he had built his little house on what had been a farm on the olive street road at the crest of the second ridge from the river up this ridge with clanking traces toiled the horsecars that carried uncle tom downtown to the bank and aunt mary to market  fleeing westward likewise from the smoke friends of uncle toms and aunt marys gradually surrounded thembuilding as a rule the high victorian mansions in favour at that period which were placed in the centre of commodious yards for the friends of uncle tom and aunt mary were for the most part rich and belonged as did they to the older families of the city mr dwyers house with its picture gallery was across the street  in the midst of such imposing company the little dwelling which became the home of our heroine sat well back in a plot that might almost be called a garden in summer its white wooden front was nearly hidden by the quivering leaves of two tall pear trees on the other side of the brick walk and near the iron fence was an elm and a flower bed that was uncle toms pride and the admiration of the neighbourhood honora has but to shut her eyes to see it aflame with tulips at eastertide the eastern wall of the house was a mass of virginia creeper and beneath that another flower bed and still another in the backyard behind the lattice fence covered with cucumber vine there were besides two maples and two apricot trees relics of the farm and of blessed memory such apricots visions of hot summer evenings come back with uncle tom in his seersucker coat with his green wateringpot bending over the beds and aunt mary seated upright in her chair looking up from her knitting with a loving eye  behind the lattice on these summer evenings stands the militant figure of that old retainer bridget the cook her stout arms akimbo ready to engage in vigorous banter should honora deign to approach  whisht nora darlint its a young lady yell be soon and the beaux acomin round she would cry and throw back her head and laugh until the tears were in her eyes  and the princess a slim figure in an immaculate linen frock with red ribbons which aunt mary had copied from longstreths london catalogue would reply with dignity  bridget i wish you would try to remember that my name is honora  another spasm of laughter from bridget  listen to that now she would cry to another ancient retainer mary ann the housemaid whose kitchen chair was tilted up against the side of the woodshed itll be miss honora next and george hanbury here today with his eye through a knothole in the fence out of his head for a sight of ye  george hanbury was honoras cousin and she did not deem his admiration a subject fit for discussion with bridget  sure declared mary ann its the air of a princess the child has  that she should be thought a princess did not appear at all remarkable to honora at twelve years of age perdita may have had such dreams she had been born she knew in some wondrous land by the shores of the summer seas not at all like st louis and friends and relatives had not hesitated to remark in her hearing that she resembledher fatherthat handsome father who surely must have been a prince whose beforementioned photograph in the tortoiseshell frame was on the bureau in her little room so far as randolph leffingwell was concerned photography had not been invented for nothing other records of him remained which honora had likewise seen one end of a rosecovered villawhich honora thought was a wing of his palace a coach and four he was driving and which had chanced to belong to an englishman although the photograph gave no evidence of this ownership neither aunt mary nor uncle tom had ever soughtfor reasons perhaps obviousto correct the childs impression of an extraordinary paternity  aunt mary was a puritan of southern ancestry and her father had been a presbyterian minister uncle tom was a member of the vestry of a church still under puritan influences as a consequence for honora there were sunday afternoonsperiods when the imaginative faculty in which she was by no means lacking was given full play she would sit by the hour in the swing uncle tom had hung for her under the maple near the lattice while castles rose on distant heights against blue skies there was her real home in a balconied chamber that overlooked mile upon mile of rustling forest in the valley and when the wind blew the sound of it was like the sea honora did not remember the sea but its music was often in her ears  she would be aroused from these dreams of greatness by the appearance of old catherine her nurse on the side porch reminding her that it was time to wash for supper no princess could have had a more humble tiringwoman than catherine  honora cannot be unduly blamed when she reached the little house under the hill as catherine called the chamber beneath the eaves she beheld reflected in the mirror an image like a tall white flower that might indeed have belonged to a princess her hair the colour of burnt sienna fell evenly to her shoulders her features even then had regularity and hauteur her legs in their black silk stockings were straight and the simple white lawn frock made the best of a slender figure those frocks of honoras were a continual source of wonder and sometimes of envyto aunt marys friends who returned from the seaside in the autumn after a week among the fashions in boston or new york to find honora in the latest models and better dressed than their own children aunt mary made no secret of the methods by which these seeming miracles were performed and showed cousin eleanor hanbury the fashion plates in the english periodicals cousin eleanor sighed  mary you are wonderful she would say honoras clothes are betterlooking than those i buy in the east at such fabulous prices from cavendish  indeed no woman was ever farther removed from personal vanity than aunt mary she looked like a little quakeress her silvered hair was parted in the middle and had in spite of palpable efforts towards tightness and repression a perceptible ripple in it grey was her only concession to colour and her gowns and bonnets were of a primness which belonged to the past repression or perhaps compression was her note for the energy confined within her little body was a thing to have astounded scientists and honora grew to womanhood and reflection before she had guessed or considered that her aunt was possessed of intense emotions which had no outlet her features were regular her shy eye had the clearness of a forest pool she believed in predestination which is to say that she was a fatalist and while she steadfastly continued to regard this world as a place of sorrow and trials she concerned herself very little about her participation in a future life old dr ewing the rector of st annes while conceding that no better or more charitable woman existed found it so exceedingly difficult to talk to her on the subject of religion that he had never tried it but once  such was aunt mary the true student of human nature should not find it surprising that she spoiled honora and stroveat what secret expense care and selfdenial to uncle tom and herself none will ever knowto adorn the child that she might appear creditably among companions whose parents were more fortunate in this worlds goods that she denied herself to educate honora as these other children were educated nor is it astonishing that she should not have understood the highly complex organism of the young lady we have chosen for our heroine who was shaken at the age of thirteen by unfulfilled longings  very early in life honora learned to dread the summer when one by one the families of her friends departed until the city itself seemed a remote and distant place from what it had been in the spring and winter the great houses were closed and blinded and in the evening the servants who had been left behind chattered on the front steps honora could not bear the sound of the trains that drifted across the night and the sight of the trunks piled in the hanburys hall in wayland square always filled her with a sickening longing would the day ever come when she too would depart for the bright places of the earth sometimes when she looked in the mirror she was filled with a fierce belief in a destiny to sit in the high seats to receive homage and dispense bounties to discourse with great intellects to know london and paris and the marts and centres of the world as her father had to escapeonly to escape from the prison walls of a humdrum existence and to soar  let us if we can reconstruct an august day when all or nearly all of honoras small friends were gone eastward to the mountains or the seaside in the little house under the hill the surface of which was a hot slate roof honora would awake about seven oclock to find old catherine bending over her in a duncoloured calico dress with the light fiercely beating against the closed shutters that braved it so unflinchingly throughout the day  the birds are before ye miss honora honey and your uncle waterin his roses this halfhour  uncle tom was indeed an early riser as honora dressed catherine assisting as at a ceremony she could see him in his seersucker coat bending tenderly over his beds he lived enveloped in a peace which has since struck wonder to honoras soul she lingered in her dressing even in those days falling into reveries from which catherine gently and deferentially aroused her and uncle tom would be carving the beefsteak and aunt mary pouring the coffee when she finally arrived in the dining room to nibble at one of bridgets unforgettable rolls or hot biscuits uncle tom had his joke and at quarterpast eight precisely he would kiss aunt mary and walk to the corner to wait for the ambling horsecar that was to take him to the bank sometimes honora went to the corner with him and he waved her goodby from the platform as he felt in his pocket for the nickel that was to pay his fare  when honora returned aunt mary had donned her apron and was industriously aiding mary ann to wash the dishes and maintain the customary high polish on her husbands share of the leffingwell silver which standing on the side table shot hither and thither rays of green light that filtered through the shutters into the darkened room the child partook of aunt marys pride in that silver made for a kentucky greatgrandfather leffingwell by a famous philadelphia silversmith threequarters of a century before honora sighed  whats the matter honora asked aunt mary without pausing in her vigorous rubbing  the leffingwells used to be great once upon a time didnt they aunt mary  your uncle tom answered aunt mary quietly is the greatest man i know child  and my father must have been a great man too cried honora to have been a consul and drive coaches  aunt mary was silent she was not a person who spoke easily on difficult subjects  why dont you ever talk to me about my father aunt mary uncle tom does  i didnt know your father honora  but you have seen him  yes said aunt mary dipping her cloth into the whiting i saw him at my wedding but he was very young  what was he like honora demanded he was very handsome wasnt he  yes child  and he had ambition didnt he aunt mary  aunt mary paused her eyes were troubled as she looked at honora whose head was thrown back  what kind of ambition do you mean honora  oh cried honora to be great and rich and powerful and to be somebody  who has been putting such things in your head my dear  no one aunt mary only if i were a man i shouldnt rest until i became great  alas that aunt mary with all her will should have such limited powers of expression she resumed her scrubbing of the silver before she spoke  to do ones duty to accept cheerfully and like a christian the responsibilities and burdens of life is the highest form of greatness my child your uncle tom has had many things to trouble him he has always worked for others and not for himself and he is respected and loved by all who know him  yes i know aunt mary but  but what honora  then why isnt he rich as my father was  your father wasnt rich my dear said aunt mary sadly  why aunt mary honora exclaimed he lived in a beautiful house and owned horses isnt that being rich  poor aunt mary  honora she answered there are some things you are too young to understand but try to remember my dear that happiness doesnt consist in being rich  but i have often heard you say that you wished you were rich aunt mary and had nice things and a picture gallery like mr dwyer  i should like to have beautiful pictures honora  i dont like mr dwyer declared honora abruptly  you mustnt say that honora was aunt marys reproof mr dwyer is an upright publicspirited man and he thinks a great deal of your uncle tom  i cant help it aunt mary said honora i think he enjoys beingwell being able to do things for a man like uncle tom  neither aunt mary nor honora guessed what a subtle criticism this was of mr dwyer aunt mary was troubled and puzzled and she began to speculate not for the first time why the lord had given a person with so little imagination a child like honora to bring up in the straight and narrow path  when i go on sunday afternoons with uncle tom to see mr dwyers pictures honora persisted i always feel that he is so glad to have what other people havent or he wouldnt have any one to show them to  aunt mary shook her head once she had given her loyal friendship such faults as this became as nothing  and when said honora when mrs dwyer has dinnerparties for celebrated people who come here why does she invite you in to see the table  out of kindness honora mrs dwyer knows that i enjoy looking at beautiful things  why doesnt she invite you to the dinners asked honora hotly our family is just as good as mrs dwyers  the extent of aunt marys distress was not apparent  you are talking nonsense my child she said all my friends know that i am not a person who can entertain distinguished people and that i do not go out and that i havent the money to buy evening dresses and even if i had she added i havent a pretty neck so its just as well  a philosophy distinctly aunt marys  uncle tom after he had listened without comment that evening to her account of this conversation was of the opinion that to take honora to task for her fancies would be waste of breath that they would right themselves as she grew up  im afraid its inheritance tom said aunt mary at last and if so it ought to be counteracted weve seen other signs of it you know honora has little or no idea of the value of moneyor of its ownership  she sees little enough of it uncle tom remarked with a smile  tom  well  sometimes i think ive done wrong not to dress her more simply im afraid its given the child a taste forfor selfadornment  i once had a fond belief that all women possessed such a taste said uncle tom with a quizzical look at his own exception to tell you the truth i never classed it as a fault  then i dont see why you married me said aunt marya periodical remark of hers but tom i do wish her to appear as well as the other children and aunt mary actually blushed the child has good looks  why dont you go as far as old catherine and call her a princess he asked  do you want me to ruin her utterly exclaimed aunt mary  uncle tom put his hands on his wifes shoulders and looked down into her face and smiled again although she held herself very straight the top of her head was very little above the level of his chin  it strikes me that you are entitled to some little indulgence in life mary he said  one of the curious contradictions of aunt marys character was a never dying interest which held no taint of envy in the doings of people more fortunate than herself in the long summer days after her silver was cleaned and her housekeeping and marketing finished she read in the bookclub periodicals of royal marriages embassy balls of great town and country houses and their owners at home and abroad and she knew by means of a correspondence with cousin eleanor hanbury and other intimates the kind of cottages in which her friends sojourned at the seashore or in the mountains how many rooms they had and how many servants and very often who the servants were she was likewise informed on the climate and the ease with which it was possible to obtain fresh vegetables and to all of this information uncle tom would listen smiling but genuinely interested while he carved at dinner  one evening when uncle tom had gone to play piquet with mr isham who was ill honora further surprised her aunt by exclaiming how can you talk of things other people have and not want them aunt mary  why should i desire what i cannot have my dear i take such pleasure out of my friends possessions as i can  but you want to go to the seashore i know you do ive heard you say so honora protested  i should like to see the open ocean before i die admitted aunt mary unexpectedly i saw new york harbour once when we went to meet you and i know how the salt water smellswhich is as much perhaps as i have the right to hope for but i have often thought it would be nice to sit for a whole summer by the sea and listen to the waves dashing upon the beach like those in the chase picture in mr dwyers gallery  aunt mary little guessed the unspeakable rebellion aroused in honora by this acknowledgment of being fatally circumscribed wouldnt uncle tom ever be rich  aunt mary shook her headshe saw no prospect of it  but other men who were not half so good as uncle tom got rich  uncle tom was not the kind of man who cared for riches he was content to do his duty in that sphere where god had placed him  poor aunt mary honora never asked her uncle such questions to do so never occurred to her at peace with all men he gave of his best to children and honora remained a child next to his flowers walking was uncle toms chief recreation and from the time she could be guided by the hand she went with him his very presence had the gift of dispelling longings even in the young the gift of compelling delight in simple things of a sunday afternoon if the heat were not too great he would take honora to the wild park that stretches westward of the city and something of the depth and intensity of his pleasure in the birds the forest and the wild flowers would communicate itself to her she learned all unconsciously by suggestion as it were to take delight in them a delight that was to last her lifetime a never failing resource to which she was to turn again and again in winter they went to the botanical gardens or the zoo uncle tom had a passion for animals and mr isham who was a director gave him a pass through the gates the keepers knew him and spoke to him with kindly respect nay it seemed to honora that the very animals knew him and offered themselves ingratiatingly to be stroked by one whom they recognized as friend jaded horses in the street lifted their noses stray homeless cats rubbed against his legs and vagrant dogs looked up at him trustfully with wagging tails  yet his goodness as emerson would have said had some edge to it honora had seen the light of anger in his blue eyea divine ray once he had chastised her for telling aunt mary a lie she could not have lied to him and honora had never forgotten it the anger of such a man had indeed some element in it of the divine terrible not in volume but in righteous intensity and when it had passed there was no occasion for future warning the memory of it lingered     chapter iii concerning providence  what quality was it in honora that compelled bridget to stop her ironing on tuesdays in order to make hot waffles for a young woman who was late to breakfast bridget who would have filled the kitchen with righteous wrath if aunt mary had transgressed the rules of the house which were like the laws of the medes and persians and in honoras early youth mary ann the housemaid spent more than one painful evening writing home for cockle shells and other articles to propitiate our princess who rewarded her with a winning smile and a kiss which invariably melted the honest girl into tears the queen of scots never had a more devoted chamber woman than old catherinewho would have gone to the stake with a smile to save her little lady a single childish ill and who spent her savings until severely taken to task by aunt mary upon objects for which a casual wish had been expressed the saints themselves must at times have been aweary from hearing honoras name  not to speak of christmas christmas in the little house was one wild delirium of joy the night before the festival was to all outward appearances an ordinary evening when uncle tom sat by the fire in his slippers as usual scouting the idea that there would be any christmas at all aunt mary sewed and talked with maddening calmness of the news of the day but for honora the air was charged with coming events of the first magnitude the very furniture of the little sittingroom had a different air the room itself wore a mysterious aspect and the cannelcoal fire seemed to give forth a special quality of unearthly light  is tomorrow christmas uncle tom would exclaim bless me honora i am so glad you reminded me  now uncle tom you knew it was christmas all the time  kiss your uncle good night honora and go right to sleep dearfrom aunt mary  the unconscious irony in that command of aunt marysto go right to sleep many times was a head lifted from a small pillow straining after the meaning of the squeaky noises that came up from below not santa claus honoras belief in him had merged into a blind faith in a larger and even more benevolent if material providence the kind of providence which mr meredith depicts and which was to say to beauchamp heres your marquise a particular providence which at the proper time gave uncle tom money and commanded with a smile buy this for honorashe wants it allsufficient reason soulsatisfying philosophy to which honora was to cling for many years of life it is amazing how much can be wrung from a reluctant world by the mere belief in this kind of providence  sleep came at last in the darkest of the hours and still in the dark hours a stirring a delicious sensation preceding reason and the consciousness of a figure stealing about the room honora sat up in bed shivering with cold and delight  is it awake ye are darlint and it but four oclock the morn  what are you doing cathy  musha its to mass im going to ask the mother of god to give ye many happy christmases the like of this miss honora and catherines arms were about her  oh its christmas cathy isnt it how could i have forgotten it  now go to sleep honey your aunt and uncle wouldnt like it at all at all if ye was to make noise in the middle of the nightand its little better it is  sleep a despised waste of time in childhood catherine went to mass and after an eternity the grey december light began to sift through the shutters and human endurance had reached its limit honora still shivering seized a fleecy wrapper the handiwork of aunt mary and crept a diminutive ghost down the creaking stairway to the sittingroom a sittingroom which now was not a sittingroom but for today a place of magic as though by a prearranged salute of the godsat honoras entrance the fire burst through the thick blanket of fine coal which uncle tom had laid before going to bed and with a little gasp of joy that was almost pain she paused on the threshold that one flash like pizarros first sunrise over peru gilded the edge of infinite possibilities  needless to enumerate them the whole world as we know was in a conspiracy to spoil honora the dwyers the cartwrights the haydens the brices the ishams and i know not how many others had sent their tributes and honoras second cousins the hanburys from the family mansion behind the stately elms of wayland squareof which something anon a miniature mahogany desk a prayerbook and hymnal which the dwyers had brought home from new york endless volumes of a more secular and to honora entrancing nature roller skates skates for real ice when it should appear in the form of sleet on the sidewalks a sled humbler gifts from bridget mary ann and catherine and a wonderful coat with hat to match of a certain dark green velvet when aunt mary appeared an hour or so later honora was surveying her magnificence in the glass  oh aunt mary she cried with her arms tightly locked around her aunts neck how lovely did you send all the way to new york for it  no honora said her aunt it didnt come from new york aunt mary did not explain that this coat had been her one engrossing occupation for six weeks at such times when honora was out or tucked away safely in bed  perhaps honoras face fell a little aunt mary scanned it rather anxiously  does that cause you to like it any less honora she asked  aunt mary exclaimed honora in a tone of reproval and added after a little i suppose mademoiselle made it  does it make any difference who made it honora  oh no indeed aunt mary may i wear it to cousin eleanors today  i gave it to you to wear honora  not in honoras memory was there a christmas breakfast during which peter erwin did not appear bringing gifts peter erwin of whom we caught a glimpse doing an errand for uncle tom in the bank with the complacency of the sun honora was wont to regard this most constant of her satellites her awakening powers of observation had discovered him in bondage and in bondage he had been ever since for their acquaintance had begun on the first sunday afternoon after honoras arrival in st louis at the age of eighteen months it will be remembered that honora was even then a coquette and as she sat in her new babycarriage under the pear tree flirted outrageously with peter who stood on one foot from embarrassment  why peter uncle tom had said slyly why dont you kiss her  that kiss had been peters seal of service and he became on sunday afternoons a sort of understudy for catherine he took an amazing delight in wheeling honora up and down the yard and up and down the sidewalk brunhilde or queen elizabeth never wielded a power more absolute nor had an adorer more satisfactory and of all his remarkable talents none were more conspicuous than his abilities to tell a story and to choose a present emancipated from the perambulator honora would watch for him at the window and toddle to the gate to meet him a gentlemaninwaiting whose zeal however arduous never flagged  on this particular christmas morning when she heard the gate slam honora sprang up from the table to don her green velvet coat poor peter as though his subjugation could be more complete  its the postman suggested uncle tom wickedly  its peter cried honora triumphantly from the hall as she flunk open the door letting in a breath of cold christmas air out of the sunlight  it was peter but a peter who has changed some since perambulator daysjust as honora has changed some a peter who instead of fourteen is six and twenty a fullfledged lawyer in the office of that most celebrated of st louis practitioners judge stephen brice for the peter erwins of this world are queer creatures and move rapidly without appearing to the honoras to move at all a great many things have happened to peter since he had been a messenger boy in the bank  needless to say uncle tom had taken an interest in him and according to peter this fact accounted for all the good fortune which had followed shortly before the news came of his brothers death uncle tom had discovered that the boy who did his errands so willingly was going to night school and was the grandson of a gentleman who had fought with credit in the mexican war and died in misfortune the grandmother was peters only living relative through uncle tom mr isham became interested and judge brice there was a certain scholarship in the washington university which peter obtained and he worked his way through the law school afterwards  a simple story of which many a duplicate could be found in this country of ours in the course of the dozen years or so of its unravelling the grandmother had died and peter had become to all intents and purposes a member of uncle toms family a place was set for him at sunday dinner and if he did not appear at sunday tea sometimes at both and here he was as usual on christmas morning his arms so full that he had had to push open the gate with his foot  well well well well he said stopping short on the doorstep and surveying our velvetclad princess ive come to the wrong house  the princess stuck her finger into her cheek  dont be silly peter she said and merry christmas  merry christmas he replied edging sidewise in at the door and depositing his parcels on the mahogany horsehair sofa he chose one and seized the princessvelvet coat and allin his arms and kissed her when he released her there remained in her hand a moroccobound diary marked with her monogram and destined to contain high matters  how could you know what i wanted peter she exclaimed after she had divested it of the tissue paper holly and red ribbon in which he had so carefully wrapped it for it is a royal trait to thank with the same graciousness and warmth the donors of the humblest and the greatest offerings  there was a paperknife for uncle tom and a workbasket for aunt mary and a dress apiece for catherine bridget and mary ann none of whom peter ever forgot although the smoke was even at that period beginning to creep westward the sun poured through the lace curtains into the little diningroom and danced on the silver coffeepot as aunt mary poured out peters cup and the blue china breakfast plates were bluer than ever because it was christmas the humblest of familiar articles took on the air of a present and after breakfast while aunt mary occupied herself with that immemorial institutionwhich was to lure hitherwards so many prominent citizens of st louis during the dayeggnogg peter surveyed the offerings which transformed the sittingroom the table had been pushed back against the bookcases the chairs knew not their timehonoured places and white paper and red ribbon littered the floor uncle tom relegated to a corner pretended to read his newspaper while honora flitted from peters knees to his or sat crosslegged on the hearthrug investigating a bottomless stocking  what in the world are we going to do with all these things said peter  we cried honora  when we get married i mean said peter smiling at uncle tom lets see and he began counting on his fingers which were long but very strongso strong that honora could never loosen even one of them when they gripped her onetwothreeeight christmases before you are twentyone well have enough things to set us up in housekeeping or perhaps youd rather get married when you are eighteen  ive always told you i wasnt going to marry you peter said honora with decision  why by not he always asked that question  honora sighed  ill make a good husband said peter ill promise ugly men are always good husbands  i didnt say you were ugly declared the ever considerate honora  only my nose is too big he quoted and i am too long one way and not wide enough  you have a certain air of distinction in spite of it said honora  uncle toms newspaper began to shake and he read more industriously than ever  youve been readingnovels said peter in a terrible judicial voice  honora flushed guiltily and resumed her inspection of the stocking miss rossiter a maiden lady of somewhat romantic tendencies was librarian of the book club that year and as a result a book called harolds quest by an author who shall be nameless had come to the house and it was harold who had had a certain air of distinction  it isnt very kind of you to make fun of me when i pay you a compliment replied honora with dignity  i was naturally put out he declared gravely because you said you wouldnt marry me but i dont intend to give up no man who is worth his salt ever gives up  you are old enough to get married now said honora still considerate  but i am not rich enough said peter and besides i want you  one of the first entries in the morocco diarywhich had a lock and key to itwas a description of honoras future husband we cannot violate the lock nor steal the key from under her pillow but this much alas may be said with discretion that he bore no resemblance to peter erwin it may be guessed however that he contained something of harold and more of randolph leffingwell and that he did not live in st louis  an event of christmas after church was the dinner of which uncle tom and aunt mary and honora partook with cousin eleanor hanbury who had been a leffingwell and was a first cousin of honoras father honora loved the atmosphere of the massive yellow stone house in wayland square with its tall polished mahogany doors and thick carpets with its deferential darky servants some of whom had been the slaves of her great uncle to honora gifted with imagination the house had an odour all its own a rich clean odour significant in later life of wealth and luxury and spotless housekeeping and she knew it from top to bottom the spacious upper floor which in ordinary dwellings would have been an attic was the realm of young george and his sisters edith and mary aunt marys namesake rainy saturdays all too brief honora had passed there when the big dolls house in the playroom became the scene of domestic dramas which edith rehearsed after she went to bed although mary took them more calmly in his tenderer years honora even fired george and riots occurred which took the combined efforts of cousin eleanor and mammy lucy to quell it may be remarked in passing that cousin eleanor looked with suspicion upon this imaginative gift of honoras and had several serious conversations with aunt mary on the subject  it was true in a measure that honora quickened to life everything she touched and her arrival in wayland square was invariably greeted with shouts of joy there was no doll on which she had not bestowed a history and by dint of her insistence their pasts clung to them with all the reality of a fate not by any means to be lived down if george rode the huge rockinghorse he was paul revere or some equally historic figure and sometimes to ediths terror he was compelled to assume the role of bluebeard when honora submitted to decapitation with a fortitude amounting to stoicism hide and seek was altogether too tame for her a stake of life and death or imprisonment or treasure being a necessity and many times was edith extracted from the recesses of the cellar in a condition bordering on hysterics the day ending tamely with a bible story or a selection from little women read by cousin eleanor  in autumn and again in spring and early summer before the annual departure of the hanbury family for the sea the pleasant yard with its wide shade trees and its shrubbery was a land of enchantment threatened by a genie black bias the family coachman polishing the fat carriage horses in the stable yard was the genie and george the intrepid knight who spurred by honora would dash in and pinch bias in a part of his anatomy which the honest darky had never seen an ideal genie for he could assume an astonishing fierceness at will  ill git you yit marse george  had it not been for honora her cousins would have found the paradise in which they lived a commonplace spot and indeed they never could realize its tremendous possibilities in her absence what would the mediterranean sea and its adjoining countries be to us unless the wanderings of ulysses and aeneas had made them real and what would cousin eleanors yard have been without honora whatever there was of romance and folklore in uncle toms library honora had extracted at an early age and with astonishing ease had avoided that which was dry and uninteresting the result was a nomenclature for aunt eleanors yard in which there was even a terra incognita wherefrom venturesome travellers never returned but were transformed into wild beasts or monkeys  although they acknowledged her leadership edith and mary were sorry for honora for they knew that if her father had lived she would have had a house and garden like theirs only larger and beside a blue sea where it was warm always honora had told them so and colour was lent to her assertions by the fact that their mother when they repeated this to her only smiled sadly and brushed her eyes with her handkerchief she was even more beautiful when she did so edith told hera remark which caused mrs hanbury to scan her younger daughter closely it smacked of honora  was cousin randolph handsome edith demanded mrs hanbury started so vividly there arose before her eyes a brave and dashing figure clad in grey english cloth walking by her side on a sunny autumn morning in the rue de la paix well she remembered that trip abroad with her mother randolphs aunt and how attentive he was and showed them the best restaurants in which to dine he had only been in france a short time but his knowledge of restaurants and the world in general had been amazing and his acquaintances legion he had a way which there was no resisting of taking people by storm  yes dear answered mrs hanbury absently when the child repeated the question he was very handsome  honora says he would have been president put in george of course i dont believe it she said they lived in a palace by the sea in the south of france with gardens and fountains and a lot of things like that and princesses and princes and eunuchs  and what exclaimed mrs hanbury aghast  i know said george contemptuously she got that out of the arabian nights but this suspicion did not prevent him the next time honora regaled them with more adventures of the palace by the summer seas from listening with a rapt attention no two tales were ever alike his admiration for honora did not wane but increased it differed from that of his sisters however in being a tribute to her creative faculties while ediths breathless faith pictured her cousin as having passed through as many adventures as queen esther george paid her a characteristic compliment but chivalrously drew her aside to bestow it he was not one to mince matters  youre a wonder honora he said if i could lie like that i wouldnt want a pony  he was forced to draw back a little from the heat of the conflagration he had kindled  george hanbury she cried dont you ever speak to me again never do you understand  it was thus that george at some cost had made a considerable discovery which for the moment shook even his scepticism honora believed it all herself  cousin eleanor hanbury was a person or personage who took a deep and abiding interest in her fellowbeings and the old clothes of the hanbury family went unerringly to the needy whose figures most resembled those of the original owners for mrs hanbury had a wide but comparatively unknown charity list she was secretly one of the many providence which honora accepted collectively although it is by no means certain whether honora at this period would have thanked her cousin for tuition at miss farmers school and for her daily tasks at french and music concerning which aunt mary was so particular on the memorable christmas morning when arrayed in green velvet she arrived with her aunt and uncle for dinner in wayland square cousin eleanor drew aunt mary into her bedroom and shut the door and handed her a sealed envelope without opening it but guessing with much accuracy its contents aunt mary handed it back  you are doing too much eleanor she said  mrs hanbury was likewise a direct person  i will take it back on one condition mary if you will tell me that tom has finished paying randolphs debts  mrs leffingwell was silent  i thought not said mrs hanbury now randolph was my own cousin and i insist  aunt mary turned over the envelope and there followed a few moments silence broken only by the distant clamour of tin horns and other musical instruments of the season  i sometimes think mary that honora is a little like randolph andmrs randolph of course i did not know her  neither did i said aunt mary  mary said mrs hanbury again i realize how you worked to make the child that velvet coat do you think you ought to dress her that way  i dont see why she shouldnt be as well dressed as the children of my friends eleanor  mrs hanbury laid her hand impulsively on aunt marys  no child i know of dresses half as well said mrs hanbury the trouble you take  is rewarded said aunt mary  yes mrs hanbury agreed if my own daughters were half as good looking i should be content and honora has an air of race oh mary cant you see i am only thinking of the childs future  do you expect me to take down all my mirrors eleanor if she has good looks said aunt mary she has not learned it from my lips  it was true even aunt marys enemies and she had some could not accuse her of the weakness of flattery so mrs hanbury smiled and dropped the subject     chapter iv of temperament  we have the word of mr cyrus meeker that honora did not have to learn to dance the art came to her naturally of mr cyrus meeker whose mustaches at the age of five and sixty are waxed as tight as ever and whose little legs today are as nimble as of yore he has a memory like mr gladstones and can give you a social history of the city that is well worth your time and attention he will tell you how for instance he was kicked by the august feet of mr george hanbury on the occasion of his first lesson to that distinguished young gentleman and how although mr meekers shins were sore he pleaded nobly for mr george who was sent home in the carriage by himselfa punishment by the way which mr george desired above all things  this celebrated incident occurred in the new ballroom at the top of the new house of young mrs hayden where the meetings of the dancing class were held weekly today the soot like the ashes of vesuvius spouting from ten thousand softcoal craters has buried that house and the whole district fathoms deep in social obscurity and beautiful mrs hayden what has become of her and lucy hayden that dolllike darling of the gods  all this belongs however to another history which may some day be written this one is honoras and must be got on with for it is to be a chronicle of lightning changes happy we if we can follow honora and we must be prepared to make many friends and drop them in the process  shortly after mrs hayden had built that palatial house which had a high fence around its grounds and a driveway leading to a portecochere and had given her initial ball the dancing class began it was on a blue afternoon in late november that aunt mary and honora with cousin eleanor and the two girls and george sulking in a corner of the carriage were driven through the gates behind bias and the fat horses of the hanburys  honora has a vivid remembrance of the impression the house made on her with its polished floors and spacious rooms filled with a new and mysterious and altogether inspiring fashion of things mrs hayden represented the outposts in the days of richardson and davenporthad honora but known it this great house was all so different from anything she and many others in the city had ever seen and she stood gazing into the drawing room with its curtains and decorously drawn shades in a rapture which her aunt and cousins were far from guessing  come honora said her aunt whats the matter dear  how could she explain to aunt mary that the sight of beautiful things gave her a sort of painwhen she did not yet know it herself there was the massive stairway for instance which they ascended softly lighted by a great leaded window of stained glass on the first landing and the spacious bedrooms with their shining brass beds and lace spreads another innovation which honora resolved to adopt when she married and at last far above all its deepset windows looking out above the trees towards the park a mile to the westward the ballroomthe ballroom with its mirrors and high chandeliers and chairs of gilt and blue set against the walls all of which made no impression whatever upon george and mary and edith but gave honora a thrill no wonder that she learned to dance quickly under such an inspiration  and how pretty mrs hayden looked as she came forward to greet them and kissed honora she had been virginia grey and scarce had had a gown to her back when she had married the elderly duncan hayden who had built her this house and presented her with a checkbooka checkbook which virginia believed to be like the widows cruse of oilunfailing alas those days of picnics and balls of dinners at that recent innovation the club of theatreparties and excursions to baseball games between the young men in mrs haydens train and all young men were who played at harvard or yale or princeton those days were too carefree to have endured  aunt mary asked honora when they were home again in the lamplight of the little sittingroom why was it that mr meeker was so polite to cousin eleanor and asked her about my dancing instead of you  aunt mary smiled  because honora she said because i am a person of no importance in mr meekers eyes  if i were a man cried honora fiercely i should never rest until i had made enough money to make mr meeker wriggle  honora come here said her aunt gazing in troubled surprise at the tense little figure by the mantel i dont know what could have put such things into your head my child money isnt everything in times of real trouble it cannot save one  but it can save one from humiliation exclaimed honora unexpectedly another sign of a peculiar precociousness at fourteen with which aunt mary was finding herself unable to cope i would rather be killed than humiliated by mr meeker  whereupon she flew out of the room and upstairs where old catherine in dismay found her sobbing a little later  poor aunt mary few people guessed the spirit which was bound up in her aching to extend its sympathy and not knowing how save by an unswerving and undemonstrative devotion her words of comfort were as few as her silent deeds were many  but honora continued to go to the dancing class where she treated mr meeker with a hauteur that astonished him amused virginia hayden and perplexed cousin eleanor mr meekers cringing soul responded and in a month honora was the leading spirit of the class led the marches and was pointed out by the little dancing master as all that a lady should be in deportment and bearing  this treatment which succeeded so well in mr meekers case honora had previously applied to others of his sex like most people with a future she began young of late for instance mr george hanbury had shown a tendency to regard her as his personal property for george had a highhanded way with himboys being an enigma to his mother even in those days he had a bullet head and a red face and square shoulders and was rather undersized for his agewhich was honoras  needless to say george did not approve of the dancing class and let it be known both by words and deeds that he was there under protest nor did he regard with favour honoras triumphal progress but sat in a corner with several congenial spirits whose feelings ranged from scorn to despair commenting in loud whispers upon those of his sex to whom the terpsichorean art came more naturally upon one algernon cartwright for example whose striking likeness to the van dyck portrait of a young king had been more than once commented upon by his elders and whose velveteen suits enhanced the resemblance algernon by the way was the favourite male pupil of mr meeker and on occasions algernon and honora were called upon to give exhibitions for the others the sight of which filled george with contemptuous rage algernon danced altogether too much with honoraso george informed his cousin  the simple result of georges protests was to make honora dance with algernon the more evincing even at this period of her career a commendable determination to resent dictation george should have lived in the middle ages when the spirit of modern american womanhood was as yet unborn once he contrived by main force to drag her out into the hall  george she said perhaps if youd let me alone perhaps id like you better  perhaps he retorted fiercely if you wouldnt make a fool of yourself with those mothers darlings id like you better  george said honora learn to dance  never he cried but she was gone while hovering around the door he heard mrs haydens voice  unless i am tremendously mistaken my dear that lady was remarking to mrs dwyer whose daughter emilys future millions were powerless to compel youths of fourteen to dance with her although she is now happily married unless i am mistaken honora will have a career the child will be a raving beauty and she has to perfection the art of managing men  as her father had the art of managing women said mrs dwyer dear me how well i remember randolph i would have followed him toto cheyenne  mrs hayden laughed he never would have gone to cheyenne i imagine she said  he never looked at me and i have reason to be profoundly thankful for it said mrs dwyer  virginia hayden bit her lip she remembered a saying of mrs brice blessed are the ugly for they shall not be tempted  they say that poor tom leffingwell has not yet finished paying his debts continued mrs dwyer although his uncle eleanor hanburys father cancelled what randolph had had from him in his will it was twentyfive thousand dollars james hanbury you remember had him appointed consul at nice randolph leffingwell gave the impression of conferring a favour when he borrowed money i cannot understand why he married that penniless and emptyheaded beauty  perhaps said mrs hayden it was because of his ability to borrow money that he felt he could afford to  the eyes of the two ladies unconsciously followed honora about the room  i never knew a better or a more honest woman than mary leffingwell but i tremble for her she is utterly incapable of managing that child if honora is a complicated mechanism now what will she be at twenty she has elements in her which poor mary never dreamed of i overheard her with emily and she talks like a grownup person  mrs haydens dimples deepened  better than some grownup women she said she sat in my room while i dressed the other afternoon mrs leffingwell had sent her with a note about that french governess and by the way she speaks french as though she had lived in paris  little mrs dwyer raised her hands in protest  it doesnt seem natural somehow it doesnt seem exactlymoral my dear  nonsense said mrs hayden mrs leffingwell is only giving the child the advantages which her companions haveemily has french hasnt she  but emily cant speak itthat way said mrs dwyer i dont blame mary leffingwell she thinks she is doing her duty but it has always seemed to me that honora was one of those children who would better have been brought up on bread and butter and jam  honora would only have eaten the jam said mrs hayden but i love her  i too am fond of the child but i tremble for her i am afraid she has that terrible thing which is called temperament  george hanbury made a second heroic rush and dragged honora out once more  what is this disease youve got he demanded  disease she cried i havent any disease  mrs dwyer says you have temperament and that it is a terrible thing  honora stopped him in a corner  because people like mrs dwyer havent got it she declared with a warmth which george found inexplicable  what is it he demanded  youll never know either george she answered its soul  soul he repeated i have one and its immortal he added promptly  in the summer that season of desolation for honora when george hanbury and algernon cartwright and other young gentlemen were at the seashore learning to sail boats and to play tennis peter erwin came to his own nearly every evening after dinner while the light was still lingering under the shade trees of the street and aunt mary still placidly sewing in the wicker chair on the lawn and uncle tom making the tour of flowers with his watering pot the gate would slam and peters tall form appear  it never occurred to honora that had it not been for peter those evenings would have been even less bearable than they were to sit indoors with a light and read in a st louis midsummer was not to be thought of peter played backgammon with her on the front steps and later onchess sometimes they went for a walk as far as grand avenue and sometimes when honora grew oldershe was permitted to go with him to uhrigs cave those were memorable occasions indeed  what saint louisan of the last generation does not remember uhrigs cave nor look without regret upon the thing which has replaced it called a coliseum the very name uhrigs cave sent a shiver of delight down ones spine and many were the conjectures one made as to what might be enclosed in that half a block of impassible brick wall over which the great trees stretched their branches honora from comparative infancy had her own theory which so possessed the mind of edith hanbury that she would not look at the wall when they passed in the carriage it was a still and sombre place by day and sometimes if you listened you could hear the whisperings of the forty thieves on the other side of the wall but no one had ever dared to cry open sesame at the great wooden gates  at night in the warm season when well brought up children were at home or at the seashore strange things were said to happen at uhrigs cave  honora was a tall slip of a girl of sixteen before it was given her to know these mysteries and the ali baba theory a thing of the past other theories had replaced it nevertheless she clung tightly to peters arm as they walked down locust street and came in sight of the wall above it and under the big trees shone a thousand glittering lights there was a crowd at the gate and instead of saying open sesame peter slipped two bright fiftycent pieces to the redfaced german ticketman and in they went  first and most astounding of disillusions of passing childhood it was not a cave at all and yet the word disillusion does not apply it was after all the most enchanting and exciting of spots to make ones eye shine and ones heart beat under the trees were hundreds of tables surrounded by hovering ministering angels in white and if you were german they brought you beer if american icecream beyond the tables was a stage with footlights already set and orchestra tuning up and a curtain on which was represented a gentleman making decorous love to a lady beside a fountain as in a dream honora followed peter to a table and he handed her a programme  oh peter she cried its going to be pinafore  honoras eyes shone like stars and elderly people at the neighbouring tables turned more than once to smile at her that evening and peter turned more than once and smiled too but honora did not consider peter he was merely providence in one of many disguises and providence is accepted by his beneficiaries as a matter of fact  the rapture of a young lady of temperament is a difficult thing to picture the bird may feel it as he soars on a bright august morning high above amber cliffs jutting out into indigo seas the novelist may feel it when the four walls of his room magically disappear and the profound secrets of the universe are on the point of revealing themselves honora gazed and listened and lost herself she was no longer in uhrigs cave but in the great world her soul aquiver with harmonies  pinafore although a comic opera held something tragic for honora and opened the floodgates to dizzy sensations which she did not understand how little peter who drummed on the table to the tune of         give three cheers and one cheer more         for the hearty captain of the pinafore  imagined what was going on beside him there were two factors in his pleasure he liked the music and he enjoyed the delight of honora  what is peter let us cease looking at him through honoras eyes and taking him like daily bread to be eaten and not thought about from one point of view he is twentynine and elderly with a sense of humour unsuspected by young persons of temperament strive as we will we have only been able to see him in his role of providence or of the piper has he no existence no purpose in life outside of that perpetual gentleman in waiting if so honora has never considered it  after the finale had been sung and the curtain dropped for the last time honora sighed and walked out of the garden as one in a trance once in a while as he found a way for them through the crowd peter glanced down at her and something like a smile tugged at the corners of a decidedly masculine mouth and lit up his eyes suddenly at locust street under the lamp she stopped and surveyed him she saw a very real very human individual clad in a dark nondescript suit of clothes which had been bought readymade and plainly without the bestowal of much thought on fifth street the fact that they were a comparative fit was in itself a tribute to the enterprise of the excelsior clothing company for honoras observation that he was too long one way had been just he was too tall his shoulders were too high his nose too prominent his eyes too deepset and he wore a straw hat with the brim turned up  to honora his appearance was as familiar as the picture of the pope which had always stood on catherines bureau but tonight by grace of some added power of vision she saw him with new and critical eyes she was surprised to discover that he was possessed of a quality with which she had never associated himyouth not to put it too stronglycomparative youth  peter she demanded why do you dress like that  like what he said  honora seized the lapel of his coat  like that she repeated do you know if you wore different clothes you might almost be distinguished looking dont laugh i think its horrid of you always to laugh when i tell you things for your own good  it was the idea of being almost distinguished looking thatthat gave me a shock he assured her repentantly  you should dress on a different principle she insisted  peter appeared dazed  i couldnt do that he said  why not  becausebecause i dont dress on any principle now  yes you do said honora firmly you dress on the principle of the wild beasts and fishes its all in our natural history at miss farmers the crab is the colour of the seaweed and the deer of the thicket its a device of nature for the protection of weak things  peter drew himself up proudly  i have always understood miss leffingwell that the king of beasts was somewhere near the shade of the jungle  honora laughed in spite of this apparent refutation of her theory of his apparel and shook her head  do be serious peter youd make much more of an impression on people if you wore clothes that hadwell a little more distinction  whats the use of making an impression if you cant follow it up he said  you can she declared i never thought of it until tonight but you must have a great deal in you to have risen all the way from an errand boy in the bank to a lawyer  look out he cautioned her i shall become insupportably conceited  a little more conceit wouldnt hurt you said honora critically youll forgive me peter if i tell you from time to time what i think its for your own good  i try to realize that replied peter humbly how do you wish me to dresslike mr rossiter  the picture evoked of peter arrayed like mr harland rossiter who had sent flowers to two generations and was preparing to send more to a third was irresistible every city hamlet and village has its harland rossiter he need not be explained but honora soon became grave again  no but you ought to dress as though you were somebody and different from the ordinary man on the street  but im not objected peter  oh cried honora dont you want to be i cant understand any man not wanting to be if i were a man i wouldnt stay here a day longer than i had to  peter was silent as they went in at the gate and opened the door for on this festive occasion they were provided with a latchkey he turned up the light in the hall to behold a transformation quite as wonderful as any contained in the arabian nights or keightleys fairy mythology this was not the honora with whom he had left the house scarce three hours before the cambric dress to be sure was still no longer than the tops of her ankles and the hair still hung in a heavy braid down her back these were positively all that remained of the original honora and the change had occurred in the incredibly brief space required for the production of the opera pinafore this honora was a woman in a strange and disturbing state of exaltation whose eyes beheld a vision and peter although he had been the subject of her conversation well knew that he was not included in the vision he smiled a little as he looked at her it is becoming apparent that he is one of those unfortunate unimaginative beings incapable of great illusions  youre not going she exclaimed  he glanced significantly at the hall clock  why its long after bedtime honora  i dont want to go to bed i feel like talking she declared come lets sit on the steps awhile if you go home i shant go to sleep for hours peter  and what would aunt mary say to me he inquired  oh she wouldnt care she wouldnt even know it  he shook his head still smiling  id never be allowed to take you to uhrigs cave or anywhere else again he replied ill come tomorrow evening and you can talk to me then  i shant feel like it then she said in a tone that implied his opportunity was now or never but seeing him still obdurate with startling suddenness she flung her arms mound his necka method which at times had succeeded marvellouslyand pleaded coaxingly only a quarter of an hour peter ive got so many things to say and i know i shall forget them by tomorrow  it was a night of wonders to her astonishment the hitherto pliant peter who only existed in order to do her will became transformed into a brusque masculine creature which she did not recognize with a movement that was almost rough he released himself and fled calling back a good night to her out of the darkness he did not even wait to assist her in the process of locking up honora profoundly puzzled stood for a while in the doorway gazing out into the night when at length she turned she had forgotten him entirely  it was true that she did not sleep for hours and on awaking the next morning another phenomenon awaited her the little house under the hill was immeasurably shrunken poor aunt mary who did not understand that a performance of pinafore could give birth to the unfulfilled longings which result in the creation of high things spoke to uncle tom a week later concerning an astonishing and apparently abnormal access of industry  shes been reading all day long tom or else shut up in her room where catherine tells me she is writing im afraid eleanor hanbury is right when she says i dont understand the child and yet she is the same to me as though she were my own  it was true that honora was writing and that the door was shut and that she did not feel the heat in one of the bookcases she had chanced upon that immortal biography of dr johnson and upon the letters of another prodigy of her own sex madame darblay whose romantic debut as an authoress was inspiration in itself honora actually quivered when she read of dr johnsons first conversation with miss burney to write a book of the existence of which even ones own family did not know to publish it under a nom de plume and to awake one day to fetes and fame would be indeed to live  unfortunately honoras novel no longer exists or the world might have discovered a second evelina a regard for truth compels the statement that it was never finished but what rapture while the fever lasted merely to take up the pen was to pass magically through marble portals into the great world itself  the sir charles grandison of this novel was needless to say not peter erwin he was none other than mr randolph leffingwell under a very thin disguise     chapter v in which providence beeps faith  two more years have gone by limping in the summer and flying in the winter two more years of conquests for our heroine appears to be one of the daughters of helen born to make trouble for warriors and othersand even for innocent bystanders like peter erwin peter was debarred from entering those brilliant lists in which apparel played so great a part george hanbury guy rossiter algernon cartwright eliphalet hopper dwyerfamiliarly known as hoppyand other young gentlemen whose names are now but memories each had his brief day of triumph arrayed like solomon in wonderful clothes from the mysterious and luxurious east they returned at christmastide and easter from college to break lances over honora let us say it boldlyshe was like that she had the worldold knack of sowing discord and despair in the souls of young men she wasas those who had known that fascinating gentleman were not slow to remarkrandolph leffingwell over again  during the festival seasons uncle tom averred they wore out the latch on the front gate if their families possessed horses to spare they took honora driving in forest park they escorted her to those anomalous dances peculiar to their innocent age which are neither childrens parties nor fullfledged balls their presents while of no intrinsic valueas one young gentleman said in a presentation speechhad an enormous if shy significance  what a beautiful ring you are wearing honora uncle tom remarked slyly one april morning at breakfast let me see it  honora blushed and hid her hand under the tablecloth  and the ringsuffice it to say that her little finger was exactly insertable in a tencent piece from which everything had been removed but the milling removed with infinite loving patience by mr rossiter and at the expense of much history and philosophy and other less important things in his college bedroom at new haven honora wore it for a whole week a triumph indeed for mr rossiter when it was placed in a box in honoras bedroom which contained other giftsnot all from himand many letters in the writing of which learning had likewise suffered the immediate cause of the putting away of this ring was said to be the renowned clinton howe who was on the harvard football eleven and who visited mr george hanbury that easter fortunate indeed the tailor who was called upon to practise his art on an adonis like mr howe and it was remarked that he scarcely left honoras side at the garden party and dance which mrs dwyer gave in honour of the returning heroes on the monday of easter week  this festival on which we should like to linger but cannot took place at the new dwyer residence for six months the victorian mansion opposite uncle toms house had been sightless with blue blinds drawn down inside the plate glass windows and the yellow stone itself was not so yellow as it once had been but had now the appearance of soiled manilla wrapping paper with black streaks here and there where the soot had run the new dwyer house was of grey stone georgian and palatial with a picturegallery twice the size of the old one a magnificent and fitting pioneer in a new city of palaces  westward the star of empireaway from the smoke the dwyer mansion with its lawns and gardens and heavily balustraded terrace faced the park that stretched away like a private estate to the south and west that same park with its huge trees and black forests that was ultima thule in honoras childhood in the open places there had been real farms and hayricks which she used to slide down with peter while uncle tom looked for wild flowers in the fields it had been separated from the city in those days by an endless country road like a via claudia stretching towards mysterious germanian forests and it was deemed a feat for peter to ride thither on his bigwheeled bicycle forest park was the country and all that the country represented in honoras childhood for uncle tom on a summers day to hire a surrey at braintrees livery stable and drive thither was liketo what shall that bliss be compared in these days when we go to europe with indifference  and now lindell roadthe via claudia of long agohad become lindell boulevard with granitoid sidewalks and the dreary fields through which it had formerly run were bristling with new houses in no sense victorian and which were the first stirrings of a national sense of the artistic the old horsecars with the clanging chains had disappeared and you could take an electric to within a block of the imposing grille that surrounded the dwyer grounds westward the star  fading fast was the glory of that bright new district on top of the second hill from the river where uncle tom was a pioneer soot had killed the pear trees the apricots behind the lattice fence had withered away asphalt and soot were slowly sapping the vitality of the maples on the sidewalk and sometimes uncle toms roses looked as though they might advantageously be given a coat of paint like those in alice in wonderland honora should have lived in the dwyers mansionpeople who are capable of judging said so people who saw her at the garden party said she had the air of belonging in such surroundings much more than emily whom even budding womanhood had not made beautiful and eliphalet hopper dwyer if his actions meant anything would have welcomed her to that house or built her another twice as fine had she deigned to give him the least encouragement  cinderella this was what she facetiously called herself one july morning of that summer she was eighteen  cinderella in more senses than one for never had the city seemed more dirty or more deserted or indeed more stifling winter and its festivities were a dream laid away in moth balls surely cinderellas life had held no greater contrasts to this day the odour of matting brings back to honora the sense of closed shutters of a stifling south wind stirring their slats at noonday the vision of aunt mary cool and placid in a cambric sacque sewing by the window in the upper hall and the sound of fruit venders crying in the street or of ragmen in the alleyrags bottles old iron what memories of endless burning lonely days come rushing back with those words  when the sun had sufficiently heated the bricks of the surrounding houses in order that he might not be forgotten during the night he slowly departed if honora took her book under the maple tree in the yard she was confronted with that hideous wooden sign to let on the dwyers iron fence opposite and the grass behind it was unkempt and overgrown with weeds aunt mary took an unceasing and to honoras mind morbid interest in the future of that house  i suppose it will be a boardinghouse she would say its much too large for poor people to rent and only poor people are coming into this district now  oh aunt mary  well my dear why should we complain we are poor and it is appropriate that we should live among the poor sometimes i think it is a pity that you should have been thrown all your life with rich people my child i am afraid it has made you discontented it is no disgrace to be poor we ought to be thankful that we have everything we need  honora put down her sewing for she had learned to sewaunt mary had insisted upon that as well as french she laid her hand upon her aunts  i am thankful she said and her aunt little guessed the intensity of the emotion she was seeking to control or imagined the hidden fires but sometimessometimes i try to forget that we are poor perhapssome day we shall not be  it seemed to honora that aunt mary derived a real pleasure from the contradiction of this hope she shook her head vigorously  we shall always be my child your uncle tom is getting old and he has always been too honest to make a great deal of money and besides she added he has not that kind of ability  uncle tom might be getting old but he seemed to honora to be of the same age as in her childhood some people never grow old and uncle tom was one of these fifteen years before he had been promoted to be the cashier of the prairie bank and he was the cashier today he had the same quiet smile the same quiet humour the same calm acceptance of life he seemed to bear no grudge even against that ever advancing enemy the soot which made it increasingly difficult for him to raise his flowers those which would still grow he washed tenderly night and morning with his wateringpot the greatest wonders are not at the ends of the earth but near us it was to take many years for our heroine to realize this  strong faith alone could have withstood the continued contact with such a determined fatalism as aunt marys and yet it is interesting to note that honoras belief in her providence never wavered a prince was to come who was to bear her away from the ragmen and the boardinghouses and the soot and incidentally and in spite of herself aunt mary was to come too and uncle tom and sometimes when she sat reading of an evening under the maple her book would fall to her lap and the advent of this personage become so real a thing that she bounded when the gate slammedto find that it was only peter  it was preposterous of course that peter should be a prince in disguise peter who despite her efforts to teach him distinction in dress insisted upon wearing the same kind of clothes a mild kind of providence peter whose modest functions were not unlike those of the third horse which used to be hitched on to the street car at the foot of the seventeenthstreet hill it was peters task to help pull honora through the interminable summers uhrigs cave was an old story now mysteries were no longer to be expected in st louis there was a great panoramaor something to that effectin the wilderness at the end of one of the new electric lines where they sometimes went to behold the white squadron of the new united states navy engaged in battle with mimic forts on a mimic sea on the very site where the country place of madame clement had been the mimic sea surrounded by wooden stands filled with common people eating peanuts and popcorn was none other than madame clements pond which honora remembered as a spot of enchantment and they went out in the open cars with these same people who stared at honora as though she had got in by mistake but always politely gave her a seat and peter thanked them sometimes he fell into conversations with them and it was noticeable that they nearly always shook hands with him at parting honora did not approve of this familiarity  but they may be clients some day he argueda frivolous answer to which she never deigned to reply  just as one used to take for granted that third horse which pulled the car uphill so peter was taken for granted he might have been on the highroad to a renown like that of chief justice marshall and honora had been none the wiser  well peter said uncle tom at dinner one evening of that memorable summer when aunt mary was helping the blackberries and incidentally deploring that she did not live in the country because of the cream one got there i saw judge brice in the bank today and he tells me you covered yourself with glory in that iron foundry suit  the judge must have his little joke mr leffingwell replied peter but he reddened nevertheless  honora thought winning an iron foundry suit a strange way to cover ones self with glory it was not at any rate her idea of glory what were lawyers for if not to win suits and peter was a lawyer  in five years said uncle tom the firm will be brice and erwin you mark my words and by that time he added with a twinkle in his eye youll be ready to marry honora  tom reproved aunt mary gently you oughtnt to say such things  this time there was no doubt about peters blush he fairly burned honora looked at him and laughed  peter is meant for an old bachelor she said  if he remains a bachelor said uncle tom hell be the greatest waste of good material i know of and if you succeed in getting him honora youll be the luckiest young woman of my acquaintance  tom said aunt mary it was all very well to talk that way when honora was a child but nowshe may not wish to marry peter and peter may not wish to marry her  even peter joined in the laughter at this literal and characteristic statement of the case  its more than likely said honora wickedly he hasnt kissed me for two years  why peter said uncle tom you act as though it were warm tonight it was only seventy when we came in to dinner  take me out to the park commanded honora  tom said aunt mary as she stood on the step and watched them cross the street i wish the child would marry him not now of course she added hastilya little frightened by her own admission but later sometimes i worry over her future she needs a strong and sensible man i dont understand honora i never did i always told you so sometimes i think she may be capable of doing something foolish likelike randolph  uncle tom patted his wife on the shoulder  dont borrow trouble mary he said smiling a little the child is only full of spirits but she has a good heart it is only human that she should want things that we cannot give her  i wish said aunt mary that she were not quite so goodlooking  uncle tom laughed you neednt tell me youre not proud of it he declared  and i have given her she continued a taste for dress  i think my dear said her husband that there were others who contributed to that  it was my own vanity i should have combated the tendency in her said aunt mary  if you had dressed honora in calico you could not have changed her replied uncle tom with conviction  in the meantime honora and peter had mounted the electric car and were speeding westward they had a seat to themselves the very first one on the gripthat survival of the days of cable cars honoras eyes brightened as she held on to her hat and the stray wisps of hair about her neck stirred in the breeze  oh i wish we would never stop until we came to the pacific ocean she exclaimed  would you be content to stop then he asked he had a trick of looking downward with a quizzical expression in his dark grey eyes  no said honora i should want to go on and see everything in the world worth seeing sometimes i feel positively as though i should die if i had to stay here in st louis  you probably would dieeventually said peter  honora was justifiably irritated  i could shake you peter  he laughed  im afraid it wouldnt do any good he answered  if i were a man she proclaimed i shouldnt stay here id go to new yorkid be somebodyid make a national reputation for myself  i believe you would said peter sadly but with a glance of admiration  thats the worst of being a womanwe have to sit still until something happens to us  what would you like to happen he asked curiously and there was a note in his voice which she intent upon her thoughts did not remark  oh i dont know she said anythinganything to get out of this rut and be something in the world its dreadful to feel that one has power and not be able to use it  the car stopped at the terminal thanks to the early hour of aunt marys dinner the western sky was still aglow with the sunset over the forests as they walked past the closed grille of the dwyer mansion into the park children rolled on the grass while mothers and fathers tired out from the heat and labour of a city day sat on the benches peter stooped down and lifted a small boy painfully thin who had fallen weeping on the gravel walk he took his handkerchief and wiped the scratch on the childs forehead  there there he said smiling its all right now we must expect a few tumbles  the child looked at him and suddenly smiled through his tears  the father appeared a redheaded irishman  thank you mr erwin im sure its very kind of you sir to bother with him he said gratefully its that thin he is with the heat i take him out for a bit of country air  why tim its you is it said peter hes the janitor of our building down town he explained to honora who had remained a silent witness to this simple scene she had been in spite of herself impressed by it and by the mingled respect and affection in the janitors manner towards peter it was so with every one to whom he spoke they walked on in silence for a few moments into a path leading to a lake which had stolen the flaming greengold of the sky  i suppose said honora slowly it would be better for me to wish to be contented where i am as you are but its no use trying i cant  peter was not a preacher  oh he said there are lots of things i want  what demanded honora interested for she had never conceived of him as having any desires whatever  i want a house like mr dwyers he declared pointing at the distant imposing roof line against the fading eastern sky  honora laughed the idea of peter wishing such a house was indeed ridiculous then she became grave again  there are times when you seem to forget that i have at last grown up peter you never will talk over serious things with me  what are serious things asked peter  well said honora vaguely ambitions and what one is going to make of themselves in life and then you make fun of me by saying you want mr dwyers house she laughed again i cant imagine you in that house  why not he asked stopping beside the pond and thrusting his hands in his pockets he looked very solemn but she knew he was smiling inwardly  whybecause i cant she said and hesitated the question had forced her to think about peter i cant imagine you living all alone in all that luxury it isnt like you  why i all alone asked peter  dontdont be ridiculous she said you wouldnt build a house like that even if you were twice as rich as mr dwyer you know you wouldnt and youre not the marrying kind she added with the superior knowledge of eighteen  im waiting for you honora he announced  you know i love you peterso she tempered her reply for honoras feelings were tender what man even peter would not have married her if he could of course he was in earnest despite his bantering tone but i never couldmarry you  not even if i were to offer you a house like mr dwyers he said a remark which betrayedalthough not to herhis knowledge of certain earthly strains in his goddess  the colours faded from the water and it blackened  as they walked on side by side in the twilight a consciousness of repressed masculine force of reserve power which she had never before felt about peter erwin invaded her and she was seized with a strange uneasiness ridiculous was the thought which she lost no time in rejecting that pointed out the true road to happiness in marrying such a man as he in the gathering darkness she slipped her hand through his arm  i wish i could marry you peter she said  he was fain to take what comfort he could from this expression of goodwill if he was not the prince charming of her dreams she would have liked him to be a little reflection on his part ought to have shown him the absurdity of the prince charming having been there all the time and in readymade clothes and he too may have had dreams we are not concerned with them           if we listen to the still small voice of realism intense longing is always followed by disappointment nothing should have happened that summer and providence should not have come disguised as the postman it was a sultry day in early septemberwhich is to say that it was comparatively coola blue day with occasional great drops of rain spattering on the brick walk and honora was reclining on the hall sofa reading about mr ibbetson and his duchess when she perceived the postmans grey uniform and smiling face on the far side of the screen door he greeted her cordially and gave her a single letter for aunt mary and she carried it unsuspectingly upstairs  its from cousin eleanor honora volunteered  aunt mary laid down her sewing smoothed the ruffles of her sacque adjusted her spectacles opened the envelope and began to read presently the letter fell to her lap and she wiped her glasses and glanced at honora who was deep in her book once more and in honoras brain as she read was ringing the refrain of the prisoner              orleans beaugency              notre dame de clery                vendome vendome              quel chagrin quel ennui              de compter toute la nuit                les heures les heures  the verse appealed to honora strangely just as it had appealed to ibbetson was she not too a prisoner and how often during the summer days and nights had she listened to the chimes of the pilgrim church near by              one two three four              one two three four  after uncle tom had watered his flowers that evening aunt mary followed him upstairs and locked the door of their room behind her silently she put the letter in his hand here is one paragraph of it     i have never asked to take the child from you in the summer    because she has always been in perfect health and i know how lonely    you would have been without her my dear mary but it seems to me    that a winter at sutcliffe with my girls would do her a world of    good just now i need not point out to you that honora is to say    the least remarkably good looking and that she has developed very    rapidly and she has in spite of the strict training you have    given her certain ideas and ambitions which seem to me i am sorry    to say more or less prevalent among young american women these    days you know it is only because i love her that i am so frank    miss turners influence will in my opinion do much to counteract    these tendencies  uncle tom folded the letter and handed it back to his wife  i feel that we ought not to refuse tom and i am afraid eleanor is right  well mary weve had her for seventeen years we ought to be willing to spare her forhow many months  nine said aunt mary promptly she had counted them and eleanor says she will be home for two weeks at christmas seventeen years it seems only yesterday when we brought her home tom it was just about this time of day and she was asleep in your arms and bridget opened the door for us aunt mary looked out of the window and do you remember how she used to play under the maple there with her dolls  uncle tom produced a very large handkerchief and blew his nose  there there mary he said nine months and two weeks out at christmas nine months in eighteen years  i suppose we ought to be very thankful said aunt mary but tom the time is coming soon  tut tut exclaimed uncle tom he turned and his eyes beheld a work of art nothing less than a porcelain plate hung in brackets on the wall decorated by honora at the age of ten with wild roses and presented with much ceremony on an anniversary morning he pretended not to notice it but aunt marys eyes were too quick she seized a photograph on her bureau a photograph of honora in a little white frock with a red sash  it was the year that was taken tom  he nodded the scene at the breakfast table came back to him and the sight of catherine standing respectfully in the hall and of honora in the red sash making the courtesy the old woman had taught her  honora recalled afterwards that uncle tom joked even more than usual that evening at dinner but it was aunt mary who asked her at length how she would like to go to boardingschool such was the matteroffact manner in which the portentous news was announced  to boardingschool aunt mary  her aunt poured out her uncles afterdinner coffee  ive spilled some my dear get another saucer for your uncle  honora went mechanically to the china closet her heart thumping she did not stop to reflect that it was the rarest of occurrences for aunt mary to spill the coffee  your cousin eleanor has invited you to go this winter with edith and mary to sutcliffe  sutcliffe no need to tell honora what sutcliffe washer cousins had talked of little else during the past winter and shown if the truth be told just a little commiseration for honora sutcliffe was not only a famous girls school sutcliffe was the worldthat world which since her earliest remembrances she had been longing to see and know in a desperate attempt to realize what had happened to her she found herself staring hard at the open china closet at aunt marys best gold dinner set resting on the pink lace paper that had been changed only last week that dinner set somehow was always an augury of festivalwhen on the rare occasions aunt mary entertained the little dining room was transformed by it and the leffingwell silver into a glorified and altogether unrecognizable state in which any miracle seemed possible  honora pushed back her chair  her lips were parted  oh aunt mary is it really true that i am going she said  why said uncle tom what zeal for learning  my dear said aunt mary who you may be sure knew all about that school before cousin eleanors letter came miss turner insists upon hard work and the discipline is very strict  no young men added uncle tom  that declared aunt mary is certainly an advantage  and no chocolate cake and bed at ten oclock said uncle tom  honora dazed only half heard them she laughed at uncle tom because she always had but tears were shining in her eyes young men and chocolate cake what were these privations compared to that magic word change suddenly she rose and flung her arms about uncle toms neck and kissed his rough cheek and then embraced aunt mary they would be lonely  aunt mary i cant bear to leave youbut i do so want to go and it wont be for longwill it only until next spring  until next summer i believe replied aunt mary gently june is a summer monthisnt it tom  it will be a summer month without question next year answered uncle tom enigmatically  it has been remarked that that day was sultry and a fine rain was now washing uncle toms flowers for him it was he who had applied that term washing since the era of ultrasoot incredible as it may seem life proceeded as on any other of a thousand rainy nights the lamps were lighted in the sittingroom uncle tom unfolded his gardening periodical and aunt mary her embroidery the gate slammed with its more subdued rainyweather sound  its peter said honora flying downstairs and she caught him astonished as he was folding his umbrella on the step oh peter if you tried until tomorrow morning you never could guess what has happened  he stood for a moment motionless staring at her a tall figure careless of the rain  you are going away he said  how did you guess it she exclaimed in surprise yesto boardingschool to sutcliffe on the hudson with edith and mary arent you glad you look as though you had seen a ghost  do i said peter  dont stand there in the rain commanded honora come into the parlour and ill tell you all about it  he came in she took the umbrella from him and put it in the rack  why dont you congratulate me she demanded  youll never come back said peter  what a horrid thing to say of course i shall come back i shall come back next june and youll be at the station to meet me  andwhat will uncle tom and aunt mary dowithout you  oh said honora i shall miss them dreadfully and i shall miss you peter  very much he asked looking down at her with such a queer expression and his voice too sounded queer he was trying to smile  suddenly honora realized that he was suffering and she felt the pangs of contrition she could not remember the time when she had been away from peter and it was natural that he should be stricken at the news peter who was the complement of all who loved and served her of aunt mary and uncle tom and catherine and who somehow embodied them all peter the eternally dependable  she found it natural that the light should be temporarily removed from his firmament while she should be at boardingschool and yet in the tenderness of her heart she pitied him she put her hands impulsively upon his shoulders as he stood looking at her with that queer expression which he believed to be a smile  peter you dear old thing indeed i shall miss you i dont know what i shall do without you and ill write to you every single week  gently he disengaged her arms they were standing under that which for courtesys sake had always been called the chandelier it was in the centre of the parlour and uncle tom always covered it with holly and mistletoe at christmas  why do you say ill never come back asked honora of course i shall come back and live here all the rest of my life  peter shook his head slowly he had recovered something of his customary quizzical manner  the east is a strange country he said the first thing we know youll be marrying one of those people we read about with more millions than there are cars on the olive street line  honora was a little indignant  i wish you wouldnt talk so peter she said in the first place i shant see any but girls at sutcliffe i could only see you for a few minutes once a week if you were there and in the second place it isnt exactlywelldignified to compare the east and the west the way you do and speak about people who are very rich and live there as though they were different from the people we know here comparisons as shakespeare said are odorous  honora he declared still shaking his head youre a fraud but i cant help loving you  for a long time that night honora lay in bed staring into the darkness and trying to realize what had happened she heard the whistling and the puffing of the trains in the cindercovered valley to the southward but the quality of these sounds had changed they were music now     chapter vi honora has a glimpse of the world  it is simply impossible to give any adequate notion of the industry of the days that followed no sooner was uncle tom out of the house in the morning than anne rory marched into the sittingroom and took command and turned it into a dressmaking establishment anne rory who deserves more than a passing mention one of the institutions of honoras youth who sewed for the first families and knew much more about them than mr meeker the dancingmaster if you enjoyed her confidenceas aunt mary didshe would tell you of her own accord who gave their servants enough to eat and who didnt anne rory was a sort of inquisition all by herself and would have made a valuable chief of police the reputations of certain elderly gentlemen of wealth might have remained to this day intact had it not been for her she had a heavensent knack of discovering peccadilloes anne rory knew the gentlemen by sight and the gentlemen did not know anne rory uncle tom she held to be somewhere in the calendar of the saints  there is not time alas to linger over anne rory or the new histories which she whispered to aunt mary when honora was out of the room at last the eventful day of departure arrived honoras new trunkher firstwas packed by aunt marys own hands the dainty clothes and the dresses folded in tissue paper while old catherine stood sniffing by after dinnersign of a great occasiona carriage came from braintrees livery stable and uncle tom held the horses while the driver carried out the trunk and strapped it on catherine mary ann and bridget all weeping were kissed goodby and off they went through the dusk to the station not the old union depot with its wooden sheds where honora had gone so often to see the hanburys off that grimy gateway to the fairer regions of the earth this new station of brick and stone and glass and tiles would hold an army corps with ease and when they alighted at the carriage entrance a tall figure came forward out of the shadow it was peter and he had a package under his arm peter checked honoras trunk and peter had got the permissionthrough judge bricewhich enabled them all to pass through the grille and down the long walk beside which the train was standing  they entered that hitherto mysterious conveyance a sleepingcar and spoke to old mrs stanley who was going east to see her married daughter and who had gladly agreed to take charge of honora afterwards they stood on the platform but in spite of the valiant efforts of uncle tom and peter conversation was a mockery  honora said aunt mary dont forget that your trunk key is in the little pocket on the left side of your bag  no aunt mary  and your little new testament at the bottom and your lunch is arranged in three packages and dont forget to ask cousin eleanor about the walking shoes and to give her my note  cries reverberated under the great glass dome and trains pulled out with deafening roars honora had a strange feeling as of pressure from within that caused her to take deep breaths of the smoky air she but half heard what was being said to her she wished that the train would go and at the same time she had a sudden surprising and fierce longing to stay she had been able to eat scarcely a mouthful of that festal dinner which bridget had spent the afternoon in preparing comprised wholly of forbidden dishes of her childhood for which bridget and aunt mary were justly famed such is the irony of life visions of one of aunt marys rare lunchparties and of a small girl peeping covetously through a crack in the diningroom door and of the gold china set rose before her but she could not eat  bread and jam and tea at miss turners uncle tom had said and she had tried to smile at him  and now they were standing on the platform and the train might start at any moment  i trust you wont get like the new yorkers honora said aunt mary do you remember how stiff they were tom she was still in the habit of referring to that memorable trip when they had brought honora home and they say now that they hold their heads higher than ever  that said uncle tom gravely is a local disease and comes from staring at the tall buildings  uncle tom  peter presented the parcel under his arm it was a box of candy and very heavy on which much thought had been spent  they are some of the things you like he said when he had returned from putting it in the berth  how good of you peter i shall never be able to eat all that  i hope there is a doctor on the train said uncle tom  yassah answered the black porter who had been listening with evident relish right good doctahdoctah lovring  even aunt mary laughed  peter asked honora cant you get judge brice to send you on to new york this winter on law business then you could come up to sutcliffe to see me  im afraid of miss turner declared peter  oh she wouldnt mind you exclaimed honora i could say you were an uncle it would be almost true and perhaps she would let you take me down to new york for a matinee  and how about my readymade clothes he said looking down at her he had never forgotten that  honora laughed  you dont seem a bit sorry that im going she replied a little breathlessly you know id be glad to see you if you were in rags  all aboard cried the porter grinning sympathetically  honora threw her arms around aunt mary and clung to her how small and frail she was somehow honora had never realized it in all her life before  goodby darling and remember to put on your thick clothes on the cool days and write when you get to new york  then it was uncle toms turn he gave her his usual vigorous hug and kiss  it wont be long until christmas he whispered and was gone helping aunt mary off the train which had begun to move  peter remained a moment  goodby honora ill write to you often and let you know how they are and perhapsyoull send me a letter once in a while  oh peter i will she cried i cant bear to leave youi didnt think it would be so hard  he held out his hand but she ignored it before he realized what had happened to him she had drawn his face to hers kissed it and was pushing him off the train then she watched from the platform the three receding figures in the yellow smoky light until the car slipped out from under the roof into the blackness of the night some faint premonitory divination of what they represented of immutable love in a changing heedless selfish world came to her rocks to which one might cling successful or failing happy or unhappy for unconsciously she thought of them all three as one a human trinity in which her faith had never been betrayed she felt a warm moisture on her cheeks and realized that she was crying with the first real sorrow of her life  she was leaving themfor what honora did not know there had been nothing imperative in cousin eleanors letter she need not have gone if she had not wished something within herself she felt was impelling her and it is curious to relate that in her mind going to school had little or nothing to do with her journey she had the feeling of faring forth into the world and she had known all along that it was destined she should what was the cause of this longing to break the fetters and fly away fetters of love they seemed to her nowand were and the world which she had seen afar filled with sunlit palaces seemed very dark and dreary to her tonight  the ladys asking for you miss said the porter  she made a heroic attempt to talk to mrs stanley but at the sight of peters candy when she opened it she was blinded once more dear peter that box was eloquent with the care with which he had studied her slightest desires and caprices marrons glaces and langtrys and certain chocolates which had received the stamp of her approvaland she could not so much as eat one the porter made the berths and there had been a time when she had asked nothing more of fate than to travel in a sleepingcar far into the night she lay wide awake dryeyed watching the lamplit streets of the little towns they passed or staring at the cornfields and pastures in the darkness thinking of the home she had left perhaps forever and wondering whether they were sleeping there picturing them tomorrow at breakfast without her and uncle tom leaving for the bank aunt mary going through the silent rooms alone and dear old catherine haunting the little chamber where she had slept for seventeen yearsalmost her lifetime a hundred vivid scenes of her childhood came back and familiar objects oddly intruded themselves the red and green lambrequin on the parlour mantela present many years ago from cousin eleanor the whatnot with its funny curly legs and the bare spot near the lock on the door of the cake closet in the dining room  youth however has its recuperative powers the next day the excitement of the journey held her the sight of new cities and a new countryside but when she tried to eat the lunch aunt mary had so carefully put up new memories assailed her and she went with mrs stanley into the dining car the september dusk was made lurid by belching steelfurnaces that reddened the heavens and later when she went to bed sharp air and towering contours told her of the mountains mountains which her greatgrandfather had crossed on horse back with that very family silver in his saddlebags which shone on aunt marys table and thenshe awoke with the light shining in her face and barely had time to dress before the conductor was calling out jersey city  once more the morning and with it new and wonderful sensations that dispelled her sorrows the ferry the olivegreen river rolling in the morning sun alive with dodging hurrying craft each bent upon its destination with an energy relentlessness and selfishness of purpose that fascinated honora each with its shrill protesting whistle seemed to say my business is the most important make way for me and yet through them all towering stately imperturbable a great ocean steamer glided slowly towards the bay by very might and majesty holding her way serene and undisturbed on a nobler errand honora thrilled as she gazed as though at last her dream were coming true and she felt within her the pulse of the worlds artery that irksome sense of spectatorship seemed to fly and she was part and parcel now of the great moving things with sure pinions with which to soar standing rapt upon the forward deck of the ferry she saw herself not an atom but one whose going and coming was a thing of consequence it seemed but a simple step to the deck of that steamer when she too would be travelling to the other side of the world and the journey one of the small incidents of life  the ferry bumped into its slip the windlasses sang loudly as they took up the chains the gates folded back and honora was forced with the crowd along the bridgelike passage to the right suddenly she saw cousin eleanor and the girls awaiting her  honora said edith when the greetings were over and they were all four in the carriage which was making its way slowly across the dirty and irregularly paved open space to a narrow street that opened between two saloons honora you dont mean to say that anne rory made that street dress mother i believe its betterlooking than the one i got at bremers  its very simple said honora  and she looks fairly radiant cried edith seizing her cousins hand its quite wonderful honora nobody would ever guess that you were from the west and that you had spent the whole summer in st louis  cousin eleanor smiled a little as she contemplated honora who sat fascinated gazing out of the window at novel scenes there was a colour in her cheeks and a sparkle in her eyes they had reached madison square madison square on a bright morning in late september seen for the first time by an ambitious young lady who had never been out of st louis the trimly appointed vehicles the highstepping horses the glittering shops the welldressed women and wellgroomed menall had an esprit de corps which she found inspiring on such a morning and amidst such a scene she felt that there was no limit to the possibilities of life  until this year cousin eleanor had been a conservative in the matter of hotels when she had yielded to ediths entreaties to go to one of the new ones hotels indeed that revolutionized transient existence this one on the avenue had a giant in a long blue livery coat who opened their carriage door and a hall in yellow and black onyx and maids and valets after breakfast when honora sat down to write to aunt mary she described the suite of rooms in which they livedthe brass beds the electric night lamps the mahogany french furniture the heavy carpets and even the whitetiled bathroom there was a marvellous arrangement in the walls with which edith was never tired of playing a circular plate covered with legends of every conceivable want from a newspaper to a needle and thread and a scotch whiskey highball  at breakfast more stimulantsof a mental nature of course solomon in all his glory had never broken eggs in such a dining room it had onyx pillars too and gilt furniture and table after table of the whitest napery stretched from one end of it to the other the glass and silver was all of a special pattern and an obsequious waiter handed honora a menu in a silver frame with a handle one side of the menu was in english and the other in french all around them were welldressed wellfed prosperouslooking people talking and laughing in subdued tones as they ate and honora had a strange feeling of being one of them of being as rich and prosperous as they of coming into a longdeferred inheritance  the mad excitement of that day in new york is a faint memory now so much has honora lived since then we descendants of rigid puritans of pioneer tobaccoplanters and frontiersmen take naturally to a luxury such as the world has never seenas our right we have abolished kings in order that as many of us as possible may abide in palaces in one day honora forgot the seventeen years spent in the little house under the hill as though these had never been cousin eleanor with a delightful sense of wrongdoing yielded to the temptation to adorn her and the saleswomen who knew mrs hanbury made indiscreetremarks such a figure and such a face and just enough of height two new gowns were ordered to be tried on at sutcliffe and as many hats and an ulster and heaven knows what else memory fails  in the evening they went to a new comic opera and it is the music of that which brings back the day most vividly to honoras mind  in the morning they took an early train to sutcliffe manors on the hudson it is an historic place first of all after leaving the station you climb through the little town clinging to the hillside and honora was struck by the quaint houses and shops which had been places of barter before the revolution the age of things appealed to her it was a brilliant day at the very end of september the air sharp and here and there a creeper had been struck crimson beyond the town on the slopes were other new sights to stimulate the imagination country housesnot merely houses in the country but mansionsenticingly hidden among great trees in a way to whet honoras curiosity as she pictured to herself the blissful quality of the life which their owners must lead long curving driveways led up to the houses from occasional lodges and once as though to complete the impression a young man and two women superbly mounted came trotting out of one of these driveways talking and laughing gayly honora took a good look at the man he was not handsome but had in fact a distinguished and haunting ugliness the girls were straightfeatured and conventional to the last degree  presently they came to the avenue of elms that led up to the long low buildings of the school  little more will be necessary in the brief account of honoras life at boardingschool than to add an humble word of praise on the excellence of miss turners establishment that lady needless to say did not advertise in the magazines or issue a prospectus parents were more or less in the situation of the candidates who desired the honour and privilege of whitewashing tom sawyers fence if you were a parent and were allowed to confide your daughter to miss turner instead of demanding a prospectus you gave thanks to heaven and spoke about it to your friends  the life of the young ladies of course was regulated on the strictest principles early rising prayers breakfast studies the daily walk rain or shine under the watchful convoy of miss hood the girls in columns of twos tennis on the school court or skating on the school pond cotton mather himself could not have disapproved of the sundays nor of the discourse of the elderly doctor moale which you heard if you were not a presbyterian although the reverend gentleman was distinctly anglican in appearance and manners sometimes honora felt devout and would follow the service with the utmost attention her religion came in waves on the sundays when the heathen prevailed she studied the congregation grew to distinguish the local country families and if the truth must be told watched for several sundays for that ugly yet handsome young man whom she had seen on horseback but he never appeared and presently she forgot him  had there been a prospectus which is ridiculous the great secret of miss turners school could not very well have been mentioned in it the english language it is to be feared is not quite flexible enough to mention this secret with delicacy did honora know it who can say selfrespecting young ladies do not talk about such things and honora was nothing if not selfrespecting                 sutcliffe manors october 15th     dearest aunt mary as i wrote you i continue to miss you and uncle    tom dreadfullyand dear old peter too and cathy and bridget and    mary ann and i hate to get up at seven oclock and miss hood    who takes us out walking and teaches us composition is such a    ridiculously strict old maidyou would laugh at her and the    sundays are terrible miss turner makes us read the bible for a    whole hour in the afternoon and reads to us in the evening and    uncle tom was right when he said we should have nothing but jam and    bread and butter for supper oh yes and cold meat i am always    ravenously hungry i count the days until christmas when i shall    have some really good things to eat again and of course i cannot    wait to see you all     i do not mean to give you the impression that i am not happy here    and i never can be thankful enough to dear cousin eleanor for    sending me some of the girls are most attractive among others    i have become great friends with ethel wing who is tall and blond    and goodlooking and her clothes though simple are beautiful    to hear her imitate miss turner or miss hood or dr moale is almost    as much fun as going to the theatre you must have heard of her    fatherhe is the mr wing who owns all the railroads and other    things and they have a house in newport and another in new york    and a country place and a yacht     i like sarah wycliffe very much she was brought up abroad and we    lead the french class together her father has a house in paris    which they only use for a month or so in the year an hotel as the    french call it and then there is maude capron from philadelphia    whose father is secretary of war i have now to go to my class in    english composition but i will write to you again on saturday                      your loving niece                              honora  the christmas holidays came and went by like mileposts from the window of an express train there was a glee club there were dances and private theatricals in mrs dwyers new house in which it was imperative that honora should take part there was no such thing as getting up for breakfast and once she did not see uncle tom for two whole days he asked her where she was staying it was the first christmas she remembered spending without peter his present appeared but perhaps it was fortunate on the whole that he was in texas trying a case it seemed almost no time at all before she was at the station again clinging to aunt mary but now the separation was not so hard and she had edith and mary for company and george a dignified and responsible sophomore at harvard  owing to the sudden withdrawal from school of little louise simpson the cincinnati girl who had shared her room during the first term honora had a new roommate after the holidays susan holt susan was not beautiful but she was good her nose turned up her hair honora described as a negative colour and she wore it in defiance of all prevailing modes if you looked very hard at susan which few people ever did you saw that she had remarkable blue eyes they were the eyes of a saint she was neither tall nor short and her complexion was not all that it might have been in brief susan was one of those girls who go through a whole term at boardingschool without any particular notice from the more brilliant honoras and ethel wings  in some respects susan was an ideal roommate she read the bible every night and morning and she wrote many letters home her ruling passion next to religion was order and she took it upon herself to arrange honoras bureau drawers it is needless to say that honora accepted these ministrations and that she found susans admiration an entirely natural sentiment susan was selfeffacing and she enjoyed listening to honoras views on all topics  susan like peter was taken for granted she came from somewhere and after school was over she would go somewhere she lived in new york honora knew and beyond that was not curious we never know when we are entertaining an angel unawares one evening early in may when she went up to prepare for supper she found susan sitting in the window reading a letter and on the floor beside her was a photograph honora picked it up it was the picture of a large country house with many chimneys taken across a wide green lawn  susan whats this  susan looked up  oh its silverdale my brother joshua took it  silverdale repeated honora  its our place in the country susan replied the family moved up last week you see the trees are just beginning to bud  honora was silent a moment gazing at the picture  its very beautiful isnt it you never told me about it  didnt i said susan i think of it very often it has always seemed much more like home to me than our house in new york and i love it better than any spot i know  honora gazed at susan who had resumed her reading  and you are going there when school is over  oh yes said susan i can hardly wait suddenly she put down her letter and looked at honora  and you she asked where are you going  i dont know perhapsperhaps i shall go to the sea for a while with my cousins  it was foolish it was wrong but for the life of her honora could not say she was going to spend the long hot summer in st louis the thought of it had haunted her for weeks and sometimes when the other girls were discussing their plans she had left them abruptly and now she was aware that susans blue eyes were fixed upon her and that they had a strange and penetrating quality she had never noticed before a certain tenderness an understanding that made honora redden and turn  i wish said susan slowly that you would come and stay awhile with me your home is so far away and i dont know when i shall see you again  oh susan she murmured its awfully good of you but im afraidi couldnt  she walked to the window and stood looking out for a moment at the budding trees her heart was beating faster and she was strangely uncomfortable  i really dont expect to go to the sea susan she said you see my aunt and uncle are all alone in st louis and i ought to go back to them ifif my father had lived it might have been different he died and my mother when i was little more than a year old  susan was all sympathy she slipped her hand into honoras  where did he live she asked  abroad answered honora he was consul at nice and had a villa there when he died and people said he had an unusually brilliant career before him my aunt and uncle brought me up and my cousin mrs hanbury ediths mother and marys sent me here to school  honora breathed easier after this confession but it was long before sleep came to her that night she wondered what it would be like to visit at a great country house such as silverdale what it would be like to live in one it seemed a strange and cruel piece of irony on the part of the fates that susan instead of honora should have been chosen for such a life susan who would have been quite as happy spending her summers in st louis and taking excursions in the electric cars susan who had never experienced that dreadful vacuumlike feeling who had no ambitious craving to be satisfied mingled with her flushes of affection for susan was a certain queer feeling of contempt of which honora was ashamed  nevertheless in the days that followed a certain metamorphosis seemed to have taken place in susan she was still the same modest selfeffacing helpful roommate but in honoras eyes she had changedhonora could no longer separate her image from the vision of silverdale and if the naked truth must be told it was due to silverdale that susan owes the honour of her first mention in those descriptive letters from sutcliffe which aunt mary has kept to this day  four days later susan had a letter from her mother containing an astonishing discovery there could be no mistakemrs holt had brought honora to this country as a baby  why susan cried honora you must have been the other baby  but you were the beautiful one replied susan generously i have often heard mother tell about it and how every one on the ship noticed you and how hortense cried when your aunt and uncle took you away and to think we have been rooming together all these months and did not know that we were reallyold friends  and honora mother says you must come to silverdale to pay us a visit when school closes she wants to see you i think added susan smiling i think she feels responsible for you she says that you must give me your aunts address and that she will write to her  oh id so like to go susan and i dont think aunt mary would objectfor a little while  honora lost no time in writing the letter asking for permission and it was not until after she had posted it that she felt a sudden sharp regret as she thought of them in their loneliness but the postponement of her homecoming would only be for a fortnight at best and she had seen so little  in due time aunt marys letter arrived there was no mention of loneliness in it only of joy that honora was to have the opportunity to visit such a place as silverdale aunt mary it seems had seen pictures of it long ago in a magazine of the book club in an article concerning one of mrs holts charitiesa model home for indiscreet young women at the end of the year aunt mary added she had bought the number of the magazine because of her natural interest in mrs holt on honoras account honora cried a little over that letter but her determination to go to silverdale was unshaken  june came at last and the end of school the subject of miss turners annual talk was worldliness miss turner saw signs she regretted to say of a lowering in the ideals of american women of a restlessness of a desire for what was a false consideration and recognition for power some of her own pupils alas were not free from this fault ethel wing who was next to honora nudged her and laughed and passed her some of maillards chocolates which she had in her pocket womans place continued miss turner was the home and she hoped they would all make good wives she had done her best to prepare them to be such independence they would find was only relative no one had it completely and she hoped that none of her scholars would ever descend to that base competition to outdo ones neighbours so characteristic of the country today  the friends and even the enemies were kissed goodby with pledges of eternal friendship cousin eleanor hanbury came for edith and mary and hoped honora would enjoy herself at silverdale dear cousin eleanor her heart was large and her charity unpretentious she slipped into honoras fingers as she embraced her a silverpurse with some gold coins in it and bade her not to forget to write home very often  you know what pleasure it will give them my dear she said as she stepped on the train for new york  and i am going home soon cousin eleanor replied honora with a little touch of homesickness in her voice  i know dear said mrs hanbury but there was a peculiar almost wistful expression on her face as she kissed honora again as of one who assents to a fiction in order to humour a child  as the train pulled out ethel wing waved to her from the midst of a group of girls on the wide rear platform of the last car it was mr wings private car and was going to newport  be good honora she cried     volume 2     chapter vii the olympian order  lying back in the chair of the pullman and gazing over the wide hudson shining in the afternoon sun honoras imagination ran riot until the seeming possibilities of life became infinite at every click of the rails she was drawing nearer to that great world of which she had dreamed a world of country houses inhabited by an olympian order to be sure susan who sat reading in the chair behind her was but a humble representative of that orderbut providence sometimes makes use of such instruments the picture of the tall and brilliant ethel wing standing behind the brass rail of the platform of the car was continually recurring to honora as emblematic of ethel in a blue tailormade gown trimmed with buff braid and which fitted her slender figure with military exactness her hair the colour of the yellowest of gold in the manner of its finish seemed somehow to give the impression of that metal and the militant effect of the costume had been heightened by a small colonial cocked hat if the truth be told honora had secretly idealized miss wing and had found her insouciance frankness and tendency to ridicule delightful militantthat was indeed ethels notemilitant and positive  youre not going home with susan she had exclaimed making a little face when honora had told her they say that silverdale is as slow as a nunneryand youre on your knees all the time you ought to have come to newport with me  it was characteristic of miss wing that she seemed to have taken no account of the fact that she had neglected to issue this alluring invitation life at silverdale slow how could it be slow amidst such beauty and magnificence  the train was stopping at a new little station on which hung the legend in gold letters sutton the sun was well on his journey towards the western hills susan had touched her on the shoulder  here we are honora she said and added with an unusual tremor in her voice at last  on the far side of the platform a yellow twoseated wagon was waiting and away they drove through the village with its old houses and its sleepy streets and its orchards and its ancient tavern dating from stagecoach days just outside of it on the treedotted slope of a long hill was a modern brick building exceedingly practical in appearance surrounded by spacious grounds enclosed in a paling fence that susan said was the sutton home  your mothers charity  a light came into the girls eyes  so you have heard of it yes it is the thing that interests mother more than anything else in the world  oh said honora i hope she will let me go through it  im sure she will want to take you there tomorrow answered susan and she smiled  the road wound upwards by the valley of a brook through the hills now wooded now spread with pastures that shone golden green in the evening light the herds gathering at the gatebars presently they came to a gothiclooking stone building with a mediaeval bridge thrown across the stream in front of it and massive gates flung open as they passed honora had a glimpse of a blue driveway under the arch of the forest an elderly woman looked out at them through the open half of a leaded lattice  thats the chamberlin estate susan volunteered mr chamberlin has built a castle on the top of that hill  honora caught her breath  are many of the places here like that she asked susan laughed  some people dont think the place is veryappropriate she contented herself with replying  a little later as they climbed higher other houses could be discerned dotted about the countryside nearly all of them varied expressions of the passion for a new architecture which seemed to possess the rich most of them were in conspicuous positions and surrounded by wide acres each to honora was an inspiration  i had no idea there were so many people here she said  im afraid sutton is becoming fashionable answered susan  and dont you want it to asked honora  it was very nice before said susan quietly  honora was silent they turned in between two simple stone pillars that divided a low wall overhung from the inside by shrubbery growing under the forest susan seized her friends hand and pressed it  im always so glad to get back here she whispered i hope youll like it  honora returned the pressure  the grey road forked and forked again suddenly the forest came to an end in a sort of premeditated tangle of wild garden and across a wide lawn the great house loomed against the western sky its architecture was of the 60s and 70s with a wide portecochere that sheltered the high entrance doors these were both flung open a butler and two footmen were standing impassively beside them and a neat maid within honora climbed the steps as in a dream followed susan through a hall with a blackwalnut fretted staircase and where she caught a glimpse of two huge chinese vases to a porch on the other side of the house spread with wicker chairs and tables out of a group of people at the farther end of this porch arose an elderly lady who came forward and clasped susan in her arms  and is this honora how do you do my dear i had the pleasure of knowing you when you were much younger  honora too was gathered to that ample bosom released she beheld a lady in a mauve satin gown at the throat of which a cameo brooch was fastened mrs holts face left no room for conjecture as to the character of its possessor her hair of a silvering blend parted in the middle fitted tightly to her head she wore earrings in short her appearance was in every way suggestive of momentum of a force which the wise would respect  where are you joshua she said this is the baby we brought from nice come and tell me whether you would recognize her  mr holt released hisdaughter he had a mild blue eye white muttonchop whiskers and very thin hands and his tweed suit was decidedly the worse for wear  i cant say that i should elvira he replied although it is not hard to believe that such a beautiful baby should prove to be such aergoodlooking young woman  ive always felt very grateful to you for bringing me back said honora  tut tut child said mrs holt there was no one else to do it and be careful how you pay young women compliments joshua they grow vain enough by the way my dear what ever became of your maternal grandfather old mr allisonwasnt that his name  he died when i was very young replied honora  he was too fond of the good things of this life said mrs holt  my dear elvira her husband protested  i cant help it he was retorted that lady i am a judge of human nature and i was relieved i can tell you my dear to honora when i saw your uncle and aunt on the wharf that morning i knew that i had confided you to good hands  they have done everything for me mrs holt said honora  the good lady patted her approvingly on the shoulder  im sure of it my dear she said and i am glad to see you appreciate it and now you must renew your acquaintance with the family  a sister and a brother honora had already learned from susan had died since she had crossed the ocean with them robert and joshua junior remained both were heavyset with rather stern faces both had closecropped tancoloured mustaches and wide jaws with blue eyes like susans both were with women at least what the french would call difficultrobert less so than joshua they greeted honora reservedly andshe could not help feelinga little suspiciously and their appearance was something of a shock to her they did not somehow go with the house and they dressed even more carelessly than peter erwin this was particularly true of joshua whose low turneddown collar revealed a porous brickred and extremely virile neck and whose clothes were creased at the knees and across the back  as for their wives mrs joshua was a merry browneyed little lady already inclining to stoutness and honora felt at home with her at once mrs robert was tall and thin with an olive face and dark eyes which gave the impression of an uncomfortable penetration she was dressed simply in a shirtwaist and a dark skirt but honora thought her striking looking  the grandchildren playing on and off the porch seemed legion and they were besieging susan in reality there were seven of them of all sizes and sexes from the third joshua with a tennisbat to the youngest who was weeping at being sent to bed and holding on to her aunt susan with desperation when honora had greeted them all and kissed some of them she was informed that there were two more upstairs safely tucked away in cribs  im sure you love children dont you said mrs joshua she spoke impulsively and yet with a kind of childlike shyness  i adore them exclaimed honora  a trellised arbour which some years later would have been called a pergola led from the porch up the hill to an oldfashioned summerhouse on the crest and thither presently susan led honora for a view of the distant western hills silhouetted in black against a flaming western sky before escorting her to her room the vastness of the house the width of the staircase and the size of the secondstory hall impressed our heroine  ill send a maid to you later dear susan said if you care to lie down for half an hour no one will disturb you and i hope you will be comfortable  comfortable when the door had closed honora glanced around her and sighed comfort seemed such a strangely inadequate word she was reminded of the illustrations she had seen of english country houses the bed alone would almost have filled her little room at home on the farther side in an alcove was a huge dressingtable a fire was laid in the grate of the marble mantel the curtains in the bay window were tightly drawn and near by was a lounge with a readinglight a huge mahogany wardrobe occupied one corner in another stood a pier glass and in another near the lounge was a small bookcase filled with books honora looked over them curiously robert elsmere and a life of christ mr isaacs a book of sermons by an eminent clergyman innocents abroad hares walks in rome when a mans single by barrie a book of meditations and organized charities for women  adjoining the bedroom was a bathroom in proportion evidently all her ownwith a huge porcelain tub and a table set with toilet bottles containing liquids of various colours  dreamily honora slipped on the new dressinggown aunt mary had made for her and took a book out of the bookcase it was the volume of sermons but she could not read she was forever looking about the room and thinking of the family she had met downstairs of course when one lived in a house like this one could afford to dress and act as one liked she was aroused from her reflections by the soft but penetrating notes of a japanese gong followed by a gentle knock on the door and the entrance of an elderly maid who informed her it was time to dress for dinner  if youll excuse me miss said that hitherto silent individual when the operation was completed you do look lovely  honora secretly was of that opinion too as she surveyed herself in the long glass the simple summer silk of a deep and glowing pink rivalled the colour in her cheeks and contrasted with the dark and shining masses of her hair and on her neck glistened a little pendant of her mothers jewels which aunt mary with cousin eleanors assistance had had set in new york honoras figure was that of a woman of five and twenty her neck was a slender column her head well set and the look of race which had been hers since childhood was at nineteen more accentuated all this she saw and went down the stairs in a kind of exultation and when on the threshold of the drawingroom she paused the conversation suddenly ceased mr holt and his sons got up somewhat precipitately and mrs holt came forward to meet her  i hope you werent waiting for me said honora timidly  no indeed my dear said mrs holt tucking honoras hand under her arm she led the way majestically to the diningroom a large apartment with a dimly lighted conservatory at the farther end presided over by the decorous butler and his assistants a huge chandelier with prisms hung over the flowers at the centre of the table which sparkled with glass and silver while dishes of vermilion and yellow fruits relieved the whiteness of the cloth honora found herself beside mr holt who looked more shrivelled than ever in his evening clothes and she was about to address him when with a movement as though to forestall her he leaned forward convulsively and began a mumbling grace  the dinner itself was more like a ceremony than a meal and as it proceeded honora found it increasingly difficult to rid herself of a curious feeling of being on probation  joshua who sat on her other side and ate prodigiously scarcely addressed a word to her but she gathered from his remarks to his father and brother that he was interested in cows and mr holt was almost exclusively occupied in slowly masticating the special dishes which the butler impressively laid before him he asked her a few questions about miss turners school but it was not until she had admired the mass of peonies in the centre of the table that his eyes brightened and he smiled  you like flowers he asked  i love them slid honora  i am the gardener here he said you must see my garden miss leffingwell i am in it by halfpast six every morning rain or shine  honora looked up and surprised mrs roberts eyes fixed on her with the same strange expression she had noticed on her arrival and for some senseless reason she flushed  the conversation was chiefly carried on by kindly little mrs joshua and by mrs holt who seemed at once to preside and to dominate she praised honoras gown but left a lingering impression that she thought her overdressed without definitely saying so and she made innumerableand often embarrassinginquiries about honoras aunt and uncle and her life in st louis and her friends there and how she had happened to go to sutcliffe to school sometimes honora blushed but she answered them all goodnaturedly and when at length the meal had marched sedately down to the fruit mrs holt rose and drew honora out of the dining room  it is a little hard on you my dear she said to give you so much family on your arrival but there are some other people coming tomorrow when it will be gayer i hope for you and susan  it is so good of you and susan to want me mrs holt replied honora i am enjoying it so much i have never been in a big country house like this and i am glad there is no one else here i have heard my aunt speak of you so often and tell how kind you were to take charge of me that i have always hoped to know you sometime or other and it seems the strangest of coincidences that i should have roomed with susan at sutcliffe  susan has grown very fond of you said mrs holt graciously we are very glad to have you my dear and i must own that i had a curiosity to see you again your aunt struck me as a good and sensible woman and it was a positive relief to know that you were to be confided to her care mrs holt however shook her head and regarded honora and her next remark might have been taken as a clew to her thoughts but we are not very gay at silverdale honora  honoras quick intuition detected the implication of a frivolity which even her sensible aunt had not been able to eradicate  oh mrs holt she cried i shall be so happy here just seeing things and being among you and i am so interested in the little bit i have seen already i caught a glimpse of your girls home on my way from the station i hope you will take me there  mrs holt gave her a quick look but beheld in honoras clear eyes only eagerness and ingenuousness  the change in the elderly ladys own expression and incidentally in the atmosphere which enveloped her was remarkable  would you really like to go my dear  oh yes indeed cried honora you see i have heard so much of it and i should like to write my aunt about it she is interested in the work you are doing and she has kept a magazine with an article in it and a picture of the institution  dear me exclaimed the lady now visibly pleased it is a very modest little work my dear i had no idea thatout in st louisthat the beams of my little candle had carried so far indeed you shall see it honora we will go down the first thing in the morning  mrs robert who had been sitting on the other side of the room rose abruptly and came towards them there was something very like a smile on her facealthough it wasnt really a smileas she bent over and kissed her motherinlaw on the cheek  i am glad to hear you are interested incharities miss leffingwell she said  honoras face grew warm  i have not so far had very much to do with them i am afraid she answered  how should she demanded mrs holt gwendolen youre not going up already  i have some letters to write said mrs robert  gwen has helped me immeasurably said mrs holt looking after the tall figure of her daughterinlaw but she has a curious reserved character you have to know her my dear she is not at all like susan for instance  honora awoke the next morning to a melody and lay for some minutes in a delicious semiconsciousness wondering where she was presently she discovered that the notes were those of a bird on a tree immediately outside of her windowa tree of wonderful perfection the lower branches of which swept the ground other symmetrical trees of many varieties dotted a velvet lawn which formed a great natural terrace above the forested valley of silver brook on the grass dewdrenched cobwebs gleamed in the early sun and the breeze that stirred the curtains was charged with the damp fresh odours of the morning voices caught her ear and two figures appeared in the distance one she recognized as mr holt and the other was evidently a gardener the gilt clock on the mantel pointed to a quarter of seven  it is far too late in this history to pretend that honora was by preference an early riser and therefore it must have been the excitement caused by her surroundings that made her bathe and dress with alacrity that morning a housemaid was dusting the stairs as she descended into the empty hall she crossed the lawn took a path through the trees that bordered it and came suddenly upon an oldfashioned garden in all the freshness of its early morning colour in one of the winding paths she stopped with a little exclamation mr holt rose from his knees in front of her where he had been digging industriously with a trowel his greeting when contrasted with his comparative taciturnity at dinner the night before was almost effusiveand a little pathetic  my dear young lady he exclaimed up so early he held up forbiddingly a mouldcovered palm i cant shake hands with you  honora laughed  i couldnt resist the temptation to see your garden she said  a gentle light gleamed in his blue eyes and he paused before a trellis of june roses with his gardening knife he cut three of them and held them gallantly against her white gown her sensitive colour responded as she thanked him and she pinned them deftly at her waist  you like gardens he said  i was brought up with them she answered i mean she corrected herself swiftly in a very modest way my uncle is passionately fond of flowers and he makes our little yard bloom with them all summer but of course honora added ive never seen anything like this  it has been a life work answered mr holt proudly and yet i feel as though i had not yet begun come i will show you the peoniesthey are at their bestbefore i go in and make myself respectable for breakfast  ten minutes later as they approached the house in amicable and even lively conversation they beheld susan and mrs robert standing on the steps under the portecochere watching them  why honora cried susan how energetic you are i actually had a shock when i went to your room and found youd gone ill have to write miss turner  dont pleaded honora you see i had every inducement to get up  she has been well occupied put in mr holt she has been admiring my garden  indeed i have said honora  oh then you have won fathers heart cried susan gwendolen holt smiled her eyes were fixed upon the roses in honoras belt  good morning miss leffingwell she said simply  mr holt having removed the loam from his hands the whole family excepting joshua junior and including an indefinite number of children and carroll the dignified butler and martha the elderly maid trooped into the library for prayers mr holt sat down before a teakwood table at the end of the room on which reposed a great moroccocovered bible adjusting his spectacles he read in a mild but impressive voice a chapter of matthew while mrs joshua tried to quiet her youngest honora sat staring at a figure on the carpet uncomfortably aware that mrs robert was still studying her mr holt closed the bible reverently and announced a prayer whereupon the family knelt upon the floor and leaned their elbows on the seats of their chairs honora did likewise wondering at the facility with which mr holt worded his appeal and at the number of things he found to pray for her knees had begun to ache before he had finished  at breakfast such a cheerful spirit prevailed that honora began almost to feel at home even robert indulged occasionally in raillery  where in the world is josh asked mrs holt after they were seated  i forgot to tell you mother little mrs joshua chirped up that he got up at an unearthly hour and went over to grafton to look at a cow  a cow sighed mrs holt oh dear i might have known it you must understand honora that every member of the holt family has a hobby joshuas is jerseys  im sure i should adore them if i lived in the country honora declared  if you and joshua would only take that sylvester farm and build a house annie said mr holt munching the dried bread which was specially prepared for him i should be completely happy then he added turning to honora i should have both my sons settled on the place robert and gwen are sensible in building  its cheaper to live with you granddad laughed mrs joshua josh says if we do that he has more money to buy cows  at this moment a footman entered and presented mrs holt with some mail on a silver tray  the vicomte de toqueville is coming this afternoon joshua she announced reading rapidly from a sheet on which was visible a large crown he landed in new york last week and writes to know if i could have him  another of mothers menagerie remarked robert  i dont think thats nice of you robert said his mother the vicomte was very kind to your father and me in paris and invited us to his chateau in provence  robert was sceptical  are you sure he had one he insisted  even mr holt laughed  robert said his mother i wish gwen could induce you to travel more perhaps you would learn that all foreigners arent fortunehunters  ive had an opportunity to observe the ones who come over here mother  i wont have a prospective guest discussed mrs holt declared with finality joshua you remember my telling you last spring that martha spences son called on me she asked he is in business with a man named dallam i believe and making a great deal of money for a young man he is just a year younger than you robert  do you mean that fat towheaded boy that used to come up here and eat melons and ride my pony inquired robert howard spence  mrs holt smiled  he isnt fat any longer robert indeed hes quite goodlooking since his mother died i had lost trace of him but i found a photograph of hers when i was clearing up my desk some months ago and sent it to him and he came to thank me i forgot to tell you that i invited him for a fortnight any time he chose and he has just written to ask if he may come now i regret to say that hes on the stock exchangebut i was very fond of his mother it doesnt seem to me quite a legitimate business  why exclaimed little mrs joshua unexpectedly im given to understand that the stock exchange is quite aristocratic in these days  im afraid i am oldfashioned my dear said mrs holt rising it has always seemed to me little better than a gambling place honora if you still wish to go to the girls home i have ordered the carriage in a quarter of an hour     chapter viii a chapter of conquests  honoras interest in the institution was so lively and she asked so many questions and praised so highly the work with which the indiscreet young women were occupied that mrs holt patted her hand as they drove homeward  my dear she said i begin to wish id adopted you myself perhaps later on we can find a husband for you and you will marry and settle down near us here at silverdale and then you can help me with the work  oh mrs holt she replied i should so like to help you i mean and it would be wonderful to live in such a place and as for marriage it seems such a long way off that somehow i never think of it  naturally ejaculated mrs holt with approval a young girl of your age should not but my dear i am afraid you are destined to have many admirers if you had not been so well brought up and were not naturally so sensible i should fear for you  oh mrs holt exclaimed honora deprecatingly and blushing very prettily  whatever else i am said mrs holt vigorously i am not a flatterer i am telling you something for your own goodwhich you probably know already  honora was discreetly silent she thought of the proud and unsusceptible george hanbury whom she had cast down from the tower of his sophomore dignity with such apparent ease and of certain gentlemen at home young and middleaged who had behaved foolishly during the christmas holidays  at lunch both the roberts and the joshuas were away  afterwards they romped with the childrenshe and susan they were shy at first especially the third joshua but honora captivated him by playing two sets of tennis in the broiling sun at the end of which exercise he regarded her with a newborn admiration in his eyes he was thirteen  i didnt think you were that kind at all he said  what kind did you think i was asked honora passing her arm around his shoulder as they walked towards the house  the boy grew scarlet  oh i didnt think youyou could play tennis he stammered  honora stopped and seized his chin and tilted his face upward  now joshua she said look at me and say that over again  well he replied desperately i thought you wouldnt want to get all mussed up and hot  thats better said honora you thought i was vain didnt you  but i dont think so any more he avowed passionately i think youre a trump and well play again tomorrow wont we  well play any day you like she declared  it is unfair to suppose that the arrival of a real vicomte and of a young goodlooking and successful member of the new york stock exchange were responsible for honoras appearance an hour later in the embroidered linen gown which cousin eleanor had given her that spring tea was already in progress on the porch and if a hush in the conversation and the scraping of chairs is any sign of a sensation this happened when our heroine appeared in the doorway and mrs holt in the act of lifting the hotwater kettle put it down again whether or not there was approval in the ladys delftblue eye honora could not have said the vicomte with the graceful facility of his race had differentiated himself from the group and stood before her as soon as the words of introduction were pronounced he made a bow that was a tribute in itself exaggerated in its respect  it is a pleasure mademoiselle he murmured but his eyes were more eloquent  a description of him in his own language leaped into honoras mind so much did he appear to have walked out of one of the many yellowbacked novels she had read he was not tall but beautifully made and his coat was quite absurdly cut in at the waist his mustache was encroc and its points resembled those of the spanish bayonets in the conservatory he might have been three and thirty and he was what the novels described as un peu fane which means that he had seen the world his eyes were extraordinarily bright black and impenetrable  a greater contrast to the vicomte than mr howard spence would have been difficult to find he was honoras first glimpse of finance of the powers that travelled in private cars and despatched ships across the ocean and in our modern mythology he might have stood for the god of prosperity prosperity is pink and so was mr spence in two placeshis smoothshaven cheeks and his shirt his flesh had a certain firmness but he was not stout he was merely well fed as prosperity should be his features were comparatively regular his mustache a light brown his eyes hazel the fact that he came from that mysterious metropolis the heart of which is wall street not only excused but legitimized the pink shirt and the neatly knotted green tie the pepperandsalt check suit that was loose and at the same time wellfitting and the jewelled ring on his plump little finger on the whole mr spence was not only prepossessing but he contrived to give honora as she shook his hand the impression of being brought a step nearer to the national source of power unlike the vicomte he did not appear to have been instantly and mortally wounded upon her arrival on the scene but his greeting was flattering and he remained by her side instead of returning to that of mrs robert  when did you come up he asked  only yesterday answered honora  new york said mr spence producing a gold cigarette case on which his monogram was largely and somewhat elaborately engraved new york is played out this time of yearisnt it i dropped in at sherrys last night for dinner and there werent thirty people there  honora had heard of sherrys as a restaurant where one dined fabulously and she tried to imagine the cosmopolitan and blissful existence which permitted dropping in at such a place moreover mr spence was plainly under the impression that she too came up from new york and it was impossible not to be a little pleased  it must be a relief to get into the country she ventured  mr spence glanced around him expressively and then looked at her with a slight smile the action and the smileto which she could not refrain from respondingseemed to establish a tacit understanding between them it was natural that he should look upon silverdale as a slow place and there was something delicious in his taking for granted that she shared this opinion she wondered a little wickedly what he would say when he knew the truth about her and this was the birth of a resolution that his interest should not flag  oh i can stand the country when it is properly inhabited he said and their eyes met in laughter  how many inhabitants do you require she asked  well he said brazenly the right kind of inhabitant is worth a thousand of the wrong kind it is a good rule in business when you come across a giltedged security to make a specialty of it  honora found the compliment somewhat singular but she was prepared to forgive new york a few sins in the matter of commercial slang new york which evidently dressed as it liked and talked as it liked but not knowing any more of a giltedged security than that it was something to mr spences taste a retort was out of the question then as though she were doomed that day to complicity her eyes chanced to encounter an appealing glance from the vicomte who was searching with the courage of despair for an english word which his hostess awaited in stoical silence he was trying to give his impressions of silverdale in comparison to country places abroad while mrs robert regarded him enigmatically and susan sympathetically honora had an almost irresistible desire to laugh  ah madame he cried still looking at honora will you have the kindness to permit me to walk about ever so little  certainly vicomte and i will go with you get my parasol susan perhaps you would like to come too howard she added to mr spence it has been so long since you were here and we have made many changes  and you mademoiselle said the vicomte to honora you will comeyes you are interested in landscape  i love the country said honora  it is a pleasure to have a guest who is so appreciative said mrs holt miss leffingwell was up at seven this morning and in the garden with my husband  at seven exclaimed the vicomte you american young ladies are wonderful for example and he was about to approach her to enlarge on this congenial theme when susan arrived with the parasol which mrs holt put in his hands  well begin i think with the view from the summer house she said and i will show you how our famous american landscape architect mr olmstead has treated the slope  there was something humorous and a little pathetic in the contrasted figures of the vicomte and their hostess crossing the lawn in front of them mr spence paused a moment to light his cigarette and he seemed to derive infinite pleasure from this juxtaposition  got leftdidnt he he said  to this observation there was obviously no answer  im not very strong on foreigners he declared an american is good enough for me and theres something about that fellow which would make me a little slow in trusting him with a woman i cared for  if you are beginning to worry over mrs holt said honora wed better walk a little faster  mr spences delight at this sally was so unrestrained as to cause the couple ahead to turn the vicomtes expression was reproachful  wheres susan asked mrs holt  i think she must have gone in the house honora answered  you two seem to be having a very good time  oh were hitting it off fairly well said mr spence no doubt for the benefit of the vicomte and he added in a confidential tone arent we  not on the subject of the vicomte she replied promptly i like him i like french people  what he exclaimed halting in his steps you dont take that man seriously  i havent known him long enough to take him seriously said honora  theres a blindness about women he declared thats incomprehensible theyll invest in almost any old thing if the certificates are beautifully engraved if you were a man you wouldnt trust that frenchman to give you change for five dollars  french people proclaimed honora have a light touch of which we americans are incapable we do not know how to relax  a light touch cried mr spence delightedly that about describes the vicomte  im sure you do him an injustice said honora  well see said mr spence mrs holt is always picking up queer people like that shes noted for it he turned to her how did you happen to come here  i came with susan she replied amusedly from boardingschool at sutcliffe  from boardingschool  she rather enjoyed his surprise  you dont mean to say you are susans age  how old did you think i was she asked  older than susan he said surveying her  no im a mere child im nineteen  but i thought he began and paused and lighted another cigarette  her eyes lighted mischievously  you thought that i had been out several years and that id seen a good deal of the world and that i lived in new york and that it was strange you didnt know me but new york is such an enormous place i suppose one cant know everybody there  andwhere do you come from if i may ask he said  st louis i was brought to this country before i was two years old from france mrs holt brought me and i have never been out of st louis since except to go to sutcliffe there you have my history mrs holt would probably have told it to you if i hadnt  and mrs holt brought you to this country  honora explained not without a certain enjoyment  and how do you happen to be here she demanded are you a member ofof the menagerie  he had the habit of throwing back his head when he laughed this of course was a thing to laugh over and now he deemed it audacity five minutes before he might have given it another name there is no use in saying that the recital of honoras biography had not made a difference with mr howard pence and that he was not a little mortified at his mistake what he had supposed her to be must remain a matter of conjecture he was however by no means aware how thoroughly this unknown and inexperienced young woman had read his thoughts in her regard and if the truth be told he was on the whole relieved that she was nobody he was just an ordinary man provided with no sixth sense or premonitory small voice to warn him that masculine creatures are often in real danger at the moment when they feel most secure  it is certain that his manner changed and during the rest of the walk she listened demurely when he talked about wall street with casual references to the powers that be it was evident that mr howard spence was one who had his fingers on the pulse of affairs ambition leaped in him  they reached the house in advance of mrs holt and the vicomte and honora went to her room  at dinner save for a little matter of a casual remark when mr holt had assumed the curved attitude in which he asked grace mr spence had a veritable triumph selfconfidence was a quality which honora admired he was undaunted by mrs holt and advised mrs robert if she had any pinmoney to buy new york central and he predicted an era of prosperity which would be unexampled in the annals of the country among other powers he quoted the father of honoras schoolmate mr james wing as authority for this prophecy he sat next to susan who maintained her usual maidenly silence but honora from time to time and as though by accident caught his eye even mr holt when not munching his dried bread was tempted to make some inquiries about the market  so far as i am concerned mrs holt announced suddenly nothing can convince me that it is not gambling  my dear elvira protested mr holt  i cant help it said that lady stoutly im oldfashioned i suppose but it seems to me like legalized gambling  mr spence took this somewhat severe arraignment of his career in admirable good nature and if these be such a thing as an implied wink honora received one as he proceeded to explain what he was pleased to call the bonafide nature of the transactions of dallam and spence  a discussion ensued in which to her surprise even the ordinarily taciturn joshua took a part and maintained that the buying and selling of blooded stock was equally gambling to this his father laughingly agreed the vicomte who sat on mrs holts right and who apparently was determined not to suffer a total eclipse without a struggle gallantly and unexpectedly came to his hostess rescue though she treated him as a doubtful ally this was because he declared with engaging frankness that in france the young men of his monde had a jeunesse he who spoke to them had gambled everybody gambled in france where it was regarded as an innocent amusement he had friends on the bourse and he could see no difference in principle between betting on the red at monte carlo and the rise and fall of the shares of la compagnie des metaux for example after completing his argument he glanced triumphantly about the table until his restless black eyes encountered honoras seemingly seeking a verdict she smiled impartially  the subject of finance lasted through the dinner and the vicomte proclaimed himself amazed with the evidences of wealth which confronted him on every side in this marvellous country and once when he was at a loss for a word honora astonished and enchanted him by supplying it  ah mademoiselle he exclaimed i was sure when i first beheld you that you spoke my language and with such an accent  i have studied it all my life vicomte she said modestly and i had the honour to be born in your country i have always wished to see it again  monsieur de toqueville ventured the fervent hope that her wish might soon be gratified but not before he returned to france he expressed himself in french and in a few moments she found herself deep in a discussion with him in that tongue while she talked her veins seemed filled with fire and she was dimly and automatically aware of the disturbance about her as though she were creating a magnetic storm that interfered with all other communication mr holts nightly bezique which he played with susan did not seem to be going as well as usual and elsewhere conversation was a palpable pretence mr spence who was attempting to entertain the two daughtersinlaw was clearly distraitif his glances meant anything robert and joshua had not appeared and mrs holt at the far end of the room under the lamp regarded honora from time to time over the edge of the evening newspaper  in his capacity as a student of american manners an unsuspected if scattered knowledge on honoras part of that portion of french literature included between theophile gautier and gyp at once dumfounded and delighted the vicomte de toqueville and he was curious to know whether amongst american young ladies miss leffingwell was the exception or the rule those eyes of his which had paid to his hostess a tender respect snapped when they spoke to our heroine and presently he boldly abandoned literature to declare that the fates alone had sent her to silverdale at the time of his visit  it was at this interesting juncture that mrs holt rattled her newspaper a little louder than usual arose majestically and addressed mrs joshua  annie perhaps you will play for us she said as she crossed the room and added to honora i had no idea you spoke french so well my dear what have you and monsieur de toqueville been talking about  it was the vicomte who springing to his feet replied nimbly mademoiselle has been teaching me much of the customs of your country  and what inquired mrs holt have you been teaching mademoiselle  the vicomte laughed and shrugged his shoulders expressively  ah madame i wish i were qualified to be her teacher the education of american young ladies is truly extraordinary  i was about to tell monsieur de toqueville put in honora wickedly that he must see your institution as soon as possible and the work your girls are doing  madame said the vicomte after a scarcely perceptible pause i await my opportunity and your kindness  i will take you tomorrow said mrs holt  at this instant a sound closely resembling a sneeze caused them to turn mr spence with his handkerchief to his mouth had his back turned to them and was studiously regarding the bookcases  after honora had gone upstairs for the night she opened her door in response to a knock to find mrs holt on the threshold  my dear said that lady i feel that i must say a word to you i suppose you realize that you are attractive to men  oh mrs holt  youre no fool my dear and it goes without saying that youdo realize itin the most innocent way of course but you have had no experience in life mind you i dont say that the vicomte de toqueville isnt very much of a gentleman but the french ideas about the relations of young men and young women are quite different and i regret to say less innocent than ours i have no reason to believe that the vicomte has come to this country toto mend his fortunes i know nothing about his property but my sense of responsibility towards you has led me to tell him that you have no dot for you somehow manage to give the impression of a young woman of fortune not purposely my deari did not mean that mrs holt tapped gently honoras flaming cheek i merely felt it my duty to drop you a word of warning against monsieur de toquevillebecause he is a frenchman  but mrs holt i had no idea ofof falling in love with him protested honora as soon as she could get her breath he seemed so kindand so interested in everything  i dare say said mrs holt dryly and i have always been led to believe that that is the most dangerous sort i am sure honora after what i have said you will give him no encouragement  oh mrs holt cried honora again i shouldnt think of such a thing  i am sure of it honora now that you are forewarned and your suggestion to take him to the institution was not a bad one i meant to do so anyway and i think it will be good for him good night my dear  after the good lady bad gone honora stood for some moments motionless then she turned out the light     chapter ix in which the vicomte continues his studies  mr robert holt honora learned at breakfast had two bobbies she had never heard of what is called forestry and had always believed the wood of her country to be inexhaustible it had never occurred to her to think of a wild forest as an example of natures extravagance and so flattering was her attention while robert explained the primary principles of caring for trees that he actually offered to show her one of the tracts on the estate which he was treating he could nothe regretted to say take her that morning  his other hobby was golf he was president of the sutton golf club and had arranged to play a match with mr spence this gentleman it appeared was likewise an enthusiast and had brought to silverdale a leather bag filled with sticks  wont you come too miss leffingwell he said as he took a second cup of coffee  somewhat to the astonishment of the holt family robert seconded the invitation  ill bet robert said mr spence gallantly that miss leffingwell can put it over both of us  indeed i cant play at all exclaimed honora in confusion and i shouldnt think of spoiling your match and besides i am going to drive with susan  we can go another day honora said susan  but honora would not hear of it  come over with me this afternoon then suggested mr spence and ill give you a lesson  she thanked him gratefully  but it wont be much fun for you im afraid she added as they left the dining room  dont worry about me he answered cheerfully he was dressed in a checked golf costume and wore a pink shirt of a new pattern and he stood in front of her in the hall glowing from his nights sleep evidently in a high state of amusement  whats the matter she demanded  you did for the vicomte all right he said id give a good deal to see him going through the institution  it wouldnt have hurt you either she retorted and started up the stairs once she glanced back and saw him looking after her  at the far end of the second story hall she perceived the vicomte who had not appeared at breakfast coming out of his room she paused with her hand on the walnut post and laughed a little so ludicrous was his expression as he approached her  ah mademoiselle que vous etes mechante he exclaimed but i forgive you if you will not go off with that stockbroker it must be that i see the home sometime and if i go now it is over i forgive you it is in the bible that we must forgive our neighbourhow many times  seventy times seven said honora  but i make a condition said the vicomte that my neighbour shall be a woman and young and beautiful then i care not how many times mademoiselle if you would but have your portrait painted as you are with your hand on the post by sargent or carolus duran there would be some noise in the salon  is that you vicomte came a voice from the foot of the stairsmrs holts voice  i come this instant madame he replied looking over the banisters and added malheureux que je suis perhaps when i return you will show me a little of the garden  the duty of exhibiting to guests the sights of silverdale and the neighbourhood had so often devolved upon susan who was methodical that she had made out a route or itinerary for this purpose there were some notes to leave and a sick woman and a child to see which caused her to vary it a little that morning and honora who sat in the sunlight and held the horse wondered how it would feel to play the lady bountiful i am so glad to have you all to myself for a little while honora susan said to her you are so popular that i begin to fear that i shall have to be unselfish and share you  oh susan she said every one has been so kind and i cant tell you how much i am enjoying this experience which i feel i owe to you  i am so happy dear that it is giving you pleasure said susan  and dont think exclaimed honora that you wont see lots of me for you will  her heart warmed to susan yet she could not but feel a secret pity for her as one unable to make the most of her opportunities in the wonderful neighbourhood in which she lived as they drove through the roads and in and out of the wellkept places everybody they met had a bow and a smile for her frienda greeting such as people give to those for whom they have only goodwill young men and girls waved their racquets at her from the tenniscourts and honora envied them and wished that she too were a part of the gay life she saw and were playing instead of being driven decorously about she admired the trim new houses in which they lived set upon the slopes of the hills pleasure houses they seemed to her built expressly for joys which had been denied her  do you see much ofof these people susan she asked  not so much as id like replied susan seriously i never seem to get time we nearly always have guests at silverdale and then there are so many things one has to attend to perhaps you have noticed she added smiling a little that we are very serious and oldfashioned  oh no indeed protested honora it is such a wonderful experience for me to be here  well said susan were having some young people to dinner tonight and others next weekthats why im leaving these notes and then we shall be a little livelier  really susan you mustnt think that im not having a good time it is exciting to be in the same house with a real french vicomte and i like mr spence tremendously  her friend was silent  dont you demanded honora  to her surprise the usually tolerant susan did not wholly approve of mr spence  he is a guest and i ought not to criticise him she answered but since you ask me honora i have to be honest it seems to me that his ambitions are a little sordidthat he is too intent upon growing rich  but i thought all new yorkers were that way exclaimed honora and added hastily except a few like your family susan  susan laughed  you should marry a diplomat my dear she said after all perhaps i am a little harsh but there is a spirit of selfishness andand of vulgarity in modern fashionable new york which appears to be catching like a disease the worship of financial success seems to be in every ones blood  it is power said honora  susan glanced at her but honora did not remark the expression on her friends face so intent was she on the reflections which susans words had aroused they had reached the far end of the silverdale domain and were driving along the shore of the lake that lay like a sapphire set amongst the green hills it was here that the new house of the robert holts was building presently they came to joshuas dairy farm and joshua himself was standing in the doorway of one of his immaculate barn honora put her hand on susans arm  cant we see the cows she asked  susan looked surprised  i didnt know you were interested in cows honora  i am interested in everything said honora and i think your brother is so attractive  it was at this moment that joshua with his hands in his pockets demanded what his sister was doing there  miss leffingwell wants to look at the cattle josh called susan  wont you show them to me mr holt begged honora id like so much to see some really good cattle and to know a little more about them  joshua appeared incredulous but being of the male sex he did not hide the fact that he was pleased it seems strange to have somebody really want to see them he said i tried to get spence to come back this way but the idea didnt seem to appeal to him here are some of the records  records repeated honora looking at a mass of typewritten figures on the wall do you mean to say you keep such an exact account of all the milk you get  joshua laughed and explained she walked by his side over the concrete paving to the first of the varnished stalls  that he said and a certain pride had come into his voice is lady guinevere and those ribbons are the prizes she has taken on both sides of the water  isnt she a dear exclaimed honora why shes actually beautiful i didnt know cows could be so beautiful  she isnt bad admitted joshua of course the good points in a cow arent necessarily features of beauty for instance these bones here he added pointing to the hips  but they seem to add somehow to the thoroughbred appearance honora declared  thats absolutely true replied joshuawhereupon he began to talk and honora still asking questions followed him from stall to stall there are some more in the pasture he said when they had reached the end of the second building  oh couldnt i see them she asked  surely replied joshua with more of alacrity than one would have believed him capable ill tell susan to drive on and you and i will walk home across the fields if you like  i should love to said honora  it was not without astonishment that the rest of the holt family beheld them returning together as the gongs were sounding for luncheon mrs holt upon perceiving them began at once to shake her head and laugh  my dear it cant be that you have captivated joshua she exclaimed in a tone that implied the carrying of a stronghold hitherto thought impregnable  honora blushed whether from victory or embarrassment or both it is impossible to say  im afraid its just the other way mrs holt she replied mr holt has captivated me  well call it mutual miss leffingwell declared joshua which was for him the height of gallantry  i only hope he hasnt bored you said the goodnatured mrs joshua  oh dear no exclaimed honora i dont see how any one could be bored looking at such magnificent animals as that hardicanute  it was at this moment that her eyes were drawn by a seemingly resistless attraction to mrs roberts face her comment upon this latest conquest though unexpressed was disquieting and in spite of herself honora blushed again  at luncheon in the midst of a general conversation mr spence made a remark sotto voce which should in the ordinary course of events have remained a secret  susan he said your friend miss leffingwell is a fascinator shes got roberts scalp too and he thought it a pretty good joke because i offered to teach her to play golf this afternoon  it appeared that susans eyes could flash indignantly perhaps she resented mr spences calling her by her first name  honora leffingwell is the most natural and unspoiled person i know she said  there is undoubtedly a keen pleasure and an ample reward in teaching a pupil as apt and as eager to learn as honora and mr spence if he attempted at all to account for the swiftness with which the hours of that long afternoon slipped away may have attributed their flight to the discovery in himself of hitherto latent talent for instruction at the little casino he had bought from the professional in charge of the course a ladys driver and she practised with exemplary patience the art of carrying ones hands through and of using the wrists in the stroke  not quite miss leffingwell he would say but so  honora would try again  thats unusually good for a beginner but you are inclined to chop it off a little still let it swing all the way round  oh dear how you must hate me  hate you said mr spence searching in vain for words with which to obliterate such a false impression anything but that  isnt it a wonderful spot she exclaimed gazing off down the swale emerald green in the afternoon light between its forest walls in the distance silver brook was gleaming amidst the meadows they sat down on one of the benches and watched the groups of players pass mr spence produced his cigarette case and presented it to her playfully  a little quiet whiff he suggested theres not much chance over at the convent and she gathered that it was thus he was pleased to designate silverdale  in one instant she was doubtful whether or not to be angry and in the next grew ashamed of the provincialism which had caused her to suspect an insult she took a cigarette and he produced a gold match case lighted a match and held it up for her honora blew it out  you didnt think seriously that i smoked she asked glancing at him  why not he asked any number of girls do  she tore away some of the rice paper and lifted the tobacco to her nose and made a little grimace  do you like to see women smoke she asked  mr spence admitted that there was something cosey about the custom when it was well done  and i imagine he added that youd do it well  im sure i should make a frightful mess of it she protested modestly  you do everything well he said  even golf she inquired mischievously  even golf for a beginner andand a woman youve got the swing in an astonishingly short time in fact youve been something of an eyeopener to me he declared if i had been betting i should have placed the odds about twenty to one against your coming from the west  this eastern complacency although it did not lower mr spence in her estimation aroused honoras pride  that shows how little new yorkers know of the west she replied laughing didnt you suppose there were any gentlewomen there  gentlewomen repeated mr spence as though puzzled by the word gentlewomen yes but you might have been born anywhere  even her sense of loyalty to her native place was not strong enough to override this compliment  i like a girl with some dash and go to her he proclaimed and there could be no doubt about the one to whom he was attributing these qualities savoir faire as the french call it and all that i dont know much about that language but the way you talk it makes mrs holts french and susans sound silly i watched you last night when you were stringing the vicomte  oh did you said honora demurely  you may have thought i was talking to mrs robert he said  i wasnt thinking anything about you replied honora indignantly and besides i wasnt i stringing the vicomte in the west we dont use anything like so much slang as you seem to use in new york  oh come now he exclaimed laughingly and apparently not the least out of countenance you made him think he was the only pebble on the beach i have no idea what you were talking about  literature she said perhaps that was the reason why you couldnt understand it  he may be interested in literature replied mr spence but it wouldnt be a bad guess to say that he was more interested in stocks and bonds  he doesnt talk about them at any rate said honora  id respect him more if he did he announced i know those fellowsthey make love to every woman they meet i saw him eying you at lunch  honora laughed  i imagine the vicomte could make love charmingly she said  mr spence suddenly became very solemn  merely as a fellowcountryman miss leffingwell he began when she sprang to her feet her eyes dancing and finished the sentence  you would advise me to be on my guard against him because although i look twentyfive and experienced i am only nineteen and inexperienced thank you  he paused to light another cigarette before he followed her across the turf but she had the incomprehensible feminine satisfaction of knowing as they walked homeward that the usual serenity of his disposition was slightly ruffled  a sudden caprice impelled her in the privacy of her bedroom that evening to draw his portrait for peter erwin the complacency of new york men was most amusing she wrote and the amount of slang they used would have been deemed vulgar in st louis nevertheless she liked people to be sure of themselves and there was something insolent about new york which appealed to her peter when he read that letter seemed to see mr howard spence in the flesh or arrayed rather in the kind of cloth alluringly draped in the showwindows of fashionable tailors for honora all unconsciously wrote literature literature was invented before phonographs and will endure after them peter could hear mr spence talk for a part of that gentlemans conversationa characteristic partwas faithfully transcribed and peter detected a strain of admiration running even through the ridicule  peter showed that letter to aunt mary whom it troubled and to uncle tom who laughed over it there was also a lifelike portrait of the vicomte followed by the comment that he was charming but very french but the meaning of this last but quite obvious attribute remained obscure he was possessed of one of the oldest titles and one of the oldest chateaux in france although she did not say so honora had this on no less authority than that of the vicomte himself mrs holtwith her victorian brooch and earrings and her watchful delftblue eyes that somehow haunted one even when she was out of sight with her ample bosom and the really kind heart it containedwas likewise depicted and mr holt with his dried bread and his garden which honora wished uncle tom could see and his prayers that lacked imagination joshua and his cows robert and his forest susan and her charities the institution jolly mrs joshua and enigmatical mrs robertall were there and even a picture of the dinnerparty that evening when honora sat next to a young mr patterson with glasses and a studious manner who knew george hanbury at harvard the other guests were a florid miss chamberlin whose person loudly proclaimed possessions and a thin miss longman who rented one of the silverdale cottages and sketched  honora was seeing life she sent her love to peter and begged him to write to her  the next morning a mysterious change seemed to have passed over the members of the family during the night it was sunday honora when she left her room heard a swishing on the stairsmrs joshua stiffly arrayed for the day even mrs robert swished but mrs holt in a bronzecoloured silk swished most of all as she entered the library after a brief errand to the housekeepers room mr holt was already arranging his bookmarks in the bible while joshua and robert in black cutaways that seemed to have the benumbing and paralyzing effect of straitjackets wandered aimlessly about the room as though its walls were the limit of their movements the children had a subdued and touchmenot air that reminded honora of her own youth  it was not until prayers were over and the solemn gathering seated at the breakfast table that mr spence burst upon it like an aurora his flannel suit was of the lightest of grays he wore white tennis shoes and a red tie and it was plain as he cheerfully bade them good morning that he was wholly unaware of the enormity of his costume there was a choking breathless moment before mrs holt broke the silence  surely howard she said youre not going to church in those clothes  i hadnt thought of going to church replied mr spence helping himself to cherries  what do you intend to do asked his hostess  read the stock reports for the week as soon as the newspapers arrive  there is no such thing as a sunday newspaper in my house said mrs holt  no sunday newspapers he exclaimed and his eyes as they encountered honoraswho sought to avoid themexpressed a genuine dismay  i am afraid said mrs holt that i was right when i spoke of the pernicious effect of wall street upon young men your mother did not approve of sunday newspapers  during the rest of the meal although he made a valiant attempt to hold his own mr spence was so to speak outlawed robert and joshua must have had a secret sympathy for him one of them mentioned the vicomte  the vicomte is a foreigner declared mrs holt i am in no sense responsible for him  the vicomte was at that moment propped up in bed complaining to his valet about the weakness of the coffee he made the remark which he afterwards repeated to honora that weak coffee and the protestant religion seemed inseparable but he did not attempt to discover the whereabouts in sutton of the church of his fathers he was not in the best of humours that morning and his toilet had advanced no further when an hour or so later he perceived from behind his lace curtains mr howard spence dressed with comparative soberness handing honora into the omnibus the incident did not serve to improve the cynical mood in which the vicomte found himself  indeed the vicomte who had a theory concerning mr spences churchgoing was not far from wrong as may have been suspected it was to honora that credit was due it was honora whom mr spence sought after breakfast and to whom he declared that her presence alone prevented him from leaving that afternoon it was honora who told him that he ought to be ashamed of himself and it was to honora after church was over and they were walking homeward together along the dusty road that mr spence remarked by way of a delicate compliment that the morning had not been a total loss after all  the little presbyterian church stood on a hillside just outside of the village and was as far as possible the possession of the holt family the morning sunshine illuminated the angels in the holt memorial window and the inmates of the holt institution occupied all the back pews mrs joshua played the organ and susan with several young women and a young man with a long coat and plastered hair sang in the choir the sermon of the elderly minister had to do with beliefs rather than deeds and was the subject of discussion at luncheon  it is very like a sermon i found in my room said honora  i left that book in your room my dear in the hope that you would not overlook it said mrs holt approvingly joshua i wish you would read that sermon aloud to us  oh do mr holt begged honora  the vicomte who had been acting very strangely during the meal showed unmistakable signs of a futile anger he had asked honora to walk with him  of course added mrs holt no one need listen who doesnt wish to since you were good enough to reconsider your decision and attend divine service howard i suppose i should be satisfied  the reading took place in the library through the open window honora perceived the form of joshua asleep in the hammock his sunday coat all twisted under him it worried her to picture his attire when he should wake up once mrs robert looked in smiled said nothing and went out again at length in a wicker chair under a distant tree on the lawn honora beheld the dejected outline of the vicomte he was trying to read but every once in a while would lay down his book and gaze protractedly at the house stroking his mustache the low song of the bees around the shrubbery vied with mr holts slow reading on the whole the situation delighted honora who bit her lip to refrain from smiling at m de toqueville when at last she emerged from the library he rose precipitately and came towards her across the lawn lifting his hands towards the pitiless puritan skies  enfin he exclaimed tragically ah mademoiselle never in my life have i passed such a day  are you ill vicomte she asked  ill were it not for you i would be gone you alone sustain meit is for the pleasure of seeing you that i suffer what kind of a menage is this then where i am walked around institutions where i am forced to listen to the exposition of doctrines where the coffee is weak where sunday which the bon dieu set aside for a jour de fete resembles to a day in purgatory  but vicomte honora laughed you must remember that you are in america and that you have come here to study our manners and customs  ah no he cried ah no it cannot all be like this i will not believe it mr holt who sought to entertain me before luncheon offered to show me his collection of chinese carvings i who might be at trouville or cabourg if it were not for you mademoiselle i should not stay herenot one little minute he said with a slow intensity behold what i suffer for your sake  for my sake echoed honora  for what else demanded the vicomte gazing upon her with the eyes of martyrdom it is not for my health alas between the coffee and this dimanche i have the vertigo  honora laughed again at the memory of the dizzy sunday afternoons of her childhood when she had been taken to see mr ishams curios  you are cruel said the vicomte you laugh at my tortures  on the contrary i think i understand them she replied i have often felt the same way  my instinct was true then he cried triumphantly the first time my eyes fell on you i said to myself ah there is one who understands and i am seldom mistaken  your experience with the opposite sex ventured honora must have made you infallible  he shrugged and smiled as one whose modesty forbade the mention of conquests  you do not belong here either mademoiselle he said you are not like these people you have temperament and a futurebelieve me why do you waste your time  what do you mean vicomte  ah it is not necessary to explain what i mean it is that you do not choose to understandyou are far too clever why is it then that you bore yourself by regarding institutions and listening to sermons in your jeunesse it is all very well for mademoiselle susan but you are not created for a religieuse and again it pleases you to spend hours with the stockbroker who is as lacking in esprit as the bull of joshua he is no companion for you  i am afraid she said reprovingly that you do not understand mr spence  par exemple cried the vicomte have i not seen hundreds like him do not they come to paris and live in the great hotels and demand cocktails and read the stock reports and send cablegrams all the day long and go to the folies bergeres and yawn nom de nom of what does his conversation consist of the price of railroadsis it not so i who speak to you have talked to him does he know how to make love  that accomplishment is not thought of very highly in america honora replied  it is because you are a new country he declared  and you are mad over money money has taken the place of love  is money so despised in france she asked i have heardthat you married for it  touch cried the vicomte laughing you see i am frank with you we marry for money yes but we do not make a god of it it is our servant you make it and we enjoy it yes and you mademoiselleyou too were made to enjoy you do not belong here he said with a disdainful sweep of the arm ah i have solved you you have in you the germ of the riviera you were born there  honora wondered if what he said were true was she different she was having a great deal of pleasure at silverdale even the sermon reading which would have bored her at home had interested and amused her but was it not from the novelty of these episodes rather than from their special characters that she received the stimulus she glanced curiously towards the vicomte and met his eye  they had been walking the while and had crossed the lawn and entered one of the many paths which it had been roberts pastime to cut through the woods and at length they came out at a rustic summerhouse set over the wooded valley honora with one foot on the ground sat on the railing gazing over the treetops the vicomte was on the bench beside her his eyes sparkled and snapped and suddenly she tingled with a sense that the situation was not without an element of danger  i had a feeling about you last night at dinner he said you reminded me of a line of marcel prevost cette femme ne sera pas aimee que parmi des drames  nonsense said honora last night at dinner you were too much occupied with miss chamberlin to think of me  ah mademoiselle you have read me strangely if you think that i talked to her with my lips yesbut it was of you i was thinking i was thinking that you were born to play a part in many dramas that you have the fatal beauty which is rare in all ages the vicomte bent towards her and his voice became caressing you cannot realize how beautiful you are he sighed  suddenly he seized her hand and before she could withdraw it she had the satisfaction of knowing the sensation of having it kissed it was a strange sensation indeed and the fact that she did not tingle with anger alone made her all the more angry trembling her face burning she leaped down from the railing and fled into the path and there seeing that he did not follow she turned and faced him he stood staring at her with eyes that had not ceased to sparkle  how cowardly of you she cried  ah mademoiselle he answered fervently i would risk your anger a thousand times to see you like that once more i cannot help my feelingsthey were dead indeed if they did not respond to such an inspiration let them plead for my pardon  honora felt herself melting a little after all there might have been some excuse for it and he made love divinely when he had caught up with her his contriteness was such that she was willing to believe he had not meant to insult her and then he was a frenchman as a proof of his versatility if not of his good faith he talked of neutral matters on the way back to the house with the charming ease and lightness that was the gift of his race and class on the borders of the wood they encountered the robert holts walking with their children  madame said the vicomte to gwendolen your silverdale is enchanting we have been to that little summerhouse which commands the valley  and are you still learning things about our country vicomte she asked with a glance at honora     chapter x in which honora widens her horizon  if it were not a digression it might be interesting to speculate upon the reason why in view of their expressed opinions of silverdale both the vicomte and mr spence remained during the week that followed robert who went off in the middle of it with his family to the seashore described it to honora as a normal week during its progress there came and went a missionary from china a pianist an english lady who had heard of the institution a southern spinster with literary gifts a youthful architect who had not built anything and a young lawyer interested in settlement work  the missionary presented our heroine with a book he had written about the yangtsekiang the southern lady suspected her of literary gifts the architect walked with her through the woods to the rustic shelter where the vicomte had kissed her hand and told her that he now comprehended the feelings of christopher wren when he conceived st pauls cathedral of michael angelo when he painted the sistine chapel even the serious young lawyer succumbed though not without a struggle when he had first seen miss leffingwell he confessed he had thought her frivolous he had done her an injustice and wished to acknowledge it before he left and since she was interested in settlement work he hoped if she were going through new york that she would let him know it would be a real pleasure to show her what he was doing  best of all honora by her unselfishness endeared herself to her hostess  i cant tell you what a real help you are to me my dear said that lady you have a remarkable gift with people for so young a girl and i do you the credit of thinking that it all springs from a kind heart  in the meantime unknown to mrs holt who might in all conscience have had a knowledge of what may be called social chemistry a drama was slowly unfolding itself by no fault of honoras of course there may have been some truth in the quotation of the vicomte as applied to herthat she was destined to be loved only amidst the play of drama if experience is worth anything monsieur de toqueville should have been an expert in matters of the sex could it be possible honora asked herself more than once that his feelings were deeper than her feminine instinct and the knowledge she had gleaned from novels led her to suspect  it is painful to relate that the irregularity and deceit of the life the vicomte was leading amused her for existence at silverdale was plainly not of a kind to make a gentleman of the vicomtes temperament and habits ecstatically happy and honora was filled with a strange and unaccountable delight when she overheard him assuring mrs wellfleet the english lady of eleemosynary tendencies that he was engaged in a study at first hand of americans  the time has come to acknowledge frankly that it was honora he was studyinghonora as the type of young american womanhood what he did not suspect was that young american womanhood was studying him thanks to a national system she had had an apprenticeship the heartblood of algernon cartwright and many others had not been shed in vain and the fact that she was playing with real fire that this was a duel with the buttons off lent a piquancy and zest to the pastime which it had hitherto lacked  the vicomtes feelings were by no means hidden processes to honora and it was as though she could lift the lid of the furnace at any time and behold the growth of the flame which she had lighted nay nature had endowed her with such a gift that she could read the daily temperature as by a register hung on the outside without getting scorched nor had there been any design on her part in thus tormenting his soul he had not meant to remain more than four days at silverdale that she knew he had not meant to come to america and fall in love with a penniless beautythat she knew also the climax would be interesting if perchance uncomfortable  it is wonderful what we can find the time to do if we only try monsieur de toqueville lent honora novels which she read in bed but being in the full bloom of health and of a strong constitution this practice did not prevent her from rising at seven to take a walk through the garden with mr holta custom which he had come insensibly to depend upon and in the brief conversations which she vouchsafed the vicomte they discussed his novels in vain he pleaded in caressing undertones that she should ride with him honora had never been on a horse but she did not tell him so if she would but drive or walkonly a little wayhe would promise faithfully not to forget himself honora intimated that the period of his probation had not yet expired if he waylaid her on the stairs he got but little satisfaction  you converse by the hour with the missionaries and take long promenades with the architects and charity workers but to me you will give nothing he complained  the persons of whom you speak are not dangerous answered honora giving him a look  the look and being called dangerous sent up the temperature several degrees frenchmen are not the only branch of the male sex who are complimented by being called dangerous the vicomte was desolated so he said  i stay here only for you and the coffee is slowly deranging me he declared in french for most of their conversations were in that language if there were duplicity in this honora did not recognize it i stay here only for you and how you are cruel i live for youhow the good god only knows i existto see you for ten minutes a day  oh vicomte you exaggerate if you were to count it up i am sure you would find that we talk an hour at least altogether and then although i am very young and inexperienced i can imagine how many conquests you have made by the same arts  i suffer he cried ah no you cannot look at me without perceiving ityou who are so heartless and when i see you play at golf with that mr spence  surely said honora you cant object to my acquiring a new accomplishment when i have the opportunity and mr spence is so kind and goodnatured about it  do you think i have no eyes he exclaimed have i not seen him look at you like the great animal of joshua when he wants his supper he is without esprit without soul there is nothing inside of him but moneymaking machinery  the most valuable of all machinery she replied laughingly  if i thought you believed that mademoiselle if i thought you were like so many of your countrywomen in this respect i should leave tomorrow he declared  dont be too sure vicomte she cautioned him  if one possessed a sense of humour and a certain knowledge of mankind the spectacle of a young and successful wall street broker at silverdale that week was apt to be diverting mr spence held his own he advised the architect to make a specialty of country houses and promised some day to order one he disputed boldly with the other young man as to the practical uses of settlement work and even measured swords with the missionary needless to say he was not popular with these gentlemen but he was also goodnatured and obliging and he did not object to repeating for the english lady certain phrases which she called picturesque expressions and which she wrote down with a gold pencil  it is evident from the vicomtes remarks that he found time to continue honoras lessons in golfor rather that she found time in the midst of her manifold and selfimposed duties to take them and in this diversion she was encouraged by mrs holt herself on saturday morning the heat being unusual they ended their game by common consent at the fourth hole and descended a wood road to silver brook to a spot which they had visited once before and had found attractive honora after bathing her face in the pool perched herself on a boulder she was very fresh and radiant  this fact if she had not known it she might have gathered from mr silences expression he had laid down his coat his sleeves were rolled up and his arms were tanned and he stood smoking a cigarette and gazing at her with approbation she lowered her eyes  well weve had a pretty good time havent we he remarked  lightning sometimes fails in its effect but the look she flashed back at him from under her blue lashes seldom misses  im afraid i havent been a very apt pupil she replied modestly  youre on the highroad to a cup he assured her if i could take you on for another week he paused and an expression came into his eyes which was not new to honora nor peculiar to mr silence i have to go back to town on monday  if honora felt any regret at this announcement she did not express it  i thought you couldnt stand silverdale much longer she replied  you know why i stayed he said and paused againrather awkwardly for mr spence but honora was silent i had a letter this morning from my partner sidney dallam calling me back  i suppose you are very busy said honora detaching a coppergreen scale of moss from the boulder  the fact is he explained that we have received an order of considerable importance for which i am more or less responsible something of a complimentsince we are after all comparatively young men  sometimes said honora sometimes i wish i were a man women are so hampered and circumscribed and have to wait for things to happen to them a man can do what he wants he can go into wall street and fight until he controls miles of railroads and thousands and thousands of men that would be a career  yes he agreed smilingly its worth fighting for  her eyes were burning with a strange light as she looked down the vista of the wood road by which they had come he flung his cigarette into the water and took a step nearer her  how long have i known you he asked  she started  why its only a little more than a week she said  does it seem longer than that to you  yes admitted honora colouring i suppose its because weve been staying in the same house  it seems to me said mr spence that i have known you always  honora sat very still it passed through her brain without comment that there was a certain haunting familiarity about this remark some other voice in some other place had spoken it and in very much the same tone  youre the kind of girl i admire he declared ive been watching youmore than you have any idea of youre adaptable put you down any place and you take hold for instance its a marvellous thing to me how youve handled all the curiosities up there this week  oh i like people said honora they interest me and she laughed a little nervously she was aware that mr spence was making love in his own manner the new fork manner undoubtedly though what he said was changed by the new vibrations in his voice he was making love too with a characteristic lack of apology and with assurance she stole a glance at him and beheld the image of a dominating man of affairs he did not it is true evoke in her that extreme sensation which has been called a thrill she had read somewhere that women were always expecting thrills and never got them nevertheless she had not realized how close a bond of sympathy had grown between them until this sudden announcement of his going back to new york in a little while she too would be leaving for st louis the probability that she would never see him again seemed graver than she would have believed  will you miss me a little he asked  oh yes she said breathlessly and i shall be curious to know how youryour enterprise succeeds  honora he said it is only a week since i first met you but i know my own mind you are the woman i want and i think i may say without boasting that i can give you what you desire in lifeafter a while i love you you are young and just now i felt that perhaps i should have waited a year before speaking but i was afraid of missing altogether what i know to be the great happiness of my life will you marry me  she sat silent upon the rock she heard him speak it is true but try as she would the full significance of his words would not come to her she had indeed no idea that he would propose no notion that his heart was involved to such an extent he was very near her but he had not attempted to touch her his voice towards the end of his speech had trembled with passiona true note had been struck and she had struck it by no seeming effort he wished to marry her  he aroused her again  i have frightened you he said  she opened her eyes what he beheld in them was not frightit was nothing he had ever seen before for the first time in his life perhaps he was awed and seeing him helpless she put out her hands to him with a gesture that seemed to enhance her gift a thousandfold he had not realized what he was getting  i am not frightened she said yes i will marry you  he was not sure whetherso brief was the momenthe had held and kissed her cheek his arms were empty now and he caught a glimpse of her poised on the road above him amidst the quivering sunlit leaves looking back at him over her shoulder  he followed her but she kept nimbly ahead of him until they came out into the open golf course he tried to think but failed never in his orderly life had anything so precipitate happened to him he caught up with her devoured her with his eyes and beheld in marriage a delirium  honora he said thickly i cant grasp it  she gave him a quick look and a smile quivered at the corners of her mouth  what are you thinking of he asked  i am thinking of mrs holts expression when we tell her said honora but we shant tell her yet shall we howard well have it for our own secret a little while  the golf course being deserted he pressed her arm  well tell her whenever you like dear he replied  in spite of the fact that they drove joshuas trotter to lunchmuch too rapidly in the heat of the day they were late  i shall never be able to go in there and not give it away he whispered to her on the stairs  you look like the cheshire cat in the tree whispered honora laughing only more purple and not so ghostlike  i know im smiling replied howard i feel like it but i cant help it it wont come off i want to blurt out the news to every one in the diningroomto that little frenchman in particular  honora laughed again her imagination easily summoned up the tableau which such a proceeding would bring forth the incredulity the chagrin the indignation even in some quarters he conceived the household with the exception of the vicomte precipitating themselves into his arms  honora who was cool enough herself no doubt owing to the superior training which women receive in matters of deportment observed that his entrance was not a triumph of dissimulation his colour was high and his expression indeed a little idiotic and he declared afterwards that he felt like a sandwichman with the news printed in red letters before and behind honora knew that the intense improbability of the truth would save them and it did mrs holt remarked slyly that the game of golf must have hidden attractions and regretted that she was too old to learn it  we went very slowly on account of the heat howard declared  i should say that you had gone very rapidly from your face retorted mrs holt in relaxing moods she indulged in banter  honora stepped into the breach she would not trust her newly acquired fiance to extricate himself  we were both very much worried mrs holt she explained because we were late for lunch once before  i suppose ill have to forgive you my dear especially with that colour i am modern enough to approve of exercise for young girls and i am sure your aunt mary will think silverdale has done you good when i send you back to her  oh im sure she will said honora  in the meantime mr spence was concentrating all of his attention upon a jellied egg honora glanced at the vicomte he sat very stiff and his manner of twisting his mustache reminded her of an animal sharpening its claws it was at this moment that the butler handed her a telegram which with mrs holts permission she opened and read twice before the meaning of it came to her  i hope it is no bad news honora said mrs holt  its from peter erwin she replied still a little dazed hes in new york and hes corning up on the five oclock train to spend an hour with me  oh said susan i remember his picture on your bureau at sutcliffe he had such a good face and you told me about him  he is like my brother honora explained aware that howard was looking at her only he is much older than i he used to wheel me up and down when i was a baby he was an errand boy in the bank then and uncle tom took an interest in him and now he is a lawyer a very good one i believe  i have a great respect for any man who makes his own way in life said mrs holt and since he is such an old friend my dear you must ask him to spend the night  oh thank you mrs bolt honora answered  it was however with mingled feelings that she thought of peters arrival at this time life indeed was full of strange coincidences  there was a little door that led out of the house by the billiard room honora remembered and contrived after luncheon to slip away and reach it she felt that she must be alone and if she went to her room she was likely to be disturbed by susan or mrs joshuaor indeed mrs holt herself honora meant to tell susan the first of all she crossed the great lawn quickly keeping as much as possible the trees and masses of shrubbery between herself and the house and reached the forest with a really large fund of energy at her disposal honora had never been one to believe in the useless expenditure of it nor did she feel the intense desire which a girl of another temperament might have had under the same conditions to keep in motion so she sat down on a bench within the borders of the wood  it was not that she wished to reflect in the ordinary meaning of the word that she had sought seclusion but rather to give her imagination free play the enormity of the change that was to come into her life did not appall her in the least but she had in connection with it a sense of unreality which though not unpleasant she sought unconsciously to dissipate howard spence she reflected with a smile was surely solid and substantial enough and she thought of him the more tenderly for the possession of these attributes a castle founded on such a rock was not a castle in spain  it did not occur to honora that her thoughts might be more of the castle than of the rock of the heaven he was to hold on his shoulders than of the hercules she had chosen to hold it  she would write to her aunt mary and her uncle tom that very afternoonone letter to both tears came into her eyes when she thought of them and of their lonely life without her but they would come on to new york to visit her often and they would be proud of her of one thing she was sureshe must go home to them at onceon tuesday she would tell mrs holt tomorrow and susan tonight and while pondering over the probable expression of that ladys amazement it suddenly occurred to her that she must write the letter immediately because peter erwin was coming  what would he say should she tell him she was surprised to find that the idea of doing so was painful to her but she was aroused from these reflections by a step on the path and raised her head to perceive the vicomte his face wore an expression of triumph  at last he cried at last and he sat down on the bench beside her her first impulse was to rise yet for some inexplicable reason she remained  i always suspected in you the qualities of a monsieur lecoq she remarked you have an instinct for the chase  mon dieu he said i have risked a stroke of the sun to find you why should you so continually run away from me  to test your ingenuity vicomte  and that other onethe stockbrokeryou do not avoid him diable i am not blind mademoiselle it is plain to me at luncheon that you have made boil the sluggish blood of that one as for me  your boilingpoint is lower she said smiling  listen mademoiselle he pursued bending towards her it is not for my health that i stay here as i have told you it is for the sight of you for the sound of the music of that low voice it is in the hope that you will be a little kinder that you will understand me a little better and today when i learn that still another is on his way to see you i could sit still no longer i do not fear that spenceno but this otherwhat is he like  he is the best type of american replied honora i am sure you will be interested in him and like him  the vicomte shrugged his shoulders  it is not in america that you will find your destiny mademoiselle you are made to grace a salon a court which you will not find in this country such a woman as you is thrown away here you possess qualitiesyou will pardon mein which your countrywomen are lackingesprit imagination elan the power to bind people to you i have read you as you have not read yourself i have seen how you have served yourself by this famille holt and how at the same time you have kept their friendship  vicomte she exclaimed  ah do not get angry he begged such gifts are rarethey are sublime they lead he added raising his arms to the heights  honora was silent she was indeed not unmoved by his voice into which there was creeping a vibrant note of passion she was a little frightened but likewise puzzled and interested this was all so different from what she had expected of him what did he mean was she indeed like that  she was aware that he was speaking again that he was telling her of a chateau in france which his ancestors had owned since the days of louis xii a grey pile that stood upon a thickly wooded heighta chateau with a banquet hall where kings had dined with a chapel where kings had prayed with a flowering terrace high above a gleaming river it was there that his childhood had been passed and as he spoke she listened with mingled feelings picturing the pageantry of life in such a place  i tell you this mademoiselle he said that you may know i am not what you call an adventurer many of these alas come to your country and i ask you to regard with some leniency customs which must be strange to americans when we marry in france it is with a dot and especially is it necessary amongst the families of our nobility  honora rose the blood mounting to her temples  mademoiselle he cried do not misunderstand me i would die rather than hurt your feelings listen i pray it was to tell you frankly that i came to this country for that purposein order that i might live as my ancestors have lived with a hotel in paris but the chateau grace a dieu is not mortgaged nor am i wholly impoverished i have soixante quinze mille livres de rente which is fifteen thousand dollars a year in your money and which goes much farther in france at the proper time i will present these matters to your guardians i have lived but i have a heart and i love you madly rather would i dwell with you in provence where i will cultivate the soil of my forefathers than a palace on the champs elysees with another we can come to paris for two months at least for you i can throw my prospects out of the window with a light heart honorehow sweet is your name in my languagei love you to despair  he seized her hand and pressed it to his lips but she drew it gently away it seemed to her that he had made the very air quiver with feeling and she let herself wonder for a moment what life with him would be incredible as it seemed he had proposed to her a penniless girl her own voice was not quite steady as she answered him and her eyes were filled with compassion  vicomte she said i did not know that you cared for methat way i thoughti thought you were amusing yourself  amusing myself he exclaimed bitterly and youwere you amusing yourself  ii tried to avoid you she replied in a low voice  i am engaged  engaged he sprang to his feet engaged ah no i will not believe it you were engaged when you came here  she was no little alarmed by the violence which he threw into his words at the same time she was indignant and yet a mischievous sprite within her led her on to tell him the truth  no i am going to marry mr howard spence although i do not wish it announced  for a moment he stood motionless speechless staring at her and then he seemed to sway a little and to choke  no no he cried it cannot be my ears have deceived me i am not sane you are going to marry him ah you have sold yourself  monsieur de toqueville she said you forget yourself mr spence is an honourable man and i love him  the vicomte appeared to choke again and then suddenly he became himself although his voice was by no means natural his elaborate and ironic bow she remembered for many years  pardon mademoiselle he said and adieu you will be good enough to convey my congratulations to mr spence  with a kind of military about face he turned and left her abruptly and she watched him as he hurried across the lawn until he had disappeared behind the trees near the house when she sat down on the bench again she found that she was trembling a little was the unexpected to occur to her from now on was it true as the vicomte had said that she was destined to be loved amidst the play of drama  she felt sorry for him because he had loved her enough to fling to the winds his chances of wealth for her sakea sufficient measure of the feelings of one of his nationality and caste and she permitted for an instant her mind to linger on the supposition that howard spence had never come into her life might she not when the vicomte had made his unexpected and generous avowal have accepted him she thought of the romances of her childish days written at fever heat in which ladies with titles moved around and gave commands and rebuked lovers who slipped in through wicket gates and to think that she might have been a vicomtesse and have lived in a castle  a poor vicomtesse it is true     chapter xi what might have been  honora sat still upon the bench after an indefinite period she saw through the trees a vehicle on the driveway and in it a single passenger and suddenly it occurred to her that the passenger must be peter for mrs holt had announced her intention of sending for him she arose and approached the house not without a sense of agitation  she halted a moment at a little distance from the porch where he was talking with howard spence and joshua and the fact that he was an unchanged peter came to her with a shock of surprise so much in less than a year had happened to honora and the sight of him and the sound of his voice brought back with a rush memories of a forgotten past how long it seemed since she had lived in st louis  yes he was the same peter but her absence from him had served to sharpen her sense of certain characteristics he was lounging in his chair with his long legs crossed with one hand in his pocket and talking to these men as though he had known them always there was a quality about him which had never struck her before and which eluded exact definition it had never occurred to her until now when she saw him out of the element with which she had always associated him that peter erwin had a personality that personality was a mixture of simplicity and selfrespect andcommon sense and as honora listened to his cheerful voice she perceived that he had the gift of expressing himself clearly and forcibly and withal modestly nor did it escape her that the other two men were listening with a certain deference in her sensitive state she tried to evade the contrast thus suddenly presented to her between peter and the man she had promised that very morning to marry  howard spence was seated on the table smoking a cigarette never it seemed had he more distinctly typified to her prosperity an attribute which she had admired in him of strife without the appearance of strife lost something of its value to look at peter was to wonder whether there could be such a thing as a wellgroomed combatant and until today she had never thought of peter as a combatant the sight of his lean face summoned all undesired the vague vision of an ideal and perhaps it was this that caused her voice to falter a little as she came forward and called his name he rose precipitately  what a surprise peter she said as she took his hand how do you happen to be in the east  an errand boy he replied somebody had to come so they chose me incidentally he added smiling down at her it is a part of my education  we thought you were lost said howard spence significantly  oh no she answered lightly evading his look i was on the bench at the edge of the wood she turned again to peter how good of you to come up and see me  i couldnt have resisted that he declared if it were only for an hour  ive been trying to persuade him to stay a while with us joshua put in with unusual graciousness my mother will be disappointed not to see you  there is nothing i should like better mr holt said peter simply gazing off across the lawn unfortunately i have to leave for the west tonight  before you go said honora you must see this wonderful place come well begin with the garden  she had a desire now to take him away by himself something she had wished an hour ago to avoid  wouldnt you like a runabout suggested joshua hospitably  honora thanked him  im sure mr erwin would rather walk she replied  come peter you must tell me all the news of home  spence accepted his dismissal with a fairly good grace and gave no evidence of jealousy he put his hand on peters shoulder  if youre ever in new york erwin said he look me up dallam and spence were members of the exchange so you wont have any trouble in finding us id like to talk to you sometime about the west  peter thanked him  for a little while as they went down the driveway side by side he was meditatively silent she wondered what he thought of howard spence until suddenly she remembered that her secret was still her own that peter had as yet no particular reason to single out mr spence for especial consideration she could not however resist saying new yorkers are like that  like what he asked  she coloured  likemr spence a littleselfassertive sure of themselves she strove to keep out of her voice any suspicion of the agitation which was the result of the events of an extraordinary day not yet ended she knew that it would have been wiser not to have mentioned howard but peters silence somehow had impelled her to speak he has made quite an unusual success for so young a man  peter looked at her and shook his head  new yorksuccess what is to become of poor old st louis he inquired  oh im going back next week honora cried i wish i were going with you  and leave all this he said incredulously for trolley rides and forest park andand me  he stopped in the garden path and looked upon the picture she made standing in the sunlight against the blazing borders her wide hat casting a shadow on her face and the smile which she had known so well since childhood indulgent quizzical with a touch of sadness was in his eyes she was conscious of a slight resentment was there in fact no change in her as the result of the events of those momentous ten months since she had seen him and rather than a tolerance in which there was neither antagonism nor envy she would have preferred from peter an open disapproval of luxury of the standards which he implied were hers she felt that she had stepped into another world but he refused to be dazzled by it he insisted upon treating her as the same honora  how did you leave uncle tom and aunt mary she asked  they were counting the days he said until she should return but they did not wish to curtail her visit they did not expect her next week he knew  honora coloured again  i feelthat i ought to go to them she said  he glanced at her as though her determination to leave silverdale so soon surprised him  they will be very happy to see you honora he said they have been very lonesome  she softened some unaccountable impulse prompted her to ask and you have you missed mea little  he did not answer and she saw that he was profoundly affected she laid a hand upon his arm  oh peter i didnt mean that she cried i know you have and i have missed youterribly it seems so strange seeing you here she went on hurriedly there are so many things i want to show you tell me how it happened hat you came on to new york  somebody in the firm had to come he said  in the firm she repeated she did not grasp the full meaning of this change in his status but she remembered that uncle tom had predicted it one day and that it was an honour i never knew any one so secretive about their own affairs why didnt you write me you had been admitted to the firm so you are a partner of judge brice  brice graves and erwin said peter it sounds very grand doesnt it i cant get used to it myself  and what made you call yourself an errand boy she exclaimed reproachfully when i go back to the house i intend to tell joshua holt andand mr spence that you are a great lawyer  peter laughed  youd better wait a few years before you say that said he  he took an interest in everything he saw in mr holts flowers in joshuas cow barn which they traversed and declared if he were ever rich enough he would live in the country they walked around the pondfringed now with yellow waterlilies on their floating green padsthrough the woods and when the shadows were lengthening came out at the little summerhouse over the valley of silver brookthe scene of that first memorable encounter with the vicomte at the sight of it the episode and much else of recent happening rushed back into honoras mind and she realized with suddenness that she had in his companionship unconsciously been led far afield and in pleasant places comparisons seemed inevitable  she watched him with an unwonted tugging at her heart as he stood for a long time by the edge of the railing gazing over the treetops of the valley towards the distant hazy hills nor did she understand what it was in him that now on this day of days when she had definitely cast the die of life when she had chosen her path aroused this strange emotion why had she never felt it before she had thought his face homelynow it seemed to shine with a transfiguring light she recalled with a pang that she had criticised his clothes today they seemed the expression of the man himself incredible is the range of human emotion she felt a longing to throw herself into his arms and to weep there  he turned at length from the view  how wonderful he said  i didnt knowyou cared for nature so much peter  he looked at her strangely and put out his hand and drew her unresisting to the bench beside him  are you in trouble honora he asked  oh no she cried oh no i amvery happy  you may have thought it odd that i should have come here without knowing mrs holt he said gravely particularly when you were going home so soon i do not know myself why i came i am a matteroffact person but i acted on an impulse  an impulse she faltered avoiding the troubled searching look in his eyes  yes he said an impulse i can call it by no other name i should have taken a train that leaves new york at noon but i had a feeling this morning which seemed almost like a presentiment that i might be of some use to you  this morning she felt herself trembling and she scarcely recognized peter with such words on his lips i am happyindeed i am onlyi am overwroughtseeing you againand you made me think of home  it was no doubt very foolish of me he declared and if my coming has upset you  oh no she cried please dont think so it has given me a sense ofof security that you were ready to help me ifif i needed you  you should always have known that he replied he rose and stood gazing off down the valley once more and she watched him with her heart beating with a sense of an impending crisis which she seemed powerless to stave off and presently he turned to her honora i have loved you for many years he said you were too young for me to speak of it i did not intend to speak of it when i came here today for many years i have hoped that some day you might be my wife my one fear has been that i might lose you perhapsperhaps it has been a dream but i am willing to wait should you wish to see more of the world you are young yet and i am offering myself for all time there is no other woman for me and never can be  he paused and smiled down at her but she did not speak she could not  i know he went on that you are ambitious and with your gifts i do not blame you i cannot offer you great wealth but i say with confidence that i can offer you something better something surer i can take care of you and protect you and i will devote my life to your happiness will you marry me  her eyes were sparkling with tearstears he remembered afterwards that were like blue diamonds  oh peter she cried i wish i could i have alwayswished that i could i cant  you cant  she shook her head  ii have told no one yetnot even aunt mary i am going to marry mr spence  for a long time he was silent and she did not dare to look at the suffering in his face  honora he said at last my most earnest wish in life will be for your happiness and whatever may come to you i hope that you will remember that i am your friend to be counted on and that i shall not change will you remember that  yes she whispered she looked at him now and through the veil of her tears she seemed to see his soul shining in his eyes the tones of a distant church bell were borne to them on the valley breeze  peter glanced at his watch  i am afraid he said that i havent time to go back to the housemy train goes at seven can i get down to the village through the valley  honora pointed out the road faintly perceptible through the trees beneath them  and you will apologize for my departure to mrs holt  she nodded he took her hand pressed it and was gone and presently in a little clearing far below he turned and waved his hat at her bravely     chapter xii which contains a surprise for mrs holt  how long she sat gazing with unseeing eyes down the valley honora did not know distant mutterings of thunder aroused her the evening sky had darkened and angrylooking clouds of purple were gathering over the hills she rose and hurried homeward she had thought to enter by the billiardroom door and so gain her own chamber without encountering the household but she had reckoned without her hostess beyond the billiard room in the little entry filled with potted plants she came face to face with that lady who was inciting a footman to further efforts in his attempt to close a recalcitrant skylight honora proved of more interest and mrs holt abandoned the skylight  why my dear she said where have you been all afternoon  ii have been walking with mr erwin mrs holt i have been showing him silverdale  and where is he it seems to me i invited him to stay all night and joshua tells me he extended the invitation  we were in the little summerhouse and suddenly he discovered that it was late and he had to catch the seven oclock train faltered honora somewhat disconnectedly otherwise he would have come to you himself and told youhow much he regretted not staying he has to go to st louis tonight  well said mrs holt this is an afternoon of surprises the vicomte has gone off too without even waiting to say goodby  the vicomte exclaimed honora  didnt you see him either before he left inquired mrs holt i thought perhaps you might be able to give me some further explanation of it  i exclaimed honora she felt ready to sink through the floor and mrs holts delftblue eyes haunted her afterwards like a nightmare  didnt you see him my dear didnt he tell you anything  hehe didnt say he was going away  did he seem disturbed about anything mrs holt insisted  now i think of it he did seem a little disturbed  to save my life said mrs holt i cant understand it he left a note for me saying that he had received a telegram and that he had to go at once i was at a meeting of my charity board it seems a very strange proceeding for such an agreeable and polite man as the vicomte although he had his drawbacks as all continentals have and at times i thought he was grave and moodydidnt you  oh yes he was moody honora agreed eagerly  you noticed it too said mrs holt but he was a charming man and so interested in america and in the work we are doing but i cant understand about the telegram i had carroll inquire of every servant in the house and there is no knowledge of a telegram having come up from the village this afternoon  perhaps the vicomte might have met the messenger in the grounds hazarded honora  at this point their attention was distracted by a noise that bore a striking resemblance to a suppressed laugh the footman on the stepladder began to rattle the skylight vigorously  what on earth is the matter with you woods said mrs holt  it must have been some dust off the skylight madam that got into my throat he stammered the colour of a geranium  nonsense said mrs holt there is no dust on the skylight  it may be i swallowed the wrong way looking up like as i was madam he ventured rubbing the frame and looking at his finger to prove his former theory  you are very stupid not to be able to close it she declared in a few minutes the place will be flooded tell carroll to come and do it  honora suffered herself to be led limply through the library and up the stairs into mrs holts own boudoir where a maid was closing the windows against the first great drops of the storm which the wind was pelting against them she drew the shades deftly lighted the gas and retired honora sank down in one of the upholstered light blue satin chairs and gazed at the shining brass of the coal grate set in the marble mantel above which hung an engraving of sir joshua reynolds cherubs she had an instinct that the climax of the drama was at hand  mrs holt sat down in the chair opposite  my dear she began i told you the other day what an unexpected and welcome comfort and help you have been to me you evidently inherit mrs holt coughed slightly the art of entertaining and pleasing and i need not warn you my dear against the dangers of such a gift your aunt has evidently brought you up with strictness and religious care you have been very fortunate  indeed i have mrs holt echoed honora in bewilderment  and susan continued mrs holt useful and willing as she is does not possess your gift of taking people off my hands and entertaining them  honora could think of no reply to this her eyesto which no one could be indifferentwere riveted on the face of her hostess and how was the good lady to guess that her brain was reeling  i was about to say my dear that i expect to have a great deal ofwell of rather difficult company this summer next week for instance some prominent women in the working girls relief society are coming and on july the twentythird i give a garden party for the delegates to the charity conference in new york the japanese minister has promised to pay me a visit and sir rupert grant who built those remarkable tuberculosis homes in england you know is arriving in august with his family then there are some foreign artists  oh mrs holt exclaimed honora how many interesting people you see  exactly my dear and i thought that in addition to the fact that i have grown very fond of you you would be very useful to me here and that a summer with me might not be without its advantages as your aunt will have you until you are married which i may say without denying your attractions is likely to be for some time i intend to write to her tonightwith your consentand ask her to allow you to remain with me all summer  honora sat transfixed staring painfully at the big pendant earrings  it is so kind of you mrs holt she faltered  i can realize my dear that you would wish to get back to your aunt the feeling does you infinite credit but on the other hand besides the advantages which would accrue to you it might to put the matter delicately be of a little benefit to your relations who will have to think of your future  indeed it is good of you but i must go back mrs holt  of course said mrs holt with a touch of dignityfor ere now people had left silverdale before she wished them toof course if you do not care to stay that is quite another thing  oh mrs holt dont say that cried honora her face burning i cannot thank you enough for the pleasure you have given me ifif things were different i would stay with you gladly although i should miss my family but nownow i feel that i must be with them ii am engaged to be married  honora still remembers the blank expression which appeared on the countenance of her hostess when she spoke these words mrs holts cheeks twitched her earrings quivered and her bosom heavedonce  engaged to be married she gasped  yes replied our heroine humbly i was going to tell youtomorrow  i suppose said mrs holt after a silence it is to the young man who was here this afternoon and whom i did not see it accounts for his precipitate departure but i must say honora since frankness is one of my faults that i feel it my duty to write to your aunt and disclaim all responsibility  it is not to mr erwin said honora meekly it isit is to mr spence  mrs holt seemed to find difficulty in speaking her former symptoms which honora had come to recognize as indicative of agitation returned with alarming intensity and when at length her voice made itself heard it was scarcely recognizable  you are engagedtohoward spence  oh mrs holt exclaimed honora it was as great a surprise to mebelieve meas it is to you  but even the knowledge that they shared a common amazement did not appear at once to assuage mrs holts emotions  do you love him she demanded abruptly  whereupon honora burst into tears  oh mrs holt she sobbed how can you ask  from this time on the course of events was not precisely logical mrs holt setting in abeyance any ideas she may have had about the affair took honora in her arms and against that ample bosom was sobbed out the pentup excitement and emotion of an extraordinary day  there there my dear said mrs holt stroking the dark hair i should not have asked you thatforgive me and the worthy lady quivering with sympathy now remembered the time of her own engagement to joshua and the fact that the circumstances of that event differed somewhat from those of the presentin regularity at least increased rather than detracted from mrs holts sudden access of tenderness the perplexing questions as to the probable result of such a marriage were swept away by a flood of feeling there there my dear i did not mean to be harsh what you told me was such a shocksuch a surprise and marriage is such a grave and sacred thing  i know it sobbed honora  and you are very young  yes mrs holt  and it happened in my house  no said honora it happenednear the golf course  mrs holt smiled and wiped her eyes  i mean my dear that i shall always feel responsible for bringing you togetherfor your future happiness that is a great deal i could have wished that you both had taken longer to reflect but i hope with all my heart that you will be happy  honora lifted up a tearstained face  he said it was because i was going away thatthat he spoke she said oh mrs holt i knew that you would be kind about it  of course i am kind about it my dear said mrs holt as i told you i have grown to have an affection for you i feel a little as though you belonged to me and after thisthis event i expect to see a great deal of you howard spences mother was a very dear friend of mine i was one of the first who knew her when she came to new york from troy a widow to educate her son she was a very fine and a very courageous woman mrs holt paused a moment she hoped that howard would be a lawyer  a lawyer honora repeated  i lost sight of him for several years continued mrs holt but before i invited him here i made some inquiries about him from friends of mine in the financial world i find that he is successful for so young a man and well thought of i have no doubt he will make a good husband my dear although i could wish he were not on the stock exchange and i hope you will make him happy  whereupon the good lady kissed honora and dismissed her to dress for dinner  i shall write to your aunt at once she said           requited love unsettled condition that it is supposed to bring did not interfere with howard spences appetite at dinner his spirits as usual were of the best and from time to time honora was aware of his glance then she lowered her eyes she sat as in a dream and try as she might her thoughts would not range themselves she seemed to see him but dimly to hear what he said faintly and it conveyed nothing to her mind  this man was to be her husband over and over she repeated it to herself his name was howard spence and he was on the highroad to riches and success and she was to live in new york ten days before he had not existed for her she could not bring herself to believe that he existed now did she love him how could she love him when she did not realize him one thing she knew that she had loved him that morning  the fetters of her past life were broken and this she would not realize she had opened the door of the cage for what these were the fragments of thoughts that drifted through her mind like tattered clouds across an empty sky after a storm peter erwin appeared to her more than once and he was strangely real but he belonged to the past course succeeded course and she talked subconsciously to mr holt and joshuasuch is the result of feminine training  after dinner she stood on the porch the rain had ceased a cool damp breeze shook the drops from the leaves and the stars were shining presently at the sound of a step behind her she started he was standing at her shoulder  honora he said  she did not move  honora i havent seen youalonesince morning it seems like a thousand years honora  yes  did you mean it  did i mean what  when you said youd marry me his voice trembled a little ive been thinking of nothing but you all day youre notsorry you havent changed your mind  she shook her head  at dinner when you wouldnt look at me and this afternoon  no im not sorry she said cutting him short im not sorry  he put his arm about her with an air that was almost apologetic and seeing that she did not resist he drew her to him and kissed her suddenly unaccountably to her she clung to him  you love me he exclaimed  yes she whispered but i am tired ii am going upstairs howard i am tired  he kissed her again  i cant believe it he said ill make you a queen and well be married in the autumn honora he nodded boyishly towards the open windows of the library shall i tell them he asked i feel like shouting it i cant hold on much longer i wonder what the old lady will say  honora disengaged herself from his arms and fled to the screen door as she opened it she turned and smiled back at him  mrs holt knows already she said  and catching her skirt she flew quickly up the stairs      book ii volume 3    chapter i so long as ye both shall live  it was late november and as honora sat at the window of the drawingroom of the sleeping car life seemed as fantastic and unreal as the mosshung southern forest into which she stared she was happy as a child is happy who is taken on an excursion into the unknown the monotony of existence was at last broken and riven the circumscribing walls limitless possibilities lay ahead  the emancipation had not been without its pangs of sorrow and there were moments of retrospectionas now she saw herself on uncle toms arm walking up the aisle of the old church how many sundays of her life had she sat watching a shaft of sunlight strike across the stone pillars of its gothic arches she saw in the chancel tall and grave and pale peter erwin standing beside the man with the flushed face who was to be her husband she heard again the familiar voice of dr ewing reciting the words of that wonderful introduction at other weddings she had been moved why was her own so unrealizable     honora wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband to live    together after gods ordinance in the holy state of matrimony wilt    thou obey him and serve him love honour and keep him in sickness    and in health and forsaking all others keep thee only unto him    so long as ye both shall live  she had promised and they were walking out of the church facing the great rose window with its blended colours and the vaults above were ringing now with the volume of an immortal march  after that an illogical series of events and pictures passed before her she was in a corner of the carriage her veil raised gazing at her husband who had kissed her passionately he was there beside her looking extremely well in his top hat and frockcoat with a white flower in his buttonhole he was the representative of the future she had deliberately chosen and yet by virtue of the strange ceremony through which they had passed he seemed to have changed in her attempt to seize upon a reality she looked out of the window they were just passing the hanbury mansion in wayland square and her eyes fell upon the playroom windows under the wide cornice and she wondered whether the dolls house were still in its place its mute inhabitants waiting to be called by the names she had given them and quickened into life once more  next she recalled the arrival at the little house that had been her home summer and winter for so many years of her life a red and white awning stretching up the length of the walk which once had run beside the tall pear trees gave it an unrecognizable gala air long had it stood there patient unpretentious content that the great things should pass it by and now modest still it had been singled out from amongst its neighbours and honoured was it honoured it seemed to honora so fanciful this day that its unwonted air of festival was unnatural why should the hour of departure from such a harbour of peace be celebrated  she was standing beside her husband in the little parlour while carriage doors slammed in the dusk outside while one by onea pageant of the past which she was leaving forever the friends of her childhood came and went laughter and tears and kisses and then in no time at all she found herself changing for the journey in the little house under the hill there locked up in the little desk cousin eleanor had given her long ago was the unfinished manuscript of that novel written at fever heat during those summer days in which she had sought to escape from a humdrum existence and nowshe had escaped aunt mary helpful under the most trying circumstances was putting her articles in a bag the initials on which she did not recognizeh l shonora leffingwell spence while old catherine tearful and inefficient knelt before her fumbling at her shoes honora bending over took the face of the faithful old servant and kissed it  dont feel badly catherine she said ill be coming back often to see you and you will be coming to see me  will ye darlint the blessing of god be on you for those wordsand you to be such a fine lady it always was a fine lady ye were with such a family and such a bringin up and now yeve married a rich man as is right and proper if its rich as croesus he was hed be none too good for you  catherine said aunt mary reprovingly what ideas you put into the childs head  sure miss mary cried catherine its always the great lady she was and she a wee bit of a thing and wasnt it yerself miss mary that dressed her like a princess  then came the goodbysthe real ones uncle tom always the friend of young people was surrounded by a group of bridesmaids in the hall she clung to him and peter who had the carriage ready what would her wedding have been without peter as they drove towards the station his was the image that remained persistently in her mind bareheaded on the sidewalk in the light of the carriage lamps the image of struggle  she had married prosperity a whimsical question that shocked her irresistibly presented itself was it not prosperity that she had promised to love honour and obey  it must not be thought that honora was by any means discontented with her prosperity he was newthat was all howard looked new but she remembered that he had always looked new such was one of his greatest charms in the long summer days since she had bade him goodby on her way through new york from silverdale honora had constructed him he was perpetual yet sophisticated youth he was finance and fashion he was power in correctly cut clothes and when he had arrived in st louis to play his part in the wedding festivities she had found her swan a swan indeedhe was all that she had dreamed of him and she had tingled with pride as she introduced him to her friends or gazed at him across the flowerladen table as he sat beside edith hanbury at the bridesmaids dinner in wayland square  the wedding ceremony had somehow upset her opinion of him but honora regarded this change as temporary julius caesar or george washington himself must have been somewhat ridiculous as bridegrooms and she had the sense to perceive that her own agitations as a bride were partly responsible no matter how much a young girl may have trifled with that electric force in the male sex known as the grand passion she shrinks from surrendering herself to its dominion honora shrank he made love to her on the way to the station and she was terrified he actually forgot to smoke cigarettes what he said was to the effect that he possessed at last the most wonderful and beautiful woman in the world and she resented the implication of possession  nevertheless in the glaring lights of the station her courage and her pride in him revived and he became again a normal and a marked man although the sex may resent it few women are really indifferent to clothes and howards wellfitting check suit had the magic touch of the metropolis his manner matched his garments obsequious porters grasped his pigskin bag and seized honoras the man at the gate inclined his head as he examined their tickets and the pullman conductor himself showed them their stateroom and plainly regarded them as important people far from home howard had the cosmopolitan air he gave the man a dollar and remarked that the new orleans train was not exactly the chicago and new york limited  not by a long shot agreed the conductor as he went out softly closing the door behind him  whereupon the cosmopolitan air dropped from mr howard spence not gracefully and he became once more that superfluous and awkward and utterly banal individual the husband  lets go out and walk on the platform until the train starts suggested honora desperately oh howard the shades are up im sure i saw some one looking in  he laughed but there was a light in his eyes that frightened her and she deemed his laughter out of place was he after all an utterly different man than what she had thought him still laughing he held to her wrist with one hand and with the other pulled down the shades  this is good enough for me he said at lastat last he whispered all the red tape is over and ive got you to myself do you love me just a little honora  of course i do she faltered still struggling her face burning as from a fire  then whats the matter he demanded  i dont knowi want air howard please let me go itsits so hot inhere you must let me go  her release she felt afterwards was due less to a physical than a mental effort she seemed suddenly to have cowed him and his resistance became enfeebled she broke from him and opened the door and reached the cement platform and the cold air when he joined her there was something jokingly apologetic about his manner and he was smoking a cigarette and she could not help thinking that she would have respected him more if he had held her  women beat me he said theyre the most erratic stock in the market  it is worthy of remark how soon the human and especially the feminine brain adjusts itself to new conditions in a day or two life became real again or rather romantic  for the american husband in his proper place is an auxiliary who makes all things possible his ability to get things done before it ceases to be a novelty is a quality to be admired honora admired an intimacyif the word be not too strongsprang up between them they wandered through the quaint streets of new orleans that most foreign of american cities searching out the tumbledown french houses and honora was never tired of imagining the romances and tragedies which must have taken place in them the new scenes excited herthe quaint cafes with their delicious peppery creole cookingand she would sit talking for a quarter of an hour at a time with alphonse who outdid himself to please the palate of a lady with such allure he called her madame but well he knew this student of human kind that the title had not been of long duration  madame came from new york without doubt such was one of his questions as he stood before them in answer to howards summons rubbing his hands and honora with a little thrill acknowledged the accuracy of his guess there was no dish of alphonses they did not taste and howard smilingly paid the bills he was ecstatically proud of his wife and although he did justice to the cooking he cared but little for the mysterious courtyards the spanish buildings and the novels of mr george w cable which honora devoured when she was too tired to walk about he followed her obediently to the battle field of new orleans and admired as obediently the sunset when the sky was all silvergreen through the magnolias and the spreading live oaks hung with spanish moss and a silver bar lay upon the father of waters honora with beating heart and flushed cheeks felt these things howard felt them through her and watchednot the sunsetbut the flame it lighted in her eyes  he left her but twice a day and then only for brief periods he even felt a joy when she ventured to complain  i believe you care more for those horrid stocks than for me she said ii am just a novelty  his answer since they were alone in their sittingroom was obvious  howard she cried how mean of you now ill have to do my hair all over again ive got such a lot of ityouve no idea how difficult it is  you bet i have he declared meaningly and honora blushed  his pleasure of possession was increased when people turned to look at her on the street or in the dining roomto think that this remarkable creature was in reality his wife nor did the feeling grow less intense with time being quite the same when they arrived at a fashionable resort in the virginia mountains on their way to new york for such were the exactions of his calling that he could spare but two weeks for his honeymoon  honoras interest in her new surroundings was as great and the sight of those towering ridges against the soft blue of the autumn skies inspired her it was indian summer here the tang of wood smoke was in the air in the valleysas they drovethe haze was shot with the dust of gold and through the gaps they looked across vast unexplored valleys to other distant bluestained ridges that rose between them and the sunset honora took an infinite delight in the ramshackle cabins beside the redclay roads in the historic atmosphere of the ancient houses and porticoes of the warm springs where the fathers of the republic had come to take the waters and one day when a north wind had scattered the smoke and swept the sky howard followed her up the paths to the ridges crest where she stood like a victory her garments blowing gazing off over the mighty billows to the westward howard had never seen a victory but his vision of domesticity was untroubled  although it was late in the season the oldfashioned rambling hotel was well filled and people interested honora as well as scenerya proof of her human qualities she chided howard because he too was not more socially inclined  how can you expect me to benow he demanded  she told him he was a goose although secretly admitting the justice of his defence he knew four or five men in the hotel with whom he talked stocks while waiting for honora to complete her toilets and he gathered from two of these who were married that patience was a necessary qualification in a husband one evening they introduced their wives later howard revealed their identityor rather that of the husbands  bowker is one of the big men in the faith insurance company and tyler is president of the gotham trust he paused to light a cigarette and smiled at her significantly if you can dolly the ladies along once in a while honora it wont do any harm he added you have a way with you you knowwhen you want to  honora grew scarlet  howard she exclaimed  he looked somewhat shamefaced  well he said i was only joking dont take it seriously but it doesnt do any harm to be polite  i am always polite she answered a little coldly  honeymoons after all are matters of conjecture and what proportion of them contain disenchantments will never be known honora lay awake for a long time that night and the poignant and ever recurring remembrance of her husbands remark sent the blood to her face like a flame would peter or george hanbury or any of the intimate friends of her childhood have said such a thing  a new and wistful feeling of loneliness was upon her for some days with a certain sense of isolation and a tinge of envy which she would not acknowledge she had been watching a group of welldressed cleanlooking people galloping off on horseback or filling the sixseated buckboards they were from new yorkthat she had discovered and they did not mix with the others in the hotel she had thought it strange that howard did not know them but for a reason which she did not analyze she hesitated to ask him who they were they had rather a rude manner of staringespecially the menand the air of deriving infinite amusement from that which went on about them one of them a young man with a lisp who was addressed by the singular name of toots she had overheard demanding as she passed who the deuce was the tall girl with the dark hair and the colour wherever she went she was aware of them it was foolish she knew but their presence seemedin the magnitude which trifles are wont to assume in the nightwatchesof late to have poisoned her pleasure  enlightenment as to the identity of these disturbing persons came the next day from an unexpected source indeed from mrs tyler she loved brides she said and honora seemed to her such a sweet bride it was mrs tylers ambition to become thin which was hitching her wagon to a star with a vengeance and she invited our heroine to share her constitutional on the porch honora found the proceeding in the nature of an ordeal for mrs tylers legs were short her frizzled hair very blond and the fact that it was natural made it seem somehow all the more damning  they had scarcely begun to walk before honora with a sense of dismay of which she was ashamed beheld some of the people who had occupied her thoughts come out of the door and form a laughing group at the end of the porch she could not rid herself of the feeling that they were laughing at her she tried in vain to drive them from her mind to listen to mrs tylers account of how she too came as a bride to new york from some place with a classical name and to the advice that accompanied the narration the most conspicuous young woman in the group in riding clothes was seated on the railing with the toe of one boot on the ground her profile was clearcut and her chestnut hair tightly knotted behind under her hat every time they turned this young woman stared at honora amusedly  nasty thing exclaimed mrs tyler suddenly and unexpectedly in the midst of a description of the delights of life in the metropolis  who asked honora  that young mrs freddy maitland sitting on the rail shes the rudest woman in new york  a perversity of spirit which she could not control prompted honora to reply  why i think she is so goodlooking mrs tyler and she seems to have so much individuality and independence  there cried mrs tyler triumphantly oncenot so very long agoi was just as inexperienced as you my dear she belongs to that horribly fast set with which no selfrespecting woman would be seen its an outrage that they should come to a hotel like this and act as though it belonged to them she knows me quite as well as i know her but when i am face to face she acts as though i was air  honora could not help thinking that this at least required some imagination on mrs maitlands part mrs tyler had stopped for breath  i have been introduced to her twice she continued but of course i wouldnt speak to her the little man with the lisp next to her who is always acting in that silly way they call toots cuthbert he gets his name in the newspapers by leading cotillons in new york and newport and the tall slim blond one with the green hat and the feather in it is jimmy wing hes the son of james wing the financier  i went to school at sutcliffe with his sister said honora  it seemed to honora that mrs tylers manner underwent a change  my dear she exclaimed did you go to sutcliffe what a wonderful school it is i fully intend to send my daughter louise there  an almost irresistible desire came over honora to run away she excused herself instead and hurried back towards her room on the way she met howard in the corridor and he held a telegram in his hand  ive got some bad news honora he said that is bad from the point of view of our honeymoon sid dallam is swamped with business and wants me in new york im afraid weve got to cut it short  to his astonishment she smiled  oh im so glad howard she cried ii dont like this place nearly so well as new orleans there areso many people here  he looked relieved and patted her on the arm  well go tonight old girl he said     chapter ii stafford park  there is a terrifying aspect of all great cities rome with its leviathan aqueducts its seething tenements clinging to the hills its cruel shining palatine must have overborne the provincial traveller coming up from ostia and honora as she stood on the deck of the ferryboat approaching new york for the second time in her life could not overcome a sense of oppression it was on a sharp december morning and the steam of the hurrying craft was dazzling white in the early sun above and beyond the city rose overpowering a very different city somehow than that her imagination had first drawn each of that multitude of vast towers seemed a fortress now manned by celt and hun and israelite and saxon captained by titans and the strife between them was on a scale never known in the world before a strife with modern arms and modern methods and modern brains in which there was no mercy  hidden somewhere amidst those bristling miles of masonry to the northward of the towers was her future home her mind dwelt upon it now for the first time and tried to construct it once she had spoken to howard of it but he had smiled and avoided discussion what would it be like to have a house of ones own in new york a house on fifth avenue as her girl friends had said when they laughingly congratulated her and begged her to remember that they came occasionally to new york those of us who like honora believe in providence do not trouble ourselves with mere matters of dollars and cents this morning however the huge material towers which she gazed upon seemed stronger than providence and she thought of her husband was his fibre sufficiently tough to become eventually the captain of one of those fortresses to compete with the maitlands and the wings and others she knew by name calmly and efficiently intrenched there  the boat was approaching the slip and he came out to her from the cabin where he had been industriously reading the stock reports his newspapers thrust into his overcoat pocket  theres no place like new york after all he declared and added when the markets up well go to a hotel for breakfast  for some reason she found it difficult to ask the question on her lips  i suppose she said hesitatingly i suppose we couldnt gohome howard youyou have never told me where we are to live  as before the reference to their home seemed to cause him amusement he became very mysterious  couldnt you pass away a few hours shopping this morning my dear  oh yes replied honora  while i gather in a few dollars he continued ill meet you at lunch and then well gohome  as the sun mounted higher her spirits rose with it new york or that strip of it which is known to the more fortunate of human beings is a place to raise ones spirits on a sparkling day in early winter and honora as she drove in a hansom from shop to shop felt a new sense of elation and independence she was at one now with the prosperity that surrounded her her purse no longer limited her whims existing only to be gratified her reflections on this recently attained state alternated with alluring conjectures on the place of abode of which howard had made such a mystery where was it and why had he insisted before showing it to her upon waiting until afternoon  newly arrayed in the most becoming of grey furs she met him at that hitherto fabled restaurant which in future daysshe reflectedwas to become so familiardelmonicos howard was awaiting her in the vestibule and it was not without a little quiver of timidity and excitement and a consequent rise of colour that she followed the waiter to a table by the window she felt as though the assembled fashionable world was staring at her but presently gathered courage enough to gaze at the costumes of the women and the faces of the men howard with a sang froid of which she felt a little proud ordered a meal for which he eventually paid a fraction over eight dollars what would aunt mary have said to such extravagance he produced a large bunch of violets  with sid dallams love he said as she pinned them on her gown i tried to get lilymrs sidfor lunch but you never can put your finger on her shell amuse you honora  oh howard its so much pleasanter lunching alone today im glad you didnt and then afterwards  he refused however to be drawn when they emerged she did not hear the directions he gave the cabman and it was not until they turned into a narrow side street which became dingier and dingier as they bumped their way eastward that she experienced a sudden sinking sensation  howard she cried where are you going you must tell me  one of the prettiest suburbs in new jerseyrivington he said wait till you see the house  suburbs rivington new jersey the words swam before honoras eyes like the great signs she had seen printed in black letters on the tall buildings from the ferry that morning she had a sickening sensation and the odour of his cigarette in the cab became unbearable by an ironic trick of her memory she recalled that she had told the clerks in the shops where she had made her purchases that she would send them her address later how different that address from what she had imagined it  its in the country she exclaimed  to lunch at delmonicos for eight dollars and live in rivington  howard appeared disturbed more than that he appeared astonished solicitous  why whats the matter honora he asked i thought youd like it its a brand new house and i got lily dallam to furnish it shes a wonder on that sort of thing and i told her to go aheadwithin reason i talked it over with your aunt and uncle and they agreed with me youd much rather live out there for a few years than in a flat  in a flat repeated honora with a shudder  certainly he said flicking his ashes out of the window who do you think i am at my age frederick t maitland or the owner of the brougham building  buthoward she protested why didnt you talk it over with me  because i wanted to surprise you he replied i spent a month and a half looking for that house and you never seemed to care it didnt occur to me that you would carefor the first few years he added and there was in his voice a note of reproach that did not escape her you never seemed inclined to discuss business with me honora i didnt think you were interested dallam and i are making money we expect some day to be on easy streetso to speakor fifth avenue some day i hope you can show some of these people the road but just now what capital we have has to go into the business  strangely enough in spite of the intensity of her disappointment she felt nearer to her husband in that instant than at any time since their marriage honora who could not bear to hurt any ones feelings seized his hand repentantly tears started in her eyes  oh howard i must seem to you very ungrateful she cried it was such asuch a surprise i have never lived in the country and im sure it will be delightfuland much more healthful than the city wont you forgive me  if he had known as much about the fluctuations of the feminine temperament as of those of stocks the ease with which honora executed this complete change of front might have disturbed him howard as will be seen possessed that quality which is loosely called good nature in marriage he had been told and was ready to believe the wind blew where it listed and he was a wise husband who did not spend his time in inquiry as to its sources he kissed her before he helped her out of the carriage again they crossed the north river and he led her through the wooden ferry house on the new jersey side to where the rivington train was standing beside a platform shed  there was no parlour car men and womenmostly womenwith bundles were already appropriating the seats and racks and honora found herself wondering how many of these individuals were her future neighbours that there might have been an hysterical element in the lively anticipation she exhibited during the journey did not occur to howard spence  after many stopsin fortytwo minutes to be exact the brakeman shouted out the name of the place which was to be her home and of which she had been ignorant that morning they alighted at an old red railroad station were seized upon by a hackman in a coonskin coat and thrust into a carriage that threatened to fall to pieces on the frozen macadam road they passed through a village in which honora had a glimpse of the drug store and grocery and the grand army hall then came detached houses of all ages in one and twoacre plots some above the road for the country was rolling a very attractive church of creamcoloured stone and finally the carriage turned sharply to the left under an archway on which were the words stafford park and stopped at a very new curbstone in a very new gutter on the right  here we are cried howard as he fished in his trousers pockets for money to pay the hackman  honora looked around her stafford park consisted of a wide centreway of red gravel not yet packed with an island in its middle planted with shrubbery and young trees the bare branches of which formed a black tracery against the orangered of the western sky on both sides of this centreway were concrete walks with crosswalks from the curbs to the houses there were six of thesethree on each sidestanding on a raised terrace and about two hundred feet apart beyond them to the northward stafford park was still a wilderness of secondgrowth hardwood interspersed with a few cedars  honoras house the first on the right was exactly like the other five if we look at it through her eyes we shall find this similarity its main drawback if we are a little older however and more sophisticated we shall suspect the owner of stafford park and his architect of a design to make it appear imposing it was indefinite and muchabused term colonial painted white and double with dormer windows of diagonal woodsurrounded panes in the roof there was a large pillared porch on its least private sidenamely the front a whitecapped maid stood in the open doorway and smiled at honora as she entered  honora walked through the rooms there was nothing intricate about the house it was as simple as two times four and really too large for her and howard her presents were installed the pictures and photograph frames and chairs even mr ishams diningroom table and cousin eleanors piano the sight of these and of the engraving which aunt mary had sent on and which all her childhood had hung over her bed in the little room at home brought the tears once more to her eyes but she forced them back bravely  these reflections were interrupted by the appearance of the little maid announcing that tea was ready and bringing her two letters one was from susan holt and the other written in a large slanting and angular handwriting was signed lily dallam it was dated from new york  my dear honora it ran i feel that i must call you so for sid and howard in addition to being partners are such friends i hesitated so long about furnishing your house my dear but howard insisted and said he wished to surprise you i am sending you this line to welcome you and to tell you that i have arranged with the furniture people to take any or all things back that you do not like and exchange them after all they will be out of date in a few years and howard and sid will have made so much money by that time i hope that i shall be able to leave my apartment which is dear and you will be coming to town  honora laid down the sheet and began to tidy her hair before the glass of the highly polished bureau in her room a line in susans letter occurred to her mother hopes to see you soon she asked me to tell you to buy good things which will last you all your life and says that it pays  the teatable was steaming in the parlour in front of the wood fire in the blue tiled fireplace the oak floor reflected its gleam and that of the electric lights the shades were drawn a slight odour of steam heat pervaded the place howard smoking a cigarette was reclining on a sofa that evidently was not made for such a purpose reading the evening newspapers  well honora he said as she took her seat behind the teatable you havent told me how you like it pretty cosey eh and enough spare room to have people out over sundays  oh howard i do like it she cried in a desperate attemptwhich momentarily came near succeeding to convince herself that she could have desired nothing more its so sweet and clean and newand all our own  she succeeded at any rate in convincing howard in certain matters he was easily convinced  i thought youd be pleased when you saw it my dear he said     chapter iii the great unattached  it was the poet cowper who sang of domestic happiness as the only bliss that has survived the fall one of the burning and unsolved questions of today iswill it survive the twentieth century will it survive rapid transit and bridge and womans rights the modern novel and modern drama automobiles flying machines and intelligence offices hotel apartment and suburban life or four homes or none at all is it a weed that will grow anywhere in a crevice between two stones in the city or is it a plant that requires tender care and the water of selfsacrifice above all is it desirable  our heroine as may have been suspected has an adaptable temperament her natural position is upright but like the reed she can bend gracefully and yields only to spring back again blithely since this chronicle regards her we must try to look at existence through her eyes and those of some of her generation and her sex we must give the four years of her life in rivington the approximate value which she herself would have put upon itwhich is a chapter we must regard rivington as a kind of purgatory not solely a place of departed spirits but of those which have not yet arrived as one of the many temporary abodes of the great unattached  no philosophical writer has as yet made the attempt to define the changeas profound as that of the tadpole to the frogbetween the lover and the husband an author of ideals would not dare to proclaim that this change is inevitable some husbandsand some wives are fortunate enough to escape it but it is not unlikely to happen in our modern civilization just when it occurred in howard spence it is difficult to say but we have got to consider him henceforth as a husband one who regards his home as a shipyard rather than the sanctuary of a goddess as a launching place the ways of which are carefully greased that he may slide off to business every morning with as little friction as possible and return at night to rest undisturbed in a comfortable berth to ponder over the combat of the morrow  it would be inspiring to summon the vision of honora in rustling garments poised as the figurehead of this craft beckoning him on to battle and victory alas the launching happened at that grimmest and most unromantic of hoursten minutes of eight in the morning there was a period indeterminate when she poured out his coffee with wifely zeal a second period when she appeared at the foot of the stairs to kiss him as he was going out of the door a third when clad in an attractive dressinggown she waved him goodby from the window and lastly a fourth which was only marked by an occasional protest on his part when the coffee was weak  id gladly come down howard if it seemed to make the least difference to you said honora but all you do is to sit with your newspaper propped up and read the stock reports and growl when i ask you a polite question youve no idea how long it makes the days out here to get up early  it seems to me you put in a good many days in town he retorted  surely you dont expect me to spend all my time in rivington she cried reproachfully id die and then i am always having to get new cooks for you because they cant make hollandaise sauce like hotel chefs men have no idea how hard it is to keep house in the countryi just wish you had to go to those horrid intelligence offices you wouldnt stay in rivington ten days and all the good cooks drink  howard indeed with the aid of the village policeman had had to expel from his kitchen one imperious female who swore like a dock hand and who wounded honora to the quick by remarking as she departed in durance that she had always lived with ladies and gentlemen and people who were somebody the incident had tended further to detract from the romance of the country  it is a mistake to suppose that the honeymoon disappears below the horizon with the rapidity of a tropical sun and there is generally an afterglow in spite of cooks and other minor clouds in spite of visions of metropolitan triumphs not shattered but put away in camphor life was touched with a certain novelty there was a new runabout and a horse which honora could drive herself and she went to the station to meet her husband on mild saturday and sunday afternoons they made long excursions into the countryuntil the golf season began when the lessons begun at silverdale were renewed but after a while certain male competitors appeared and the lessons were discontinued sunday after his pile of newspapers had religiously been disposed of became a field day indeed it is impossible without a twinge of pity to behold howard taking root in rivington for we know that sooner or later he will be dug up and transplanted the soil was congenial he played poker on the train with the rivington husbands and otherwise got along with them famously and it was to him an enigmawhen occasionally he allowed his thoughts to dwell upon such trivial matterswhy honora was not equally congenial with the wives  there were no doubt interesting people in rivington about whom many stories could be written people with loves and fears and anxieties and joys with illnesses and recoveries with babies but few grandchildren there were weddings at the little church and burials there were dances at the golf club there were christmas trees where most of the presentslike honorascame from afar from family centres formed in a social period gone by there were promotions for the heads of families and consequent rejoicings over increases of income there were movings there wereinevitable in the ever grinding action of that remorseless law the survival of the fittestcommercial calamities and the heartrending search for new employment  rivington called upon honora in vehicles of all descriptions in proportion to the improvidence or prosperity of the owners and honora returned the calls and joined the sewing circle and the womans luncheon club which met for the purpose of literary discussion in the evenings there were little dinners of six or eight where the men talked business and the women house rent and groceries and gossip and the cheapest places in new york city to buy articles of the latest fashion some of them had actually built or were building houses that cost as much as thirty thousand dollars with the inexplicable intention of remaining in rivington the rest of their lives  honora was kind to these ladies as we know she was kind to everybody she almost allowed two or three of them to hope that they might become her intimates and made excursions to new york with them and lunched in fashionable restaurants their range of discussion included babies and robert browning the modern novel and the best matinee it would be interesting to know why she treated them on the whole like travellers met by chance in a railroad station from whom she was presently forever to depart the time and manner of this departure were matters to be determined in the future  it would be interesting to know likewise just at what period the intention of moving away from rivington became fixed in honoras mind honora circumscribed honora limited honora admitting defeat and this chronicle would be finished the gods exist somewhere though many incarnations may be necessary to achieve their companionship and no prison walls loom so high as to appall our heroines soul to exchange one prison for another is in itself something of a feat and an argument that the thing may be done again neither do the wise ones beat themselves uselessly against brick or stone howardpoor manis fatuous enough to regard a great problem as being settled once and for all by a marriage certificate and a benediction and labours under the delusion that henceforth he may come and go as he pleases eat his breakfast in silence sleep after dinner and spend his sundays at the rivington golf club it is as well to leave him at present in blissful ignorance of his future  our sympathies however must be with honora who has paid the price for heaven and who discovers that by marriage she has merely joined the ranks of the great unattached hitherto it had been inconceivable to her that any one sufficiently prosperous could live in a city or near it and dependent on it without being socially a part of it most momentous of disillusions with the exception of the sidney dallams and one or two young brokers who occasionally came out over sunday her husband had no friends in new york rivington and the holt family incongruous mixture formed the sum total of her acquaintance  on monday mornings in particular if perchance she went to town the huge signs which she read across the swamps of breakfast foods and other necessaries seemed for some reason best to express her isolation welldressed laughing people descended from omnibuses at the prettier stations people who seemed allsufficient to themselves people she was sure she should like if only she knew them once the sight of her school friend ethel wing chatting with a tall young man brought up a flood of recollections again in a millinery establishment she came face to face with the attractive mrs maitland whom she had seen at hot springs sometimes she would walk on fifth avenue watching with mingled sensations the procession there the colour the movement the sensation of living in a world where every one was fabulously wealthy was at once a stimulation and a despair brougham after brougham passed victoria after victoria in which beautifully gowned women chatted gayly or sat back impassive amidst the cushions some of them indeed looked bored but this did not mar the general effect of pleasure and prosperity even the peoplewelldressed tooin the hansom cabs were usually animated and smiling on the sidewalk athletic clearskinned girls passed her sometimes with a man sometimes in groups of two and three going in and out of the expensivelooking shops with the large plateglass windows  all of these women apparently had something definite to do somewhere to go some one to meet the very next minute they protested to milliners and dressmakers if they were kept waiting and even seemed impatient of time lost if one by chance bumped into them but honora had no imperative appointments lily dallam was almost sure to be out or going out immediately and seemed to have more engagements than any one in new york  im so sorry my dear she would say and add reproachfully why didnt you telephone me you were coming if you had only let me know we might have lunched together or gone to the matinee now i have promised clara trowbridge to go to a lunch party at her house  mrs dallam had a most convincing way of saying such things and in spite of ones self put one in the wrong for not having telephoned but if indeed honora telephonedas she did once or twice in her innocencelily was quite as distressed  my dear why didnt you let me know last night trixy brent has given lula chandos his box at the horse show and lula would never never forgive me if i backed out  although she lived in an apartmentin a most attractive one to be surethere could be no doubt about it that lily dallam was fashionable she had a way with her and her costumes were marvellous she could have made her fortune either as a dressmaker or a house decorator and she bought everything from little men and women whom she discovered herself it was a curious fact that all of these small tradespeople eventually became fashionable too lily was kind to honora and gave her their addresses before they grew to be great and insolent and careless whether one patronized them or not  while we are confessing the trials and weaknesses of our heroine we shall have to admit that she read occasionally the society columns of the newspapers and in this manner she grew to have a certain familiarity with the doings of those favourites of fortune who had more delightful engagements than hours in which to fulfil them so intimate was lily dallam with many of these olympians that she spoke of them by their first names or generally by their nicknames some two years after honoras marriage the dallams had taken a house in that much discussed colony of quicksands where sport and pleasure reigned supreme and more than once the gown which mrs sidney dallam had worn to a polo match had been faithfully described in the public prints or the dinners which she had given at the quicksands club one of these dinners honora learned had been given in honour of mr trixton brent  you ought to know trixy honora mrs dallam declared hed be crazy about you  time passed however and mrs dallam made no attempt to bring about this most desirable meeting when honora and howard went to town to dine with the dallams it was always at a restaurant a partie carree lily dallam thought it dull to dine at home and they went to the theatre afterwardsinvariably a musical comedy although honora did not care particularly for musical comedies she always experienced a certain feverish stimulation which kept her wide awake on the midnight train to rivington howard had a most exasperating habit of dozing in the corner of the seat  you are always sleepy when i have anything interesting to talk to you about said honora or reading stock reports i scarcely see anything at all of you  howard roused himself  where are we now he asked  oh cried honora we havent passed hydeville howard who is trixton brent  what about him demanded her husband  nothingexcept that he is one of lilys friends and she said she knewi should like him i wish you would be more interested in people who is he  one of the bestknown operators in the market howard answered and his air implied that a lack of knowledge of mr brent was ignorance indeed a daring gambler he cornered cotton once and raked in over a million hes a sport too  how old is he  about fortythree  is he married inquired honora  hes divorced said howard and she had to be content with so much of the gentlemans biography for her husband relapsed into somnolence again a few days later she saw a picture of mr brent in polo costume in one of the magazines she thought him goodlooking and wondered what kind of a wife he had had  honora when she went to town for the day generally could be sure of finding some one at least of the holt family at home at luncheon time they lived still in the same house on madison avenue to which aunt mary and uncle tom had been invited to breakfast on the day of honoras arrival in her own country it had a wide brownstone front with a basement and a high flight of steps leading up to the door within solemnity reigned and this effect was largely produced by the prodigiously high ceilings and the black walnut doors and woodwork on the second floor the library where the family assembled was more cheerful the books themselves although in blackwalnut cases and the sun pouring in assisted in making this effect  here indeed were stability and peace here honora remade the acquaintance of the young settlement worker and of the missionary now on the presbyterian board of missions here she charmed other friends and allies of the holt family and once met somewhat to her surprise two young married women who differed radically from the other guests of the house honora admired their gowns if not their manners for they ignored her and talked to mrs holt about plans for raising money for the working girls relief society  you should join us my dear said mrs holt i am sure you would be interested in our work  id be so glad to mrs holt replied honora if only i didnt live in the country  she came away as usual feeling of having run into a cul de sac mrs holts house was a refuge not an outlet and thither honora directed her steps when a distaste for lunching alone or with some of her rivington friends in the hateful selfish gayety of a fashionable restaurant overcame her or when her moods had run through a cycle and an atmosphere of religion and domesticity became congenial  howard she asked unexpectedly one evening as he sat smoking beside the blue tiled mantel have you got on your winter flannels  ill bet a hundred dollars to ten cents he cried that youve been lunching with mrs holt  i think youre horrid said honora  something must be said for her domestic virtue in the face of such mocking heresy is exceptionally difficult of attainment  mrs holt had not been satisfied with honoras and susans accounts of the house in stafford park she felt called upon to inspect it and for this purpose in the spring following honoras marriage she made a pilgrimage to rivington and spent the day honora met her at the station and the drive homeward was occupied in answering innumerable questions on the characters conditions and modes of life of honoras neighbours  now my dear said mrs holt when they were seated before the fire after lunch i want you to feel that you can come to me for everything i must congratulate you and howard on being sensible enough to start your married life simply in the country i shall never forget the little house in which mr holt and i began and how blissfully happy i was the good lady reached out and took honoras hand in her own not that your deep feeling for your husband will ever change but men are more difficult to manage as they grow older my dear and the best of them require a little managing for their own good and increased establishments bring added cares and responsibilities now that i am here i have formed a very fair notion of what it ought to cost you to live in such a place and i shall be glad to go over your housekeeping books with you and tell you if you are being cheated as i dare say you are  oh mrs holt honora faltered ii havent kept any books howard just pays the bills  you mean to say he hasnt given you any allowance cried mrs holt aghast you dont know what it costs to run this house  no said honora humbly i never thought of it i have no idea what howards income may be  ill write to howard myselftonight declared mrs holt  please dont mrs holt illill speak to him said honora  very well then the good lady agreed and i will send you one of my own books with my own system as soon as i get home it is not your fault my dear it is howards it is little short of criminal of him i suppose this is one of the pernicious results of being on the stock exchange new york is nothing like what it was when i was a girlthe extravagance by everybody is actually appalling the whole city is bent upon lavishness and pleasure and i am afraid it is very often the wives honora who take the lead in prodigality it all tends my dear to loosen the marriage tieespecially this frightful habit of dining in hotels and restaurants  before she left mrs holt insisted on going over the house from top to bottom from laundry to linen closet suffice it to say that the inspection was not without a certain criticism which must be passed over  it is a little large just for you and howard my dear was her final comment but you are wise in providing for the future  for the future honora repeated  mrs holt playfully pinched her cheek  when the children arrive my dear as i hope they willsoon she said smiling at honoras colour sometimes it all comes back to memy own joy when joshua was a baby i was very foolish about him no doubt annie and gwendolen tell me so i wouldnt even let the nurse sit up with him when he was getting his teeth mercy she exclaimed glancing at the enamelled watch on her gownfor long practice had enabled her to tell the time upside downwell be late for the train my dear  after returning from the station honora sat for a long time at her window looking out on the park the afternoon sunlight had the silvery tinge that comes to it in march the red gravel of the centre driveway was very wet and the grass of the lawns of the houses opposite already a vivid green in the backyards the white clothes snapped from the lines and a group of children followed by nurses with perambulators tripped along the strip of sidewalk  why could not she feel the joys and desires of which mrs holt had spoken it never had occurred to her until today that they were lacking in her children a home why was it that she did not want children why should such a natural longing be absent in her her mind went back to the days of her childhood dolls and she smiled to think of their large families she had always associated marriage with childrenuntil she got married and now she remembered that her childhood ideals of the matrimonial state had been very much like mrs holts own experience of it why then had that ideal gradually faded until when marriage came to her it was faint and shadowy indeed why were not her spirit and her hopes enclosed by the walls in which she sat  the housekeeping book came from mrs holt the next morning but honora did not mention it to her husband circumstances were her excuse he had had a hard day on the exchange and at such times he showed a marked disinclination for the discussion of household matters it was not until the autumn in fact that the subject of finance was mentioned between them and after a period during which howard had been unusually uncommunicative and morose just as electrical disturbances are said to be in some way connected with sun spots so honora learned that a certain glumness and tendency to discuss expenses on the part of her husband were synchronous with a depression in the market  i wish youd learn to go a little slow honora he said one evening the bills are pretty stiff this month you dont seem to have any idea of the value of money  oh howard she exclaimed after a moments pause for breath how can you say such a thing when i save you so much  save me so much he echoed  yes if i had gone to ridley for this suit he would have charged me two hundred dollars i took such painsall on your accountto find a little man lily dallam told me about who actually made it for one hundred and twentyfive  it was typical of the unreason of his sex that he failed to be impressed by this argument  if you go on saving that way said he well be in the hands of a receiver by christmas i cant see any difference between buying one suit from ridleywhoever he may beand three from lily dallams little man except that you spend more than three times as much money  oh i didnt get threei never thought you could be so unjust howard surely you dont want me to dress like these rivington women do you  i cant see anything wrong with their clothes he maintained  and to think that i was doing it all to please you she cried reproachfully  to please me  who else wewe dont know anybody in new york and i wanted you to be proud of me ive tried so hard andand sometimes you dont even look at my gowns and say whether you like them and they are all for you  this argument at least did not fail of results combined as it was with a hint of tears in honoras voice its effect upon howard was peculiarhe was at once irritated disarmed and softened he put down his cigaretteand honora was on his knee he could not deny her attractions  how could you be so cruel howard she asked  you know you wouldnt like me to be a slattern it was my own idea to save moneyi had a long talk about economy one day with mrs holt and you act as though you had such a lot of it when were in town for dinner with these rivington people you always have champagne ifif youre poor you ought to have told me so and i shouldnt have ordered another dinner gown  youve ordered another dinner gown  only a little one said honora the simplest kind but if youre poor  she had made a discoveryto reflect upon his business success was to touch a sensitive nerve  im not poor he declared but the bottoms dropped out of the market and even old wing is economizing well have to put on the brakes for awhile honora  it was shortly after this that honora departed on the first of her three visits to st louis     chapter iv the new doctrine  this history concerns a free and untrammelledand let us add femininespirit no lady is in the least interesting if restricted and contented with her restrictionsa fact which the ladies of our nation are fast finding out what would become of the goddess of liberty and let us mark well while we are making these observations that liberty is a goddess not a god although it has taken us in america over a century to realize a significance in the choice of her sex andanother discoveryshe is not a haus frau she is never domiciled never fettered even the french clever as they are have not conceived her equality and fraternity are neither kith nor kin of hers and she laughs at them as mythsfor she is a laughing lady she alone of the three is real and she alone is worshipped for attributes which she does not possess she is a coquette and she is never satisfied if she were she would not be liberty if she were she would not be worshipped of men but despised if they understood her they would not care for her and finally she comes not to bring peace but a sword  at quarter to seven one blustery evening of the april following their fourth anniversary honora returned from new york to find her husband seated under the tall lamp in the room he somewhat facetiously called his den scanning the financial page of his newspaper he was in his dressing gown his slippered feet extended towards the hearth smoking a cigarette and on the stand beside him was a cocktail glassempty  howard she cried brushing his ashes from the table how can you be so untidy when you are so goodlooking dressed up i really believe youre getting fat and there she added critically touching a place on the top of his head is a bald spot  anything else he murmured with his eyes still on the sheet  lots answered honora pulling down the newspaper from before his face for one thing im not going to allow you to be a bear any more i dont mean a stock exchange bear but a domestic bearwhich is much worse youve got to notice me once in a while if you dont ill get another husband thats what women do in these days you know when the one they have doesnt take the trouble to make himself sufficiently agreeable im sure i could get another one quite easily she declared  he looked up at her as she stood facing him in the lamplight before the fire and was forced to admit to himself that the boast was not wholly idle a smile was on her lips her eyes gleamed with health her fursof silver foxwere thrown back the crimson roses pinned on her mauve afternoon gown matched the glow in her cheeks while her hair mingled with the dusky shadows howard spence experienced one of those startling illuminating moments which come on occasions to the busy and selfabsorbed husbands of his nation psychologists have a name for such a phenomenon ten minutes before so far as his thoughts were concerned she had not existed and suddenly she had become a possession which he had not in truth sufficiently prized absurd though it was the possibility which she had suggested aroused in him a slight uneasiness  you are a deuced goodlooking woman ill say that for you honora he admitted  thanks she answered mockingly and put her hands behind her back if i had only known you were going to settle down in rivington and get fat and bald and wear dressing gowns and be a bear i never should have married younever never never oh how young and simple and foolish i was and the magnificent way you talked about new york and intimated that you were going to conquer the world i believed you wasnt i a little idiot notto know that youd make for a place like this and dig a hole and stay in it and let the world go hang  he laughed though it was a poor attempt and she read in his eyes which had not left her face that he was more or less disturbed  i treat you pretty well dont i honora he asked there was an amorous apologetic note in his voice that amused her and reminded her of the honeymoon i give you all the money you want or ratheryou take itand i dont kick up a row except when the market goes to pieces  when you act as though wed have to live in harlemwhich couldnt be much worse she interrupted and you stay in town all day and have no end of fun making moneyfor you like to make money and expect me to amuse myself the best part of my life with a lot of women who dont know enough to keep thin  he laughed again but still uneasily honora was still smiling  whats got into you he demanded i know you dont like rivington but you never broke loose this way before  if you stay here said honora with a new firmness it will be alone i cant see what you want with a wife anyway ive been thinking you over lately i dont do anything for you except to keep getting you cooksand anybody could do that you dont seem to need me in any possible way all i do is to loiter around the house and read and play the piano or go to new york and buy clothes for nobody to look at except strangers in restaurants im worth more than that i think ill get married again  great lord what are you talking about he exclaimed when he got his breath  i think ill take a man next time she continued calmly who has something to him some ambition the kind of man i thought i was getting when i took you only i shouldnt be fooled again women remarry a good deal in these days and im beginning to see the reason why and the women who have done it appear to be perfectly happymuch happier than they were at first i saw one of them at lily dallams this afternoon she was radiant i cant see any particular reason why a woman should be tied all her life to her husbands apron stringsor whatever he wearsand waste the talents she has its wicked when she might be the making of some man who is worth something and who lives somewhere  her husband got up  jehosaphat he cried i never heard such talk in my life  the idea that her love for him might have ebbed a little or that she would for a moment consider leaving him he rejected as preposterous of course the reputation which the majority of her sex had made throughout the ages for constancy to the marriage tie was not to be so lightly dissipated nevertheless there was in her words a new undertone of determination he had never before heardor at least noticed  there was one argument or panacea which had generally worked like a charm although some time had elapsed since last he had resorted to it he tried to seize and kiss her but she eluded him at last he caught her out of breath in the corner of the room  howardyoull knock over the lampyoull ruin my gownand then youll have to buy me another i did mean it she insisted holding back her head youll have to choose between rivington and me itsits an ultimatum there were at least three awfully attractive men at lily dallams teai wont tell you who they werewho would be glad to marry me in a minute  he drew her down on the arm of his chair  now that lily has a house in town he said weakly i suppose you think youve got to have one  oh howard it is such a dear house i had no idea that so much could be done with so narrow a front its all french with mirrors and big white panels and satin chairs and sofas and a carved gilt piano that she got for nothing from a dealer she knows and church candlesticks the mirrors give it the effect of being larger than it really is ive only two criticisms to make its too far from fifth avenue and one can scarcely turn around in it without knocking something downa photograph frame or a flower vase or one of her spindlelegged chairs it was only a hideous oldfashioned stone front when she bought it i suppose nobody but reggie farwell could have made anything out of it  whos reggie farwell inquired her husband  howard do you really mean to say youve never heard of reggie farwell lily was so lucky to get himshe says he wouldnt have done the house if he hadnt been such a friend of hers and he was coming to the tea this afternoononly something happened at the last minute and he couldnt she was so disappointed he built the maitlands house and did over the cecil graingers and hes going to do our housesome day  why not right away asked howard  because ive made up my mind to be very very reasonable she replied were going to quicksands for a while first  to quicksands he repeated but in spite of himself he experienced a feeling of relief that she had not demanded a town mansion on the spot  honora sprang to her feet  get up howard she cried remember that were going out for dinnerand youll never be ready  hold on he protested i dont know about this quicksands proposition lets talk it over a little more  well talk it over another time she replied butremember my ultimatum and i am only taking you there for your own good  for my own good  yes to get you out of a rut to keep you from becoming commonplace and obscure andand everything you promised not to be when you married me she retorted from the doorway her eyes still alight with that disturbing and tantalizing fire it is my last desperate effort as a wife to save you from baldness obesity and nonentity wherewith she disappeared into her room and closed the door  we read of earthquakes in the tropics and at the ends of the earth with commiseration it is true yet with the fond belief that the ground on which we have built is so firm that our own lares and penates are in no danger of being shaken down and in the same spirit we learn of other peoples domestic cataclysms howard spence had had only a slight shock but it frightened him and destroyed his sense of immunity and during the week that followed he lacked the moral courage either to discuss the subject of quicksands thoroughly or to let it alone to put down his foot like a turk or accede like a crichton  either course might have saved him one trouble with the unfortunate man was that he realized but dimly the gravity of the crisis he had laboured under the delusion that matrimonial conditions were still what they had been in the eighteenth centuryalthough it is doubtful whether he had ever thought of that century characteristically he considered the troublesome affair chiefly from its business side his ambition if we may use so large a word for the sentiment that had filled his breast had been coincident with his prenuptial passion for honora and she had contrived after four years in some mysterious way to stir up that ambition once more to make him uncomfortable to compel him to ask himself whether he were not sliding downhill to wonder whether living at quicksands might not bring him in touch with important interests which had as yet eluded him and above allif the idea be put a little more crudely and definitely than it occurred in his thoughts he awoke to the realization that his wife was an asset he had hitherto utterly neglected inconceivable though it were a middleofthenight reflection if he insisted on trying to keep such a woman bottled up in rivington she might some day pack up and leave him one never could tell what a woman would do in these days les sacrees femmes  we are indebted to honora for this view of her husbands mental processes she watched them as it were through a glass in the side of his head and incidentally derived infinite amusement therefrom with instinctive wisdom she refrained from tinkering  an invitation to dine with the dallams in their own house arrived a day or two after the tea which honora had attended there although lily had always been cordial honora thought this note couched in terms of unusual warmth she was implored to come early because lily had so much to talk to her about which couldnt be written on account of a splitting headache in moderate obedience to this summons honora arrived on the evening in question before the ornamental ironwork of mrs dallams front door at a few minutes after seven oclock honora paused in the spring twilight to contemplate the house which stood out incongruously from its sombre brownstone brothers and sisters with noisy basement kitchens the third avenue elevated so handy for sid roared across the gap scarcely a block away and just as the door was opened the tightest of little blue broughams pulled by a huge chestnut horse and driven by the tiniest of grooms in top boots drew up at the curb and out of it burst a resplendent ladymrs dallam  oh its you honora she cried am i late im so sorry but i just couldnt help it its all clara trowbridges fault she insisted on my staying to meet that renee labride who dances so divinely in lady emmeline shes sweet ive seen her eight times here she took honoras arm and faced her towards the street what do you think of my turnout isnt he a darling  is hefull grown asked honora  lilly dallam burst out laughing  bless you i dont mean patrickalthough i had a terrible time finding him i mean the horse trixy brent gave him to me before he went abroad  gave him to you honora exclaimed  oh hes always doing kind things like that and he hadnt any use for him my dear i hope you dont think for an instant trixys in love with me hes crazy about lula chandos i tried so hard to get her to come to dinner tonight and the trowbridges and the barclays youve no idea how difficult it is in new york to get any one under two weeks and so weve got just ourselves  honora was on the point of declaring politely that she was very glad when lily dallam asked her how she liked the brougham  its the image of mrs cecil graingers my dear and i got it for a song as long as trixy gave me the horse i told sid the least he could do was to give me the brougham and the harness is master sid asleep she inquired of the maid who had been patiently waiting at the door i meant to have got home in time to kiss him  she led honora up the narrow but thickly carpeted stairs to a miniature boudoir where madame adelaide in a gilt rococo frame looked superciliously down from the walls  why havent you been in to see me since my tea honora you were such a success and after you left they were all crazy to know something about you and why they hadnt heard of you my dear how much did little harris charge you for that dress if i had your face and neck and figure id die before id live in rivington youre positively wasted honora and if you stay there no one will look at you though you were as beautiful as mrs langtry  youre rather goodlooking yourself lily said honora  im ten years older than you my dear and i have to be so careful sid says im killing myself but ive found a little massage woman who is wonderful how do you like this dress  all your things are exquisite  do you think so cried mrs dallam delightedly  honora indeed had not perjured herself only the hypercritical when mrs dallam was dressed had the impression of a performed miracle she was the most finished of finished products her complexion was high and be it added natural her hair wonderfully onduled and she had withal the sweetest and kindest of smiles and the most engaging laughter in the world it was impossible not to love her  howard she cried when a little later they were seated at the table how mean of you to have kept honora in a dead and alive place like rivington all these years i think shes an angel to have stood it men are beyond me do you know what an attractive wife youve got ive just been telling her that there wasnt a woman at my tea who compared with her and the men were crazy about her  thats the reason i live down there proclaimed howard as he finished his first glass of champagne  honora demanded mrs dallam ignoring his bravado why dont you take a house at quicksands youd love it and youd look simply divine in a bathing suit why dont you come down  ask howard replied honora demurely  well lily ill own up i have been considering it a little that gentleman admitted with gravity but i havent decided anything there are certain drawbacks  drawbacks exclaimed mrs dallam drawbacks at quicksands id like to know what they are dont be silly howard you get more for your money there than any place i know suddenly the light of an inspiration came into her eyes and she turned to her husband sid the alfred fern house is for rent isnt it  i think it must be lily replied mr dallam  sometimes i believe im losing my mind declared mrs dallam what an imbecile i was not to think of it its a dear honora not five minutes from the club with the sweetest furniture and they just finished it last fall it would be positively wicked not to take it howard they couldnt have failed more opportunely im sorry for alfred but i always thought louise fern a little snob sid you must see alfred down town the first thing in the morning and ask him whats the least hell rent it for tell him i wish to know  butmy dear lilybegan mr dallam apologetically  there complained his wife youre always raising objections to my most charming and sensible plans you act as though you wanted honora and howard to stay in rivington  my dear lily he protested again and words failing him he sought by a gesture to disclaim such a sinister motive for inaction  what harm can it do she asked plaintively howard doesnt have to rent the house although it would be a sin if he didnt find out the rent in the morning sid and well all four go down on sunday and look at it and lunch at the quicksands club im sure i can get out of my engagement at laura deansthis is so important what do you say honora  i think it would be delightful said honora     chapter v quicksands  to convey any adequate idea of the community familiarly known as quicksands a cinematograph were necessary with a pen we can only approximate the appearance of the shifting grains at any one time some households there were indeed which maintained a precarious though seemingly miraculous footing on the surface or near it going under for mere brief periods only to rise again and flaunt menservants in the face of providence  there were real tragedies too although a casual visitor would never have guessed it for tragedies sink and that is the end of them the cinematograph to be sure would reveal one from time to time coming like a shadow across an endless feast and gone again in a flash such was what might appropriately be called the episode of the alfred ferns after three years of married life they had come they had rented the market had gone up they had bought and builtupon the sands the ancient farmhouse which had stood on the site had been torn down as unsuited to a higher civilization although the great elms which had sheltered it had been left standing in grave contrast to the twisted cedars and stunted oaks so much in evidence round about  the fernsor rather little mrs fernhad had taste and the new house reflected it as an indication of the quality of imagination possessed by the owners the place was called the brackens there was a long porch on the side of the ocean but a view of the water was shut off from it by a hedge which during the successive ownerships of the adjoining property had attained a height of twelve feet there was a little toy greenhouse connecting with the porch an economy indulged in when the market had begun to go the wrong way for mr fern exile although unpleasant was sometimes found necessary at quicksands and even effective  above all things however if one is describing quicksands one must not be depressing that is the unforgiveable sin there hence we must touch upon these tragedies lightly  if after walking through the entrance in the hedge that separated the brackens from the main road you turned to the left and followed a driveway newly laid out between young poplars you came to a mass of cedars behind these was hidden the stable there were four stalls all replete with brass trimmings and a box and the carriagehouse was made large enough for the break which mr fern had been getting ready to buy when he had been forced so unexpectedly to change his mind  if the world had been searched perhaps no greater contrast to rivington could have been found than this delightful colony of quicksands full of life and motion and colour where everybody was beautifully dressed and enjoying themselves for a whole week after her instalment honora was in a continual state of excitement and anticipation and the sound of wheels and voices on the highroad beyond the hedge sent her peeping to her curtains a dozen times a day the waking hours instead of burdens were so many fleeting joys in the morning she awoke to breathe a new perplexing and delicious perfumethe salt sea breeze stirring her curtains later she was on the gay yellowochre beach with lily dallam making new acquaintances and presently stepping with a quiver of fear akin to delight into the restless limitless blue water that stretched southward under a milky haze luncheon somewhere more new acquaintances and then perhaps in lilys light wood victoria to meet the train of trains for at halfpast five the little station forlorn all day long in the midst of the twisted cedars that grew out of the heated sand assumed an air of gayety and animation vehicles of all sorts drew up in the open space before it wagonettes phaetons victorias high wheeled hackney carts and low hempstead carts women in white summer gowns and veils compared notes or shouted invitations to dinner from carriage to carriage the engine rolled in with a great cloud of dust the horses danced the husbands and the overnight guests grimy and brandishing evening newspapers poured out of the special car where they had sat in armchairs and talked stocks all the way from long island city some were driven home it is true some to the beach and others to the quicksands club where they continued their discussions over whiskeyandsodas until it was time to have a cocktail and dress for dinner  then came the memorable evening when lily dallam gave a dinner in honour of honora her real introduction to quicksands it was characteristic of lily that her touch made the desert bloom three years before quicksands had gasped to hear that the sidney dallams had bought the faraday houseor rather what remained of it  we got it for nothing lily explained triumphantly on the occasion of honoras first admiring view nobody would look at it my dear  it must have been this first price undoubtedly that appealed to sidney dallam model for all husbands to sidney who had had as much of an idea of buying in quicksands as of acquiring a scotch shooting box the faraday place had belonged to the middle ages as time is reckoned in quicksands and had lain deserted for years chiefly on account of its lugubrious and funereal aspect it was on a corner two for rent signs had fallen successively from the overgrown hedge some fifty feet back from the road hidden by undergrowth and in the tenebrous shades of huge larches and cedars stood a hideous twostoried house with a mansard roof once painted dark red  the magical transformation of all this into a sunny smiling white villa with redstriped awnings and wellkept lawns and just enough shade had done no little towards giving to lily dallam that ascendency which she had acquired with such startling rapidity in the community when honora and howard drove up to the door in the deepening twilight every window was a yellow blazing square and above the sound of voices rose a waltz from lady emmeline played with vigour on the piano lily dallam greeted honora in the little room which for some unexplained reason was known as the library pressed into service at dinner parties as the ladies dressing room  my dear how sweet you look in that coral ive been so lucky tonight she added in honoras ear ive actually got trixy brent for you  our heroine was conscious of a pleasurable palpitation as she walked with her hostess across the little entry to the door of the drawingroom where her eyes encountered an inviting and vivacious scene some ten or a dozen guests laughing and talking gayly filled the spaces between the furniture an upright piano was embedded in a corner and the lady who had just executed the waltz had swung around on the stool and was smiling up at a man who stood beside her with his hand in his pocket she was a decided brunette neither tall nor short with a suggestion of plumpness  thats lula chandos explained lily dallam in her usual staccato following honoras gaze at the piano in ashes of roses shes stopped mourning for her husband trixy told her tonight shed discarded the sackcloth and kept the ashes hes awfully clever i dont wonder that shes crazy about him do you hes standing beside her  honora took a good look at the famous trixy who resembled a certain type of military englishman he had closecropped hair and a closecropped mustache and his grey eyes as they rested amusedly on mrs chandos seemed to have in them the light of mockery  trixy cried his hostess threading her way with considerable skill across the room and dragging honora after her trixy i want to introduce you to mrs spence now arent you glad you came  it was partly no doubt by such informal introductions that lily dallam had made her reputation as the mistress of a house where one and all had such a good time honora of course blushed to her temples and everybody laughedeven mrs chandos  glad said mr brent with his eyes on honora does not quite express it you usually have a supply of superlatives lily which you might have drawn on  isnt he irrepressible demanded lily dallam delightedly hes always teasing  it was running through honoras mind while lily dallams characteristic introductions of the other guests were in progress that irrepressible was an inaccurate word to apply to mr brents manner honora could not define his attitude but she vaguely resented it all of lilys guests had the air of being at home and at that moment a young gentleman named charley goodwin who was six feet tall and weighed two hundred pounds was loudly demanding cocktails they were presently brought by a rather harassedlooking manservant  i cant get over how well you look in that gown lula declared mrs dallam as they went out to dinner trixy what does she remind you of  cleopatra cried warry trowbridge with an attempt to be gallant  eternal vigilance said mr brent and they sat down amidst the laughter lily dallam declaring that he was horrid and mrs chandos giving him a look of tender reproach but he turned abruptly to honora who was on his other side  where did you drop down from mrs spence he inquired  why do you take it for granted that i have dropped she asked sweetly  he looked at her queerly for a moment and then burst out laughing  because you are sitting next to lucifer he said its kind of me to warn you isnt it  it wasnt necessary replied honora and besides as a dinner companion i imagine lucifer couldnt be improved on  he laughed again  as a dinner companion he repeated so you would limit lucifer to dinners thats rather a severe punishment since were neighbours  how delightful to have lucifer as ones neighbour said honora avoiding his eyes of course ive been brought up to believe that he was always next door so to speak but ive neverhad any proof of it until now  proof echoed mr brent has my reputation gone before me  i smell the brimstone said honora  he derived apparently infinite amusement from this remark likewise  if i had known i was to have the honour of sitting here i should have used another perfume he replied i have several  it was honoras turn to laugh  they are probably forcommercial transactions not for ladies she retorted we are notoriously fond of brimstone if it is not too strong a suspicion of it  her colour was high and she was surprised at her own vivacity it seemed strange that she should be holding her own in this manner with the renowned trixton brent no wonder after four years of rivington that she tingled with an unwonted excitement  at this point mr brents eye fell upon howard who was explaining something to mrs trowbridge at the far end of the table  whats your husband like he demanded abruptly  honora was a little taken aback but recovered sufficiently to retort youd hardly expect me to give you an unprejudiced judgment  thats true he agreed significantly  hes everything added honora that is to be expected in a husband  which isnt much in these days declared mr brent  on the contrary said honora  what i should like to know is why you came to quicksands said mr brent  for a little excitement she replied so far i have not been disappointed but why do you ask that question she demanded with a slight uneasiness why did you come here  oh he said you must remember that imlucifer a citizen of the world at home anywhere a sort of freebooter im not here all the timebut thats no reflection on quicksands may i make a bet with you mrs spence  what about  that you wont stay in quicksands more than six months he answered  why do you say that she asked curiously  he shook his head  my experience with your sex he declared enigmatically has not been a slight one  trixy interrupted mrs chandos at this juncture from his other side warry trowbridge wont tell me whether to sell my consolidated potteries stock  because he doesnt know said mr brent laconically and readdressed himself to honora who had however caught a glimpse of mrs chandos face  dont you think its time for you to talk to mrs chandos she asked  what for  well for one reason it is customary out of consideration for the hostess to assist in turning the table  lily doesnt care he said  how about mrs chandos i have an idea that she does care  he made a gesture of indifference  and how about me honora continued perhapsid like to talk to mr dallam  have you ever tried it he demanded  over her shoulder she flashed back at him a glance which he did not return she had never to tell the truth given her husbands partner much consideration he had existed in her mind solely as an obliging shopkeeper with whom lily had unlimited credit and who handed her over the counter such things as she desired and tonight in contrast to trixton brent sidney dallam suggested the counter more than ever before he was about five and forty small neatly made with little hands and feet fast growing bald and what hair remained to him was a jet black his suavity of manner and anxious desire to give one just the topic that pleased had always irritated honora  good shopkeepers are not supposed to have any tastes predilections or desires of their own and it was therefore with no little surprise that after many haphazard attempts honora discovered mr dallam to be possessed by one allabsorbing weakness she had fallen in love she remarked with little sid on the beach and sidney dallam suddenly became transfigured was she fond of children honora coloured a little and said yes he confided to her with an astonishing degree of feeling that it had been the regret of his life he had not had more children nobody he implied who came to his house had ever exhibited the proper interest in sid  sometimes he said leaning towards her confidentially i slip upstairs for a little peep at him after dinner  oh cried honora if youre going tonight maynt i go with you id love to see him in bed  of course ill take you said sidney dallam and he looked at her so gratefully that she coloured again  honora said lily dallam when the women were back in the drawingroom what did you do to sid you had him beamingand he hates dinner parties  we were talking about children replied honora innocently  children  yes said honora and your husband has promised to take me up to the nursery  and did you talk to trixy about children too cried lily laughing with a mischievous glance at mrs chandos  is he interested in them asked honora  you dear cried lily youll be the death of me lula honora wants to know whether trixy is interested in children  mrs chandos in the act of lighting a cigarette smiled sweetly  apparently he is she said  its time he were if hes ever going to be said honora just as sweetly  everybody laughed but mrs chandos who began to betray an intense interest in some old lace in the corner of the room  i bought it for nothing my dear said mrs dallam but she pinched honoras arm delightedly how wicked of you she whispered but it serves her right  in the midst of the discussion of clothes and house rents and other peoples possessions interspersed with anecdotes of a kind that was new to honora sidney dallam appeared at the door and beckoned to her  how silly of you sid exclaimed his wife of course she doesnt want to go  indeed i do protested honora rising with alacrity and following her host up the stairs at the end of a hallway a nurse who had been reading beside a lamp got up smilingly and led the way on tiptoe into the nursery turning on a shaded electric light honora bent over the crib the child lay as children will with his little yellow head resting on his arm but in a moment as she stood gazing at him he turned and opened his eyes and smiled at her and she stooped and kissed him  wheres daddy he demanded  weve waked him said honora remorsefully  daddy said the child tell me a story  the nurse looked at dallam reproachfully as her duty demanded and yet she smiled the noise of laughter reached them from below  i didnt have any tonight the child pleaded  i got home late dallam explained to honora and looking at the nurse pleaded in his turn just one  just a tiny one said the child  its against all rules mr dallam said the nurse buthes been very lonesome today  dallam sat down on one side of him honora on the other  will you go to sleep right away if i do sid he asked  the child shut his eyes very tight  like that he promised  it was not the sidney dallam of the countingroom who told that story and honora listened with strange sensations which she did not attempt to define  i used to be fond of that one when i was a youngster he explained apologetically to her as they went out and little sid had settled himself obediently on the pillow once more it was when i dreamed he added of less prosaic occupations than the stock market  sidney dallam had dreamed  although lily dallam had declared that to leave her house before midnight was to insult her it was halfpast eleven when honora and her husband reached home he halted smilingly in her doorway as she took off her wrap and laid it over a chair  well honora he asked how do you likethe whirl of fashion  she turned to him with one of those rapid and bewildering movements that sometimes characterized her and put her arms on his shoulders  what a dear old stayathome you were howard she said i wonder what would have happened to you if i hadnt rescued you in the nick of time own up that you likea little variety in life  being a man he qualified his approval  i didnt have a bad time he admitted i had a talk with brent after dinner and i think ive got him interested in a little scheme its a strange thing that sid dallam was never able to do any business with him if i can put this through coming to quicksands will have been worth while he paused a moment and added brent seems to have taken quite a shine to you honora  she dropped her arms and going over to her dressing table unclasped a pin on the front of her gown  i imagine she answered in an indifferent tone that he acts so with every new woman he meets  howard remained for a while in the doorway seemingly about to speak then he turned on his heel and she heard him go into his own room  far into the night she lay awake the various incidents of the evening like magic lantern views thrown with bewildering rapidity on the screen of her mind at last she was launched into life and the days of her isolation gone by forever she was in the centre of things and yetwell nothing could be perfect perhaps she demanded too much once or twice in the intimate and somewhat uproarious badinage that had been tossed back and forth in the drawingroom after dinner her delicacy had been offended an air of revelry had prevailed enhanced by the arrival of whiskeyandsoda on a tray and at the time she had been caught up by an excitement in the grip of which she still found herself she had been aware as she tried to talk to warren trowbridge of trixton brents glance and of a certain hostility from mrs chandos that caused her now to grow warm with a kind of shame when she thought of it but she could not deny that this man had for her a fascination there was in him an insolent sense of power of scarcely veiled contempt for the company in which he found himself and she asked herself in this mood of introspection whether a little of his contempt for lily dallams guests had not been communicated from him to her  when she had risen to leave he had followed her into the entry she recalled him vividly as he had stood before her then a cigar in one hand and a lighted match in the other his eyes fixed upon her with a singularly disquieting look that was tinged however with amusement im coming to see you he announced  do be careful she had cried youll burn yourself  that he answered tossing away the match is to be expected  she laughed nervously  good night he added and remember my bet  what could he have meant when he had declared that she would not remain in quicksands     chapter vi gad and meni  there was an orthodox place of worship at quicksands a temple not merely opened up for an hour or so on sunday mornings to be shut tight during the remainder of the week although it was thronged with devotees on the sabbath this temple of course was the quicksands club howard spence was quite orthodox and like some of our puritan forefathers did not even come home to the midday meal on the first day of the week but a certain instinct of protest and of nonconformity which may have been remarked in our heroine sent her to st andrewsbytheseaby no means so well attended as the house of gad and meni she walked home in a pleasantly contemplative state of mind through a field of daisies and had just arrived at the hedge in front of the brackens when the sound of hoofs behind her caused her to turn mr trixton brent very firmly astride of a restive fleabitten polo pony surveyed her amusedly  where have you been said he  to church replied honora demurely  such virtue is unheard of in quicksands  it isnt virtue said honora  i had my doubts about that too he declared  what is it then she asked laughingly wondering why he had such a faculty of stirring her excitement and interest  dissatisfaction was his prompt reply  i dont see why you say that she protested  im prepared to make my wager definite said he the odds are a thoroughbred horse against a personally knitted worsted waistcoat that you wont stay in quicksands six months  i wish you wouldnt talk nonsense said honora and besides i cant knit  there was a short silence during which he didnt relax his disconcerting stare  wont you come in she asked im sorry howard isnt home  im not he said promptly cant you come over to my box for lunch ive asked lula chandos and warry trowbridge  it was not without appropriateness that trixton brent called his house the box it was square with no pretensions to architecture whatever with a porch running all the way around it and it was literally filled with the relics of the mans physical prowess cups for games of all descriptions heads and skins from the bitter roots to bengal and masks and brushes from england to honora there was an irresistible and mysterious fascination in all these trophies each suggesting a finishedand some perhaps a cruelperformance of the man himself the cups were polished until they beat back the light like mirrors and the glossy bear and tiger skins gave no hint of dying agonies  mr brents method with women honora observed more resembled the noble sport of isaac walton than that of nimrod but she could not deny that this element of cruelty was one of his fascinations it was very evident to a feminine observer for instance that mrs chandos was engaged in a breathless and altogether desperate struggle with the slow but inevitable and appalling nemesis of a body and character that would not harmonize if her figure grew stout what was to become of her charm as an enfant gate her host not only perceived but apparently derived great enjoyment out of the drama of this contest from selfindulgence to selfdenialeven though inspired by terroris a far cry and trixton brent had evidently prepared his menu with a satanic purpose  what no entree lula i had that sauce especially for you  oh trixy did you really how sweet of you and her liquid eyes regarded with an almost equal affection first the master and then the dish ill take a little she said weakly its so bad for my gout  what asked trixton brent flashing an amused glance at honora are the symptoms of gout lula i hear a great deal about that trouble these days but it seems to affect every one differently  mrs chandos grew very red but warry trowbridge saved her  its a swelling he said innocently  brent threw back his head and laughed  you havent got it anyway warry he cried  mr trowbridge who resembled a lean and greying irish terrier maintained that he had  its a pity you dont ride lula i understand that thats one of the best preventivesfor gout i bought a horse last week that would just suit youan ideal womans horse hes taken a couple of blue ribbons this summer  i hope you will show him to us mr brent exclaimed honora in a spirit of kindness  do you ride he demanded  im devoted to it she declared  it was true for many weeks that spring on monday wednesday and friday mornings she had gone up from rivington to harveys riding academy near central park thus she had acquired the elements of the equestrian art and incidentally aroused the enthusiasm of a ridingmaster  after mrs chandos had smoked three of the cigarettes which her host specially imported from egypt she declared with no superabundance of enthusiasm that she was ready to go and see what trixy had in the stables in spite of that ladys somewhat obvious impatience honora insisted upon admiring everything from the monogram of coloured sands so deftly woven on the white in the coach house to the hunters and polo ponies in their rows of boxes at last vercingetorix the latest acquisition of which brent had spoken was uncovered and trotted around the ring  im sorry trixy but ive really got to leave said mrs chandos and im in such a predicament i promised fanny darlington id go over there and its eight miles and both my horses are lame  brent turned to his coachman  put a pair in the victoria right away and drive mrs chandos to mrs darlingtons he said  she looked at him and her lip quivered  you always were the soul of generosity trixy but why the victoria  my dear lula he replied if theres any other carriage you prefer  honora did not hear the answer which at any rate was scarcely audible she moved away and her eyes continued to follow vercingetorix as he trotted about the tanbark after a groom and presently she was aware that trixton brent was standing beside her  what do you think of him he asked  hes adorable declared honora would you like to try him  ohmight i sometime  why not todaynow he said ill send him over to your house and have your saddle put on him  before honora could protest mrs chandos came forward  its awfully sweet of you trixy to offer to send me to fannys but warry says he will drive me over goodby my dear she added holding out her hand to honora  i hope you enjoy your ride  mr trowbridges phaeton was brought up brent helped mrs chandos in and stood for a moment gazing after her amusement was still in his eyes as he turned to honora  poor lula he said most women could have done it better than thatcouldnt they  i think you were horrid to her exclaimed honora indignantly it wouldnt have hurt you to drive her to mrs darlingtons  it did not occur to her that her rebuke implied a familiarity at which they had swiftly but imperceptibly arrived  oh yes it would hurt me said he id rather spend a day in jail than drive with lula in that frame of mind tender reproaches and all that sort of thing you know although i cant believe you ever indulge in them dont he added  in spite of the fact that she was up in arms for her sex honora smiled  do you know she said slowly im beginning to think you are a brute  thats encouraging he replied  and fickle  still more encouraging most men are fickle were predatory animals  its just as well that i am warned said honora she raised her parasol and picked up her skirts and shot him a look although he did not resemble in feature the great if unscrupulous emperor of the french he reminded her now of a picture she had once seen of napoleon and a lady the lady obviously in a little flutter under the emperors scrutiny the picture had suggested a probable future for the lady  how long will it take you to dress he asked  to dress for what  to ride with me  im not going to ride with you she said and experienced a tingle of satisfaction from his surprise  why not he demanded  in the first place because i dont want to and in the second because im expecting lily dallam  lily never keeps an engagement he said  thats no reason why i shouldnt honora answered  im beginning to think youre deuced clever said he  how unfortunate for me she exclaimed  he laughed although it was plain that he was obviously put out honora was still smiling  deuced clever he repeated  an experienced moth suggested honora perhaps one that has been singed a little once or twice goodbyive enjoyed myself immensely  she glanced back at him as she walked down the path to the roadway he was still standing where she had left him his feet slightly apart his hands in the pockets of his riding breeches looking after her  her announcement of an engagement with mrs dallam had been to put it politely fiction she spent the rest of the afternoon writing letters home pausing at periods to look out of the window occasionally it appeared that her reflections were amusing at seven oclock howard arrived flushed and tired after his day of rest  by the way honora i saw trixy brent at the club and he said you wouldnt go riding with him  do you call him trixy to his face she asked  what nobut everyone calls him trixy whats the matter with you  nothing she replied onlythe habit every one has in quicksands of speaking of people they dont know well by their nicknames seems rather bad taste  i thought you liked quicksands he retorted you werent happy until you got down here  its infinitely better than rivington she said  i suppose he remarked with a little irritation unusual in him that youll be wanting to go to newport next  perhaps said honora and resumed her letter he fidgeted about the room for a while ordered a cocktail and lighted a cigarette  look here he began presently i wish youd be decent to brent hes a pretty good fellow and hes in with james wing and that crowd of big financiers and he seems to have taken a shine to me probably because hes heard of that copper deal i put through this spring  honora thrust back her writing pad turned in her chair and faced him  how decent do you wish me to be she inquired  how decent he repeated  yes  he regarded her uneasily took the cocktail which the maid offered him drank it and laid down the glass  he had had before in the presence of his wife this vague feeling of having passed boundaries invisible to him in her eyes was a curious smile that lacked mirth in her voice a dispassionate note that added to his bewilderment  what do you mean honora  i know its too much to expect of a man to be as solicitous about his wife as he is about his business she replied otherwise he would hesitate before he threw her into the arms of mr trixton brent i warn you that he is very attractive to women  hang it said howard i cant see what youre driving at im not throwing you into his arms im merely asking you to be friendly with him it means a good deal to meto both of us and besides you can take care of yourself youre not the sort of woman to play the fool  one never can tell said honora what may happen suppose i fell in love with him  dont talk nonsense he said  im not so sure she answered meditatively that it is nonsense it would be quite easy to fall in love with him easier than you imagine curiously would you care she added  care he cried of course id care what kind of rot are you talking  why would you care  why what a darned idiotic question  its not really so idiotic as you think it is she said suppose i allowed mr brent to make love to me as hes very willing to do would you be sufficiently interested to compete  to what  to compete  butbut were married  she laid her hand upon her knee and glanced down at it  it never occurred to me until lately she said how absurd is the belief men still hold in these days that a weddingring absolves them forever from any effort on their part to retain their wives affections they regard the ring very much as a ball and chain or a hobble to prevent the women from running away that they may catch them whenever they may desirewhich isnt often am i not right  he snapped his cigarette case  darn it honora youre getting too deep for me he exclaimed you never liked those browning women down at rivington but if this isnt browning im hanged if i know what it is an attack of nerves perhaps they tell me that women go all to pieces nowadays over nothing at all  thats just it she agreed nothing at all  i thought as much he replied eager to seize this opportunity of ending a conversation that had neither head nor tail and yet was marvellously uncomfortable there be a good girl and forget it  he stooped down suddenly to her face to kiss her but she turned her face in time to receive the caress on the cheek  the panacea she said  he laughed a little boyishly as he stood looking down at her  sometimes i cant make you out he said youve changed a good deal since i married you  she was silent but the thought occurred to her that a complete absorption in commercialism was not developing  if you can manage it honora he added with an attempt at lightness i wish youd have a little dinner soon and ask brent will you  nothing she replied would give me greater pleasure  he patted her on the shoulder and left the room whistling but she sat where she was until the maid came in to pull the curtains and turn on the lights reminding her that guests were expected           although the circle of mr brents friends could not be said to include any university or college presidents it was however both catholic and wide he was hail fellow indeed with jockeys and financiers great ladies and municipal statesmen of good irish stock he was a lion who roamed at large over a great variety of hunting grounds some of which it would be snobbish to mention for many reasons he preferred quicksands a maneater a womaneater and extraordinarily popular nevertheless many ladies so it was reported had tried to tame him some of them he had cheerfully gobbled up and others after the briefest of inspections disdainfully thrust aside with his paw  this instinct for lion taming which the most spirited of women possess is by the way almost inexplicable to the great majority of the male sex honora had it as must have been guessed but however our faith in her may be justified by the ridiculous ease of her previous conquests we cannot regard without trepidation her entrance into the arena with this particular and widely renowned king of beasts innocence pitted against sophistry and wile and might  two of the preliminary contests we have already witnessed others more or less similar followed during a period of two months or more nothing inducing the excessive wagging of tongueshonora saw to that although mrs chandos kindly took the trouble to warn our heroinea scene for which there is unfortunately no space in this chronicle an entirely amicable almost honeyed scene in honoras boudoir nor can a complete picture of life at quicksands be undertaken multiply mrs dallams dinnerparty by one hundred howard silences sundays at the club by twenty and one has a very fair idea of it it was not precisely intellectual happy says montesquieu the people whose annals are blank in historys book let us leave it at that  late one afternoon in august honora was riding homeward along the ocean road the fragrant marshes that bordered it were a vivid green under the slanting rays of the sun and she was gazing across them at the breakers crashing on the beach beyond trixton brent was beside her  i wish you wouldnt stare at me so she said turning to him suddenly it is embarrassing  how did you know i was looking at you he asked  i felt it  he drew his horse a little nearer  sometimes youre positively uncanny she added  he laughed  i rather like that castlesinspain expression you wore he declared  castles in spain  or in some other place where the real estate is more valuable certainly not in quicksands  you are uncanny proclaimed honora with conviction  i told you you wouldnt like quicksands said he  ive never said i didnt like it she replied i cant see why you assume that i dont  youre ambitious he said not that i think it a fault when its more or less warranted your thrown away here and you know it  she made him a bow from the saddle  i have not been without a reward at least she answered and looked at him  i have said he  honora smiled  im going to be your good angel and help you get out of it he continued  get out of what  quicksands  do you think im in danger of sinking she asked and is it impossible for me to get out alone if i wished to  it will be easier with my help he answered youre clever enough to realize thathonora  she was silent awhile  you say the most extraordinary things she remarked presently sometimes i think they are almost  indelicate he supplied  she coloured  yes indelicate  you cant forgive me for sweeping away your rosecoloured cloud of romance he declared laughing there are spades in the pack however much you may wish to ignore em you know very well you dont like these quicksands people they grate on your finer sensibilities and all that sort of thing come now isnt it so  she coloured again and put her horse to the trot  onwards and upwards he cried veni vidi vici ascendi  it seems to me she laughed that so much education is thrown away on the stock market  whether you will be any happier higher up he went on god knows sometimes i think you ought to go back to the arcadia you came from did you pick out spence for an embryo lord of high finance  my excuse is replied honora that i was very young and i hadnt met you  whether the lion has judged our heroine with astuteness or done her a little less than justice must be left to the reader apparently he is accepting her gentle lashings with a meek enjoyment he assisted her to alight at her own door sent the horses home and offered to come in and give her a lesson in a delightful game that was to do its share in the disintegration of the old and tiresome order of thingsbridge the lion it will be seen was selfsacrificing even to the extent of double dummy he had picked up the game with characteristic aptitude abroadquicksands had yet to learn it  howard spence entered in the midst of the lesson  hello brent said he genially you may be interested to know i got that little matter through without a hitch today  i continue to marvel at you said the lion and made it no trumps  since this is a veracious history and since we have wandered so far from home and amidst such strange if brilliant scenes it must be confessed that honora three days earlier had entered a certain shop in new york and inquired for a book on bridge yes said the clerk he had such a treatise it had arrived from england a week before she kept it looked up in her drawer and studied it in the mornings with a pack of cards before her  given the proper amount of spur anything in reason can be mastered     volume 4     chapter vii of certain delicate matters  in the religious cult of gad and meni practised with such enthusiasm at quicksands the saints days were polo days and the chief of all festivals the occasion of the match with the banbury hunt clubquicksandss greatest rival rival for more reasons than one reasons too delicate to tell long long ago there appeared in punch a cartoon of lord beaconsfield executing that most difficult of performances an egg dance we shall be fortunate indeed if we get to the end of this chapter without breaking an egg  our pen fails us in a description of that festival of festivals the banbury one which took place early in september we should have to go back to babylon and the days of king nebuchadnezzar who turns out to have been only a regent by the way and his name is now said to be spelled rezzar how give an idea of the libations poured out to gad and the shekels laid aside for meni in the quicksands temple  honora privately thought that building ugly and it reminded her of a collection of huge yellow fungi sprawling over the ground a few of the inevitable tortured cedars were around it between two of the larger buildings was wedged a room dedicated to the worship of bacchus today like a narrow rivergorge at flood time jammed with treetrunkssome of them let us say waterloggedand all grinding together with an intolerable noise like a battle if you happened to be passing the windows certain more or less intelligible sounds might separate themselves from the bedlam  four to five on quicksands  that stock isnt worth a dn  shes gone to south dakota  honora however is an heretic as we know without going definitely into her reasons these festivals had gradually become distasteful to her perhaps it would be fairer to look at them through the eyes of lily dallam who was in her element on such days and regarded them as the most innocent and enjoyable of occasions and perhaps they were  the view from the veranda at least appealed to our heroines artistic sense the marshes in the middle distance the shimmering sea beyond and the polo field laid down like a vast green carpet in the foreground while the players in white breeches and bright shirts on the agile little horses that darted hither and thither across the turf lent an added touch of colour and movement to the scene amongst them trixton brent most frequently caught the eye and held it once honora perceived him flying the length of the field madly pursued his mallet poised lightly his shirt bulging in the wind his closecropped head bereft of a cap regardless of the havoc and confusion behind him he played indeed with the cocksureness and individuality one might have expected and honora forgetting at moments the disturbing elements by which she was surrounded followed him with fascination occasionally his name rippled from one end of the crowded veranda to the other and she experienced a curious and uncomfortable sensation when she heard it in the mouths of these strangers  from time to time she found herself watching them furtively comparing them unconsciously with her quicksands friends some of them she had remarked before at contests of a minor importance and they seemed to her to possess a certain distinction that was indefinable they had come today from many mysterious and therefore delightful places which honora knew only by name and some had driven the twentyfive odd miles from the bunting community of banbury in coaches and even those new and marvellous importationsfrench automobiles when the game had ended and lily dallam was cajoling the club steward to set her teatable at once a group of these visitors halted on the lawn talking and laughing gayly two of the younger men honora recognized with a start but for a moment she could not place themuntil suddenly she remembered that she had seen them on her wedding trip at hot springs the one who lisped was mr cuthbert familiarly known as toots the other taller and slimmer and paler was jimmy wing a third the regularity of whose features made one wonder at the perfection which nature could attain when she chose who had a certain gallic appearance and who if the truth be told might have reminded an impartial eye of a slightly animated wax clothing model turned stared hesitated and bowed to lily dallam  thats reggie farwel who did my house in town she whispered to honora hes never been near me since it was finished hes utterly ruined  honora was silent she tried not to look at the group in which there were two women of very attractive appearance and another man  those people are so superior mrs dallam continued  im not surprised at elsie shorter ever since she married jerry shes stuck to the graingers closer than a sister thats cecil grainger my dear the man who looks as though he were going to fall asleep any moment but to think of abby kame acting that way isnt it ridiculous clara she cried appealing to mrs trowbridge they say that cecil grainger never leaves her side i knew her when she first married john kame the dearest simplest man that ever was he was twenty years older than abby and made his money in leather she took the first steamer after his funeral and an apartment in a roman palace for the winter as soon as she decently could she made for england the english will put up with anybody who has a few million dollars and i dont deny that abbys goodlooking and clever in her way but its absurd for her to come over here and act as though we didnt exist she neednt be afraid that ill speak to her they say she became intimate with bessie grainger through charities one of your friend mrs holts charities by the way honora where are you going  for honora had risen  i think ill go home lily she said im rather tired  home exclaimed mrs dallam what can you be thinking of my dear nobody ever goes home after the banbury match the fun has just begun and were all to stay here for dinner and dance afterwards and trixy brent promised me faithfully hed come here for tea as soon as he dressed  i really cant stay lily ii dont feel up to it said honora desperately  and you cant know how i counted on you you look perfectly fresh my dear  honora felt an overwhelming desire to hide herself to be alone in spite of the cries of protest that followed her and drewshe thoughtan unnecessary and disagreeable attention to her departure she threaded her way among groups of people who stared after her her colour was high her heart beating painfully a vague sense of rebellion and shame within her for which she did not try to account rather than run the gantlet of the crowded veranda she stepped out on the lawn and there encountered trixton brent he had in an incredibly brief time changed from his polo clothes to flannels and a straw hat he looked at her and whistled and barred her passage  hello he cried hoitytoity where are we going in such a hurry  home answered honora a little breathlessly and added for his deception the games over isnt it im glad you won  mr brent however continued to gaze at her penetratingly and she avoided his eyes  but why are you rushing off like a flushed partridgeno reference to your complexion has there been a row  oh noi was justtired please let me go  being your good angelor physician as you choosei have a prescription for that kind of weariness he said smilingly ianticipated such an attack thats why i got into my clothes in such record time  i dont know what you mean faltered honora you are always imagining all sorts of things about me that arent true  as a matter of fact said brent i have promised faithfully to do a favor for certain friends of mine who have been clamouring to be presented to you  i canttodaymr brent she cried i really dont feel likemeeting people i told lily dallam i was going home  the group however which had been the object of that ladys remarks was already moving towards themwith the exception of mrs shorter and mr farwell who had left it they greeted mr brent with great cordiality  mrs kame he said let me introduce mrs spence and mrs spence mr grainger mr wing and mr cuthbert mrs spence was just going home  home echoed mrs kame i thought quicksands people never went home after a victory  ive scarcely been here long enough replied honora to have acquired all of the quicksands habits  oh said mrs kame and looked at honora again wasnt that mrs dallam you were with i used to know her years ago but she doesnt speak to me any more  perhaps she thinks youve forgotten her said honora  it would be impossible to forget mrs dallam declared mrs kame  so i should have thought said honora  trixton brent laughed and mrs kame too after a moments hesitation she laid her hand familiarly on mr brents arm  i havent seen you all summer trixy she said i hear youve been here at quicksands stewing in that little packingcase of yours arent you coming into our steeplechase at banbury  i believe you went to school with my sister said young mr wing  oh yes answered honora somewhat surprised i caught a glimpse of her once in new york i hope you will remember me to her  and ive seen you before proclaimed mr cuthbert but i cant for the life of me think where  honora did not enlighten him  i shant forget at any rate mrs spence said cecil grainger who had not taken his eyes from her except to blink  mrs kame saved her the embarrassment of replying  cant we go somewhere and play bridge trixy demanded  id be delighted to offer you the hospitality of my packingcase as you call it said brent but the diningroom ceiling fell down wednesday and im having the others bolstered up as a mere matter of precaution  i suppose we couldnt get a fourth anyway neither jimmy nor toots plays its so stupid of them not to learn  mrs spence might help us out suggested brent  do you play exclaimed mrs kame in a voice of mixed incredulity and hope  play cried mr brent she can teach jerry shorter or the duchess of taunton  the duchess cheats announced cecil grainger i caught her at it at cannes  indeed i dont play very well honora interrupted him and besides  suppose we go over to mrs spences house trixton brent suggested im sure shed like to have us wouldnt you mrs spence  what a brilliant idea trixy exclaimed mrs kame  i should be delighted said honora somewhat weakly an impulse made her glance toward the veranda and for a fraction of a second she caught the eye of lily dallam who turned again to mrs chandos  i say said mr cuthbert i dont playbut i hope i may come along  and me too chimed in mr wing  honora not free from a certain uneasiness of conscience led the way to the brackens flanked by mr grainger and mr cuthbert her frame of mind was not an ideal one for a hostess she was put out with trixton brent and she could not help wondering whether these people would have made themselves so free with another house when tea was over however and the bridge had begun her spirits rose or rather a new and strange excitement took possession of her that was not wholly due to the novel and revolutionary experience of playing for moneyand winning her star being in the ascendant as we may perceive she had drawn mrs kame for a partner and the satisfaction and graciousness of that lady visibly grew as the score mounted even the skill of trixton brent could not triumph over the hands which the two ladies held  in the intervals the talk wandered into regions unfamiliar to honora and she had a sense that her own horizon was being enlarged a new vista at least had been cut possibilities became probabilities even when mrs kame chose to ridicule quicksands honora was silent so keenly did she feel the justice of her guests remarks and the implication was that honora did not belong there when train time arrived and they were about to climb into trixton brents omnibusfor which he had obligingly telephonedmrs kame took honoras band in both her own some good thing after all could come out of this communitysuch was the triumphant discovery the ladys manner implied  my dear dont you ever come to banbury she asked id be so glad to see you i must get trixy to drive you over some day for lunch weve had such a good time and cecil didnt fall asleep once quite a record you saved our lives really  are you going to be in town this winter mr grainger inquired  ii suppose soreplied honora for the moment taken aback although i havent decided just where  i shall look forward to seeing you he said  this hope was expressed even more fervently by mr cuthbert and mr wing and the whole party waved her a cordial goodby as the carriage turned the circle trixton brent with his hands in his pockets stood facing her under the electric light on the porch  well he said  well repeated honora  nice people said mr brent  honora bridled  you invited them here she said i must say i think it was ratherpresumptuous and youve got me into no end of trouble with lily dallam  he laughed as he held open the screen door for her  i wonder whether a good angel was ever so abused he said  a good angel she repeated smiling at him in spite of herself  or knighterrant he continued whichever you choose you want to get out of quicksandsim trying to make it easy for you before you leave you have to arrange some place to go before we are off with the old wed better be on with the new  oh please dont say such things she cried theyre soso sordid she looked searchingly into his face do i really seem to you like that  her lip was quivering and she was still under the influence of the excitement which the visit of these people had brought about  no said brentcoming very close to her no you dont thats the extraordinary part of it the trouble with you honora is that you want something badly very badlyand you havent yet found out what it is  and you wont find out he added until you have tried everything therefore am i a good samaritan or something like it  she looked at him with startled eyes breathing deeply  i wonder if that is so she said in a low voice  not until you have had and broken every toy in the shop he declared out of the mouths of men of the world occasionally issues wisdom im going to help you get the toys dont you think im kind  and isnt this philanthropic mood a little new to you she asked  i thought i had exhausted all novelties he answered perhaps thats the reason why i enjoy it  she turned and walked slowly into the drawingroom halted and stood staring at the heap of gold and yellow bills that mr grainger had deposited in front of the place where she had sat her sensation was akin to sickness she reached out with a kind of shuddering fascination and touched the gold  i think she said speaking rather to herself than to brent ill give it to charity  if it is possible to combine a meritorious act with good policy i should suggest giving it to mrs grainger for the relief of oppressed working girls he said  honora started  i wonder why howard doesnt come she exclaimed looking at the clock  probably because he is holding nothing but full hands and flushes hazarded mr brent might i propose myself for dinner  when so many people are clamouring for you she asked  even so he said  i think ill telephone to the club said honora and left the room  it was some time before her husband responded to the call and then he explained that if honora didnt object he was going to a mans dinner in a private room the statement was not unusual  but howard she said ii wanted you particularly tonight  i thought you were going to dine with lily dallam she told me you were are you alone  mr brent is here he brought over some banbury people to play bridge theyve gone  oh brent will amuse you he replied i didnt know you were going to be home and ive promised these men ill come back early  she hung up the receiver thoughtfully paused a moment and went back to the drawingroom brent looked up  well he said was i right  you seem always to be right honora sighed  after dinner they sat in the screened part of the porch which mrs fern had arranged very cleverly as an outside room brent had put a rug over honoras knees for the ocean breath that stirred the leaves was cold across the darkness fragments of dance music drifted fitfully from the club and died away and at intervals when the embers of his cigar flared up she caught sight of her companions face  she found him difficult to understand there are certain rules of thumb in every art no doubteven in that most perilous one of liontaming but here was a baffling individual lion she liked him best she told herself when he purred platonically but she could by no means be sure that his subjection was complete sometimes he had scratched her in his play and however natural it is to desire a lion for ones friend to be eaten is both uncomfortable and inglorious  thats a remarkable husband of yours he said at length  i shouldnt have said that you were a particularly good judge of husbands she retorted after a moment of surprise  he acknowledged with a laugh the justice of this observation  i stand corrected he is by no means a remarkable husband permit me to say he is a remarkable man  what makes you think so asked honora considerably disturbed  because he induced you to marry him for one thing said brent of course he got you before you knew what you were worth but we must give him credit for discovery and foresight  perhaps honora could not resist replying perhaps he didnt know what he was getting  thats probably true brent assented or hed be sitting here now where i am instead of playing poker although there is something in matrimony that takes the bloom off the peach  i think thats a horrid cynical remark said honora  well he said we speak according to our experiencesthat is if were not inclined to be hypocritical most women are  honora was silent he had thrown away his cigar and she could no longer see his face she wondered whither he was leading  how would you like to see your husband president of a trust company he said suddenly  howardpresident of a trust company she exclaimed  why not he demanded and added enigmatically smaller men have been  i wish you wouldnt joke about howard she said  how does the idea strike you he persisted ambition satisfiedtemporarily quicksands a milestone on a back road another toy to break husband a big man in the community so far as the eye can see visiting list on fifth avenue and all that sort of thing  i once told you you could be brutal she said  you havent told me what you thought of the idea  i wish youd be sensible once in a while she exclaimed  howard spence president of the orange trust company he recited i suppose no man is a hero to his wife does it sound so incredible  it did but honora did not say so  what have i to do with it she asked in pardonable doubt as to his seriousness  everything answered brent women of your type usually have they make and mar without rhyme or reasonset business by the ears alter the gold reserve disturb the balance of trade and nobody ever suspects it old james wing and i have got a trust company organized and the building up and the man wing wanted for president backed out  honora sat up  whywhy did he back out she demanded  he preferred to stay where he was i suppose replied brent in another tone the point is that the place is empty ill give it to you  to me  certainly said brent i dont pretend to care anything about your husband hell do as well as the next man his duties are pretty welldefined  again she was silent but after a moment dropped back in her chair and laughed uneasily  youre preposterous she said i cant think why i let you talk to me in this way     chapter viii of mental processesfeminine and insoluble  honora may be pardoned for finally ascribing to mr brents somewhat sardonic sense of humour his remarks concerning her husbands elevation to a conspicuous position in the world of finance taken in any other sense than a joke they were both insulting and degrading and made her face burn when she thought of them after he had goneor rather after she had dismissed himshe took a book upstairs to wait for howard but she could not read at times she wished she had rebuked trixton brent more forcibly although he was not an easy person to rebuke and again she reflected that had she taken the matter too seriously she would have laid herself open to his ridicule the lion was often unwittingly rough and perhaps that was part of his fascination  if howard had come home before midnight it is possible that she might have tried to sound him as to his relations with trixton brent that gentleman she remembered had the reputation of being a peculiarly hardheaded business man and it was of course absurd that he should offer her husband a position merely to please her and her imagination failed her when she tried to think of howard as the president of a trust company she was unable to picture him in a great executive office  this train of thought led her to the unaccustomed task of analyzing his character for the first time since her marriage comparisons crept into her mind and she awoke to the fact that he was not a masterful maneven among men for all his selfconfidenceselfassurance perhaps would be the better wordhe was in reality a follower not a leader a gleaner he did not lack ideas she tried to arrest the process in her brain when she got as far as asking herself whether it might not be that he lacked ideals since in business matters he never had taken her into his confidence and since she would not at any rate have understood such things she had no proof of such a failing but one or two vague remarks of trixton brents which she recalled and howards own request that she should be friendly with brent reenforced her instinct on this point  when she heard her husbands footstep on the porch she put out her light but still lay thinking in the darkness her revelations had arrived at the uncomfortable stage where they began to frighten her and with an effort she forced herself to turn to the other side of the account the hour was conducive to exaggerations perfection in husbands was evidently a state not to be considered by any woman in her right senses he was more or less amenable and he was prosperous although definite news of that prosperity never came from himquicksands always knew of it first an instance of this secondhand acquisition of knowledge occurred the very next morning when lily dallam with much dignity walked into honoras little sittingroom there was no apparent reason why dignity should not have been becoming to lily dallam for she was by no means an unimpressivelooking woman but the assumption by her of that quality always made her a little tragic or if one chanced to be in the humourhonora was not a little ridiculous  i suppose i have no pride she said as she halted within a few feet of the doorway  why lily exclaimed honora pushing back the chair from her desk and rising  but mrs dallam did not move  i suppose i have no pride she repeated in a dead voice but i just couldnt help coming over and giving you a chance  giving me a chance said honora  to explainafter the way you treated me at the polo game if i hadnt seen it with my own eyes i shouldnt have believed it i dont think i should have trusted my own eyes mrs dallam went so far as to affirm if lula chandos and clara trowbridge and others hadnt been there and seen it too i shouldnt have believed it  honora was finding penitence a little difficult but her heart was kind  do sit down lily she begged if ive offended you in any way im exceedingly sorryi am really you ought to know me well enough to understand that i wouldnt do anything to hurt your feelings  and when i counted on you so for my tea and dinner at the club continued mrs dallam there were other women dying to come and you said you had a headache and were tired  i was began honora fruitlessly  and you were so popular in quicksandseverybody was crazy about you you were so sweet and so unspoiled i might have known that it couldnt last and now because abby kame and cecil grainger and  lily please dont say such things honora implored revolted  of course you wont be satisfied now with anything less than banbury or newport but you cant say i didnt warn you honora that they are a horrid selfish fast lot lily dallam declared and brushed her eyes with her handkerchief i did love you  if youll only be reasonable a moment lily said honora  reasonable i saw you with my own eyes five minutes after you left me they all started for your house and lula chandos said it was the quickest cure of a headache she had ever seen  lily honora began again with exemplary patience when people invite themselves to ones house its a little difficult to refuse them hospitality isnt it  invite themselves  yes replied honora if i werentfond of you too i shouldnt make this explanation i was tired i never felt less like entertaining strangers they wanted to play bridge there wasnt a quiet spot in the club where they could go they knew i was on my way home and they suggested my house that is how it happened  mrs dallam was silent a moment  may i have one of howards cigarettes she asked and added after this modest wish had been supplied thats just like them theyre willing to make use of anybody  i meant said honora to have gone to your house this morning and to have explained how it happened  another brief silence broken by lily dallam  did you notice the skirt of that suit abby kame had on she asked im sure she paid a fabulous price for it in paris and its exactly like one i ordered on tuesday  the details of the rest of this conversation may be omitted that honora was forgiven and mrs dallams spirits restored may be inferred from her final remark  my dear what do you think of sid and howard making twenty thousand dollars apiece in sassafras copper isnt it too lovely im having a little architect make me plans for a conservatory you know ive always been dying for onei dont see how ive lived all these years without it  honora after her friend had gone sat down in one of the wicker chairs on the porch she had a very vague idea as to how much twenty thousand dollars was but she reflected that while they had lived in rivington howard must have made many similar sums of which she was unaware gradually she began to realize however that her resentment of the lack of confidence of her husband was by no means the only cause of the feeling that took possession of and overwhelmed her something like it she had experienced before today her thoughts seemed to run through her in pulsations like waves of heat and she wondered that she could have controlled herself while listening to lily dallam  mrs dallams reproaches presented themselves to honora in new aspects she began to feel now with an intensity that frightened her distaste and rebellion it was intolerable that she should be called to account for the people she chose to have in her house that any sort of pressure should be brought to bear on her to confine her friends to quicksands treason heresy disloyalty to the cult of that communityin reality these and not a breach of engagement were the things of which she had been accused she saw now she would not be tied to quicksandsshe would not she would not she would not she owed it no allegiance her very soul rebelled at the thought and cried out that she was made for something better something higher than the life she had been leading she would permit no one forcibly to restrict her horizon  just where and how this higher and better life was to be found honora did not know but the belief of her childhoodthat it existed somewherewas still intact her powers of analysis we see are only just budding and she did not and could not define the ideal existence which she so unflaggingly sought of two of its attributes only she was surethat it was to be free from restraint and from odious comparisons honoras development it may be remarked proceeds by the action of irritants and of late her protest against quicksands and what it represented had driven her to other books besides the treatise on bridge the library she had collected at rivington she had brought with her and was adding to it from time to time its volumes are neither sufficiently extensive or profound to enumerate  those who are more or less skilled in psychology may attempt to establish a sequence between the events and reflections just related and the fact that one morning a fortnight later honora found herself driving northward on fifth avenue in a hansom cab she was in a pleasurable state of adventurous excitement comparable to that columbus must have felt when the shores of the old world had disappeared below the horizon during the fortnight we have skipped honora had been to town several times and had driven and walked through certain streets inspiration courage and decision had all arrived at once this morning when at the ferry she had given the cabman this particular address on fifth avenue  the cab with the jerking and thumping peculiar to hansoms made a circle and drew up at the curb but even then a moment of irresolution intervened and she sat staring through the little side window at the sign t gerald shorter real estate in neat gold letters over the basement floor of the building  here yare miss said the cabman through the hole in the roof  honora descended and was almost at the flight of steps leading down to the office door when a familiar figure appeared coming out of it it was that of mr toots cuthbert arrayed in a faultless morning suit his tie delicately suggestive of falling leaves and there dangled over his arm the slenderest of walking sticks  mrs spence he lisped with every appearance of joy  mr cuthbert she cried  going in to see jerry he inquired after he had put on his hat nodding up at the sign  ithat is yes i had thought of it she answered  town house said mr cuthbert with a knowing smile  i did have an idea of looking at houses she confessed somewhat taken aback  im your man announced mr cuthbert  you exclaimed honora with an air of considering the lilies of the field but he did not seem to take offence  thats my business he proclaimedwhen in town jerry gives me a commission come in and see him while i get a list and some keys by the way you wouldnt object to telling him you were a friend of mine would you  not at all said honora laughing  mr shorter was a jovial gentleman in loosefitting clothes and he was exceedingly glad to meet mr cuthberts friend  what kind of a house do you want mrs spence he asked cuthbert tells me this morning that the whitworth house has come into the market you couldnt have a better location than that on the avenue between the cathedral and the park  oh said honora with a gasp thats much too expensive im sure and there are only two of us she hesitated a little alarmed at the rapidity with which affairs were proceeding and added i ought to tell you that ive not really decided to take a house i wished toto see what there was to be had and then i should have to consult my husband  she gazed very seriously into mr shorters brown eyes which became very wide and serious too but all the time it seemed to her that other parts of him were laughing  husbands he declared are killjoys what have they got to do with a houseexcept to sleep in it now i havent the pleasure of knowing you as well as i hope to one of these days mrs spence  oh i say interrupted mr cuthbert  but i venture to predict on a slight acquaintance continued mr shorter undisturbed that you will pick out the house you want and that your husband will move into it  honora could not help laughing and mr shorter leaned back in his revolving chair and laughed too in so alarming a manner as to lead her to fear he would fall over backwards but mr cuthbert who did not appear to perceive the humour in this conversation extracted some keys and several pasteboard slips from a rack in the corner suddenly mr shorter jerked himself upright again and became very solemn  wheres my hat he demanded  what do you want with your hat mr cuthbert inquired  why im going with you of course mr shorter replied ive decided to take a personal interest in this matter you may regard my presence cuthbert as justified by an artistic passion for my profession i should never forgive myself if mrs spence didnt get just the right house  oh said mr cuthbert ill manage that all right i thought you were going to see the representative of a syndicate at eleven  mr shorter with a sigh acknowledged this necessity and escorted honora gallantly through the office and across the sidewalk to the waiting hansom cuthbert got in beside her  jerrys a joker he observed as they drove off you mustnt mind him  i think hes delightful said honora  one wouldnt believe that a man of his size and appearance could be so fond of women said mr cuthbert hes the greatest old ladykiller that ever breathed for two cents he would have come with us this morning and let a five thousand dollar commission go do you know mrs shorter  no replied honora she looks most attractive i caught a glimpse of her at the polo that day with you  ive been at her house in newport ever since came down yesterday to try to earn some money he continued cheerfully making himself agreeable deuced clever woman much too clever for me and jerry too always in a teteatete with an antiquarian or a pathologist or a psychologist and tells novelists what to put into their next books and jurists how to decide cases full of modern and liberal ideasbelieves in free love and all that sort of thing and gives jerry the dickens for practising it  oh exclaimed honora  mr cuthbert however did not appear to realize that he had shocked her  by the way he asked have you seen cecil grainger since the quicksands game  no she replied has mr grainger been at quicksands since  nobody knows where hes been answered mr cuthbert its a mystery he hasnt been homeat newport i meanfor a fortnight hes never stayed away so long without letting any one know where he is naturally they thought he was at mrs kames in banbury but she hasnt laid eyes on him its a mystery my own theory is that he went to sleep in a parlour car and was sent to the yards and hasnt waked up  and isnt mrs grainger worried asked honora  oh you never can tell anything about her he said do you know her shes a sphinx all the pendletons are stoics and besides shes been so busy with this charities conference that she hasnt had time to think of cecil whos that  that was a lady from rivington one of honoras former neighbours to whom she had bowed life indeed is full of contrasts mr cuthbert too was continually bowing and waving to acquaintances on the avenue  thus pleasantly conversing they arrived at the first house on the list and afterwards went through a succession of them once inside honora would look helplessly about her in the darkness while her escort would raise the shades admitting a gloomy light on bare interiors or shrouded furniture  and the rents four five six and seven and eight thousand dollars a year pride prevented her from discussing these prices with mr cuthbert and in truth when lunch time came she had seen nothing which realized her somewhat vague but persistent ideals  im so much obliged to you she said and i hope youll forgive me for wasting your time  mr cuthbert smiled broadly and honora smiled too  indeed there was something ludicrous in the remark he assumed an attitude of reflection  i imagine you wouldnt care to go over beyond lexington avenue would you i didnt think to ask you  no she replied blushing a little i shouldnt care to go over as far as that  he pondered a while longer when suddenly his face lighted up  ive got it he cried the very thingwhy didnt i think of it dicky farnhams house or rather his wifes house ill get it straight after a whileshe isnt his wife any more you know she married eustace rindge last month thats the reason its for rent dicky says hell never get married againyou bet they planned it together laid the cornerstone and all that sort of thing and before it was finished she had a divorce and had gone abroad with rindge i saw her before she sailed and she begged me to rent it but it isnt furnished  i might look at it said honora dubiously  im sure it will just suit you he declared with enthusiasm its a real find well drive around by the office and get the keys  the house was between fifth avenue and madison on a cross street not far below fiftyninth and honora had scarcely entered the little oakpanelled hall before she had forgotten that mr cuthbert was a real estate agenta most difficult thing to remember  upstairs the drawingroom was flooded with sunlight that poured in through a window with stone mullions and leaded panes extending the entire width of the house against the wall stood a huge stone mantel of the tudor period and the ceiling was of wood behind the little hall a cosey library lighted by a well and behind that an ample diningroom and honora remembered to have seen in a shop on fourth avenue just the sideboard for such a setting  on the third floor as mr cuthbert pointed out there was a bedroom and boudoir for mrs spence and a bedroom and dressingroom for mr spence into the domestic arrangement of the house however important we need not penetrate the rent was eight thousand dollars which mr cuthbert thought extremely reasonable  eight thousand dollars as she stood with her back turned looking out on the street some trick of memory brought into her mind the fact that she had once heard her uncle declare that he had bought his house and lot for that exact sum and as cashier of mr ishams bank he did not earn so much in a year  she had found the house indeed but the other and mightier half of the task remained of getting howard into it in the consideration of this most difficult of problems honora who in her exaltation had beheld herself installed in every room grew suddenly serious she was startled out of her reflections by a remark of almost uncanny penetration on the part of mr cuthbert  oh hell come round all right when he sees the house that young gentleman declared  honora turned quickly and after a moment of astonishment laughed in spite of herself it was impossible not to laugh with mr cuthbert so irresistible and debonair was he so confiding and sympathetic that he became before one knew it an accomplice had he not poured out to honora with a charming gayety and frankness many of his financial troubles  im afraid hell think it frightfully expensive she answered becoming thoughtful once more and it did not occur to her that neither of them had mentioned the individual to whom they referred  wait until hes feeling tiptop mr cuthbert advised and then bring him up here in a hurry i say i hope you do take the house he added with a boyish seriousness after she had refused his appeal to lunch with him and that you will let me come and see you once in a while  she lunched alone in a quiet corner of the diningroom of one of the large hotels gazing at intervals absently out of the window and by the middle of the afternoon she found herself quite unexpectedly in the antique furniture shop gazing at the sideboard and a set of leatherseated jacobean chairs and bribing the dealer with a smile to hold them for a few days until she could decide whether she wished them in a similar mood of abstraction she boarded the ferry but it was not until the boat had started on its journey that she became aware of a trim familiar figure in front of her silhouetted against the ruffed blue waters of the rivertrixton brents and presently as though the concentration of her thoughts upon his back had summoned him he turned  where have you been all this time she asked i havent seen you for an age  to seattle  to seattle she exclaimed what were you doing there  trying to forget you he replied promptly and incidentally attempting to obtain control of some properties both efforts i may add were unsuccessful  im sorry said honora  and what mischief he demanded have you been up to  youll never guess she exclaimed  preparing for the exodus he hazarded  you surely dont expect me to stay in quicksands all winter she replied a little guiltily  quicksands he declared has passed into history  you always insist upon putting a wrong interpretation upon what i do she complained  he laughed  what interpretation do you put on it he asked  a most natural and praiseworthy one she answered education improvement growththese things are as necessary for a woman as for a man of course i dont expect you to believe thatyour idea of women not being a very exalted one  he did not reply for at that instant the bell rang the passengers pressed forward about them and they were soon in the midst of the confusion of a landing it was not until they were seated in adjoining chairs of the parlourcar that the conversation was renewed  when do you move to town he inquired  however simple mr brents methods of reasoning may appear to others his apparent clairvoyance never failed to startle honora  somebody has told you that ive been looking at houses she exclaimed  have you found one  she hesitated  yesi have found one it belongs to some people named farnhamtheyre divorced  dicky farnhams exwife he supplied i know where it isunexceptionable neighbourhood and all that sort of thing  and its just finished continued honora her enthusiasm gaining on her as she spoke of the object which had possessed her mind for four hours its the most enchanting house and so sunny for new york if i had built it myself it could not have suited me better only  only repeated trixton brent smiling  well she said slowly i really oughtnt to talk about it ii havent said anything to howard yet and he may not like it i ran across it by the merest accident  what will you give me he said if i can induce howard to like it  my eternal friendship she laughed  thats not enough said trixton brent     chapter ix introducing a revolutionizing vehicle  howard said honora that evening ive been going through houses today  houses he exclaimed looking up from his newspaper  and ive been most fortunate she continued i found one that mrs farnham builtshe is now mrs rindge it is just finished and so attractive if id looked until doomsday i couldnt have done any better  but great scott he ejaculated what put the notion of a town house into your head  isnt it high time to be thinking of the winter she asked its nearly the end of september  he was inarticulate for a few moments in an evident desperate attempt to rally his forces to meet such an unforeseen attack  who said anything about going to town he inquired  now howard dont be foolish she replied surely you didnt expect to stay in quicksands all winter  foolish he repeated and added inconsequently why not  because said honora calmly i have a life to lead as well as you  but you werent satisfied until you got to quicksands and now you want to leave it  i didnt bargain to stay here in the winter she declared you know very well that if you were unfortunate it would be different but youre quite prosperous  how do you know he demanded unguardedly  quicksands tells me she said it isa little humiliating not to have more of your confidence and to hear such things from outsiders  you never seemed interested in business matters he answered uneasily  i should be said honora if you would only take the trouble to tell me about them she stood up howard cant you see that it is making usgrow apart if you wont tell me about yourself and what youre doing you drive me to other interests i am your wife and i ought to knowi want to know the reason i dont understand is because youve never taken the trouble to teach me i wish to lead my own life it is trueto develop i dont want to be like these other women down here ii was made for something better im sure of it but i wish my life to be joined to yours tooand it doesnt seem to be and sometimesim afraid i cant explain it to yousometimes i feel lonely and frightened as though i might do something desperate and i dont know whats going to become of me  he laid down his newspaper and stared at her helplessly with the air of a man who suddenly finds himself at sea in a small boat without oars  oh you cant understand she cried i might have known you never could  he was indeed thoroughly perplexed and uncomfortable unhappy might not be too strong a word he got up awkwardly and put his hand on her arm she did not respond he drew her limp and unresisting down on the lounge beside him  for heavens sake what is the matter honora he faltered ii thought we were happy you were getting on all right and seemed to be having a good time down here you never said anything aboutthis  she turned her head and looked at hima long searching look with widened eyes  no she said slowly you dont understand i suppose it isnt your fault  ill try he said i dont like to see youupset like this ill do anything i can to make you happy  not things notnot toys trixton brents expression involuntarily coming to her lips oh cant you see im not that kind of a woman i dont want to be bought i want you whatever you are if you are i want to be saved take care of mesee a little more of mebe a little interested in what i think god gave me a mind andother men have discovered it you dont know you cant know what temptations you subject me to it isnt right howard and oh it is humiliating not to be able to interest ones husband  but you do interest me he protested  she shook her head  not so much as your business she said not nearly so much  perhaps i have been too absorbed he confessed one thing has followed another i didnt suspect that you felt this way come ill try to brace up he pressed her to him dont feel badly youre overwrought youve exaggerated the situation honora well go in on the eight oclock train together and look at the housealthough im afraid its a little steep he added cautiously  i dont care anything about the house said honora i dont want it  there he said soothingly youll feel differently in the morning well go and look at it anyway  her quick ear however detected an undertone which if not precisely resentment was akin to the vexation that an elderly gentleman might be justified in feeling who has taken the same walk for twenty years and is one day struck by a falling brick howard had not thought of consulting her in regard to remaining all winter in quicksands and although he might not realize it himself if he should consent to go to new york one reason for his acquiescence would be that the country in winter offered a more or less favourable atmosphere for the recurrence of similar unpleasant and unaccountable domestic convulsions business demands peace at any price and the ultimatum at rivington though delivered in so different a manner recurred to him  the morning sunlight as is well known is a dispeller of moods a disintegrator of the nights fantasies it awoke honora at what for her was a comparatively early hour and as she dressed rapidly she heard her husband whistling in his room it is idle to speculate on the phenomenon taking place within her and it may merely be remarked in passing that she possessed a quality which in a man leads to a career and fame unimagined numbers of americas women possess that qualitya fact that is becoming more and more apparent every day  why honora howard exclaimed as she appeared at the breakfast table whats happened to you  have you forgotten already she asked smilingly as she poured out her coffee that we are going to town together  he readjusted his newspaper against the carafe  how much do you think mrs farnhamor mrs rindgeis worth he asked  im sure i dont know she replied  old marshall left her five million dollars  what has that to do with it inquired honora  she isnt going to rent especially in that part of town for nothing  wouldnt it be wiser howard to wait and see the house you know you proposed it yourself and it wont take very much of your time  he returned to a perusal of the financial column but his eye from time to time wandered from the sheet to his wife who was reading her letters  howard she said i feel dreadfully about mrs holt we havent been at silverdale all summer heres a note from her saying shell be in town tomorrow for the charities conference asking me to come to see her at her hotel i think ill go to silverdale a little later  why dont you he said it would do you good  and you she asked  my only day of the week is sunday honora you know that and i wouldnt spend another day at silverdale if they gave me a deed to the property he declared  on the train when howard had returned from the smoking car and they were about to disembark at long island city they encountered mr trixton brent  whither away he cried in apparent astonishment up at dawn and the eight oclock train  we were going to look at a house explained honora and howard has no other time  ill go too declared mr brent promptly you mightnt think me a judge of houses but i am ive lived in so many bad ones that i know a good one when i see it now  honora has got a wild notion into her head that im going to take the farnham house said howard smiling there on the deck of the ferryboat in the flooding sunlight the idea seemed to give him amusement with the morning light pharaoh must have hardened his heart  well perhaps you are said mr brent conveying to honora his delight in the situation by a scarcely perceptible wink i shouldnt like to take the other end of the bet why shouldnt you youre fat and healthy and making money faster than you can gather it in  howard coughed and laughed a little uncomfortably trixton brent was not a man to offend  honora has got that delusion too he replied he steeled himself in his usual manner for the ordeal to come by smoking a cigarette for the arrival of such a powerful ally on his wifes side lent a different aspect to the situation  honora during this colloquy was silent she was a little uncomfortable and pretended not to see mr brents wink  incredible as it may seem i expected to have my automobile ready this morning he observed we might have gone in that it landed three days ago but so far it has failed to do anything but fire off revolver shots  oh i do wish you had it said honora relieved by the change of subject to drive in one must be such a wonderful sensation  ill let you know when it stops shooting up the garage and consents to move out he said ill take you down to quicksands in it  the prospective arrival of mr brents french motor car which was looked for daily had indeed been one of the chief topics of conversation at quicksands that summer he could appear at no lunch or dinner party without being subjected to a shower of questions as to where it was and as many as half a dozen different women among whom was mrs chandosdeclared that he had promised to bring them out from new york on the occasion of its triumphal entry into the colony honora needless to say had betrayed no curiosity  neither mr shorter nor mr cuthbert had appeared at the real estate office when at a little after nine oclock honora asked for the keys and an office boy perched on the box seat of the carriage drove with them to the house and opened the wroughtiron gate that guarded the entrance and the massive front door honora had a sense of unreality as they entered and told herself it was obviously ridiculous that she should aspire to such a dwelling yesterday under the spell of that somewhat adventurous excursion with mr cuthbert she had pictured herself as installed he had contrived somehow to give her a sense of intimacy with the people who lived thereabouthis own friends  perhaps it was her husband who was the disillusionizing note as he stood on the polished floor of the sunflooded drawingroom although bare of furniture it was eloquent to honora of a kind of taste not to be found at quicksands it carried her back by undiscernible channels of thought to the impression which in her childhood the hanbury mansion had always made howard in her present whimsical fancy even seemed a little grotesque in such a setting his inevitable pink shirt and obviously prosperous clothes made discord there and she knew in this moment that he was appraising the house from a commercial standpoint his comment confirmed her guess  if i were starting out to blow myself or you honora he said poking with his stick a marmouset of the carved stone mantel id get a little more for my money while i was about it  honora did not reply she looked out of the window instead  see here old man said trixton brent im not a real estate dealer or an architect but if i were in your place id take that carriage and hustle over to jerry shorters as fast as i could and sign the lease  howard looked at him in some surprise as one who had learned that trixton brents opinions were usually worth listening to characteristically he did not like to display his ignorance  i know what you mean brent he replied and there may be something to the argument it gives an idea of conservativeness and prosperity  youve made a bullseye said trixton brent succinctly  butbut im not ready to begin on this scale objected howard  why cried brent with evident zestfor he was a man who enjoyed sport in all its forms even to baiting the husbands of his friendswhen i first set eyes on you old fellow i thought you knew a thing or two and youve made a few turns since that confirmed the opinion but im beginning to perceive that you have limitations i could sit down here now if there were any place to sit and calculate how much living in this house would be worth to me in wall street  honora who had been listening uneasily knew that a shrewder or more disturbing argument could not have been used on her husband and it came from trixton brentto howard at leastex cathedra she was filled with a sense of shame which was due not solely to the fact that she was a little consciencestricken because of her innocent complicity nor that her husband did not resent an obvious attempt of a highhanded man to browbeat him but also to the feeling that the character of the discussion had in some strange way degraded the house itself why was it that everything she touched seemed to become contaminated  theres no use staying any longer she said howard doesnt like it  i didnt say so he interrupted theres something about the place that grows on you if i felt i could afford it  at any rate declared honora trying to control her voice ive decided now ive seen it a second time that i dont want it i only wished him to look at it she added scornfully aware that she was taking up the cudgels in his behalf but she could not bring herself in brents presence to declare that the argument of the rent seemed decisive  her exasperation was somewhat increased by the expression on trixton brents face which plainly declared that he deemed her last remarks to be the quintessence of tactics and he obstinately refused as they went down the stairs to the street to regard the matter as closed  ill take him down town in the elevated he said as he put her into the carriage the first rounds a draw  she directed the driver to the ferry again and went back to quicksands several times during the day she was on the point of telephoning brent not to try to persuade howard to rent the house and once she even got so far as to take down the receiver but when she reflected it seemed an impossible thing to do at four oclock she herself was called to the telephone by mr cray a confidential clerk in howards office who informed her that her husband had been obliged to leave town suddenly on business and would not be home that night  didnt he say where he was going asked honora  he didnt even tell me mrs spence cray replied and mr dallam doesnt know  oh dear said honora i hope he realizes that people are coming for dinner tomorrow evening  im positive from what he said that hell be back some time tomorrow cray reassured her  she refused an invitation to dine out and retired shortly after her own dinner with a novel so distracting that she gradually regained an equable frame of mind the uneasiness the vague fear of the future wore away and she slept peacefully in the morning however she found on her breakfast tray a note from trixton brent  her first feeling after reading it was one of relief that he had not mentioned the house he had written from a new york club asking her to lunch with him at delmonicos that day and drive home in the motor no answer was required if she did not appear at one oclock he would know she couldnt come  honora took the eleven oclock train which gave her an hour after she arrived in new york to do as she pleased her first idea as she stood for a moment amidst the clamour of the traffic in front of the ferry house was to call on mrs holt at that ladys hotel and then she remembered that the charities conference began at eleven and decided to pay a visit to madame dumond who made a specialty of importing novelties in dress her costume for the prospective excursion in the automobile had cost honora some thought that morning as the day was cool she had brought along an ulster that was irreproachable but how about the hat and veil  madame dumond was enchanted she had them bothshe had landed with them only last week she tried them on honora and stood back with her hands clasped in an ecstasy she did not attempt to hide what a satisfaction to sell things to mrs spence some ladies she could mention would look like frights in them but madame spence had de la race she could wear anything that was chic the hat and veil said madame with a simper were sixty dollars  sixty dollars exclaimed honora  ah madame what would you novelties were novelties the united states custom authorities robbers  having attended to these important details honora drove to the restaurant in her hansom cab the blood coursing pleasantly in her veins the autumn air sparkled and new york was showing signs of animation she glanced furtively into the little mirror at the side her veil was grey and with the hat gave her somewhat the air of a religieuse an aspect heightened by the perfect oval of her face and something akin to a religious thrill ran through her  the automobile with its brass and varnish shining in the sunlight was waiting a little way up the street and the first person honora met in the vestibule of delmonicos was lula chandos she was as usual elaborately dressed and gave one the impression of being lost so anxiously was she scanning the face of every new arrival  oh my dear she cried staring hard at the hat and the veil have you seen clara trowbridge anywhere  a certain pity possessed honora as she shook her head  she was in town this morning continued mrs chandos and i was sure she was coming here to lunch trixy just drove up a moment ago in his new car did you see it  honoras pity turned into a definite contempt  i saw an automobile as i came in she said but the brevity of her reply seemed to have no effect upon mrs chandos  there he is now at the entrance to the cafe she exclaimed  there indeed was trixton brent staring at them from the end of the hall and making no attempt to approach them  i think ill go into the dressingroom and leave my coat said honora outwardly calm but inwardly desperate fortunately lula made no attempt to follow her  youre a dream in that veil my dear mrs chandos called after her dont forget that were all dining with you tonight in quicksands  once in the dressingroom honora felt like locking the doors and jumping out of the window she gave her coat to the maid rearranged her hair without any apparent reason and was leisurely putting on her hat again and wondering what she would do next when mrs kame appeared  trixy asked me to get you she explained mr grainger and i are going to lunch with you  how nice said honora with such a distinct emphasis of relief that mrs kame looked at her queerly  what a fool trixy was with all his experience to get mixed up with that chandos woman that lady remarked as they passed through the hallway shes like molassesone can never get her off lucky thing he found cecil and me here theres your persistent friend trixy she added when they were seated really this is pathetic when an invitation to lunch and a drive in your car would have made her so happy  honora looked around and beheld indeed mrs chandos and two other quicksands women mrs randall and mrs barclay at a table in the corner of the room  wheres bessie today cecilor do you know demanded mrs kame after an amused glance at brent who had not deigned to answer her i promised to go to newport with her at the end of the week but i havent been able to find her  cecil doesnt know said trixton brent the police have been looking for him for a fortnight where the deuce have you been cecil  to the adirondacks replied mr grainger gravely  this explanation which seemed entirely plausible to honora appeared to afford great amusement to brent and even to mrs kame  when did you come to life demanded brent  yesterday said mr grainger quite as solemnly as before  mrs kame glanced curiously at honora and laughed again  you ought to be ashamed of yourself trixy she said  why he asked innocently theres nothing wrong in going to the adirondacksis there cecil  no said mr grainger blinking rapidly  the adirondacks declared mrs kame have now become classic  by the way observed mr grainger i believe bessies in town today at a charity powwow reading a paper ive half a mind to go over and listen to it the white dove of peaceand all that kind of thing  youd go to sleep and spoil it all said brent  but you cant cecil cried mrs kame dont you remember were going to westchester to the faunces to spend the night and play bridge and we promised to arrive early  thats so by george said mr grainger and he drank the rest of his whiskeyandsoda  ill tell you what ill do if mrs spence is willing suggested brent if you start right after lunch ill take you out well have plenty of time he added to honora to get back to quicksands for dinner  are you sure she asked anxiously i have people for dinner tonight  oh lots of time declared mrs kame trixys car is some unheardof horsepower its only twentyfive miles to the faunces and youll be back at the ferry by halfpast four  easily said trixton brent     chapter x on the art of lion taming  after lunch while mrs kame was telephoning to her maid and mr grainger to mrs faunce honora found herself alone with trixton brent in the automobile at a moment when the quicksands party were taking a cab mrs chandos parsed long enough to wave her hand  bon voyage she cried what an ideal party and the chauffeur doesnt understand english if you dont turn up this evening honora ill entertain your guests  we must get back said honora involuntarily to brent it would be too dreadful if we didnt  are you afraid ill run off with you he asked  i believe youre perfectly capable of it she replied if i were wise id take the train  why dont you he demanded  she smiled  i dont know its because of your deteriorating influence i suppose and yet i trust you in spite of my instincts andmy eyes im seriously put out with you  why  ill tell you later if youre at a loss she said as mrs kame and mr grainger appeared  eight years have elapsed since that day and this writingan aeon in this rapidly moving republic of ours the roads although far from perfect yet were not then what they have since become but the weather was dry and the voyage to westchester accomplished successfully it was halfpast three when they drove up the avenue and deposited mrs kame and cecil grainger at the long front of the faunce house and brent who had been driving relinquished the wheel to the chauffeur and joined honora in the tonneau the day was perfect the woods still heavy with summer foliage and the only signs of autumn were the hay mounds and the yellowing cornstalks stacked amidst the stubble of the fields  brent sat silently watching her for she had raised her veil in saying goodby to mrs kame andas the chauffeur was proceeding slowlyhad not lowered it suddenly she turned and looked him full in the face  what kind of woman do you think i am she demanded  thats rather a big order isnt it he said  im perfectly serious continued honora slowly  id really like to know  before i begin on the somewhat lengthy list of your qualities he replied smiling may i ask why youd like to know  yes she said quickly id like to know because i think youve misjudged me i was really more angry than you have any idea of at the manner in which you talked to howard and did you seriously suppose that i was in earnest when we spoke about your assistance in persuading him to take the house  he laughed  you are either the cleverest woman in the world he declared or else you oughtnt to be out without a guardian and no judge in possession of his five senses would appoint your husband  indignant as she was she could not resist smiling there was something in the way brent made such remarks that fascinated her  i shouldnt call you precisely eligible either she retorted  he laughed again but his eyes made her vaguely uneasy  are these harsh words the reward for my charity he asked  im by no means sure its charity she said thats what is troubling me and you have no right to say such things about my husband  how was i to know you were sensitive on the subject he replied  i wonder what it would be like to be so utterly cynical as you she said  do you mean to say you dont want the house  i dont want it under those conditions she answered with spirit i didnt expect to be taken literally and youve always insisted she added in ascribing to me motives thatthat never occurred to me you make the mistake of thinking that because you have no ideals other people havent i hope howard hasnt said hed take the house hes gone off somewhere and i havent been able to see him  trixton brent looked at her queerly  after that last manoeuvre of yours he said it was all i could do to prevent him from rushing over to jerry shortersand signing the lease  she did not reply  what do these sudden virtuous resolutions mean he asked resignation quicksands for life abandonment of the whole campaign  there isnt any i campaign she saidand her voice caught in something like a sob im not that sordid kind of a person and if i dont like quicksands its because the whole atmosphere seems to be charged withwith just such a spirit  her hand was lying on the seat he covered it with his own so quickly that she left it there for a moment as though paralyzed while she listened to the first serious words he had ever addressed to her  honora i admire you more than any woman i have ever known he said  her breath came quickly and she drew her hand away  i suppose i ought to feel complimented she replied  at this crucial instant what had been a gliding flight of the automobile became suddenly a more or less uneven and jerky progress accompanied by violent explosions at the first of these honora in alarm leaped to her feet and the machine after what seemed an heroic attempt to continue came to a dead stop they were on the outskirts of a village children coming home from school surrounded them in a ring brent jumped out the chauffeur opened the hood and they peered together into what was to honora an inexplicable tangle of machinery there followed a colloquy in technical french between the master and the man  whats the matter asked honora anxiously  nothing much said brent sparkplugs well fix it up in a few minutes he looked with some annoyance at the gathering crowd stand back a little cant you he cried and give us room  after some minutes spent in wiping greasy pieces of steel which the chauffeur extracted and subsequent ceaseless grinding on the crank the engine started again not without a series of protesting cracks like pistol shots the chauffeur and brent leaped in the bystanders parted with derisive cheers and away they went through the village only to announce by another series of explosions a second disaster at the other end of the street a crowd collected there too  oh dear said honora dont you think we ought to take the train mr brent if i were to miss a dinner at my own house it would be too terrible  theres nothing to worry about he assured her nothing broken its only the igniting system that needs adjustment  although this was so much greek to honora she was reassured trixton brent inspired confidence there was another argument with the chauffeur a little more animated than the first more greasy plugs taken out and wiped and a sharper exchange of compliments with the crowd more grinding until the chauffeurs face was steeped in perspiration and more pistol shots they were off again but lamely spurting a little at times and again slowing down to the pace of an oxcart their progress became a series of illustrations of the fable of the hare and the tortoise they passed horses and the horses shied into the ditch then the same horses passed them usually at the periods chosen by the demon under the hood to fire its pistol shots and into the ditch went the horses once more their owners expressing their thoughts in language at once vivid and unrestrained  it is one of the blessed compensations of life that in times of prosperity we do not remember our miseries in these enlightened days when everybody owns an automobile and calmly travels from chicago to boston if he chooses we have forgotten the dark ages when these machines were possessed by devils when it took sometimes as much as three hours to go twenty miles and often longer than that how many of us have had the same experience as honora  she was always going to take the train and didnt whenever her mind was irrevocably made up the automobile whirled away on all four cylinders for a half a mile or so until they were out of reach of the railroad there were trolley cars to be sure but those took forever to get anywhere four oclock struck five and six when at last the fiend who had conspired with fate having accomplished his evident purpose of compelling honora to miss her dinner finally abandoned them as suddenly and mysteriously as he had come and the automobile was a lamb once more it was halfpast six and the sun had set before they saw the lights twinkling all yellow on the heights of fort george at that hour the last train they could have taken to reach the dinnerparty in time was leaving the new york side of the ferry  what will they think cried honora they saw us leave delmonicos at two oclock and they didnt know we were going to westchester  it needed no very vivid imagination to summon up the probable remarks of mrs chandos on the affair it was all very well to say the motor broke down but unfortunately trixton brents reputation was not much better than that of his car  trixton brent as might have been expected was inclined to treat the matter as a joke  theres nothing very formal about a quicksands dinnerparty he said well have a cosey little dinner in town and call em up on the telephone  she herself was surprised at the spirit of recklessness stealing over her for there was after all a certain appealing glamour in the adventure she was thrilled by the swift gliding motion of the automobile the weird and unfamiliar character of these upper reaches of a great city in the twilight where new houses stood alone or in rows on wide levelled tracts and old houses once in the country were seen high above the roadway behind crumbling fences surrounded by gloomy old trees with rotting branches she stole a glance at the man close beside her a delightful fear of him made her shiver and she shrank closer into the corner of the seat  honora  all at once he had seized her hand again and held it in spite of her efforts to release it  honora he said i love you as i have never loved in my life as i never shall love again  ohyou mustnt say that she cried  why not he demanded why not if i feel it  because faltered honora because i cant listen to you  brent made a motion of disdain with his free hand  i dont pretend that its right he said im not a hypocrite anyway thank god its undoubtedly wrong according to all moral codes ive never paid any attention to them youre married im happy to say im divorced youve got a husband i wont be guilty of the bad taste of discussing him hes a good fellow enough but he never thinks about you from the time the exchange opens in the morning until he gets home at night and wants his dinner you dont love himit would be a miracle if a woman with any spirit did he hasnt any more of an idea of what he possesses by legal right than the man i discovered driving in a cart one of the best hunters i ever had in my stables to say that he doesnt appreciate you is a ludicrous understatement any woman would have done for him  please dont she implored him please dont  but for the moment she knew that she was powerless carried along like a chip on the crest of his passion  i dont pretend to say how it is or why it is he went on paying no heed to her protests i suppose theres one woman for every man in the worldthough i didnt use to think so i always had another idea of woman before i met you ive thought i was in love with em but now i understand it was onlysomething else i say i dont know what it is in you that makes me feel differently i cant analyze it and i dont want to youre not perfect by a good deal and god knows im not youre ambitious but if you werent youd be humdrumyet theres no pitiful artifice in you as in other women that any idiot can see through and it would have paralyzed forever any ordinary woman to have married howard spence  a new method of wooing surely and evidently peculiar to trixton brent honora in the prey of emotions which he had aroused in spite of her needless to say did not at that moment perceive the humour in it his words gave her food for thought for many months afterwards  the lion was indeed aroused at last and whip or goad or wile of no avail there came a time when she no longer knew what he was saying when speech though eloquent and forceful seemed a useless medium her appeals were lost and she found herself fighting in his arms when suddenly they turned into one of the crowded arteries of harlem she made a supreme effort of will and he released her  oh she cried trembling  but he looked at her unrepentant with the light of triumph in his eyes  ill never forgive you she exclaimed breathless  i gloried in it he replied i shall remember it as long as i live and ill do it again  she did not answer him she dropped her veil and for a long space was silent while they rapidly threaded the traffic and at length turned into upper fifth avenue skirting the park she did not so much as glance at him but he seemed content to watch her veiled profile in the dusk  her breath in the first tumult of her thought came and went deeply but gradually as the street lights burned brighter and familiar sights began to appear she grew more controlled and became capable of reflection she remembered that there was a train for quicksands at sevenfifteen which howard had taken once or twice but she felt that the interval was too short in that brief period she could not calm herself sufficiently to face her guests indeed the notion of appearing alone or with brent at that dinnerparty appalled her and suddenly an idea presented itself  brent leaned over and began to direct the chauffeur to a wellknown hotel she interrupted him  no she said id rather go to the holland house  very well he said amicably not a little surprised at this unlookedfor acquiescence and then told his man to keep straight on down the avenue  she began mechanically to rearrange her hat and veil and after that sitting upright to watch the cross streets with feverish anticipation her hands in her lap  honora he said  she did not answer  raise the veil just for a moment and look at me  she shook her head but for some reason best known to herself she smiled a little perhaps it was because her indignation which would have frightened many men into repentance left this one undismayed at any rate he caught the gleam of the smile through the film of her veil and laughed  well have a little table in the corner of the room he declared and you shall order the dinner here we are he cried to the chauffeur pull up to the right  they alighted crossed the sidewalk the doors were flung open to receive them and they entered the hotel  through the entrance to the restaurant honora caught sight of the red glow of candles upon the white tables and heard the hum of voices in the hall people were talking and laughing in groups and it came as a distinct surprise to her that their arrival seemed to occasion no remark at the moment of getting out of the automobile her courage had almost failed her  trixton brent hailed one of the hotel servants  show mrs spence to the ladies parlour said he and added to honora ill get a table and have the dinner card brought up in a few moments  honora stopped the boy at the elevator door  go to the office she said and find out if mrs joshua holt is in and the number of her room and take me to the telephone booths ill wait there  she asked the telephone operator to call up mr spences house at quicksandsand waited  im sorry madam he said after a little while which seemed like half an hour to honora but theyve had a fire in the kingston exchange and the quicksands line is out of order  honoras heart sank but the bellboy had reappeared yes mrs holt was in  take me to her room she said and followed him into the elevator  in response to his knock the door was opened by mrs holt herself she wore a dovecoloured gown and in her hand was a copy of the report of the board of missions for a moment she peered at honora over the glasses lightly poised on the uncertain rim of her nose  whymy dear she exclaimed in astonishment honora  oh cried honora im so glad youre here i was so afraid youd be out  in the embrace that followed both the glasses and the mission report fell to the floor honora picked them up  sit down my dear and tell me how you happen to be here said mrs holt i suppose howard is downstairs  no he isnt said honora rather breathlessly thats the reason i came here thats one reason i mean i was coming to see you this morning but i simply didnt have time for a call after i got to town  mrs holt settled herself in the middle of the sofa the only piece of furniture in the room in harmony with her ample proportions her attitude and posture were both judicial and justice itself spoke in her delftblue eyes  tell me all about it she said thus revealing her suspicions that there was something to tell  i was just going to said honora hastily thinking of trixton brent waiting in the ladies parlour i took lunch at delmomicos with mr grainger and mr brent and mrs kame  cecil grainger demanded mrs holt  honora trembled  yes she said  i knew his father and mother intimately said mrs holt unexpectedly and his wife is a friend of mine shes one of the most executive women we have in the working girls association and she read a paper today that was masterful you know her of course  no said honora i havent met her yet  then how did you happen to be lunching with her husband  i wasnt lunching with him mrs holt said honora mr brent was giving the lunch  whos mr brent demanded mrs holt one of those quicksands people  hes not exactly a quicksands person i scarcely know how to describe him hes very rich and goes abroad a great deal and plays polo thats the reason he has a little place at quicksands hes been awfully kind both to howard and me she added with inspiration  and mrs kame said mrs holt  shes a widow and has a place at banbury  i never heard of her said mrs holt and honora thanked her stars  and howard approves of these mixed lunches my dear when i was young husbands and wives usually went to parties together  a panicky thought came to honora that mrs holt might suddenly inquire as to the whereabouts of mr brents wife  oh howard doesnt mind she said hastily i suppose times have changed mrs holt and after lunch we all went out in mr brents automobile to the faunces in westchester  the paul jones faunces mrs holt interrupted  what a nice woman that young mrs faunce is she was kitty esterbrook you know both of them very old families  it was only continued honora in desperation it was only to leave mr grainger and mrs kame there to spend the night they all said we had plenty of time to go and get back to quicksands by six oclock but coming back the automobile broke down  of course said mrs holt it serves any one right for trusting to them i think they are an invention of the devil  and weve only just got back to new york this minute  who inquired mrs holt  mr brent and i said honora with downcast eyes  good gracious exclaimed the elder lady  i couldnt think of anything else to do but come straight here to you said honora gazing at her friend and oh im so glad to find you theres not another train to quicksands till after nine  you did quite right my dear under the circumstances i dont say you havent been foolish but its howards fault quite as much as yours he has no business to let you do such things  and what makes it worse said honora is that the wires are down to quicksands and i cant telephone howard and we have people to dinner and they dont know i went to westchester and theres no use telegraphing it wouldnt be delivered till midnight or morning  there there my dear dont worry i know how anxious you feel on your husbands account  ohmrs holt i was going to ask you a great great favour wouldnt you go down to quicksands with me and spend the nightand pay us a little visit you know we would so love to have you  of course ill go down with you my dear said mrs holt im surprised that you should think for an instant that i wouldnt its my obvious duty martha she called martha  the door of the bedroom opened and mrs holts elderly maid appeared the same maid by the way who had closed the shutters that memorable stormy night at silverdale she had it seemed a trick of appearing at crises  martha telephone to mrs edgerlyyou know her numberand say that i am very sorry but an unexpected duty calls me out of town tonight and ask her to communicate with the reverend mr field as for staying with you honora she continued i have to be back at silverdale tomorrow night perhaps you and howard will come back with me my frank opinion is that a rest from the gayety of quicksands will do you good  i will come with pleasure said honora but as for howardim afraid hes too busy  and how about dinner asked mrs holt  i forgot to say said honora that mr brents downstairs he brought me here of course have you any objection to his dining with us  no answered mrs holt i think i should like to see him  after mrs holt had given instructions to her maid to pack and honora had brushed some of the dust of the roads from her costume they descended to the ladies parlour at the far end of it a waiter holding a card was standing respectfully and trixton brent was pacing up and down between the windows when he caught sight of them he stopped in his tracks and stared and stood as if rooted to the carpet honora came forward  oh mr brent she cried my old friend mrs holt is here and shes going to take dinner with us and come down to quicksands for the night may i introduce mr brent  wasnt it fortunate mr brent that mrs spence happened to find me said mrs holt as she took his hand i know it is a relief to you  it was not often indeed that trixton brent was taken off his guard but some allowance must be made for him since he was facing a situation unparalleled in his previous experience virtue had not often been so triumphant and never so dramatic as to produce at the critical instant so emblematic a defender as this matronly lady in dove colour for a moment he stared at her speechless and then he gathered himself together  a relief he asked  it would seem so to me said mrs holt not that i do not think you are perfectly capable of taking care of her as an intimate friend of her husband i was merely thinking of the proprieties and as i am a guest in this hotel i expect you both to do me the honour to dine with me before we start for quicksands  after all trixton brent had a sense of humour although it must not be expected that he should grasp at once all the elements of a joke on himself so colossal  i for one he said with a slight bow which gave to his words a touch somewhat elaborate will be delighted and he shot at honora a glance compounded of many feelings which she returned smilingly  is that the waiter asked mrs holt  that is a waiter said trixton brent glancing at the motionless figure shall i call him  if you please said mrs holt honora you must tell me what you like  anything mrs holt said honora  if we are to leave a little after nine said that lady balancing her glasses on her nose and glancing at the card we have not im afraid time for many courses  the head waiter greeted them at the door of the diningroom he too was a man of wisdom and experience he knew mrs holt and he knew trixton brent if gravity had not been a lifelong habit with him one might have suspected him of a desire to laugh as it was he seemed palpably embarrassedfor mr brent had evidently been conversing with him  two sir he asked  three said mrs holt with dignity  the head waiter planted them conspicuously in the centre of the room one of the strangest parties from the point of view of a connoisseur of new york that ever sat down together mrs holt with her curls and her glasses laid flat on the bosom of her dovecoloured dress honora in a costume dedicated to the very latest of the sports and trixton brent in english tweeds the diningroom was full but here and there amongst the diners honora observed were elderly people who smiled discreetly as they glanced in their directionfriends perhaps of mrs holt and suddenly in one corner she perceived a table of six where the mirth was less restrained  fortunately for mr brent he had had a cocktail or perhaps two in honoras absence sufficient time had elapsed since their administration for their proper soothing and exhilarating effects at the sound of the laughter in the corner he turned his head a signal for renewed merriment from that quarter whereupon he turned back again and faced his hostess once more with a heroism that compelled honoras admiration as a sportsman he had no intention of shirking the bitterness of defeat  mrs grainger and mrs shorter he remarked appear to be enjoying themselves  honora felt her face grow hot as the merriment at the corner table rose to a height it had not heretofore attained and she did not dare to look again  mrs holt was blissfully oblivious to her surroundings she was as usual extremely composed and improved the interval while drinking her soup with a more or less undisguised observation of mr brent evidently regarding him somewhat in the manner that a suspicious householder would look upon a strange gentleman whom he accidentally found in his front hall explanations were necessary that mr brents appearance on the whole was in his favour did not serve to mitigate her suspicions goodlooking men were apt to be unscrupulous  are you interested in working girls mr brent she inquired presently  honora in spite of her discomfort had an insane desire to giggle she did not dare to raise her eyes  i cant say that ive had much experience with them mrs holt he replied with a gravity little short of sublime  naturally you wouldnt have had said mrs holt what i meant was are you interested in the problems they have to face  extremely said he so unexpectedly that honora choked i cant say that ive given as many hours as i should have liked to a study of the subject but i dont know of any class that has a harder time as a rule theyre underpaid and overworked and when night comes they are either tired to death or bored to death and the goodlooking ones are subject to temptations which some of them find impossible to resist in a natural desire for some excitement to vary the routine of their lives  it seems to me said mrs holt that you are fairly conversant with the subject i dont think i ever heard the problem stated so succinctly and so well perhaps she added it might interest you to attend one of our meetings next month indeed you might be willing to say a few words  im afraid youll have to excuse me mrs holt im a rather busy man and nothing of a public speaker and it is rarely i get off in the daytime  how about automobiling asked mrs holt with a smile  well said trixton brent laughing in spite of himself i like the working girls i have to have a little excitement occasionally and i find it easier to get off in the summer than in the winter  men cover a multitude of sins under the plea of business said mrs holt shaking her head i cant say i think much of your method of distraction why any one desires to get into an automobile i dont see  have you ever been in one he asked mine is here and i was about to invite you to go down to the ferry in it ill promise to go slow  well said mrs holt i dont object to going that distance if you keep your promise ill admit that ive always had a curiosity  and in return said brent gallantly allow me to send you a cheque for your working girls  youre very good said mrs holt  oh he protested im not in the habit of giving much to charities im sorry to say id like to know how it feels  then i hope the sensation will induce you to try it again said mrs holt  nobody mrs holt cried honora could be kinder to his friends than mr brent  we were speaking of disinterested kindness my dear was mrs holts reply  youre quite right mrs holt said trixton brent beginning as the dinner progressed to take in the lady opposite a delight that surprised him im willing to confess that ive led an extremely selfish existence  the confession isnt necessary she replied its written all over you youre the type of successful man who gets what he wants i dont mean to say that you are incapable of kindly instincts and her eye twinkled a little  im very grateful for that concession at any rate he declared  there might be some hope for you if you fell into the hands of a good woman said mrs holt i take it you are a bachelor mark my words the longer you remain one the more steeped in selfishness you are likely to become in this modern and complex and sensesatisfying life which so many people lead  honora trembled for what he might say to this remembering his bitter references of that afternoon to his own matrimonial experience visions of a scene arose before her in the event that mrs holt should discover his status but evidently trixton brent had no intention of discussing his marriage  judging by some of my married friends and acquaintances he said i have no desire to try matrimony as a remedy for unselfishness  then replied mrs holt all i can say is i should make new friends amongst another kind of people if i were you you are quite right and if i were seeking examples of happy marriages i should not begin my search among the socalled fashionable set of the present day they are so supremely selfish that if the least difference in taste develops or if another man or woman chances along whom they momentarily fancy more than their own husbands or wives they get a divorce their idea of marriage is not a mutual sacrifice which brings happiness through trials borne together and through the making of character no they have a notion that man and wife may continue to lead their individual lives that isnt marriage ive lived with joshua holt thirtyfive years last april and i havent pleased myself in all that time  all men said trixton brent are not so fortunate as mr holt  honora began to have the sensations of a witness to a debate between mephistopheles and the powers of heaven her head swam but mrs holt who had unlookedfor flashes of humour laughed and shook her curls at brent  i should like to lecture you some time she said i think it would do you good  he shook his head  im beyond redemption dont you think so honora he asked with an unexpected return of his audacity  im afraid im not worthy to judge you she replied and coloured  stuff and nonsense said mrs holt women are superior to men and its our duty to keep them in order and if were really going to risk our lives in your automobile mr brent youd better make sure its there she added glancing at her watch  having dined together in an apparent and inexplicable amity their exit was of even more interest to the table in the corner than their entrance had been mrs holts elderly maid was waiting in the hall mrs holts little trunk was strapped on the rear of the car and the lady herself with something of the feelings of a missionary embarking for the wilds of africa was assisted up the little step and through the narrow entrance of the tonneau by the combined efforts of honora and brent an expression of resolution emblematic of a determination to die if necessary in the performance of duty was on her face as the machinery started and her breath was not quite normal when in an incredibly brief period they descended at the ferry  the journey to quicksands was accomplished in a good fellowship which honora an hour before would not have dreamed of even mrs holt was not wholly proof against the charms of trixton brent when he chose to exert himself and for some reason he did so choose as they stood in the starlight on the platform of the deserted little station while he went across to whelens livery stable to get a carriage mrs holt remarked to honora  mr brent is a fascinating man my dear  i am so glad that you appreciate him exclaimed honora  and a most dangerous one continued mrs holt he has probably in his day disturbed the peace of mind of a great many young women not that i havent the highest confidence in you honora but honesty forces me to confess that you are young and pleasureloving and a little heedless and the atmosphere in which you live is not likely to correct those tendencies if you will take my advice you will not see too much of mr trixton brent when your husband is not present  indeed as to the probable effect of this incident on the relations between mr brent and herself honora was wholly in the dark although from her point of view what she had done had been amply justified by the plea of selfdefence it could not be expected that he would accept it in the same spirit the apparent pleasure he had taken in the present situation once his amazement had been overcome profoundly puzzled her  he returned in a few minutes with the carriage and driver and they started off brent sat in front and honora explained to mrs holt the appearance of the various places by daylight and the names of their owners the elderly lady looked with considerable interest at the blazing lights of the club with the same sensations she would no doubt have had if she had been suddenly set down within the moulin rouge shortly afterwards they turned in at the gate of the brackens the light streamed across the porch and driveway and the sound of music floated out of the open windows within the figure of mrs barclay could be seen she was singing vaudeville songs at the piano mrs holts lips were tightly shut as she descended and made her way up the steps  i hope youll come in said honora to trixton brent in a low voice  come in he replied i wouldnt miss it for ten thousand dollars  mrs holt was the first of the three to appear at the door of the drawingroom and mrs barclay caught sight of her and stopped in the middle of a bar with her mouth open some of the guests had left a table in the corner where lula chandos had insisted on playing bridge was covered with scattered cards and some bills a decanter of whiskey two soda bottles and two glasses the blue curling smoke from mrs chandos cigarette mingled with the haze that hung between the ceiling and the floor and that lady was in the act of saying cheerfully to howard who sat oppositetrixys run off with her  suddenly the chill of silence pervaded the room lula chandos whose back was turned to the door looked from mrs barclay to howard who with the other men had risen to his feet  whats the matter she said in a frightened tone and following the eyes of the others turned her head slowly towards the doorway  mrs holt who filled it had been literally incapable of speech close behind her stood honora and trixton whose face was inscrutable  howard said honora summoning all the courage that remained in her heres mrs holt we dined with her and she was good enough to come down for the night im so sorry not to have been here she added to her guests but we went to westchester with mrs kame and mr grainger and the automobile broke down on the way back  mrs holt made no attempt to enter but stared fixedly at the cigarette that mrs chandos still held in her trembling fingers howard crossed the room in the midst of an intense silence  glad to see you mrs holt he said erwont you come in andand sit down  thank you howard she replied i do not wish to interrupt your party it is my usual hour for retiring  and i think my dear she added turning to honora that ill ask you to excuse me and show me to my room  certainly mrs holt said honora breathlessly  howard ring the bell  she led the way up the stairs to the guestchamber with the rose paper and the little balcony as she closed the door gusts of laughter reached them from the floor below and she could plainly distinguish the voices of may barclay and trixton brent  i hope youll be comfortable mrs holt she said your maid will be in the little room across the hall and i believe you like breakfast at eight  you mustnt let me keep you from your guests honora  oh mrs holt she said on the verge of tears i dont want to go to them really i dont  it must be confessed said mrs holt opening her handbag and taking out the copy of the mission report which had been carefully folded that they seem to be able to get along very well without you i suppose i am too old to understand this modern way of living how well i remember one nightit was in 1886i missed the train to silverdale and my telegram miscarried poor mr holt was nearly out of his head  she fumbled for her glasses and dropped them honora picked them up and it was then she perceived that the tears were raining down the good ladys cheeks at the same moment they sprang into honoras eyes and blinded her mrs holt looked at her long and earnestly  go down my dear she said gently you must not neglect your friends they will wonder where you are and at what time do you breakfast  atat any time you like  i shall be down at eight said mrs holt and she kissed her  honora closing the door stood motionless in the hall and presently the footsteps and the laughter and the sound of carriage wheels on the gravel died away     chapter xi containing some revelations  honora as she descended caught a glimpse of the parlour maid picking up the scattered cards on the drawingroom floor there were voices on the porch where howard was saying goodby to mrs chandos and trixton brent she joined them  oh my dear cried mrs chandos interrupting honoras apologies im sure i shant sleep a winkshe gave me such a fright you might have sent trixy ahead to prepare us when i first caught sight of her i thought it was my own dear mother who had come all the way from cleveland and the cigarette burned my fingers but i must say i think it was awfully clever of you to get hold of her and save trixys reputation good night dear  and she got into her carriage  give my love to mrs holt said brent as he took honoras hand and tell her i feel hurt that she neglected to say good night to me i thought i had made an impression tell her ill send her a cheque for her rescue work she inspires me with confidence  howard laughed  ill see you tomorrow brent he called out as they drove away though always assertive it seemed to honora that her husband had an increased air of importance as he turned to her now with his hands in his pockets he looked at her for a moment and laughed again he too had apparently seen the incident only in a humorous light well honora he remarked you have a sort of a p t barnum way of doing things once in a whilehavent you is the old lady really tucked away for the night or is she coming down to read us a sermon and how the deuce did you happen to pick her up  she had come downstairs with confession on her lips and in the agitation of her mind had scarcely heeded brents words or mrs chandos she had come down prepared for any attitude but the one in which she found him for anger reproaches arraignments nay she was surprised to find now that she had actually hoped for these she deserved to be scolded it was her right if he had been all of a man he would have called her to account there must bethere was something lacking in his character and it came to her suddenly with all the shock of a great contrast with what different eyes she had looked upon him five years before at silverdale  he went into the house and started to enter the drawingroom still in disorder and reeking with smoke  no not in there she cried sharply  he turned to her puzzled her breath was coming and going quickly she crossed the hall and turned on the light in the little parlour there and he followed her  dont you feel well he asked  howard she said werent you worried  worried no why should i have been lula chandos and may barclay had seen you in the automobile in town and i knew you were high and dry somewhere  high and dry she repeated  what  nothing they said i had run off with mr brent didnt they  he laughed  yes there was some joking to that effect  you didnt take it seriously  nowhy should i  she was appalled by his lack of knowledge of her all these years she had lived with him and he had not grasped even the elements of her nature and this was marriage trixton brentshort as their acquaintance had beenhad some conception of her character and possibilities her husband none where was she to begin how was she to tell him the episode in the automobile in order that he might perceive something of its sinister significance  where was she to go to be saved from herself if not to him  i might have run away with him if i had loved him she said after a pause would you have cared  you bet your life said howard and put his arm around her  she looked up into his face so intent had she been on what she had meant to tell him that she did not until now perceive he was preoccupied and only half listening to what she was saying  you bet your life he said patting her shoulder what would i have done all alone in the new house  in the new house she cried oh howardyou havent taken it  i havent signed the lease he replied importantly smiling down at her and thrusting his hands in his pockets  i dont want it said honora i dont want it i told you that id decided i didnt want it when we were there oh howard why did you take it  he whistled he had the maddening air of one who derives amusement from the tantrums of a spoiled child  well he remarked women are too many for me if theres any way of pleasing em i havent yet discovered it the night before last you had to have the house nothing else would do it was the greatest find in new york for the first time in months you get up for breakfasta pretty sure sign you hadnt changed your mind you drag me to see it and when you land me there because i dont lose my head immediately you say you dont want it of course i didnt take you seriouslyi thought youd set your heart on it so i wired an offer to shorter today and he accepted it and when i hand you this pleasant little surprise you go right up in the air  he had no air of vexation however as he delivered this somewhat reproachful harangue in the picturesque language to which he commonly resorted quite the contrary he was still smiling as santa claus must smile when he knows he has another pack up the chimney  why this sudden change of mind he demanded it cant be because you want to spend the winter in quicksands  she was indeed at a loss what to say she could not bring herself to ask him whether he had been influenced by trixton brent if he had she told herself she did not wish to know he was her husband after all and it would be too humiliating and then he had taken the house  have you hit on a palace you like better he inquired with a clumsy attempt at banter they tell me the elder maitlands are going abroadperhaps we could get their house on the park  you said you couldnt afford mrs rindges house she answered uneasily and ii believed you  i couldnt he said mysteriously and paused  it seemed to her as she recalled the scene afterwards that in this pause he gave the impression of physically swelling she remembered staring at him with wide frightened eyes and parted lips  i couldnt he repeated with the same strange emphasis and a palpable attempt at complacency butercircumstances have changed since then  what do you mean howard she whispered  the corners of his mouth twitched in the attempt to repress a smile  i mean he said that the president of a trust company can afford to live in a better house than the junior partner of dallam and spence  the president of a trust company honora scarcely recognized her own voiceso distant it sounded the room rocked and she clutched the arm of a chair and sat down he came and stood over her  i thought that would surprise you some he said obviously pleased by these symptoms the fact is i hadnt meant to break it to you until morning but i think ill go in on the seven thirtyfive he glanced significantly up at the ceiling as though mrs holt had something to do with this decision president of the orange trust company at forty isnt so bad eh  the orange trust company did you say the orange trust company  yes he produced a cigarette old james wing and brent practically control it you see if i do say it myself i handled some things pretty well for brent this summer and hes seemed to appreciate it he and wing were buying in traction stocks out west but you could have knocked me down with a paperknife when he came to me  when did he come to you she asked breathlessly  yesterday we went down town together you remember and he asked me to step into his office well we talked it over and i left on the one oclock for newport to see mr wing wonderful old man i sat up with him till midnightit wasnt any picnic  more than once during the night honora awoke with a sense of oppression and each time went painfully through the whole episode from the eveningsome weeks past when trixton brent had first mentioned the subject of the trust company to the occurrence in the automobile and howards triumphant announcement she had but a vague notion of how that scene had finished or of how limply she had got to bed round and round the circle she went in each waking period to have implored him to relinquish the place had been waste of breath and thenher reasons these were the moments when the current was strongest when she grew incandescent with humiliation and pain when stray phrases in red letters of brents were illuminated merit he had a contempt for her husband which he had not taken the trouble to hide but not a business contempt as good as the next man brent had saidor words to that effect as good as the next man then she had tacitly agreed to the bargain and refused to honour the bill no she had not she had not before god she was innocent of that when she reached this point it was always to james wing that she clungthe financier at least had been impartial and it was he who saved her  at length she opened her eyes to discover with bewilderment that the room was flooded with light and then she sprang out of bed and went to the open window to seaward hung an opal mist struck here and there with crimson she listened some one was whistling an air she had heard beforemrs barclay had been singing it last night wheels crunched the gravelhoward was going off she stood motionless until the horses hoofs rang on the highroad and then hurried into her dressinggown and slippers and went downstairs to the telephone and called a number  is this mr brents will you say to mr brent that mrs spence would be greatly obliged if he stopped a moment at her house before going to town thank you  she returned to her room and dressed with feverish haste trying to gather her wits for an ordeal which she felt it would have killed her to delay at ten minutes to eight she emerged again and glanced anxiously at mrs holts door and scarcely had she reached the lower hall before he drove into the circle she was struck more forcibly than ever by the physical freshness of the man and he bestowed on her as he took her hand the peculiar smile she knew so well that always seemed to have an enigma behind it at sight and touch of him the memory of what she had prepared to say vanished  behold me as ever your obedient servant he said as he followed her into the screenedoff portion of the porch  you must think it strange that i sent for you i know she cried as she turned to him but i couldnt wait ii did not know until last night howard only told me then oh you didnt do it for me please say you didnt do it for me  my dear honora replied trixton brent gravely we wanted your husband for his abilities and the valuable services he can render us  she stood looking into his eyes striving to penetrate to the soul behind ignorant or heedless that others before her had tried and failed he met her gaze unflinchingly and smiled  i want the truth she craved  i never lieto a woman he said  my lifemy future depends upon it she went on id rather scrub floors id rather begthan to have it so you must believe me  i do believe you he affirmed and he said it with a gentleness and a sincerity that startled her  thank you she answered simply and speech became very difficult ifif i havent been quite fair with youmr brent i am sorry ii liked you and i like you today better than ever before and i can quite see now how i must have misled you into thinkingqueer things about me i didnt mean to i have learned a lesson  she took a deep involuntary breath the touch of lightness in his reply served to emphasize the hitherto unsuspected fact that sportsmanship in trixton brent was not merely a code but assumed something of the grandeur of a principle  i too have learned a lesson he replied i have learned the difference between nature and art i am something of a connoisseur in art i bow to nature and pay my bets  your bets she asked with a look  my renunciations forfeits whatever you choose to call them i have been fairly and squarely beatenbut by nature not by art that is my consolation  laughter struck into her eyes like a shaft of sunlight into a well her emotions were no longer to be distinguished and in that moment she wondered what would have happened if she had loved this man and why she had not and when next he spoke she started  how is my elderly dovecoloured friend this morning he asked that dinner with her was one of the great events of my life i didnt suppose such people existed any more  perhaps youll stay to breakfast with her suggested honora smiling i know shed like to see you again  no thanks he said taking her hand im on my way to the trainid quite forgotten it au revoir he reached the end of the porch turned and called back as a dea ex machina she has never been equalled  honora stood for a while looking after him until she heard a footstep behind hermrs holts  who was that my dear she asked howard  howard has gone mrs holt honora replied rousing herself i must make his apologies it was mr brent  mr brent the good lady repeated with a slight upward lift of the faint eyebrows does he often call this early  honora coloured a little and laughed  i asked him to breakfast with you but he had to catch a train hewished to be remembered he took such a fancy to you  i am afraid said mrs holt that his fancy is a thing to be avoided are you coming to silverdale with me honora  yes mrs holt she replied slipping her arm through that of her friend for as long as you will let me stay  and she left a note for howard to that effect     book iii   volume 5    chapter i ascendi  honora did not go back to quicksands neither in this modern chronicle shall we  the sphere we have left which we know is sordid sometimes shines in the retrospect and there came a time after the excitement of furnishing the new house was over when our heroine as it were swung for a time in space not for a very long time that month perhaps between autumn and winter  we need not be worried about her though we may pause for a moment or two to sympathize with her in her lonelinessor rather in the moods it produced she even felt in those days slightly akin to the lady of the victoria perfectly respectable whom all of us fortunate enough occasionally to go to new york have seen driving on fifth avenue with an expression of wistful haughtiness and who changes her costumes four times a day  sympathy we have seen honora surrounded by friendswhat has become of them her husband is president of a trust company and she has one of the most desirable houses in new york what more could be wished for to jump at conclusions in this way is by no means to understand a heroine with an ideal she had these things andstrange as it may seemsuffered  her sunny drawingroom with its gathered silk curtains was especially beautiful whatever the leffingwells or allisons may have lacked it was not taste honora sat in it and wondered wondered as she looked back over the road she had threaded somewhat blindly towards the ideal whether she might not somewhere have taken the wrong turn the farther she travelled the more she seemed to penetrate into a land of unrealities the exquisite objects by which she was surrounded and which she had collected with such care had no substance she would not have been greatly surprised at any moment to see them vanish like a scene in a theatre leaning an empty windy stage behind them they did not belong to her nor she to them  past generations of another blood no doubt had been justified in looking upon the hazy landscapes in the great tapestries as their own and childrens children had knelt in times gone by beside the carved stone mantel the big gilded chairs with the silken seats might appropriately have graced the table of the hotel de rambouillet would not the warriors and the wits the patient ladies of high degree and of many children and even the precieuses ridicules themselves turn over in their graves if they could so much as imagine the contents of the single street in modern new york where honora lived  one morning as she sat in that room possessed by these whimsical though painful fancies she picked up a newspaper and glanced through it absently until her eye fell by chance upon a name on the editorial page something like an electric shock ran through her and the letters of the name seemed to quiver and become red slowly they spelledpeter erwin  the argument of mr peter erwin of st louis before the supreme court of the united states in the now celebrated snowden case is universally acknowledged by lawyers to have been masterly and reminiscent of the great names of the profession in the past mr erwin is not dramatic he appears to carry all before him by the sheer force of intellect and by a kind of lincolnian ability to expose a fallacy he is still a young man selfmade and studied law under judge brice of st louis once president of the national bar association whose partner he is  honora cut out the editorial and thrust it in her gown and threw the newspaper is the fire she stood for a time after it had burned watching the twisted remnants fade from flame colour to rose and finally blacken then she went slowly up the stairs and put on her hat and coat and veil although a cloudless day it was windy in the park and cold the ruffled waters an intense blue she walked fast  she lunched with mrs holt who had but just come to town and the light like a speeding guest was departing from the city when she reached her own door  there is a gentleman in the drawingroom madam said the butler he said he was an old friend and a stranger in new york and asked if he might wait  she stood still with presentiment  what is his name she asked  mr erwin said the man  still she hesitated in the strange state in which she found herself that day the supernatural itself had seemed credible and yetshe was not prepared  i beg pardon madam the butler was saying perhaps i shouldnt  yes yes you should she interrupted him and pushed past him up the stairs at the drawingroom door she pausedhe was unaware of her presence and he had not changed she wondered why she had expected him to change even the glow of his newly acquired fame was not discernible behind his wellremembered head he seemed no olderand no younger and he was standing with his hands behind his back gazing in simple silent appreciation at the big tapestry nearest the windows  peter she said in a low voice  he turned quickly and then she saw the glow but it was the old glow not the newthe light in which her early years had been spent  what a coincidence she exclaimed as he took her hand  coincidence  it was only this morning that i was reading in the newspaper all sorts of nice things about you it made me feel like going out and telling everybody you were an old friend of mine still holding his fingers she pushed him away from her at arms length and looked at him what does it feel like to be famous and have editorials about ones self in the new york newspapers  he laughed and released his hands somewhat abruptly  it seems as strange to me honora as it does to you  how unkind of you peter she exclaimed  she felt his eyes upon her and their searching yet kindly and humorous rays seemed to illuminate chambers within her which she would have kept in darkness which she herself did not wish to examine  im so glad to see you she said a little breathlessly flinging her muff and boa on a chair sit there where i can look at you and tell me why you didnt let me know you were coming to new york  he glanced a little comically at the gilt and silk armchair which she designated and then at her and she smiled and coloured divining the humour in his unspoken phrase  for a great man she declared you are absurd  he sat down in spite of his black clothes and the lounging attitude he habitually assumed with his knees crossedhe did not appear incongruous in a seat that would have harmonized with the flowing robes of the renowned french cardinal himself honora wondered why he impressed her today as forcetremendous force in repose and yet he was the same peter why was it had the clipping that even then lay in her bosom effected this magic change he had intimated as much but she denied it fiercely  she rang for tea  you havent told me why you came to new york she said  i was telegraphed for from washington by a mr wing he explained  a mr wing she repeated you dont mean by any chance james wing  the mr wing said peter  the reason i asked explained honora flushing was because howard isassociated with him mr wing is largely interested in the orange trust company  yes i know said peter his elbows were resting on the arms of his chair and he looked at the tips of his fingers which met honora thought it strange that he did not congratulate her but he appeared to be reflecting  what did mr wing want she inquired in her momentary confusion and added hastily i beg your pardon peter i suppose i ought not to ask that  he was kind enough to wish me to live in new york he answered still staring at the tips of his fingers  oh how nice she criedand wondered at the same time whether on second thoughts she would think it so i suppose he wants you to be the counsel for one of his trusts whenwhen do you come  im not coming  not coming why isnt it a great compliment  he ignored the latter part of her remark and it seemed to her when she recalled the conversation afterwards that she had heard a certain note of sadness under the lightness of his reply  to attempt to explain to a new yorker why any one might prefer to live in any other place would be a difficult task  you are incomprehensible peter she declared and yet she felt a relief that surprised her and a desire to get away from the subject dear old st louis somehow in spite of your greatness it seems to fit you  its growing said peterand they laughed together  why didnt you come to lunch she said  lunch i didnt know that any one ever went to lunch in new yorkin this part of it at leastwith less than three weeks notice and by the way if i am interfering with any engagement  my book is not so full as all that of course youll come and stay with us peter  he shook his head regretfully  my train leaves at six from fortysecond street he replied  oh you are niggardly she cried to think how little i see of you peter and sometimes i long for you its strange but i still miss you terriblyafter five years it seems longer than that she added as she poured the boiling water into the teapot but she did not look at him  he got up and walked as far as a watercolour on the wall  you have some beautiful things here honora he said i am glad i have had a glimpse of you surrounded by them to carry back to your aunt and uncle  she glanced about the room as he spoke and then at him he seemed the only reality in it but she did not say so  youll see them soon was what she said and considered the miracle of him staying there where providence had placed him and bringing the world to him whereas she who had gone forth to seek itthe day after tomorrow will be sunday he reminded her  nothing had changed there she closed her eyes and saw the little dining room in all the dignity of sunday dinner the big silver soup tureen catching the sun the flowered china with the gilt edges and even a glimpse of lace paper when the closet door opened aunt mary and uncle tom with peter between them and these strangely were the only tangible things and immutable  youll give thema good account of me she said i know that you do not care for new york she added with a smile but it is possible to be happy here  i am glad you are happy honora and that you have got what you wanted in life although i may be unreasonable and provincial andand western he confessed with a twinklefor he had the characteristic national trait of shading off his most serious remarksi have never gone so far as to declare that happiness was a question of locality  she laughed  nor fame her mind returned to the loadstar  oh fame he exclaimed with a touch of impatience and he used the word that had possessed her all day there is no reality in that men are not loved for it  she set down her cup quickly he was looking at the watercolour  have you been to the metropolitan museum lately he asked  the metropolitan museum she repeated in bewilderment  that would be one of the temptations of new york for me he said i was there for half an hour this afternoon before i presented myself at your door as a suspicious character there is a picture there by coffin called the rain i believe i am very fond of it and looking at it on such a winters day as this brings back the summer the squall coming and the sound of it in the trees and the very smell of the wet meadowgrass in the wind do you know it  no replied honora and she was suddenly filled with shame at the thought that she had never been in the museum i didnt know you were so fond of pictures  i am beginning to be a rival of mr dwyer he declared ive bought fouralthough i havent built my gallery when you come to st louis ill show them to youand let us hope it will be soon  for some time after she had heard the street door close behind him honora remained where she was staring into the fire and then she crossed the room to a reading lamp and turned it up  some one spoke in the doorway  mr grainger madam  before she could rouse herself and recover from her astonishment the gentleman himself appeared blinking as though the vision of her were too bright to be steadily gazed at if the city had been searched it is doubtful whether a more striking contrast to the man who had just left could have been found than cecil grainger in the braided grey cutaway that clung to the semblance of a waist he still possessed in him hyde park and fifth avenue so to speak shook hands across the sea put him in either and he would have appeared indigenous  hope youll forgive my comin round on such slight acquaintance mrs spence said he couldnt resist the opportunity to pay my respects shorter told me where you were  that was very good of mr shorter said honora whose surprise had given place to a very natural resentment since she had not the honour of knowing mrs grainger  oh said mr grainger shorters a good sort said hed been here himself to see how you were fixed and hadnt found you in uncommonly well fixed i should say he added glancing around the room with undisguised approval why the deuce did she furnish it since shes gone to paris to live with rindge  i suppose you mean mrs rindge said honora she didnt furnish it  mr grainger winked at her rapidly like a man suddenly brought face to face with a mystery  oh he replied as though he had solved it the solution came a few moments later its ripping he said farwell couldnt have done it any better  honora laughed and momentarily forgot her resentment  will you have tea she asked oh dont sit down there  why not he asked jumping it was the chair that had held peter and mr grainger examined the seat as though he suspected a bent pin  because said honora because it isnt comfortable pull up that other one  again mystified he did as he was told she remembered his reputation for going to sleep and wondered whether she had been wise in her second choice but it soon became apparent that mr grainger as he gazed at her from among the cushions had no intention of dozing his eyelids reminded her of the shutters of a camera and she had the feeling of sitting for thousands of instantaneous photographs for his benefit she was by turns annoyed amused and distrait peter was leaving his hotel now he was taking the train was he thinking of her he had said he was glad she was happy she caught herself up with a start after one of these silences to realize that mr grainger was making unwonted and indeed pathetic exertions to entertain her and it needed no feminine eye to perceive that he was thoroughly uncomfortable she had unconsciously and in thinking of peter rather overdone the note of rebuke of his visit and honora was above all else an artist his air was distinctly apologetic as he rose perhaps a little mortified like that of a man who has got into the wrong house  i very much fear ive intruded mrs spence he stammered and he was winking now with bewildering rapidity wewe had such a pleasant drive together that day to westchesteri was tempted  we did have a good time she agreed and it has been a pleasure to see you again  thus in the kindness of her heart she assisted him to cover his retreat for it was a strange and somewhat awful experience to see mr cecil grainger discountenanced he glanced again as he went out at the chair in which he had been forbidden to sit  she went to the piano played over a few bars of thais and dropped her hands listlessly cross currents of the strange events of the day flowed through her mind peters arrival and its odd heralding and the discomfort of mr grainger  howard came in he did not see her under the shaded lamp and she sat watching him with a curious feeling of detachment as he unfolded his newspaper and sank with a sigh of content into the cushioned chair which mr grainger had vacated was it fancy that her husbands physical attributes had changed since he had attained his new position of dignity she could have sworn that he had visibly swollen on the evening when he had announced to her his promotion and he seemed to have remained swollen not bloated of course he was fatter andif possible pinker but there was a growing suggestion in him of hummingandhawing greatness if therewere leisure in this tooleisurely chronicle for what might be called aftermath the dinner that honora had given to some of her quicksands friends might be described suffice it to recall with honora that lily dallam with a sure instinct had put the finger of her wit on this new attribute of howards  youll kill me howard she had cried he even looks at the soup as though he were examining a security  needless to say it did not cure him although it sealed lily dallams fateand incidentally that of quicksands honoras thoughts as she sat now at the piano watching him flew back unexpectedly to the summer at silverdale when she had met him and she tried to imagine the genial and boyish representative of finance that he was then in the midst of this effort he looked up and discovered her  what are you doing over there honora he asked  thinking she answered  thats a great way to treat a man when he comes home after a days work  i beg your pardon howard she said with unusual meekness who do you think was here this afternoon  erwin ive just come from mr wings househe has gout today and didnt go down town he offered erwin a hundred thousand a year to come to new york as corporation counsel and if youll believe mehe refused it  ill believe you she said  did he say anything about it to you  he simply mentioned that mr wing asked him to come to new york he didnt say why  well howard remarked hes one too many for me he cant be making over thirty thousand where he is     chapter ii the path of philanthropy  mrs cecil grainger may safely have been called a personality and one of the proofs of this was that she haunted people who had never seen her honora might have looked at her it is true on the memorable night of the dinner with mrs holt and trixton brent butfor sufficiently obvious reasonsrefrained it would be an exaggeration to say that mrs grainger became an obsession with our heroine yet it cannot be denied that since honoras arrival at quicksands this lady had in increasing degrees been the subject of her speculations the threads of mrs graingers influence were so ramified indeed as to be found in mrs dallam who declared she was the rudest woman in new york and yet had copied her brougham in mr cuthbert and trixton brent in mrs kame in mrs holt who proclaimed her a tower of strength in charities and lastly in mr grainger himself who although he did not spend much time in his wifes company had for her an admiration that amounted to awe  elizabeth grainger who was at once modern and tenaciously conservative might have been likened to some of the roman matrons of the aristocracy in the last years of the republic her family the pendletons had traditions so for that matter had the graingers but senator pendleton antique homo virtute et fide had been a roman of the old school who would have preferred exile after the battle of philippi and who could he have foreseen modern new york and modern finance would have been more content to die when he did he had lived in washington square his daughter inherited his executive ability many of his prejudices as they would now be called and his habit of regarding favourable impressions with profound suspicion she had never known the necessity of making friends hers she had inherited and for some reason specially decreed they were better than those of less fortunate people  mrs grainger was very tall and sargent in his portrait of her had caught with admirable art the indefinable yet partly supercilious and scornful smile with which she looked down upon the world about her she possessed the rare gift of combining conventionality with personal distinction in her dress her hair was almost titian red in colour and her face on the authority of mr reginald farwell was at once modern and italian renaissance not the languid amorous renaissance but the lady of decision who chose and did not wait to be chosen her eyes had all the colours of the tapaz and her regard was so baffling as to arouse intense antagonism in those who were not her friends  to honora groping about for a better and a higher life the path of philanthropy had more than once suggested itself and on the day of peters visit to new york when she had lunched with mrs holt she had signified her willingness now that she had come to live in town to join the working girls relief society mrs holt needless to say was overjoyed they were to have a meeting at her house in the near future which honora must not fail to attend it was not however without a feeling of trepidation natural to a stranger that she made her way to that meeting when the afternoon arrived  no sooner was she seated in mrs holts drawingroomfilled with campchairs for the occasionthan she found herself listening breathlessly to a recital of personal experiences by a young woman who worked in a bindery on the east side honoras heart was soft her sympathies as we know easily aroused and after the young woman had told with great simplicity and earnestness of the struggle to support herself and lead an honest and selfrespecting existence it seemed to honora that at last she had opened the book of life at the proper page  afterwards there were questions and a report by miss harber a middleaged lady with glasses who was the secretary honora looked around her the membership of the society judging by those present was surely of a sufficiently heterogeneous character to satisfy even the catholic tastes of her hostess there were elderly ladies some benevolent and some formidable some bedecked and others unadorned there were earnestlooking younger women to whom dress was evidently a secondary consideration and there was a sprinkling of others perfectly gowned several of whom were gathered in an opposite corner honoras eyes as the reading of the report progressed were drawn by a continual and resistless attraction to this group or rather to the face of one of the women in it which seemed to stare out at her like the eat in the tree of an oldfashioned picture puzzle or the lineaments of george washington among a mass of boulders on a cliff once one has discovered it one can see nothing else in vain honora dropped her eyes some strange fascination compelled her to raise them again until they met those of the other woman did their glances meet she could never quite be sure so disconcerting were the lights in that regardlights seemingly of laughter and mockery  some instinct informed honora that the woman was mrs grainger and immediately the scene in the holland house diningroom came back to her never until now had she felt the full horror of its comedy and then as though to fill the cup of humiliation came the thought of cecil graingers call she longed in an agony with which sensitive natures will sympathize for the reading to be over  the last paragraph of the report contained tributes to mrs joshua holt and mrs cecil grainger for the work each had done during the year and amidst enthusiastic handclapping the formal part of the meeting came to an end the servants were entering with tea as honora made her way towards the door where she was stopped by susan holt  my dear honora cried mrs holt who had hurried after her daughter youre not going  honora suddenly found herself without an excuse  i really ought to mrs holt ive had such a good timeand ive been so interested i never realized that such things occurred and ive got one of the reports which i intend to read over again  but my dear protested mrs holt you must meet some of the members of the society bessie  mrs grainger indeedfor honora had been right in her surmisewas standing within earshot of this conversation and honora who knew she was there could not help feeling that she took a rather redoubtable interest in it at mrs holts words she turned  bessie ive found a new recruitone that i can answer for mrs spence whom i spoke to you about  mrs grainger bestowed upon honora her enigmatic smile  oh she declared ive heard of mrs spence from other sources and ive seen her too  honora grew a fiery red there was obviously no answer to such a remark which seemed the quintessence of rudeness but mrs grainger continued to smile and to stare at her with the air of trying to solve a riddle  im coming to see you if i may she said ive been intending to since ive been in town but im always so busy that i dont get time to do the things i want to do  an announcement that fairly took away honoras breath she managed to express her appreciation of mrs graingers intention and presently found herself walking rapidly uptown through swirling snow somewhat dazed by the events of the afternoon and these by the way were not yet finished as she reached her own door a voice vaguely familiar called her name  honora  she turned the slim tall figure of a young woman descended from a carriage and crossed the pavement and in the soft light of the vestibule she recognized ethel wing  im so glad i caught you said that young lady when they entered the drawingroom and she gazed at her school friend the colour glowed in honoras cheeks but health alone could not account for the sparkle in her eyes why you look radiant you are more beautiful than you were at sutcliffe is it marriage  honora laughed happily and they sat down side by side on the lounge behind the tea table  i heard youd married said ethel but i didnt know what had become of you until the other day jim never tells me anything it appears that hes seen something of you but it wasnt from jim that i heard about you first youd never guess who told me you were here  who asked honora curiously  mr erwin  peter erwin  im perfectly shameless proclaimed ethel wing ive lost my heart to him and i dont care who knows it why in the world didnt you marry him  butwhere did you see him honora demanded as soon as she could command herself sufficiently to speak her voice must have sounded odd ethel did not appear to notice that  he lunched with us one day when father had gout didnt he tell you about it he said he was coming to see you that afternoon  yeshe came but he didnt mention being at lunch at your house  im sure that was like him declared her friend and for the first time in her life honora experienced a twinge of that worldold ailmentjealousy how did ethel know what was like him i made father give him up for a little while after lunch and he talked about you the whole time but he was most interesting at the table continued ethel sublimely unconscious of the lack of compliment in the comparison as jim would say he fairly wiped up the ground with father and it isnt an easy thing to do  wiped up the ground with mr wing honora repeated  oh in a delightfully quiet humorous way thats what made it so effective i couldnt understand all of it but i grasped enough to enjoy it hugely fathers so used to bullying people that its become second nature with him ive seen him lay down the law to some of the biggest lawyers in new york and they took it like little lambs he caught a tartar in mr erwin i didnt dare to laugh but i wanted to  what was the discussion about asked honora  im not sure that i can give you a very clear idea of it said ethel generally speaking it was about modern trust methods and what a selfrespecting lawyer would do and what he wouldnt father took the ground that the laws werent logical and that they were different and conflicting anyway in different states he said they impeded the natural development of business and that it was justifiable for the great legal brains of the country to devise means by which these laws could be eluded he didnt quite say that but he meant it and he honestly believes it the manner in which mr erwin refuted it was a revelation to me ive been thinking about it since you see id never heard that side of the argument mr erwin said in the nicest way possible but very firmly that a lawyer who hired himself out to enable one man to take advantage of another prostituted his talents that the brains of the legal profession were out of politics in these days and that it was almost impossible for the men in the legislatures to frame laws that couldnt be evaded by clever and unscrupulous devices he cited ever so many cases  ethels voice became indistinct as though some one had shut a door in front of it honora was trembling on the brink of a discovery holding herself back from it as one who has climbed a fair mountain recoils from the lip of an unsuspected crater at sight of the lazy sulphurous fumes all the years of her marriage ever since she had first heard his name the stature of james wing had been insensibly growing and the vastness of his empire gradually disclosed she had lived in that empire in it his word had stood for authority his genius had been worshipped his decrees had been absolute  she had met him once in howards office when he had greeted her gruffly and the memory of his rugged features and small red eyes like live coals had remained and she saw now the drama that had taken place before ethels eyes the capitalist overbearing tyrannical hearing a few simple truths in his own house from peterher peter and she recalled her husbands account of his talk with james wing peter had refused to sell himself had howard many times during the days that followed she summoned her courage to ask her husband that question and kept silence she did not wish to know  i dont want to seem disloyal to papa ethel was saying he is under great responsibilities to other people to stockholders and he must get things done but oh honora im so tired of money money money and its standards and the things people are willing to do for it ive seen too much  honora looked at her friend and believed her one glance at the girls tired eyesa weariness somehow enhancedin effect by the gold sheen of her hairconfirmed the truth of her words  youve changed ethel since sutcliffe she said  yes ive changed said ethel wing and the weariness was in her voice too ive had too much honora life was all glitter like a christmas tree when i left sutcliffe i had no heart im not at all sure that i have one now ive known all kinds of peopleexcept the right kind and if i were to tell you some of the things that have happened to me in five years you wouldnt believe them money has been at the bottom of it allit ruined my brother and it has ruined me and then the other day i beheld a man whose standards simply take no account of money a man who holds something else higher ii had been groping lately and then i seemed to see clear for the first time in my life but im afraid it comes too late  honora took her friends hand in her own and pressed it  i dont know why im telling you all this said ethel it seems today as though i had always known you and yet we werent particularly intimate at school i suppose im inclined to be oversuspicious heaven knows ive had enough to make me so but i always thought that you were a littleambitious youll forgive my frankness honora i dont think youre at all so now she glanced at honora suddenly perhaps youve changed too she said  honora nodded  i think im changing all the time she replied  after a moments silence ethel wing pursued her own train of thought  curiously enough when hewhen mr erwin spoke of you i seemed to get a very different idea of you than the one i had always had i had to go out of town but i made up my mind id come to see you as soon as i got back and ask you to tell me something about him  what shall i tell you asked honora he is what you think he is and more  tell me something of his early life said ethel wing           there is a famous river in the western part of our country that disappears into a canon the walls of which are some thousands of feet high and the bottom so narrow that the confined waters roar through it at breakneck speed sometimes they disappear entirely under the rock to emerge again below more furiously than ever from the riverbed can be seen far far above a blue ribbon of sky once upon a time not long ago two heroes in the service of the government of the united states whose names should be graven in the immortal rock and whose story read wherever the language is spoken made the journey through this canon and came out alive that journey once started there could be no turning back down and down they were buffeted by the rushing waters over the falls and through the tunnels with time to think only of that which would save them from immediate death until they emerged into the sunlight of the plain below  all of which by way of parallel for our own chronicle hitherto leisurely enough is coming to its canonperhaps even now begins to feel the pressure of the shelving sides and if our heroine be somewhat rudely tossed from one boulder to another if we fail wholly to understand her emotions and her acts we must blame the canon she had indeed little time to think  one evening three weeks or so after the conversation with ethel wing just related honoras husband entered her room as her maid was giving the finishing touches to her toilet  youre not going to wear that dress he exclaimed  why not she asked without turning from the mirror  he lighted a cigarette  i thought youd put on something handsometo go to the graingers and where are your jewels youll find the women there loaded with em  one string of pearls is all i care to wear said honoraa reply with which he was fain to be content until they were in the carriage when she added howard i must ask you as a favour not to talk that way before the servants  what way he demanded  oh she exclaimed if you dont know i suppose it is impossible to explain you wouldnt understand  i understand one thing honora that youre too confoundedly clever for me he declared  honora did not reply for at that moment they drew up at a carpet stretched across the pavement  unlike the mansions of vast and imposing facades that were beginning everywhere to catch the eye on fifth avenue and that followed mostly the continental styles of architecture the house of the cecil graingers had a substantial middle oftheeighties appearance it stood on a corner with a high iron fence protecting the area around it within it gave one an idea of space that the exterior strangely belied and it was furnished not in a french but in what might be called a comfortably english manner it was filled honora saw with handsome and priceless things which did not immediately and aggressively strike the eye but which somehow gave the impression of having always been there what struck her as she sat in the little withdrawing room while the maid removed her overshoes was the note of permanence  some of those who were present at mrs graingers that evening remember her entrance into the drawingroom her gown the colour of a rosetinted cloud set off the exceeding whiteness of her neck and arms and vied with the crimson in her cheeks and the single glistening string of pearls about the slender column of her neck served as a contrast to the shadowy masses of her hair mr reginald farwell who was there afterwards declared that she seemed to have stepped out of the gentle landscape of an old painting she stood indeed hesitating for a moment in the doorway her eyes softly alight in the very pose of expectancy that such a picture suggested  honora herself was almost frightened by a sense of augury of triumph as she went forward to greet her hostess conversation for the moment had stopped cecil grainger with the air of one who had pulled aside the curtain and revealed this vision of beauty and innocence crossed the room to welcome her and mrs grainger herself was not a little surprised she was not a dramatic person and it was not often that her drawingroom was the scene of even a mild sensation no entrance could have been at once so startling and so unexceptionable as honoras  i was sorry not to find you when i called she said i was sorry too replied mrs grainger regarding her with an interest that was undisguised and a little embarrassing im scarcely ever at home except when im with the children do you know these people  im not sure said honora buti must introduce my husband to you  how dye do said mr grainger blinking at her when this ceremony was accomplished im awfully glad to see you mrs spence upon my word  honora could not doubt it but he had little time to express his joy because of the appearance of his wife at honoras elbow with a tall man she had summoned from a corner  before we go to dinner i must introduce my cousin mr chilternhe is to have the pleasure of taking you out she said  his name was in the class of those vaguely familiar vaguely familiar too was his face an extraordinary face honora thought glancing at it as she took his arm although she was struck by something less tangible than the unusual features he might have belonged to any nationality within the limits of the caucasian race his short kinky black hair suggested great virility an effect intensified by a strongly bridged nose sinewy hands and bushy eyebrows but the intangible distinction was in the eyes that looked out from under these brows the glimpse she had of them as he bowed to her gravely might be likened to the hasty reading of a chance page in a forbidden book her attention was arrested her curiosity aroused she was on that evening so to speak exposed for and sensitive to impressions she was on the threshold of the alhambra  hugh has such a faculty complained mr grainger of turning up at the wrong moment  dinner was announced she took chilterns arm and they fell into file behind a lady in yellow with a long train who looked at her rather hard it was mrs freddy maitland her glance shifted to chiltern and it seemed to honora that she started a little  hello hugh she said indifferently looking back over her shoulder have you turned up again  still sticking to the same side of your horse i see he replied ignoring the question i told you youd get lopsided  the deformity if there were any did not seem to trouble her  im going to florida wednesday we want another man think it over  sorry but ive got something else to do he said  the devil and idle hands retorted mrs maitland  honora was sure as she could be that chiltern was angry although he gave no visible sign of this it was as though the current ran from his arm into hers  have you been away she asked  it seems to me as though i had never been anywhere else he answered and he glanced curiously at the guests ranging about the great flowerladen table they sat down  she was a little repelled a little piqued and a little relieved when the man on her other side spoke to her and she recognized mr reginald farwell the architect the table capriciously swung that way she did not feel prepared to talk to mr chiltern and before entering upon her explorations she was in need of a guide she could have found none more charming none more impersonal none more subtly aware of her wants which had once been his than mr farwell with his hair parted with geometrical precision from the back of his collar to his forehead with his silky mustache and eyes of soft hazel lights he was all things to all men and womenwithin reason he was an achievement that civilization had not hitherto produced a combination of the beaux arts and the jockey club and american adaptability he was of those upon whom labour leaves no trace  there were preliminaries mutually satisfactory to see mrs spence was never to forget her but more delicately intimated he remembered to have caught a glimpse of her at the quicksands club and mrs dallam nor her house were not mentioned by either honora could not have been in new york long no it was her first winter and she felt like a stranger would mr farwell tell her who some of these people were nothing charmed mr farwell so much as simplicitywhen it was combined with personal attractions he did not say so but contrived to intimate the former  its always difficult when one first comes to new york he declared but it soon straightens itself out and one is surprised at how few people there are after all well begin on cecils right thats mrs george grenfell  oh yes said honora looking at a tall thin woman of middle age who wore a tiara and whose throat was covered with jewels honora did not imply that mrs grenfells name and most of those that followed were extremely familiar to her  in my opinion shes got the best garden in newport and she did most of it herself next to her with the bald head is freddy maitland next to him is miss godfrey shes a little eccentric but she can afford to bethe godfreys for generations have done so much for the city the man with the beard next her is john laurens the philanthropist that pretty woman whos just as nice as she looks is mrs victor strange she was agatha pendletonmrs graingers cousin and the gentleman with the pink face whom she is entertaining  is my husband said honora smiling i know something about him  mr farwell laughed he admired her aplomb and he did not himself change countenance indeed the incident seemed rather to heighten the confidence between them honora was looking rather critically at howard it was a fact that his face did grow red at this stage of a dinner and she wondered what mrs strange found to talk to him about  and the woman on the other side of him she asked by the way she has a red face too  so she has he replied amusedly that is mrs littleton pryor the greatest living rebuke to the modern woman most of those jewels are inherited but she has accustomed herself by long practice to carry them as well as other burdens she has eight children and shes on every charity list her ancestors were the very roots of manhattan she looks like a holbeindoesnt she  and the extraordinary looking man on my right honora asked ive got to talk to him presently  chiltern he said is it possible you havent heard something about hugh chiltern  is it such lamentable ignorance she asked  that depends upon ones point of view he replied hes always been a sort of awell viking said farwell  honora was struck by the appropriateness of the word  vikingyes he looks it exactly i couldnt think tell me something about him  well he laughed lowering his voice a little here goes for a little rough and ready editing one thing about chiltern thats to be admired is that hes never cared a rap what people think of course in a way he never had to his family own a section of the state where theyve had woollen mills for a hundred years more or less i believe hugh chiltern has sold em or theyve gone into a trust or something but the estate is still there at grenobleone of the most beautiful places ive ever seen the generalthis mans fatherwas a violent dictatorial man there is a story about his taking a battery at gettysburg which is almost incredible but he went back to grenoble after the war and became the typical publicspirited citizen built up the mills which his own pioneer grandfather had founded and all that he married an aunt of mrs graingersone of those delicate gentle women who never dare to call their soul their own  and then prompted honora with interest  its only fair to hugh farwell continued to take his early years into account the general never understood him and his mother died before he went off to school men who were at harvard with him say he has a brilliant mind but he spent most of his time across the charles river breaking things it was probably the energy the general got rid of at gettysburg what hugh really needed was a war and he had too much money he has a curious literary streak im told and wrote a rather remarkable articleive forgotten just where it appeared he raced a yacht for a while in a daredevil fiendish way as one might expect and used to go off on cruises and not be heard of for months at last he got engaged to sally harringtonmrs freddy maitland  honora glanced across the table  exactly said mr farwell that was seven or eight years ago nobody ever knew the reason why she broke itthough it may have been pretty closely guessed he went away and nobodys laid eyes on him until he turned up tonight  honoras innocence was not too great to enable her to read between the lines of this biography which reginald farwell had related with such praiseworthy delicacy it was a biography she well knew that like a score of others had been guarded as jealously as possible within the circle on the borders of which she now found herself mrs grainger with her charities mrs littleton pryor with her good works miss godfrey with her virtueall swallowed it as gracefully as possible noblesse oblige honora had read french and english memoirs and knew that history repeats itself and a biography that is printed in black letter and illuminated in gold is attractive in spite of its contents the contents indeed our heroine had not found uninteresting and she turned now to the subject with a flutter of anticipation  he looked at her intently almost boldly she thought and before she dropped her eyes she had made a discovery the thing stamped upon his face and burning in his eyes was not worldweariness disappointment despair she could not tell what it was yet that it was none of these she knew it was not unrelated to experience but transcended it there was an element of purpose in it of determination almostshe would have believedof hope that mrs maitland nor any other woman was a part of it she became equally sure nothing could have been more commonplace than the conversation which began and yet it held for her between the lines as in the biography the thrill of interest she was a woman and embarked on a voyage of discovery  do you live in new york he asked  yes said honora since this autumn  ive been away a good many years he said in explanation of his question i havent quite got my bearings i cant tell you how queerly this sort of thing affects me  you mean civilization she hazarded  yes and yet ive come back to it  of course she did not ask him why their talk was like the starting of a heavy traina series of jerks and yet both were aware of an irresistible forward traction she had not recovered from her surprise in finding herself already so far in his confidence  and the time will come i suppose when youll long to get away again  no he said ive come back to stay its taken me a long while to learn it but theres only one place for a man and thats his own country  her eyes lighted  theres always so much for a man to do  what would you do he asked curiously  she considered this  if you had asked me that question two years agoeven a year agoi should have given you a different answer its taken me some time to learn it too you see and im not a man i once thought i should have liked to have been a king amongst money changers and own railroad and steamship lines and dominate men by sheer power  he was clearly interested  and now he prompted her  she laughed a little to relieve the tension  wellive found out that there are some men that kind of power cant controlthe best kind and ive found out that that isnt the best kind of power it seems to be a brutal barbarous cunning power now that ive seen it at close range theres another kind that springs from a man himself that speaks through his works and acts that influences first those around him and then his community convincing people of their own folly and that finally spreads in ever widening circles to those whom he cannot see and never will see  she paused breathing deeply a little frightened at her own eloquence something told her that she was not only addressing her own soulshe was speaking to his  im afraid youll think im preaching she apologized  no he said impatiently no  to answer your question then if i were a man of independent means i think i should go into politics and i should put on my first campaign banner the words no compromise  it was a little strange that until nowtonightshe had not definitely formulated these ambitions the idea of the banner with its inscription had come as an inspiration he did not answer but sat regarding her drumming on the cloth with his strong brown fingers  i have learned this much in new york she said carried on by her impetus that men and women are like plants to be useful and to grow properly they must be firmly rooted in their own soil this city seems to me like a luxurious overgrown hothouse of course she added hastily there are many people who belong here and whose best work is done here i was thinking about those whom it attracts and i have seen so many who are only watered and fed and warmed and who becomedistorted  its extraordinary replied chiltern slowly that you should say this to me it is what i have come to believe but i couldnt have said it half so well  mrs grainger gave the signal to rise honora took chilterns arm and he led her back to the drawingroom she was standing alone by the fire when mrs maitland approached her  havent i seen you before she asked     chapter iii vineland  it was a pleasant newport to which honora went early in june a fair city shining in the midst of summer seas a place to light the fires of imagination it wore at once an air of age and of a new and sparkling unreality honora found in the very atmosphere a certain magic which she did not try to define but to the enjoyment of which she abandoned herself and in those first days after her arrival she took a sheer delight in driving about the island narrow thames street crowded with gay carriages with its aspect of the eighteenth and it shops of the twentieth century the whiffs of the sea bellevue avenue with its glorious serried ranks of trees its erring perfumes from bright gardens its massed flowering shrubs beckoning the eye its lawns of a truly enchanted green through tree and hedge as she drove came ever changing glimpses of gleaming palace fronts glimpses that made her turn and look again that stimulated but did not satisfy and left a pleasant longing for something on the seeming verge of fulfilment  the very stillness and solitude that seemed to envelop these palaces suggested the enchanters wand tomorrow perhaps the perfect lawns where the robins hopped amidst the shrubbery would become again the rockbound windswept new england pasture above the sea and screaming gulls circle where now the swallows hovered about the steep blue roof of a french chateau hundreds of years hence would these great pleasure houses still be standing behind their screens and walls and hedges or would indeed the shattered vinecovered marble of a balustrade alone mark the crumbling terraces whence once the fabled owners scanned the sparkling waters of the ocean who could say  the onward rush of our story between its canon walls compels us reluctantly to skip the narrative of the winter conquests of the lady who is our heroine popularity had not spoiled her and the best proof of this lay in the comments of a world that is nothing if not critical no beauty could have received with more modesty the triumph which had greeted her at mrs grenfells tableaux in april when she had appeared as circe in an architectural frame especially designed by mr farwell himself there had been a moment of hushed astonishment followed by an acclaim that sent the curtain up twice again  we must try to imagine too the logical continuation of that triumph in the baiae of our modern republic and empire newport open sesame seems as ever to be the countersign of her life even the palace gates swung wide to her most of them with the more readiness because she had already passed through other gatesmrs graingers for instance baiae apparently is a topsyturvy world in which if one alights upside down it is difficult to become righted to alight upside down is to alight in a palace the graingers did not live in one but in a garden that existed before the palaces were and one that the palace owners could not copy a garden that three generations of graingers somewhat assisted by a remarkable climate had made with loving care the box was priceless the spreading trees in the miniature park no less so and time the unbribeable alone could now have produced the wide carefully cherished victorian mansion likewise not purchasable by california gold was a grandfather whose name had been written large in the pages of american history his library was now lined with english sporting prints but these too were old and mellow and rare  to reach honoras cottage you turned away from the pomp and glitter and noise of bellevue avenue into the inviting tunnel of a leafy lane that presently stopped of itself as though to provide against the contingency of a stray excursionist a purpleplumed guard of old lilac trees massed themselves before the house and seemed to look down with contempt on the new brick wall across the lane odi profanum vulgus it was on account of the new brick wall in fact that honora through the intervention of mrs grainger and mrs shorter had been able to obtain this most desirable of retreats which belonged to a greataunt of miss godfrey mrs forsythe  mr chamberlin none other than he of whom we caught a glimpse some years ago in a castle near silverdale owned the wall and the grounds and the palace it enclosed this gentleman was of those who arrive in newport upside down and was even now with the somewhat doubtful assistance of his wife making lavish and pathetic attempts to right himself newport had never forgiven him for the razing of a mansion and the felling of trees which had been landmarks and for the driving out of mrs forsythe the mere sight of the modern wall had been too much for this ladythe lilacs and the leaves in the lane mercifully hid the palaceand after five and thirty peaceful summers she had moved out and let the cottage it was furnished with delightful oldfashioned things that seemed to express at every turn the aristocratic and uncompromising personality of the owner who had lived so long in their midst  mr chamberlin who has nothing whatever to do with this chronicle except to have been the indirect means of honoras installation used to come through the wall once a week or so to sit for half an hour on her porch as long as he ever sat anywhere he had reddish sidewhiskers and he reminded her of a buzzing toy locomotive wound up tight and suddenly taken from the floor she caught glimpses of him sometimes in the mornings buzzing around his gardeners his painters his carpenters and his grooms he would buzz the rest of his life but nothing short of a revolution could take his possessions away  the graingers and the grenfells and the stranges might move mountains but not mr chamberlins house whatever heartburnings he may have had because certain people refused to come to his balls he was in newport to remain he would sit under the battlements until the crack of doom or ratherand more appropriate in mr chamberlins casewalk around them and around blowing trumpets until they capitulated  honora magically found herself within them and without a siege behold her at last in the setting for which we always felt she was destined why is it in this world that realization is so difficult a thing now that she is there how shall we proceed to give the joys of her elysium their full value not certainly by repeating the word pleasure over and over again not by describing the palaces at which she lunched and danced and dined or the bright waters in which she bathed or the yachts in which she sailed during the week indeed she moved untrammelled in a world with which she found herself in perfect harmony it was new it was dazzling it was unexplored during the week it possessed still another and more valuable attributeit was real and she honora leffingwell spence was part and parcel of its permanence the life relationships of the people by whom she was surrounded became her own she had little time for thoughtduring the week  we are dealing now in emotions as delicate as cloud shadows and these drew on as saturday approached on saturdays and sundays the quality and texture of life seemed to undergo a change who does not recall the monday mornings of the school days of youth and the indefinite feeling betwixt sleep and waking that today would not be as yesterday or the day before on saturday mornings when she went downstairs she was wont to find the porch littered with newspapers and her husband lounging in a wicker chair behind the disapproving lilacs although they had long ceased to bloom their colour was purplehis was pink  honora did not at first analyze or define these emotions and was conscious only of a stirring within her and a change reality became unreality the house in which she lived and for which she felt a passion of ownership was for two days a rented house other women in newport had weekend guests in the guise of husbands and some of them went so far as to bewail the fact some had got rid of them honora kissed hers dutifully and picked up the newspapers drove him to the beach and took him out to dinner where he talked oracularly of finance on sunday night he departed without visible regrets for new york  one monday morning a storm was raging over newport seized by a sudden whim she rang her bell breakfasted at an unusual hour and nine oclock found her with her skirts flying on the road above the cliffs that leads to the fort the wind had increased to a gale and as she stood on the rocks the harbour below her was full of tossing white yachts straining at their anchors serene in the midst of all this hubbub lay a great grey battleship  presently however her thoughts were distracted by the sight of something moving rapidly across her line of vision a sloop yacht with a ridiculously shortened sail was coming in from the narrows scudding before the wind like a frightened bird she watched its approach in a sort of fascination for of late she had been upon the water enough to realize that the feat of which she was witness was not without its difficulties as the sloop drew nearer she made out a bareheaded figure bent tensely at the wheel and four others clinging to the yellow deck in a flash the boat had rounded to the mainsail fell and a veil of spray hid the actors of her drama when it cleared the yacht was tugging like a wild thing at its anchor  that night was mrs grenfells ball and many times in later years has the scene come back to honora it was not a large ball by no means on the scale of mr chamberlins for instance the great room reminded one of the gallery of a royal french chateau with its dished ceiling in the oval of which the colours of a pastoral fresco glowed in the ruby lights of the heavy chandeliers its grey panelling hidden here and there by tapestries and its series of deep arched windows that gave glimpses of a lanternhung terrace out there beyond a marble balustrade the lights of fishing schooners tossed on a blueblack ocean the same ocean on which she had looked that morning and which she heard now in the intervals of talk and laughter crashing against the cliffsalthough the wind had gone down like a woman stirred to the depths of her being its bosom was heaving still at the memory of the passion of the morning  this night after the storm was capriciously mild the velvet gown of heaven sewn with stars the music had ceased and supper was being served at little tables on the terrace the conversation was desultory  who is that with reggie farwell ethel wing asked  its the farrenden girl replied mr cuthbert whose business it was to know everybody chicago wheat she looks like ceres doesnt she quite becoming to reggies dark beauty she was sixteen they tell me when the old gentleman emerged from the pit and they packed her off to a convent by the next steamer reggie may have the blissful experience of living in one of his own houses if he marries her  the fourth at the table was ned carrington who had been first secretary at an embassy and he had many stories to tell of ambassadors who spoke commercial american and asked royalties after their wives some one had said about him that he was the only edition of the almanach de gotha that included the united states he somewhat resembled a golden seal emerging from a cold bath and from time to time screwed an eyeglass into his eye and made a careful survey of mrs grenfells guests  by george he exclaimed isnt that hugh chiltern  honora started and followed the direction of mr carringtons glance at sight of him a vivid memory of the mans personality possessed her  yes cuthbert was saying thats chiltern sure enough he came in on dicky farnhams yacht this morning from new york  this morning said ethel wing surely not no yacht could have come in this morning  nobody but chiltern would have brought one in you mean he corrected her he sailed her they say dicky was half dead with fright and wanted to put in anywhere chiltern sent him below and kept right on he has a devil in him i believe by the way thats dicky farnhams exwife hes talking toadele she keeps her good looks doesnt she whats happened to rindge  left him on the other side i hear said carrington perhaps shell take chiltern next she looked as though she were ready to and they say its easier every time  cest le second mari qui coute paraphrased cuthbert tossing his cigar over the balustrade the strains of a waltz floated out of the windows the groups at the tables broke up and the cotillon began  as honora danced chiltern remained in the back of her mind or rather an indefinite impression was there which in flashes she connected with him she wondered at times what had become of him and once or twice she caught herself scanning the bewildering shifting sheen of gowns and jewels for his face at last she saw him by the windows holding a favour in his hand coming in her direction she looked away towards the red uniforms of the hungarian band on the raised platform at the end of the room he was standing beside her  do you remember me mrs spence he asked  she glanced up at him and smiled he was not a person one would be likely to forget but she did not say so  i met you at mrs grangers was what she said  he handed her the favour she placed it amongst the collection at the back of her chair and rose and they danced was it dancing the music throbbed nay the musicians seemed suddenly to have been carried out of themselves and played as they had not played before her veins were filled with pulsing fire as she was swung guided carried out of herself by the extraordinary virility of the man who held her she had tasted mastery  thank you she faltered as they came around the second time to her seat  he released her  i stayed to dance with you he said i had to await my opportunity  it was kind of you to remember me she replied as she went off with mr carrington  a moment later she saw him bidding good night to his hostess his face she thought had not lost that strange look of determination that she recalled and yethow account for his recklessness  rum chap chiltern remarked carrington he might be almost anything if he only knew it  in the morning when she awoke her eye fell on the cotillon favours scattered over the lounge one amongst them stood outa silvermounted pincushion honora arose picked it up contemplatively stared at it awhile and smiled then she turned to her window breathing in the perfumes gazing out through the horsechestnut leaves at the green shadowdappled lawn below  on her breakfast tray amidst some invitations was a letter from her uncle this she opened first     dear honora he wrote amongst your fathers papers which have    been in my possession since his death was a certificate for three    hundred shares in a land company he bought them for very little    and i had always thought them worthless it turns out that these    holdings are in a part of the state of texas that is now being    developed on the advice of mr isham and others i have accepted an    offer of thirty dollars a share and i enclose a draft on new york    for nine thousand dollars i need not dwell upon the pleasure it is    for me to send you this legacy from your father and i shall only    add the counsel of an old uncle to invest this money by your    husbands advice in some safe securities  honora put down the letter and sat staring at the cheque in her hand nine thousand dollarsand her own her first impulse was to send it back to her uncle but that would be she knew to hurt his feelingshe had taken such a pride in handing her this inheritance she read the letter again and resolved that she would not ask howard to invest the money this at least should be her very own and she made up her mind to take it to a bank in thames street that morning  while she was still under the influence of the excitement aroused by the unexpected legacy mrs shorter came in a lady with whom honoras intimacy had been of steady growth the tie between them might perhaps have been described as intellectual for elsie shorter professed only to like people who were worth while she lent honora french plays discussed them with her and likewise a wider range of literature including certain brightly bound books on evolution and sociology  in the eighteenth century mrs shorter would have had a title and a salon in the faubourg in the twentieth she was the wife of a most fashionable and successful real estate agent in new york and was aware of no incongruity bourgeoise was the last thing that could be said of her she was as ready as a george sand to discuss the whole range of human emotions which she did many times a week with certain gentlemen of intellectual bent who had the habit of calling on her she had never to the knowledge of her acquaintances been shocked but while she believed that a great love carried mysteriously concealed in its flame its own pardon she had through some fifteen years of married life remained faithful to jerry shorter who was not to say the least a lochinvar or a roland although she had had nervous prostration and was thirtyfour she was undeniably pretty she was of the suggestive and not the strongminded type and the secret of her strength with the other sex was that she was in the habit of submitting her opinions for their approval  my dear she said to honora you may thank heaven that you are still young enough to look beautiful in negligee how far have you got have you guessed of which woman vivarce was the lover and isnt it the most exciting play youve ever read ned carrington saw it in paris and declares it frightened him into being good for a whole week  oh elsie exclaimed honora apologetically i havent read a word of it  mrs shorter glanced at the pile of favours  how was the dance she asked i was too tired to go hugh chiltern offered to take me  i saw mr chiltern there i met him last winter at the graingers  hes staying with us said mrs shorter you know hes a sort of cousin of jerrys and devoted to him he turned up yesterday morning on dicky farnhams yacht in the midst of all that storm it appears that dicky met him in new york and hugh said he was coming up here and dicky offered to sail him up when the storm broke they were just outside and all on board lost their heads and hugh took charge and sailed in dicky told me that himself  then it wasntrecklessness said honora involuntarily but mrs shorter did not appear to be surprised by the remark  thats what everybody thinks of course she answered they say that he had a chance to run in somewhere and browbeat dicky into keeping on for newport at the risk of their lives they do hugh an injustice he might have done that some years ago but hes changed  curiosity got the better of honora  changed she repeated  of course you didnt know him in the old days honora said mrs shorter you wouldnt recognize him now ive seen a good deal of men but he is the most interesting and astounding transformation ive ever known  how asked honora she was sitting before the glass with her hand raised to her hair  mrs shorter appeared puzzled  thats what interests me she said my dear dont you think life tremendously interesting i do i wish i could write a novel between ourselves ive tried i had mr dewing send it to a publisher who said it was clever but had no plot if i only could get a plot  honora laughed  how would i the transformation of mr chiltern do elsie  if i only knew whats happened to him and how hes going to end sighed mrs shorter  you were saying said honora for her friend seemed to have relapsed into a contemplation of this problem you were saying that he had changed  he goes away for seven years and he suddenly turns up filled with ambition and a purpose in life something he had never dreamed of hes been at grenoble where the chiltern estate is making improvements and preparing to settle down there and hes actually getting ready to write a life of his father the generalthats the most surprising thing they never met but to strike fire while the general was alive it appears that jerry and cecil grainger and one or two other people have some of the old gentlemans letters and thats the reason why hughs come to newport and the strangest thing about it my dear added mrs shorter inconsequently is that i dont think its a love affair  honora laughed again it was the first time she had ever heard mrs shorter attribute unusual human phenomena to any other source he wrote jerry that he was coming back to live on the estatefrom england and he wasnt there a week i cant think where hes seen any womenthat is mrs shorter corrected herself hastily of his own class hes been in the jungleindia africa cores that was after sally harrington broke the engagement and im positive hes not still in love with sally she lunched with me yesterday and i watched him oh i should have known it but sally hasnt got over it it wasnt a grand passion with hugh i dont believe hes ever had such a thing not that he isnt capable of iton the contrary hes one of the few men i can think of who is  at this point in the conversation honora thought that her curiosity had gone far enough     chapter iv the viking  she was returning on foot from the bank in thames street where she had deposited her legacy when she met him who had been the subject of her conversation with mrs shorter and the encounter seemedand wasthe most natural thing in the world she did not stop to ask herself why it was so fitting that the viking should be a part of vineland why his coming should have given it the one and final needful touch for that designation of reginald farwells had come back to her despite the fact that hugh chiltern had with such apparent resolution set his face towards literature and the tillage of the land it was as the viking still that her imagination pictured him by these tokens we may perceive that this faculty of our heroines has been at work and her canvas already sketched in  whether by design or accident he was at the leafy entrance of her lane she was not to know she spied him standing there and in her leisurely approach a strange conceit of reincarnation possessed her and she smiled at the contrast thus summoned up despite the jingling harnesses of bellevue avenue and the background of mr chamberlins palace wall despite the straw hat and white trousers and blue doublebreasted serge coat in which he was conventionally arrayed he was the sea fighter stillof all the ages m vipsanius agrippa who had won an empire for augustus had just such a head  their greeting too was conventional enough and he turned and walked with her up the lane and halted before the lilacs you have mrs forsythes house he said how well i remember it my mother used to bring me here years ago  wont you come in asked honora gently  he seemed to have forgotten her as they mounted in silence to the porch and she watched him with curious feelings as he gazed about him and peered through the windows into the drawingroom  its just as it was he said even the furniture im glad you havent moved it they used to sit over there in the corner and have tea on the ebony table and it was always darkjust as it is now i can see them they wore dresses with wide skirts and flounces and queer low collars and bonnets and they talked in subdued voicesunlike so many women in these days  she was a little surprised and moved by the genuine feeling with which he spoke  i was most fortunate to get the house she answered and i have grown to love it sometimes it seems as though i had always lived here  then you dont envy that he said flinging his hand towards an opening in the shrubbery which revealed a glimpse of one of the pilasters of the palace across the way the instinct of tradition which had been the cause of mrs forsythes departure was in him too he likewise seemed to belong to the little house as he took one of the wicker chairs  not said honora when i can have this  she was dressed in white her background of lilac leaves seated on the railing with the tip of one toe resting on the porch she smiled down at him from under the shadows of her wide hat  i didnt think you would he declared this place seems to suit you as i imagined you i have thought of you often since we first met last winter  yes she replied hastily i am very happy here mrs shorter tells me you are staying with then  when i saw you again last night he continued ignoring her attempt to divert the stream from his channel i had a vivid impression as of having just left you have you ever felt that way about people  yes she admitted and poked the toe of her boot with her parasol  and then i find you in this house which has so many associations for me harmoniously here he added if you know what i mean not a newcomer but some one who must always have been logically expected  she glanced at him quickly with parted lips it was she who had done most of the talking at mrs graingers dinner and the imaginative quality of mind he was now revealing was unlooked for she was surprised not to find it out of character it is a little difficult to know what she expected of him since she did not know herself the methods perhaps of the viking in longfellows poem she was aware at least that she had attracted him and she was beginning to realize it was not a thing that could be done lightly this gave her a little flutter of fear  are you going to be long in newport she asked  i am leaving on friday he replied it seems strange to be here again after so many years i find ive got out of touch with it and i havent a boat although farnhams been kind enough to offer me his  i cant imagine you somehow without a boat she said and added hastily mrs shorter was speaking of you this morning and said that you were always on the water when you were here newport must have been quite different then  he accepted the topic and during the remainder of his visit she succeeded in keeping the conversation in the middle ground although she had a sense of the ultimate futility of the effort a sense of pressure being exerted no matter what she said she presently discovered however that the taste for literature attributed to him which had seemed so incongruousexisted he spoke with a new fire when she led him that way albeit she suspected that some of the fuel was derived from the revelation that she shared his liking for books as the extent of his reading became gradually disclosed however her feeling of inadequacy grew and she resolved in the future to make better use of her odd moments on her table in two green volumes was the life of a massachusetts statesman that mrs shorter had lent her she picked it up after chiltern had gone he had praised it  he left behind him a blurred portrait on her mind as that of two men superimposed and only that morning he had had such a distinct impression of one it was from a consideration of this strange phenomenon with her book lying open in her lap that her maid aroused her to go to mrs pryors this was tuesday  some of the modern inventions we deem most marvellous have been fitted for ages to man and woman woman particularly possesses for instance a kind of submarine bell and if she listens she can at times hear it tinkling faintly and the following morning wednesday honora heard hers when she received an invitation to lunch at mrs shorters after a struggle she refused but mrs shorter called her up over the telephone and she yielded  ive got alfred dewing for myself said elsie shorter as she greeted honora in the hall he writes those very clever thingsyouve read them and hugh for you she added significantly  the shorter cottage though commodious was simplicity itself from the vinecovered pergola where they lunched they beheld the distant sea like a lavender haze across the flats and honora wondered whether there were not an element of truth in what mr dewing said of their hostessthat she thought nothing immoral except novels with happy endings chiltern did not talk much he looked at honora  hugh has got so serious said elsie shorter that sometimes im actually afraid of him you ought to have done something to be as serious as that hugh  done something  written the origin of species or founded a new political party or executed a coup detat half the time im under the delusion that im entertaining a celebrity under my roof and i wake up and its only hugh  its because he looks as though he might do any of those things suggested mr deming perhaps he may  oh said elsie shorter the men who do them are usually little wobbly specimens  honora was silent watching chiltern at times the completeness of her understanding of him gave her an uncanny sensation and again she failed to comprehend him at all she felt his anger go to a white heat but the others seemed blissfully unaware of the fact the arrival of coffee made a diversion  you and hugh may have the pergola honora ill take mr deming into the garden  i really ought to go in a few minutes elsie said honora  what nonsense exclaimed mrs shorter if its bridge at the playfairs ill telephone and get you out of it  no  then i dont see where you can be going declared mrs shorter and departed with her cavalier  why are you so anxious to get away asked chiltern abruptly  honora coloured  ohdid i seem so elsie has such a mania for pairing people offsometimes its quite embarrassing  she was a little rash in assuming that youd rather talk to me he said smiling  you were not consulted either  i was consulted before lunch he replied  you mean  i mean that i wanted you he said she had known it of course the submarine bell had told her and he could have found no woman in newport who would have brought more enthusiasm to his aid than elsie shorter  and you usuallyget what you want she retorted with a spark of rebellion  yes he admitted only hitherto i havent wanted very desirable things  she laughed but her curiosity got the better of her  hitherto she said you have just taken what you desired  from the smouldering fires in his eyes darted an arrowpoint of flame  what kind of a man are you she asked throwing the impersonal to the winds somebody called you a viking once  who he demanded  it doesnt matter im beginning to think the name singularly appropriate it wouldnt be the first time one landed in newport according to legend she added  i havent read the poem since childhood said chiltern looking at her fixedly but he becamedomesticated if i remember rightly  yes she admitted the impossible happened to him as it usually does in books and then circumstances helped there were no other women  when the lady died said chiltern he fell upon his spear  the final argument for my theory declared honora  on the contrary he maintained smiling it proves there is always one woman for every manif he cars find her if this man had lived in modern times he would probably have changed from a captain kidd into a useful citizen of the kind you once said you admired  is a woman necessary she asked for the transformation  he looked at her so intently that she blushed to the hair clustering at her temples she had not meant that her badinage should go so deep  it was not a woman he said slowly that brought me back to america  oh she exclaimed suffused i hope you wont think that curiosityand got no farther  he was silent a moment and when she ventured to glance up at him one of those enigmatical changes had taken place he was looking at her gravely though intently and the viking had disappeared  i wanted you to know he answered you must have heard more or less about me people talk naturally these things havent been repeated to me but i dare say many of them are true i havent been a saint and i dont pretend to be now ive never taken the trouble to deceive any one and ive never cared im sorry to say what was said but id like you to believe that when i agreed with with the sentiments you expressed the first time i saw you i was sincere and i am still sincere  indeed i do believe it cried honora  his face lighted  you seemed different from the other women i had knownof my generation at least he went on steadily none of them could have spoken as you did i had just landed that morning and i should have gone direct to grenoble but there was some necessary business to be attended to in new york i didnt want to go to bessies dinner but she insisted she was short of a man i went i sat next to you and you interpreted my mind it seemed too extraordinary not to have had a significance  honora did not reply she felt instinctively that he was a man who was not wont ordinarily to talk about his affairs beneath his speech was an undercurrentor undertow perhapscarrying her swiftly easily helpless into the deep waters of intimacy for the moment she let herself go without a struggle her silence was of a breathless quality which he must have felt  and i am going to tell you why i came home he said i have spoken of it to nobody but i wish you to know that it had nothing to do with any ordinary complication these people may invent nor was there anything supernatural about it what happened to me i suppose is as old a story as civilization itself id been knocking about the world for a good many years and id had time to think one day i found myself in the interior of china with a few coolies and a man who i suspect was a ticketofleave englishman i can see the place now the yellow fog the sand piled up against the wall like yellow snow desolation was a mild name for it i think i began with a consideration of the englishman who was asleep in the shadow of a tower there was something inconceivably hopeless in his face in that ochre light then the place where i was born and brought up came to me with a startling completeness and i began to go over my own life step by step to make a long story short i perceived that what my father had tried to teach me in his own way had some reason in it he was a good deal of a man i made up my mind id come home and start in where i belonged but i didnt do so right awayi finished the trip first and lent the englishman a thousand pounds to buy into a firm in shanghai i suppose he added that is what is called suggestion in my case it was merely the cumulative result of many reflections in waste places  and since then  since then i have been at grenoble making repairs and trying to learn something about agriculture ive never been as happy in my life  and youre going back on friday she said  he glanced at her quickly he had detected the note in her speech though lightly uttered it was unmistakably a command she tried to soften its effect in her next sentence  i cant express how much i appreciate your telling me this she said ill confess to you i wished to think that something of that kind had happened i wished to believe thatthat you had made this determination alone when i met you that night there was something about you i couldnt account for i havent been able to account for it until now  she paused confused fearful that she had gone too far a moment later she was sure of it a look came into his eyes that frightened her  youve thought of me he said  you must know she replied that you have an unusual personalitya striking one i can go so far as to say that i remembered you when you reappeared at mrs grenfells she hesitated  he rose and walked to the far end of the tiled pavement of the pergola and stood for a moment looking out over the sea then he turned to her  i either like a person or i dont he said and i tell you frankly i have never met a woman whom i cared for as i do you i hope youre not going to insist upon a probationary period of months before you decide whether you can reciprocate  here indeed was a speech in his other character and she seemed to see in a flash his whole life in it there was a touch of boyishness that appealed a touch of insistent masterfulness that alarmed she recalled that mrs shorter had said of him that he had never had to besiege a fortressthe white flag had always appeared too quickly of course there was the mystery of mrs maitlandstill to be cleared up it was plain at least that resistance merely made him unmanageable she smiled  it seems to me she said that in two days we have become astonishingly intimate  why shouldnt we he demanded  but she was not to be led into casuistry  ive been reading the biography you recommended she said  he continued to look at her a moment and laughed as he sat down beside her later he walked home with her a dinner and bridge followed and it was after midnight when she returned as her maid unfastened her gown she perceived that her pincushion had been replaced by the one she had received at the ball  did you put that there mathilde she asked  mathilde had she had seen it on madames bureau and thought madame wished it there she would replace the old one at once  no said honora you may leave it now  bien madame said the maid and glanced at her mistress who appeared to have fallen into a revery  it had seemed strange to her to hear people talking about him at the dinner that night and once or twice her soul had sprung to arms to champion him only to remember that her knowledge was special she alone of all of them understood and she found herself exulting in the superiority the amazed comment when the heir to the chiltern fortune had returned to the soil of his ancestors had been revived on his arrival in newport ned carrington amid much laughter had quoted the lines about prince hal            to mock the expectations of the world           to frustrate prophecies  honora disliked mr carrington  perhaps the events of thursday would better be left in the confusion in which they remained in honoras mind she was awakened by penetrating persistent and mournful notes which for some time she could not identify although they sounded oddly familiar and it was not until she felt the dampness of the coverlet and looked at the white square of her open windows that she realized there was a fog and it had not lifted when chiltern came in the afternoon they discussed literaturebut the book had fallen to the floor absit omen if printing had then been invented undoubtedly there would have been a book instead of an apple in the third chapter of genesis he confided to her his plan of collecting his fathers letters and of writing the generals life honora too would enjoy writing a book perhaps the thought of the pleasure of collaboration occurred to them both at once it was chiltern who wished that he might have her help in the difficult places she had he felt the literary instinct it was not the viking who was talking now and then at last he had risen reluctantly to leave the afternoon had flown she held out her hand with a frank smile  goodby she said goodby and good luck  but i may not go he replied  she stood dismayed  i thought you told me you were going on fridaytomorrow  i merely set that as a probable date i have changed my mind there is no immediate necessity do you wish me to go he demanded  she had turned away and was straightening the books on the table  why should i she said  you wouldnt object to my remaining a few days more he had reached the doorway  what have i to do with your staying she asked  everything he answeredand was gone  she stood still the feeling that possessed her now was rebellion and akin to hate  her conduct therefore becomes all the more incomprehensible when we find her accepting the next afternoon his invitation to sail on mr farnhams yacht the folly it is true that the gods will not exonerate mrs shorter that lady who had been bribed with alfred dewing used her persuasive powers she might be likened to a skilful artisan who blew wonderful rainbow fabrics out of glass without breaking it she blew the tender passion into a thousand shapes and admired every one her criminal culpability consisted in forgetting the fact that it could not be trusted with children  nature seems to delight in contrasts as though to atone for the fog she sent a dazzling day out of the northwest and the summer world was stained in new colours the yachts were whiter the water bluer the grass greener the stern grey rocks themselves flushed with purple the wharves were gay and dark clustering foliage hid an enchanted city as the folly glided between dancing buoys honora with a frightened glance upward at the great sail caught her breath and she felt rather than saw the man beside her guiding her seaward  a discreet expanse of striped yellow deck separated them from the wicker chairs where mrs shorter and mr dewing were already established she glanced at the profile of the viking and allowed her mind to dwell for an instant upon the sensations of that other woman who had been snatched up and carried across the ocean which was the quality in him that attracted her his lawlessness or his intellect and ambition never she knew had he appealed to her more than at this moment when he stood a stern figure at the wheel and vouchsafed her nothing but commonplaces this surely was his element  presently however the yacht slid out from the infolding land into an open sea that stretched before them to a silverlined horizon and he turned to her with a disconcerting directness as though taking for granted a subtle understanding between them  how well you sail she said hurriedly  i ought to be able to do that at least he declared  i saw you when you came in the other day although i didnt know who it was until afterwards i was standing on the rocks near the fort and my heart was in my mouth  he answered that the dolly was a good sea boat  so you decided to forgive me he said  for what  for staying in newport  before accepting the invitation she had formulated a policy cheerfully confident in her ability to carry it out for his decision not to leave newport had had an opposite effect upon her than that she had anticipated it had oddly relieved the pressure it had given her a chance to rally her forces to smile indeed at an onslaught that had so disturbed her to examine the matter in a more rational light it had been a cause for selfcongratulation that she had scarcely thought of him the night before and today in her blue veil and blue serge gown she had boarded the folly with her wits about her she forgot that it was he who so to speak had the choice of ground and weapons  i have forgiven you why shouldnt i when you have so royally atoned  but he obstinately refused to fence there was nothing apologetic in this man no indirectness in his method of attack parry adroitly as she might he beat down her guard as the afternoon wore on there were silences when honora by staring over the waters tried to collect her thoughts but the sea was his ally and she turned her face appealingly toward the receding land fascination and fear struggled within her as she had listened to his onslaughts and she was conscious of being moved by what he was not by what he said vainly she glanced at the two representatives of an ironically satisfied convention only to realize that they were absorbed in a milder but no less entrancing aspect of the same topic and would not thank her for an interruption  do you wish me to go away he asked at last abruptly almost rudely  surely she said your work your future isnt in newport  you havent answered my question  its because i have no right to answer it she replied although we have known each other so short a time i am your friend you must realize that i am not conventional i have lived long enough to understand that the people one likes best are not necessarily those one has known longest you interest mei admit it franklyi speak to you sincerely i am even concerned that you shall find happiness and i feel that you have the power to make something of yourself what more can i say it seems to me a little strange she added that under the circumstances i should say so much i can give no higher proof of my friendship  he did not reply but gave a sharp order to the crew the sheet was shortened and the folly obediently headed westward against the swell flinging rainbows from her bows as she ran mrs shorter and dewing returned at this moment from the cabin where they had been on a tour of inspection  where are you taking us hugh said mrs shorter nowhere in particular he replied  please dont forget that i am having people to dinner tonight thats all i ask what have you done to him honora to put him in such a humour  honora laughed  i hadnt noticed anything peculiar about him she answered  this boat reminds me of adele said mrs shorter she loved it i can see how she could get a divorce from dickybut the folly she told me yesterday that the sight of it made her homesick and eustace rindge wont leave paris  it suddenly occurred to honora as she glanced around the yacht that mrs rindge rather haunted her  so that is your answer said chiltern when they were alone again  what other can i give you  is it because you are married he demanded  she grew crimson  isnt that an unnecessary question  no he declared it concerns me vitally to understand you you were good enough to wish that i should find happiness i have found the possibility of itin you  oh she cried dont say such things  have you found happiness he asked  she turned her face from him towards their shining wake but he had seen that her eyes were filled with sudden tears  forgive me he pleaded i did not mean to be brutal i said that because i felt as i have never in my life felt before as i did not know i could feel i cant account for it but i ask you to believe me  i can account for it she answered presently with a strange gentleness it is because you met me at a critical time suchcoincidences often occur in life i happened to be a woman and i confess it a woman who was interested i could not have been interested if you had been less real less sincere but i saw that you were going through a crisis that you might with your powers build up your life into a splendid and useful thing and womanlike my instinct was to help you i should not have allowed you to go on butbut it all happened so quickly that i was bewildered ii do not understand it myself  he listened hungrily and yet at times with evident impatience  no he said i cannot believe that it was an accident it was you  she stopped him with an imploring gesture  please she said please let us go in  without an instants hesitation he brought the sloop about and headed her for the lightship on brentons reef and they sailed in silence awhile she watched the sapphire waters break to dazzling whiteness under the westerning sun then in an ecstasy she did not seek to question she closed her eyes to feel more keenly the swift motion of their flight why not the sea the winds of heaven had aided others since the dawn of history legend was eternally true on these very shores happiness had awaited those who had dared to face primeval things  she looked again this time towards an unpeopled shore no sentinel guarded the uncharted reefs and the very skies were smiling after the storm at the scudding fates  it was not until they were landlocked once more and the folly was reluctantly beating back through the narrows that he spoke again  so you wish me to go away  i cannot see any use in your staying she replied after what you have said icannot see she added in a low voice that for you to remain would be to promote the happiness ofeither of us you should have gone today  you care he exclaimed  it is because i do not wish to care that i tell you to go  and you refuse happiness  it could be happiness for neither of us said honora the situation would be impossible you are not a man who would be satisfied with moderation you would insist upon having all and you do not know what you are asking  i know that i want you he said and that my life is won or lost with or without you  you have no right to say such a thing  we have each of us but one life to live  and one life to ruin she answered see you are running on the rocks  he swung the boat around  others have rebuilt upon ruins he declared  she smiled at him  but you are taking my ruins for granted she said you would make them first  he relapsed into silence again the folly needed watching once he turned and spoke her name and she did not rebuke him  women have a clearer vision of the future than men she began presently and i know you better than you know yourself whatwhat you desire would not mend your life but break it utterly i am speaking plainly as i have told you you interest me so far that is the extent of my feelings i do not know whether they would go any farther but on your account as well as my own i will not take the risk we have come to an impasse i am sorry i wish we might have been friends but what you have said makes it impossible there is only one thing to do and that is for you to go away  he eased off his sheet rounded the fort and set a course for the moorings the sun hung red above the silhouetted roofs of conanicut and a quaint tower in the shape of a minaret stood forth to cap the illusions of a day  the wind was falling the harbour quieting for the night and across the waters to the tones of a trumpet the red bars of the battleships flag fluttered to the deck the folly making a wide circle shot into the breeze and ended by gliding gently up to the buoy     chapter v the survival of the fittest  it was saturday morning but honora had forgotten the fact not until she was on the bottom step did the odour of cigarettes reach her and turn her faint and she clutched suddenly at the banisters thus she stood for a while motionless and then went quietly into the drawingroom the french windows looking out on the porch were as usual open  it was an odd sensation thus to be regarding ones husband objectively for the first time he appeared to her definitely as a stranger as much a stranger as the man who came once a week to wind mrs forsythes clocks nay more there was a sense of intrusion in this visit of invasion of a life with which he had nothing to do she examined him ruthlessly very much as one might examine a burglar taken unawares there was the inevitable shirt with the wide pink stripes of the abolishment or even of the effective toning down of which she had long since despaired on the contrary like his complexion they evinced a continual tendency towards a more aggressive colour there was also the jewelled ring now conspicuously held aloft on a fat little finger the stripes appeared that morning as the banner of a hated suzerain the ring as the emblem of his overlordship he did not belong in that house everything in it cried out for his removal and yet it was in the eyes of the law at least his by grace of that fact she was here enjoying it at that instant as though in evidence of this he laid down a burning cigarette on a mahogany stand he had had brought out to him honora seized an ash tray hurried to the porch and picked up the cigarette in the tips of her fingers  howard i wish you would be more careful of mrs forsythes furniture she exclaimed  hello honora he said without looking up i see by the newport paper that old maitland is back from europe things are skyrocketing in wall street he glanced at the ash tray which she had pushed towards him whats the difference about the table if the old lady makes a row ill pay for it  some things are priceless she replied you do not seem to realize that  not this rubbish said howard judging by the fuss she made over the inventory youd think it might be worth something  she has trusted us with it said honora her voice shook  he stared at her  i never saw you look like that he declared  its because you never look at me closely she answered  he laughed and resumed his reading she stood awhile by the railing across the way beyond the wall she heard mr chamberlins shrill voice berating a gardener  howard she asked presently why do you come to newport at all  why do i come to newport he repeated i dont understand you  why do you come up here every week  well he said it isnt a bad trip on the boat and i get a change from new york and see men i shouldnt probably see otherwise he paused and looked at her again doubtfully why do you ask such a question  i wished to be sure said honora  sure of what  that thearrangement suited you perfectly you do not feelthe lack of anything do you  what do you mean  you wouldnt care to stay in newport all the time  not if i know myself he replied i leave that part of it to you  what part of it she demanded  you ought to know you do it pretty well he laughed by the way honora ive got to have a conference with mr wing today and i may not be home to lunch  were dining there tonight she told him in a listless voice  upon ethel wing had descended the dominating characteristics of the elder james who whatever the power he might wield in wall street was little more than a visitor in newport it was ethels house from the hour she had swept the reel and carter plans which her father had brought home from the table and sent for mr farwell the forehanded reginald arrived with a sketch and the result as every one knows is one of the chief monuments to his reputation so exquisitely proportioned is its simple twostoried marble front as seen through the trees left standing on the old estate that tourists having beheld the chamberlin and other mansions are apt to think this niggardly for a palace two infolding wings stretching towards the water enclose a court and through the slender white pillars of the peristyle one beholds in fancy the summer seas of greece  looking out on the court and sustaining this classic illusion is a marblepaved dining room with hangings of pompeiian red and frescoes of nymphs and satyrs and piping shepherds framed between fluted pilasters dimly discernible in the soft lights  in the midst of these surroundings at the head of his table sat the great financier whose story but faintly concerns this chronicle the man who every day that he had spent down town in new york in the past thirty years had eaten the same meal in the same little restaurant under the street this he told honora on his left as though it were not history he preferred apple pie to the greatest of artistic triumphs of his daughters chef and had it a glorified apple pie with frills and furbelows and whipped cream which he angrily swept to one side with contempt  that isnt apple pie he said id like to take that frenchman to the little new england hilltown where i went to school and show him what apple pie is  such were the autobiographical snatchesby no means so crude as they sound that reached her intelligence from time to time mr wing was too subtle to be crude and he had married a playfair a family noted for good living honora did not know that he was fond of talking of that apple pie and the new england school at public banquets nor did mr wing suspect that the young woman whom he was apparently addressing and who seemed to be hanging on his words was not present  it was not until she had put her napkin on the table that she awoke with a start and gazed into his face and saw written there still another history than the one he had been telling her the face was hidden indeed by the red beard what she read was in the little eyes that swept her with a look of possession possession in a large sense let it be emphasized that an exact justice be done mr james wingshe was one of the many chattels over which his ownership extended bought and paid for with her husband a hot resentment ran through her at the thought  mr cuthbert who was many kinds of a barometer sought her out later in the courtyard  your husbands feeling tiptop isnt he said he  hes been locked up with old wing all day somethings in the wind and id give a good deal to know what it is  im afraid i cant inform you replied honora  mr cuthbert apologized  oh i didnt mean to ask you far a tip he declared quite confused i didnt suppose you knew the old man is getting ready to make another killing thats all you dont mind my telling you you look stunning tonight do you  honora smiled  no i dont mind she said  mr cuthbert appeared to be ransacking the corners of his brain for words  i was watching you tonight at the table while mr wing was talking to you i dont believe you heard a thing he said  such astuteness she answered smiling at him astounds me  he laughed nervously  youre different than youve ever been since ive known you he went on undismayed i hope you wont think im making love to you not that i shouldnt like to but ive got sense enough to see its no use  her reply was unexpected  what makes you think that she asked curiously  oh im not a fool said mr cuthbert but if i were a poet or that fellow dewing i might be able to tell you what your eyes were like tonight  im glad youre not said honora  as they were going in she turned for a lingering look at the sea a strong young moon rode serenely in the sky and struck a path of light across the restless waters along this shimmering way the eyes of her companion followed hers  i can tell you what that colour is at least do you remember the blue transparent substance that used to be on favours at childrens parties he asked there were caps inside of them and crackers  i believe you are a poet after all she said  a shadow fell across the flags honora did not move  hello chiltern said cuthbert i thought you were playing bridge  you havent looked at me once tonight he said when cuthbert had gone in  she was silent  are you angry  yes a little she answered do you blame me  the vibration of his voice in the moonlit court awoke an answering chord in her and a note of supplication from him touched her strangely logic in his presence was a little difficultthere can be no doubt of that  i must go in she said unsteadily my carriage is waiting  but he stood in front of her  i should have thought you would have gone she said  i wanted to see you again  and now  i cant leave while you feel this way he pleaded i cant abandon what i have of youwhat you will let me take if i told you i would be reasonable  i dont believe in miracles she said recovering a little at least in modern ones the question is could you become reasonable  as a last resort he replied with a flash of humour and a touch of hope if you wouldcommute my sentence  she passed him and picking up her skirts paused in the window  i will give you one more chance she said  this was the conversation that by repeating itself filled the interval of her drive home so oblivious was she to howards presence that he called her twice from her corner of the carriage after the vehicle had stopped and he halted her by seizing her arm as she was about to go up the stairs she followed him mechanically into the drawingroom  he closed the door behind them and the other door into the darkened dining room he even took a precautionary glance out of the window of the porch and these movements which ordinarily might have aroused her curiosity if not her alarm she watched with a profound indifference he took a stand before the japanese screen in front of the fireplace thrust his hands in his pockets cleared his throat and surveyed her from her white shoulders to the goldembroidered tips of her slippers  im leaving for the west in the morning honora if youve made any arrangements for me on sunday youll have to cancel them i may be gone two weeks i may be gone a month i dont know  yes she said  im going to tell you something those fellows in the smoking room tonight did their best to screw out of me if you say anything about it alls up between me and wing the fact that he picked me out to engineer the thing and that hes going to let me in if i push it through is a pretty good sign that he thinks something of my business ability eh  youd better not tell me howard she said  youre too clever to let it out he assured her and added with a chuckle if it goes through order what you like rent a house on bellevue avenueany thing in reason  what is it she asked with a sudden premonition that the thing had a vital significance for her  its the greatest scheme extant he answered with elation i wont go into detailsyou wouldnt understandem mr wing and some others have tried the thing before nearer home and it worked like a charm street railways we buy up the little lines for nothing and get an interest in the big ones and sell the little lines for fifty times what they cost us and guarantee big dividends for the big lines  it sounds to me said honora slowly as though some one would get cheated  some one get cheated he exclaimed laughing every one gets cheated as you call it if they havent enough sense to know what their propertys worth and how to use it to the best advantage its a case he announced of the survival of the fittest which reminds me that if im going to be fit tomorrow id better go to bed mr wings to take me to new york on his yacht and youve got to have your wits about you when you talk to the old man     volume 6     chapter vi clio or thalia  according to the ordinary and inaccurate method of measuring time a fortnight may have gone by since the event last narrated and honora had tasted at last the joys of authorship her name was not to appear to be sure on the cover of the life and letters of general angus chiltern nor indeed so far had she written so much as a chapter or a page of a work intended to inspire young and old with the virtues of citizenship at present the biography was in the crucial constructive stage should the letters be put in one volume and the life in another or should the letters be inserted in the text of the life or could not there be a third and judicious mixture of both of these methods honoras counsel on this and other problems was it seems invaluable her own table was fairly littered with biographies more or less famous which had been fetched from the library and the method of each considered  even as mr garrick would never have been taken for an actor in his coach and four so our heroine did not in the least resemble george eliot for instance as she sat before her mirror at high noon with monsieur cadron and her maid mathilde in worshipful attendance some of the ladies indeed who have left us those chatty memoirs of the days before the guillotine she might have been likened to monsieur cadron was an artist and his branch of art was hairdressing it was by his own wish he was here today since he had conceived a new coiffure especially adapted he declared to the type of madame spence behold him declaring ecstatically that seldom in his experience had he had such hairs to work with  avec une telle chevelure lon peut tout faire madame etre simple cest le comble de lart ca vous donne he added with clasped hands and a step backward ca vous donne tout a fait lair dune dame de nattier  madame took the handglass and did not deny that she was eblouissante if madame suggested monsieur cadron had but a little dress a la marie antoinette madame had cried madames maid running to fetch one with little pink flowers and green leaves on an ecru ground could any coiffure or any gown be more appropriate for an entertainment at which clio was to preside  it is obviously impossible that a masterpiece should be executed under the rules laid down by convention it would never be finished mr chiltern was coming to lunch and it was not the first time on her appearance in the doorway he halted abruptly in his pacing of the drawingroom and stared at her  im sorry i kept you waiting she said  it was worth it he said and they entered the dining room a subdued goldengreen light came in through the tall glass doors that opened out on the little garden which had been mrs forsythes pride the scent of roses was in the air and a mass of them filled a silver bowl in the middle of the table on the dark walls were mrs forsythes precious prints and above the mantel a portrait of a thin aristocratic gentleman who resembled the poet tennyson in the noonday shadows of a recess was a dark mahogany sideboard loaded with softly gleaming silverhonoras chiltern sat down facing her he looked at honora over the rosesand she looked at him a sense of unreality that was paradoxically stronger than reality itself came over her a sense of fitness of harmony and for the moment an imagination ever straining at its leash was allowed to soar it was chiltern who broke the silence  what a wonderful bowl he said  it has been in my fathers family a great many years he was very fond of it she answered and with a sudden impulsive movement she reached over and set the bowl aside  thats better he declared much as i admire the bowl and the roses  she coloured faintly and smiled the feast of reason that we are impatiently awaiting is deferred it were best to attempt to record the intangible things the goldengreen light the perfumes and the faint musical laughter which we can hear if we listen thalias laughter surely not clios thalia enamoured with such a theme has taken the stage herselfand as vesta goddess of hearths it was vesta whom they felt to be presiding they lingered therefore over the coffee and chiltern lighted a cigar he did not smoke cigarettes  ive lived long enough he said to know that i have never lived at all there is only one thing in life worth having  what is it asked honora  this he answered with a gesture when it is permanent  she smiled  and how is one to know whether it would bepermanent  through experience and failure he answered quickly we learn to distinguish the reality when it comes it is unmistakable  suppose it comes too late she said forgetting the ancient verse inscribed in her youthful diary those who walk on ice will slide against their wills  to admit that is to be a coward he declared  such a philosophy may be fitting for a man she replied but for a woman  we are no longer in the dark ages he interrupted every one man or woman has the right to happiness there is no reason why we should suffer all our lives for a mistake  a mistake she echoed  certainly he said it is all a matter of luck or fate or whatever you choose to call it do you suppose if i could have found fifteen years ago the woman to have made me happy i should have spent so much time in seeking distraction  perhaps you could not have been capable of appreciating herfifteen years ago suggested honora and lest he might misconstrue her remark she avoided his eyes  perhaps he admitted but suppose i have found her now when i know the value of things  suppose you should find her nowwithin a reasonable time what would you do  marry her he exclaimed promptly marry her and take her to grenoble and live the life my father lived before me  she did not reply but rose and he followed her to the shaded corner of the porch where they usually sat the bundle of yellowstained envelopes he had brought were lying on the table and honora picked them up mechanically  i have been thinking she said as she removed the elastics that it is a mistake to begin a biography by the enumeration of ones ancestors readers become frightfully bored before they get through the first chapter  im beginning to believe he laughed that you will have to write this one alone all the ideas i have got so far have been yours why shouldnt you write it and i arrange the material and talk about it that appears to be all im good for  if she allowed her mind to dwell on the vista he thus presented she did not betray herself  another thing she said it should be written like fiction  like fiction  fact should be written like fiction and fiction like fact its difficult to express what i mean but this life of your father deserves to be widely known and it should be entertainingly done like lockhart or partons works  an envelope fell to the floor spilling its contents among them were several photographs  oh she exclaimed how beautiful what place is this  i hadnt gone over these letters he answered i only got them yesterday from cecil grainger these are some pictures of grenoble which must leave been taken shortly before my father died  she gazed in silence at the old house half hidden by great maples and beeches their weighted branches sweeping the ground the building was of wood painted white and through an archway of verdure one saw the generous doorway with its circular steps with its fanlight above and its windows at the side other quaint windows some of them of triple width suggested an interior of mystery and interest  my greatgreatgrandfather alexander chiltern built it he said on land granted to him before the revolution of course the house has been added to since then but the simplicity of the original has always been kept my father put on the conservatory for instance and chiltern pointed to a portion at the end of one of the long low wings he got the idea from the orangery of a georgian house in england and an english architect designed it  honora took up the other photographs one of them over which she lingered was of a charming oldfashioned garden spattered with sunlight and shut out from the world by a high brick wall behind the wall again were the dense masses of the trees and at the end of a path between nodding foxgloves and canterbury bells in a curved recess a stone seat  she turned her face his was at her shoulder  how could you ever have left it she asked reproachfully  she voiced his own regrets which the crowding memories had awakened  i dont know he answered not without emotion i have often asked myself that question he crossed over to the railing of the porch swung about and looked at her her eyes were still on the picture i can imagine you in that garden he said  did the garden cast the spell by which she saw herself on the seat or was it chilterns voice she would indeed love and cherish it and was it true that she belonged there securely infolded within those peaceful walls how marvellously well was thalia playing her comedy which was the real and which the false what of true value what of peace and security was contained in her present existence she had missed the meaning of things and suddenly it was held up before her in a garden  a later hour found them in honoras runabout wandering northward along quiet country roads on the eastern side of the island chiltern who was driving seemed to take no thought of their direction until at last with an exclamation he stopped the horse and honora beheld an abandoned mansion of a bygone age sheltered by ancient trees with wide lands beside it sloping to the water  what is it she asked  beaulieu he replied it was built in the seventeenth century i believe and must have been a fascinating place in colonial days he drove in between the fences and tied the horse and came around by the side of the runabout wont you get out and look at it  she hesitated and their eyes met as he held out his hand but she avoided it and leaped quickly to the ground neither spoke as they walked around the deserted house and gazed at the quaint facade broken by a crumbling shaded balcony let in above the entrance door no sound broke the stillness of the summers daya pregnant stillness the air was heavy with perfumes and the leaves formed a tracery against the marvellous blue of the sky mystery brooded in the place here in this remote paradise now in ruins people had dwelt and loved thought ended there and feeling which is unformed thought began again she glanced at him and again their eyes met and hers faltered they turned as with one consent down the path toward the distant water paradise overgrown could it be reconstructed redeemed  in former days the ground they trod had been a pleasance the width of the house bordered doubtless by the forest trees grew out of the flower beds now and underbrush choked the paths the box itself that once primly lined the alleys was gnarled and shapeless labyrinth had replaced order nature had reaped her vengeance at length in the deepening shade they came at what had been the edge of the old terrace to the daintiest of summerhouses crumbling too the shutters off their hinges the floorboards loose past and gone were the idyls of which it had been the stage  they turned to the left through tangled box that wound hither and thither until they stopped at a stone wall bordering a treearched lane at the bottom of the lane was a glimpse of blue water  honora sat down on the wall with her back to a great trunk chiltern with a hand on the stones leaped over lightly and stood for some moments in the lane his feet a little apart and firmly planted his hands behind his back  what had thalia been about to allow the message of that morning to creep into her comedy a message announcing the coming of an intruder not in the play in the person of a husband bearing gifts what right had he in the eternal essence of things to return he was out of all time and place such had been her feeling when she had first read the hastily written letter but even when she had burned it it had risen again from the ashes anything but that in trying not to think of it she had picked up the newspaper learned of a railroad accidentand shuddered anything but his return her marriage was a sinthere could be no sacrament in it she would flee first and abandon all rather than submit to it  chilterns step aroused her now he came back to the wall where she was sitting and faced her  you are sad he said  she shook her head at him slowly and tried to smile  what has happened he demanded rudely i cant bear to see you sad  i am going away she said the decision had suddenly come to her why had she not seen before that it was inevitable  he seized her wrist as it lay on the wall and she winced from the sudden pain of his grip  honora i love you he said i must have youi will have you i will make you happy i promise it on my soul i cant i wont live without you  she did not listen to his wordsshe could not have repeated them afterwards the very tone of his voice was changed by passion creation spoke through him and she heard and thrilled and swayed and soared forgetting heaven and earth and hell as he seized her in his arms and covered her face with kisses thus eric the red might have wooed and by what grace she spoke the word that delivered her she never knew as suddenly as he had seized her he released her and she stood before him with flaming cheeks and painful breath  i love you he said i love you i have searched the world for you and found you and by all the laws of god you are mine  and love was written in her eyes he had but to read it there though her lips might deny it this was the man of all men she would have chosen and she was his by right of conquest yet she held up her hand with a gesture of entreaty  no hughit cannot be she said  cannot he cried i will take you you love me  i am married  married do you mean that you would let that man stand between you and happiness  what do you mean she asked in a frightened voice  just what i say he cried with incredible vehemence leave himdivorce him you cannot live with him he isnt worthy to touch your hand  the idea planted itself with the force of a barbed arrow from a strongbow struggle as she might she could not henceforth extract it  oh she cried  he took her arm gently and forced her to sit down on the wall such was the completeness of his mastery that she did not resist he sat down beside her  listen honora he said and tried to speak calmly though his voice was still vibrant let us look the situation in the face as i told you once the days of useless martyrdom are past the world is more enlightened today and recognizes an individual right to happiness  to happiness she repeated after him like a child he forgot his words as he looked into her eyes they were lighted as with all the candles of heaven in his honour  listen he said hoarsely and his fingers tightened on her arm  the current running through her from him made her his instrument did he say the sky was black she would have exclaimed at the discovery  yesi am listening  honora  hugh she answered and blinded him he was possessed by the tragic fear that she was acting a dream presently she would awakeand shatter the universe his dominance was too complete  i love youi respect you you are making it very hard for me please try to understand what i am saying he cried almost fiercely this thing this miracle has happened in spite of us henceforth you belong to medo you hear  once more the candles flared up  we cannot drift we must decide now upon some definite action our lives are our own to make as we choose you said you were going away and you meantalone  the eyes were wide now with fright  oh i musti must she said dontdont talk about it and she put forth a hand over his  i will talk about it he declared trembling i have thought it all out and this time it was her fingers that tightened you are going away and presentlywhen you are freei will come to you  for a moment the current stopped  no no she cried almost in terror the first fatalist must have been a woman and the vision of rent prison bars drove her mad no we could never be happy  we canwe will be happy he said with a conviction that was unshaken do you hear me i will not debase what i have to say by resorting to comparisons butothers i know have been happy are happy though their happiness cannot be spoken of with ours listen you will go awayfor a little whileand afterwards we shall be together for all time nothing shall separate us we never have known life either of us until now i missing you have run after the false gods and youi say it with truthneeded me we will go to live at grenoble as my father and mother lived we will take up their duties there and if it seems possible i will go into public life when i return i shall find youwaiting for mein the garden  so real had the mirage become that honora did not answer the desert and its journey fell away could such a thing after all be possible did fate deal twice to those whom she had made novices the mirage indeed suddenly became realitya mirage only because she had proclaimed it such she had beheld in it as he spoke a grenoble which was paradise regained and why should paradise regained be a paradox why paradise regained paradise gained she had never known it until he had flung wide the gates she had sought for it and never found it until now and her senses doubted it it was a paradise of love to be sure but one too of duty duty made it real work was there and fulfilment of the purpose of life itself and if his days hitherto had been useless hers had in truth been barren  it was only of late after a lifelong groping that she had discovered their barrenness the right to happiness could she begin anew and found it upon a rock and was he the rock  the question startled her and she drew away from him first her hand and then she turned her body staring at him with widened eyes he did not resist the movement nor could he being male divine what was passing within her though he watched her anxiously she had no thought of the first daysbut afterwards for at such times it is the woman who scans the veil of the future how long would that beacon burn which flamed now in such prodigal waste would not the very springs of it dry up she looked at him and she saw the viking but the viking had fled from the world and theythey would be going into it could love prevail against its dangers and pitfalls andduties love was the word that rang out as one calling through the garden and her thoughts ran molten let love overflowshe gloried in the waste and let the lean years comeshe defied them today  oh hugh she faltered  my dearest he cried and would have seized her in his arms again but for a look of supplication that he had in him this innate and unsuspected chivalry filled her with an exquisite sweetness  you willprotect me she asked  with my life and with my honour he answered honora there will be no happiness like ours  i wish i knew she sighed and then her look returning from the veil rested on him with a tenderness that was inexpressible ii dont care hugh i trust you  the sun was setting slowly they went back together through the paths of the tangled garden which had doubtless seen many dramas and the courses changed of many lives overgrown and outworn now yet love was loth to leave it honora paused on the lawn before the house and looked back at him over her shoulder  how happy we could have been here in those days she sighed  we will be happier there he said  honora loved many times in her life had she believed herself to have had this sensation and yet had known nothing of these aches and ecstasies her mortal body unattended went out to dinner that evening never it is said was her success more pronounced the charm of randolph leffingwell which had fascinated the nobility of three kingdoms had descended on her and hostesses had discovered that she possessed the magic touch necessary to make a dinner complete her quality as we know was not wit it was something as old as the world as new as modern psychology it was in short the power to stimulate she infused a sense of wellbeing and ordinary people in her presence surprised themselves by saying clever things  lord ayllington a lean hardriding gentleman who was supposed to be on the verge of contracting an alliance with the eldest of the grenfell girls regretted that mrs spence was neither unmarried nor an heiress  you know he said to cecil grainger who happened to be gracing his wifes dinnerparty shes the sort of woman for whom a man might consent to live in venice  and shes the sort of woman replied a man couldnt get to go to venice  lord ayllingtons sigh was a proof of an intimate knowledge of the world  i suppose not he said its always so and there are few american women who would throw everything overboard for a grand passion  you ought to see her on the beach mr grainger suggested  i intend to said ayllington by the way not a few of your american women get divorced and keep their cake and eat it too its a bit difficult here at newport for a stranger you know  im willing to bet declared mr grainger that it doesnt pay when youre divorced and married again youve got to keep up appearancesthe first time you dont some of these people are working pretty hard  whereupon for the englishmans enlightenment he recounted a little gossip  this of course was in the smoking room in the drawingroom mrs graingers cousin did not escape and the biography was the subject of laughter  you see something of him i hear remarked mrs playfair a lady the deficiency of whose neck was supplied by jewels and whose conversation sounded like liquid coming out of an inverted bottle is he really serious about the biography  youll have to ask mr grainger replied honora  hugh ought to marry mrs grenfell observed  why did he come back inquired another who had just returned from a prolonged residence abroad was there a woman in the case  put it in the plural and youll be nearer right laughed mrs grenfell and added to honora youd best take care my dear hes dangerous  honora seemed to be looking down on them from a great height and to reginald farwell alone is due the discovery of this altitude his reputation for astuteness after that evening was secure he had sat next her and had merely put two and two togetheran operation that is probably at the root of most prophecies more than once that summer mr farwell had taken sketches down honoras lane for she was on what was known as his list of advisers a sheepfold of ewes some one had called it and he was always piqued when one of them went astray in addition to this intuition told him that he had taken the name of a deity in vainand that deity was chiltern these reflections resulted in another afterdinner conversation to which we are not supposed to listen  he found jerry shorter in a receptive mood and drew him into cecil graingers study where this latter gentleman when awake carried on his lifework of keeping a record of prize winners  i believe there is something between mrs spence and hugh chiltern after all jerry he said  by jinks you dont say so exclaimed mr shorter who had a profound respect for his friends diagnoses in these matters she was dazzling tonight and her eyes were like stars i passed her in the hall just now and i might as well have been in halifax  she fairly withered me when i made a little fun of chiltern declared farwell  i tell you what it is reggie remarked mr shorter with more frankness than tact you could talk architecture with em from now to christmas and nothingd happen but it would take an iceberg to write a book with hugh and see him alone six days out of seven chiltern knocks women into a cocked hat ive seen em stark raving crazy why there was that mrs slicer six or seven years agoyou rememberthat cecil grainger had such a deuce of a time with and there was mrs duttoni was a committee to see her when the old general was aliveto say nothing about a good many women you and i know  mr farwell nodded  im confoundedly sorry if its so mr shorter continued with sincerity she has a brilliant future ahead of her shes got good blood in her shes stunning to look at and shes made her own way in spite of that billycock of a husband who talks like the original rothschild by the bye wing is using him for a good thing hes sent him out west to pull that street railway chestnut out of the fire im not particularly squeamish reggie though i try to play the game straight myselfthe way my father played it but by the lord harry i cant see the difference between dick turpin and wing and trixy brent its hold and deliver with those fellows but if the police get anybody their get spence  the police never get anybody said farwell pessimistically for the change of topic bored him  no i suppose they dont answered mr shorter cheerfully finishing his chartreuse and fixing his eye on one of the coloured lithographs of lean horses on cecil graingers wall id talk to hugh if i wasnt as much afraid of him as of jim jeffries i dont want to see him ruin her career  why should an affair with him ruin it asked farwell unexpectedly there was constance witherspoon i understand that went pretty far  my dear boy said mr shorter its the women bessie grainger here for instanceshed go right up in the air and the women hadwell a childhoodinterest in constance selfpreservation is the first lawof women  they say hugh has changedthat he wants to settle down said farwell  if youd ever gone to church reggie said mr shorter youd know something about the limitations of the leopard     chapter vii liberty and the pursuit of happiness  that night was honoras soul played upon by the unknown musician of the sleepless hours now a mad ecstatic chorus dinned in her ears and set her blood coursing and again despair seized her with a dirge periods of semiconsciousness only came to her and from one of these she was suddenly startled into wakefulness by her own words i have the right to make of my life what i can but when she beheld the road of terrors that stretched between her and the shining places it seemed as though she would never have the courage to fare forth along its way to look back was to survey a prospect even more dreadful  the incidents of her life ranged by in procession not in natural sequence but a group here and a group there and it was given her for the first time to see many things clearly but now she loved god alone knew what she felt for this man and when she thought of him the very perils of her path were dwarfed on returning home that night she had given her maid her cloak and had stood for a long time immobilegazing at her image in the pierglass  madame est belle comme limperatrice dautriche said the maid at length  am i really beautiful mathilde  mathilde raised her eyes and hands to heaven in a gesture that admitted no doubt mathilde moreover could read a certain kind of history if the print were large enough  honora looked in the glass again yes she was beautiful he had found her so he had told her so and here was the testimony of her own eyes the bloom on the nectarines that came every morning from mr chamberlins greenhouse could not compare with the colour of her cheeks her hair was like the dusk her eyes like the blue pools among the rocks and touched now by the sun her neck and arms of the whiteness of seafoam it was meet that she should be thus for him and for the love he brought her  she turned suddenly to the maid  do you love me mathilde she asked  mathilde was not surprised she was on the contrary profoundly touched  how can madame ask she cried impulsively and seized honoras hand how was it possible to be near madame and not love her  and would you goanywhere with me  the scene came back to her in the night watches for the little maid had wept and vowed eternal fidelity  it was notuntil the first faint herald of the morning that honora could bring herself to pronounce the fateful thing that stood between her and happiness that threatened to mar the perfection of a heavenborn lovedivorce and thus having named it resolutely several times the demon of salvation began gradually to assume a kindly aspect that at times became almost benign in fact this one was not a demon at all but a liberator the demon she perceived stalked behind him and his name was notoriety it was he who would flay her for coquetting with the liberator  what if she were flayed once married to chiltern once embarked upon that life of usefulness once firmly established on ground of her own tilling and she was immune and this led her to a consideration of those she knew who had been flayed they were not few and a surfeit of publicity is a sufficient reason for not enumerating them here and during this process of exorcism notoriety became a bogey too he had been powerless to hurt them it must be true what chiltern had said that the world was changing the tragic and the ridiculous here joining hands she remembered that reggie farwell had told her that he had recently made a trip to western new york to inspect a house he had built for a remarried couple who were not wholly unknown the dovecote he had called it the man in his former marriage had been renowned all up and down tidewater as a rake and a brute and now it was an exception when he did not have at least one baby on his knee and he knew according to mr farwell more about infant diet than the whole staff of a maternity hospital  at length as she stared into the darkness dissolution came upon it the sills of her windows outlined themselves and a blurred foliage was sketched into the frame with a problem but half solved the day had surprised her she marvelled to see that it grew apace and presently arose to look out upon a stillness like that of eternity in the grey light the very leaves seemed to be holding their breath in expectancy of the thing that was to come presently the drooping roses raised their heads from pearl to silver grew the light and comparison ended the reds were aflame the greens resplendent the lawn sewn with the diamonds of the dew  a little travelling table was beside the window and honora took her pen and wrote     my dearest above all created things i love you morning has come    and it seems to me that i have travelled far since last i saw you    i have come to a new place which is neither hell nor heaven and in    the mystery of it youyou alone are real it is to your strength    that i cling and i know that you will not fail me     since i saw you hugh i have been through the valley of the    shadow i have thought of many things one truth alone is clear    that i love you transcendently you have touched and awakened me    into life i walk in a world unknown     there is the glory of martyrdom in this message i send you now    you must not come to me again until i send for you i cannot i    will not trust myself or you i will keep this love which has come    to me undefiled it has brought with it to me a new spirit a    spirit with a scorn for things base and mean though it were my    last chance in life i would not see you if you came if i thought    you would not understand what i feel i could not love you as i do     i will write to you again when i see my way more clearly i told    you in the garden before you spoke that i was going away do not    seek to know my plans for the sake of the years to come obey me                      honora  she reread the letter and sealed it a new and different exaltation had come to herbegotten perhaps in the act of writing a new courage filled her and now she contemplated the ordeal with a tranquillity that surprised her the disorder and chaos of the night were passed and she welcomed the coming day and those that were to follow it as though the fates were inclined to humour her impatience there was a telegram on her breakfast tray dated at new york and informing her that her husband would be in newport about the middle of the afternoon his western trip was finished a day earlier than he expected honora rang her bell  mathilde i am going away  oui madame  and i should like you to go with me  oui madame  it is only fair that you should understand mathilde i am going away alone i am notcoming back  the maids eyes filled with sudden tears  oh madame she cried in a burst of loyalty if madame will permit me to stay with her  honora was troubled but her strange calmness did not forsake her the morning was spent in packing which was a simple matter she took only such things as she needed and left her dinnergowns hanging in the closets a few precious books of her own she chose but the jewellery her husband had given her was put in boxes and laid upon the dressingtable in one of these boxes was her wedding ring when luncheon was over an astonished and perturbed butler packed the leffingwell silver and sent it off to storage  there had been but one interruption in honoras labours a note had arrivedfrom hima note and a box he would obey her she had known he would understand and respect her the more what would their love have been without that respect she shuddered to think and he sent her this ring as a token of that love as undying as the fire in its stones would she wear it that in her absence she might think of him honora kissed it and slipped it on her finger where it sparkled the letter was beneath her gown though she knew it by heart chiltern had gone at last he could not he said remain in newport and not see her  at midday she made but the pretence of a meal it was not until afterwards in wandering through the lower rooms of this house become so dear to her that agitation seized her and a desire to weep what was she leaving so precipitately and whither going the world indeed was wide and these rooms had been her home the day had grown bluegrey and in the dining room the gentle face seemed to look down upon her compassionately from the portrait the scent of the roses overpowered her as she listened no sound brake the quiet of the place  would howard never come the train was inhad been in ten minutes hark the sound of wheels her heart beating wildly she ran to the windows of the drawingroom and peered through the lilacs yes there he was ascending the steps  mrs spence is out i suppose she heard him say to the butler who followed with his bag  no sir shes is the drawingroom  the sight of him with his air of satisfaction and importance proved an unexpected tonic to her strength it was as though he had brought into the room marshalled behind him all the horrors of her marriage and she marvelled and shuddered anew at the thought of the years of that sufferance  well im back he said and weve made a great killing as i wrote you they were easier than i expected  he came forward for the usual perfunctory kiss but she recoiled and it was then that his eye seemed to grasp the significance of her travelling suit and veil and he glanced at her face  whats up where are you going he demanded has anything happened  everything she said and it was then suddenly that she felt the store of her resolution begin to ebb and she trembled howard i am going away  he stopped short and thrust his hands into the pockets of his checked trousers  going away he repeated where  i dont know said honora im going away  as though to cap the climax of tragedy he smiled as he produced his cigarette case and she was swept as it were by a scarlet flame that deprived her for the moment of speech  well he said complacently theres no accounting for women a case of nerveseh honora been hitting the pace a little too hard i guess he lighted a match blissfully unaware of the quality of her look all of us have to get toned up once in a while i need it myself ive had to drink a case of scotch whiskey out west to get this deal through now whats the name of that new boat with everything on her from a cafe to a stock exchange a german name  i dont know said honora she had answered automatically  to the imminent peril of one of the frailest of mrs forsythes chairs he sat down on it placed his hands on his knees flung back his head and blew the smoke towards the ceiling still she stared at him as in a state of semihypnosis  instead of going off to one of those thousanddollaraminute doctors let me prescribe for you he said ive handled some nervous men in my time and i guess nervous women arent much different youve had these little attacks before and they blow overdont they wing owes me a vacation if i do say it myself there are not five men in new york who would have pulled off this deal for him now the proposition i was going to make to you is this that we get cosey in a cabin de luxe on that german boat hire an automobile on the other side and do up europe its a sort of a handicap never to have been over there  oh youre making it very hard for me howard she cried i might have known that you couldnt understand that you never could understandwhy i am going away ive lived with you all this time and you do not know me any better than you knowthe scrubwoman im going away from youforever  in spite of herself she ended with an uncontrollable sob  forever he repeated but he continued to smoke and to look at her without any evidences of emotion very much as though he had received an ultimatum in a business transaction and then there crept into his expression something of a complacent pity that braced her to continue why he asked  becausebecause i dont love you because you dont love me you dont know what love isyou never will  but were married he said we get along all right  oh cant you see that that makes it all the worse she cried i can stand it no longer i cant live with youi wont live with you im of no use to youyoure sufficient unto yourself it was all a frightful mistake i brought nothing into your life and i take nothing out of it we are strangerswe have always been so i am not even your housekeeper your whole interest in life is in your business and you come home to read the newspapers and to sleep home the very word is a mockery if you had to choose between me and your business you wouldnt hesitate an instant and ii have been starved it isnt your fault perhaps that you dont understand that a woman needs something more than dinnergowns and jewels andand trips abroad her only possible compensation for living with a man is love loveand you havent the faintest conception of it it isnt your fault perhaps its my fault for marrying you i didnt know any better  she paused with her breast heaving he rose and walked over to the fireplace and flicked his ashes into it before he spoke his calmness maddened her  why didnt you say something about this before he asked  because i didnt know iti didnt realize ituntil now  when you married me he went on you had an idea that you were going to live in a house on fifth avenue with a ballroom didnt you  yes said honora i do not say i am not to blame i was a fool my standards were false in spite of the fact that my aunt and uncle are the most unworldly people that ever livedperhaps because of iti knew nothing of the values of life i have but one thing to say in my defence i thought i loved you and that you could give mewhat every woman needs  you were never satisfied from the first he retorted you wanted money and positiona mania with american women ive made a success that few men of my age can duplicate and even now you are not satisfied when i come back to tell you that i have money enough to snap my fingers at half these people you know  how asked honora how did you make it  what do you mean he asked  she turned away from him with a gesture of weariness  no you wouldnt understand that either howard  it was not until then that he showed feeling  somebody has been talking to you about this deal im not surprised a lot of these people are angry because we didnt let them in what have they been saying he demanded  her eyes flashed  nobody has spoken to me on the subject she said i only know what i have read and what you have told me in the first place you deceived the stockholders of these railways into believing their property was worthless and in the second place you intend to sell it to the public for much more than it is worth  at first he stared at her in surprise then he laughed  by george youd make something of a financier yourself honora he exclaimed and seeing that she did not answer continued well youve got it about right only its easier said than done it takes brains thats what business isa survival of the fittest if you dont do the other man hell do you he opened the cigarette case once more and now he said let me give you a little piece of advice its a good motto for a woman not to meddle with what doesnt concern her it isnt her business to make the money but to spend it and she can usually do that to the queens taste  a high ideal she exclaimed  you ought to have some notion of where that ideal came from he retorted you were all for getting rich in order to compete with these people now youve got what you want  and i am going to throw it away that is like a woman isnt it  he glanced at her and then at his watch  see here honora i ought to go over to mr wings i wired him id be there at fourthirty  dont let me keep you she replied  by gad you are pale he said whats got into the women these days they never used to have these confounded nerves well if you are bent on it i suppose theres no use trying to stop you go off somewhere and take a rest and when you come back youll see things differently  she held out her hand  goodby howard she said i wanted you to know that i didntbear you any illwillthat i blame myself as much as you more if anything i hope you will be happyi know you will but i must ask you to believe me when i say that i shant come back ii am leaving all the valuable things you gave me you will find them on my dressingtable and i wanted to tell you that my uncle sent me a little legacy from my fatheran unexpected onethat makes me independent  he did not take her hand but was staring at her now incredulously  you mean you are actually going he exclaimed  yes  butwhat shall i say to mr wing what will he think  despite the ache in her heart she smiled  does it make any difference what mr wing thinks she asked gently need he know isnt this a matter which concerns us alone i shall go off and after a certain time people will understand that i am not coming back  buthave you considered that it may interfere with my prospects he asked  why should it you are invaluable to mr wing he cant afford to dispense with your services just because you will be divorced that would be ridiculous some of his own associates are divorced  divorced he cried and she saw that he had grown pasty white on what grounds have you been  he did not finish  no she said you need fear no scandal there will be nothing in any way harmful to yourprospects  what can i do he said though more to himself than to her her quick ear detected in his voice a note of relief and yet he struck in her standing helplessly smoking in the middle of the floor chords of pity  you can do nothing howard she said if you lived with me from now to the millennium you couldnt make me love you nor could you love methe way i must be loved try to realize it the wrench is what you dread after it is over you will be much more contented much happier than you have been with me believe me  his next remark astonished her  whats the use of being so damned precipitate he demanded  precipitate  because i can stand it no longer i should go mad she answered  he took a turn up and down the room stopped suddenly and stared at her with eyes that had grown smaller suspicion is slow to seize the complacent was it possible that he had been supplanted  honora with an instinct of what was coming held up her head had he been angry had he been a man how much humiliation he would have spared her  so youre in love he said i might have known that something was at the bottom of this  she took account of and quivered at the many meanings behind his speechmeanings which he was too cowardly to voice in words  yes she answered i am in lovein love as i never hoped to beas i did not think it possible to be my love is such that i would go through hell fire for the sake of it i do not expect you to believe me when i tell you that such is not the reason why i am leaving you if you had loved me with the least spark of passion if i thought i were in the least bit needful to you as a woman and as a soul as a helper and a confidante instead of a mere puppet to advertise your prosperity this would notcould nothave happened i love a man who would give up the world for me tomorrow i have but one life to live and i am going to find happiness if i can  she paused afire with an eloquence that had come unsought but her husband only stared at her she was transformed beyond his recognition surely he had not married this woman and if the truth be told down in his secret soul whispered a small congratulatory voice although he did not yet fully realize it he was glad he had not  honora with an involuntary movement pressed her handkerchief to her eyes  goodby howard she said ii did not expect you to understand if i had stayed i should have made you miserably unhappy  he took her hand in a dazed manner as though he knew not in the least what he was doing he muttered something and found speech impossible he gulped once uncomfortably the english language had ceased to be a medium great is the force of habit in the emergency he reached for his cigarette case  honora had given orders that the carriage was to wait at the door the servants might suspect but that was all her maid had been discreet she drew down her veil as she descended the steps and told the coachman to drive to the station  it was raining leaning forward from under the hood as the horses started she took her last look at the lilacs     chapter viii in which the law betrays a heart  it was still raining when she got into a carriage at boston and drove under the elevated tracks through the narrow slippery business streets to the hotel from the windows of her room as the night fell she looked out across the dripping foliage of the common below her and robbed from that sacred ground were the little granite buildings that housed the entrances to the subway and for a long time she stood watching the people crowding into these most of them had homes to go to in the gathering gloom the arclights shone casting yellow streaks on the glistening pavement wagons and carriages plunged into the maelstrom at the corner pedestrians dodged and slipped lightnings flashed from overhead wires and clanging trolley cars pushed their greater bulk through the mass and presently the higher toned and more ominous bell of an ambulance sounded on its way to the scene of an accident  it was mathilde who ordered her dinner and pressed her to eat but she had no heart for food in her bright sittingroom with the shades tightly drawn an inexpressible loneliness assailed her a large engraving of a picture of a sentimental school hung on the wall she could not bear to look at it and yet her eyes from time to time were fatally drawn thither it was of a young girl taking leave of her lover in early christian times before entering the arena it haunted honora and wrought upon her imagination to such a pitch that she went into her bedroom to write  for a long time nothing more was written of the letter than dear uncle tom and aunt mary what to say to them     i do not know what you will think of me i do not know tonight    what to think of myself i have left howard it is not because he    was cruel to me or untrue he does not love me nor i him i    cannot expect you who have known the happiness of marriage to    realize the tortures of it without love my pain in telling you    this now is all the greater because i realize your belief as to the    sacredness of the tieand it is not your fault that you did not    instil that belief into me i have had to live and to think and to    suffer for myself i do not attempt to account for my action and i    hesitate to lay the blame upon the modern conditions and atmosphere    in which i lived for i feel that above all things i must be    honest with myself     my marriage with howard was a frightful mistake and i have grown    slowly to realize it until life with him became insupportable    since he does not love me since his one interest is his business    my departure makes no great difference to him     dear aunt mary and uncle tom i realize that i owe you much    everything that i am i do not expect you to understand or to    condone what i have done i only beg that you will continue to    love your niece                           honora  she tried to review this letter incoherent though it were and incomplete in her present state of mind she was able to add but a few words as a postscript i will write you my plans in a day or two when i see my way more clearly i would fly to youbut i cannot i am going to get a divorce  she sat for a time picturing the scene in the sittingroom when they should read it and a longing which was almost irresistible seized her to go back to that shelter one force alone held her in misery where she washer love for chiltern it drew her on to suffer the horrors of exile and publicity when she suffered most his image rose before her and she kissed the ring on her hand where was he now on this rainy night on the seas  at the thought she heard again the foghorns and the sirens  her sleep was fitful many times she went over again her talk with howard and she surprised herself by wondering what he had thought and felt since her departure and ever and anon she was startled out of chimerical dreams by the clamour of bellsthe trolley cars on their ceaseless round passing below at last came the slumber of exhaustion  it was nine oclock when she awoke and faced the distasteful task she had set herself for the day in her predicament she descended to the office where the face of one of the clerks attracted her and she waited until he was unoccupied  i should like you to tell methe name of some reputable lawyer she said  certainly mrs spence he replied and honora was startled at the sound of her name she might have realized that he would know her i suppose a young lawyer would doif the matter is not very important  oh no she cried blushing to her temples a young lawyer would do very well  the clerk reflected he glanced at honora again and later in the day she divined what had been going on in his mind  well he said there are a great many i happen to think of mr wentworth because he was in the hotel this morning he is in the tremont building  she thanked him hurriedly and was driven to the tremont building through the soggy street that faced the still dripping trees of the common mounting in the elevator she read on the glass door amongst the names of the four members of the firm that of alden wentworth and suddenly found herself face to face with the young man in his private office he was well groomed and deeply tanned and he rose to meet her with a smile that revealed a line of perfect white teeth  how do you do mrs spence he said i did not think when i met you at mrs grenfells that i should see you so soon in boston wont you sit down  honora sat down there seemed nothing else to do she remembered him perfectly now and she realized that the nimblewitted clerk had meant to send her to a gentleman  i thought she faltered i thought i was coming to aa stranger they gave me your address at the hotelwhen i asked for a lawyer  perhaps suggested mr wentworth delicately perhaps you would prefer to go to some one else i can give you any number of addresses if you like  she looked up at him gratefully he seemed very human and understandingvery honourable he belonged to her generation after all and she feared an older man  if you will be kind enough to listen to me i think i will stay here it is only a matter ofof knowledge of the law she looked at him again and the pathos of her smile went straight to his heart for mr wentworth possessed that organ although he did not wear it on his sleeve  he crossed the room closed the door and sat down beside her  anything i can do he said  she glanced at him once more helplessly  i do not know how to tell you she began it all seems so dreadful she paused but he had the lawyers gift of silenceof sympathetic silence i want to get a divorce from my husband  if mr wentworth was surprised he concealed it admirably his attitude of sympathy did not change but he managed to ask her in a businesslike tone which she welcomedon what grounds  i was going to ask you that question said honora  this time mr wentworth was surprisedgenuinely so and he showed it  but my dear mrs spence he protested you must remember thatthat i know nothing of the case  what are the grounds one can get divorced on she asked  he coloured a little under his tan  they are different in different states he replied i thinkperhapsthe best way would be to read you the massachusetts statutes  nowait a moment she said its very simple after all what i have to tell you i dont love my husband and he doesnt love me and it has become torture to live together i have left him with his knowledge and consent and he understands that i will get a divorce  mr wentworth appeared to be ponderingperhaps not wholly on the legal aspects of the case thus naively presented whatever may have been his private comments they were hidden he pronounced tentatively and a little absently the word desertion  if the case could possibly be construed as desertion on your husbands part you could probably get a divorce in three years in massachusetts  three years cried honora appalled i could never wait three years  she did not remark the young lawyers smile which revealed a greater knowledge of the world than one would have suspected he said nothing however  three years she repeated why it cant be mr wentworth there are the waterfordsshe was mrs boutwell you remember andand mrs rindgeit was scarcely a year before  he had the grace to nod gravely and to pretend not to notice the confusion in which she halted lawyers even young ones with white teeth and clear eyes are apt to be a little cynical he had doubtless seen from the beginning that there was a man in the background it was not his business to comment or to preach  some of the western states grant divorces onon much easier terms he said politely if you care to wait i will go into our library and look up the laws of those states  i wish you would answered honora i dont think i could bear to spend three years in suchin such an anomalous condition and at any rate i should much rather go west out of sight and have it all as quickly over with as possible  he bowed and departed on his quest and honora waited at moments growing hot at the recollection of her conversation with him whyshe asked herself should the law make it so difficult and subject her to such humiliation in a course which she felt to be right and natural and noble finally her thoughts becoming too painful she got up and looked out of the window and far below her through the mist she beheld the buryingground of bostons illustrious dead which her cabman had pointed out to her as he passed she did not hear the door open as mr wentworth returned and she started at the sound of his voice  i take it for granted that you are really serious in this matter mrs spence he said  oh she exclaimed  and that you have thoroughly reflected he continued imperturbably evidently in spite of the cold impartiality of the law a new england conscience had assailed him in the library i cannot take erthe responsibility of advising you as to a course of action you have asked me the laws of certain western states as to divorce i will read them  an office boy followed him deposited several volumes on the taule and mr wentworth read from them in a voice magnificently judicial  theres not much choice is there she faltered when he had finished  he smiled  as places of residence he began in an attempt to relieve the pathos  oh i didnt mean that she cried exile isis exile she flushed after a few moments of hesitation she named at random a state the laws of which required a six months residence she contemplated him i hardly dare to ask you to give me the name of some reputable lawyer out there  he had looked for an instant into her eyes men of the law are not invulnerable particularly at mr wentworths age and new england consciences to the contrary notwithstanding in spite of himself her eyes had made him a partisan an accomplice he told himself afterwards  really mrs spence he began and caught another appealing look he remembered the husband now and a lecture on finance in the grenfell smoking room which howard spence had delivered and which had grated on boston sensibility it is only right to tell you that our firm does notdoes nottake divorce casesas a rule not that we are taking this one he added hurriedly but as a friend  oh thank you said honora  merely as a friend who would be glad to do you a service he continued i will during the day try to get you the name ofof as reputable a lawyer as possible in that place  and mr wentworth paused as red as though he had asked her to marry him  how good of you she cried i shall be at the touraine until this evening  he escorted her through the corridor bowed her into the elevator and her spirits had risen perceptibly as she got into her cab and returned to the hotel there she studied railroad folders one confidant was enough and she dared not even ask the head porter the way to a locality whereit was well knowndivorces were sold across a counter and as she worked over the intricacies of this problem the word her husband had applied to her action recurred to herprecipitate no doubt mr wentworth too had thought her precipitate nearly every important act of her life had been precipitate but she was conscious in this instance of no regret delay she felt would have killed her let her exile begin at once  she had scarcely finished luncheon when mr wentworth was announced for reasons best known to himself he had come in person and he handed her written on a card the name of the honourable david beckwith  ill have to confess i dont know much about him mrs spence he said except that he has been in congress and is one of the prominent lawyers of that state  the gift of enlisting sympathy and assistance was peculiarly honoras and if some one had predicted that morning to mr wentworth that before nightfall he would not only have put a lady in distress on the highroad to obtaining a western divorce which he had hitherto looked upon as disgraceful but that likewise he would miss his train for prides crossing buy the ladys tickets and see her off at the south station for chicago he would have regarded the prophet as a lunatic but that is precisely what mr wentworth did and when as her train pulled out honora bade him goodby she felt the tug at her heartstrings which comes at parting with an old friend  and anything i can do for you here in the east whilewhile you are out there be sure to let me know he said  she promised and waved at him from the platform as he stood motionless staring after her romance had spent a whole day in boston and with mr alden wentworth of all people  fortunately for the sanity of the human race the tension of grief is variable honora closed in her stateroom eased herself that night by writing a long if somewhat undecipherable letter to chiltern and was able the next day to read the greater portion of a novel it was only when she arrived in chicago after nightfall that loneliness again assailed her she was within nine hoursso the timetable saidof st louis of all her trials the homesickness which she experienced as she drove through the deserted streets of the metropolis of the middle west was perhaps the worst a great city on sunday night what traveller has not felt the depressing effect of it and so far as the incoming traveller is concerned chicago does not put her best foot forward the way from the station to the auditorium hotel was hacked and bruisedso it seemedby the cruel battle of trade and she stared in a kind of fascination that increased the ache in her heart at the ugliness and cruelty of the twentieth century  to have imagination is unquestionably to possess a great capacity for suffering and honora was paying the penalty for hers it ran riot now the huge buildings towered like formless monsters against the blackness of the sky under the sickly blue of the electric lights across the dirty footscarred pavements strange black human figures seemed to wander aimlessly an elevated train thundered overhead and presently she found herself the tenant of two rooms in that vast refuge of the homeless the modern hotel where she sat until the small hours looking down upon the myriad lights of the shore front and out beyond them on the black waters of an inland sea           from newport to salomon city in a state not far from the pacific tier is something of a transition in less than a week though in modern life we should be surprised at nothing limited trains are wonderful enough but what shall be said of the modern mind that travels faster than light and much too fast for the pages of a chronicle martha washington and the good ladies of her acquaintance knew nothing about the upper waters of the missouri and the words for better for worse for richer for poorer were not merely literature to them  nous avons change tout cela although there are yet certain crudities to be eliminated in these enlightened times if in one week a lady is not entirely at home with husband number one in the next week she may have travelled in comparative comfort some twothirds across a continent and be on the highroad to husband number two why travel why have to put up with all this useless expense and worry and waste of time why not have ones divorce sent cod to ones door or establish a new branch of the postoffice department american enterprise has surely lagged in this  seated in a plushcovered rockingchair that rocked on a track of its own and thus saved the yellowandred hotel carpet the honourable dave beckwith patiently explained the vexatious process demanded by his particular sovereign state before she should consent to cut the gordian knot of marriage and his statethe honourable dave remarkedwas in the very forefront of enlightenment in this respect practically all that she demanded was that ladies in mrs spences predicament should become pro tempore her citizens married misery did not exist in the honourable daves state amongst her own bona fide citizens and by a wise provision in the constitution of our glorious american union no one state could tie the nuptial knot so tight that another state could not cut it at a blow  six months residence and a whole year before the divorce could be granted honora looked at the plush rockingchair the yellowandred carpet the inevitable icewater on the marbletopped table and the picture of a lady the shape of a liqueur bottle playing tennis in the late eighties and sighed for one who is sensitive to surroundings that room was a torture chamber  but mr beckwith she exclaimed i never could spend a year here isnt there ahouse i could get that is aa littlea little better furnished and then there is a certain publicity about staying at a hotel  the honourable dave might have been justly called the friend of ladies in a temporary condition of loneliness his mission in life was not merely that of a liberator but his natural goodness led him to perform a hundred acts of kindness to make as comfortable as possible the purgatory of the unfortunates under his charge he was a man of a remarkable appearance and not to be lightly forgotten his hair above all fascinated honora and she found her eyes continually returning to it so incredibly short it was and so incredibly stiff that it reminded her of the needle points on the cylinder of an oldfashioned musicbox and she wondered if it were properly inserted what would be the resultant melody  the honourable daves head was like a cannonball painted white across the top of it a blemish that would undoubtedly have spoiled the tune was a long scara relic of one of the gentlemans many personal difficulties he who made the sear honora reflected must have been a strong man the honourable dave indeed had fought his way upward through life to the congress of the united states and many were the harrowing tales of frontier life he told honora in the long winter evenings when the blizzards came down the river valley they would fill a book unfortunately not this book the growing responsibilities of taking care of the lonely ladies that came in increasing numbers to salomon city from the effeter portions of the continent had at length compelled him to give up his congressional career the honourable dave was unmarried and he told honora not likely to become so he was thus at once human and invulnerable a high priest dedicated to freedom  it is needless to say that the plush rockingchair and the picture of the liqueurbottle lady did not jar on his sensibilities like an eminent physician who has never himself experienced neurosis the honourable dave firmly believed that he understood the trouble from which his client was suffering he had seen many cases of it in ladies from the atlantic coast the first had surprised him no doubt salomon city though it contained the great boon was not esthetic being a keen student of human nature he rightly supposed that she would not care to join the colony but he thought it his duty to mention that there was a colony  honora repeated the word  out there he said waving his cigar to the westward some of the ladies have ranches some of the gentlemen too he added for it appeared that exiles were not confined to one sex its sociala little too social i guess declared mr beckwith for you a delicate compliment of differentiation that honora accepted gravely theyve got a casino and they burn a good deal of electricity first and last they dont bother salomon city much once in a while in the winter they come in a bunch to the theatre soon as i looked at you i knew you wouldnt want to go there  her exclamation was sufficiently eloquent  ive got just the thing for you he said it looks a little as if i was reaching out into the sanitarium business are you acquainted by any chance with mrs boutwell who married a fellow named waterford he asked taking momentarily out of his mouth the cigar he was smoking by permission  honora confessed with no great enthusiasm that she knew the present mrs waterford not the least of her tribulations had been to listen to a partial recapitulation by the honourable dave of the ladies he had assisted to a transfer of husbands what indeed had these ladies to do with her she felt that the very mention of them tended to soil the pure garments of her martyrdom  what i was going to say was this the honourable dave continued mrs boutwellthat is to say mrs waterfordcouldnt stand this hotel any more than you and she felt like you do about the colony so she rented a little house up on wylie street and furnished it from the east i took the furniture off her hands its still in the house by the way which hasnt been rented for i figured it out that another lady would be coming along with the same notions now you can look at the house any time you like  although she had to overcome the distaste of its antecedents the house or rather the furniture was too much of a find in salomon city to be resisted it had but six rooms and was of wood and painted grey like its twin beside it but mrs waterford had removed the stainedglass windowlights in the front door deftly hidden the highly ornamental steam radiators and made other eliminations and improvements including the white bookshelves that still contained the ladys winter reading fifty or more yellowandgreenbacked french novels and plays honoras first care after taking possession was to order her maid to remove these from her sight but it is to be feared that they found their way directly to mathildes room honora would have liked to fumigate the house and yet at the same time she thanked her stars for it mr beekwith obligingly found her a cook and on thursday evening she sat down to supper in her tiny dining room she had found a temporary haven at last  suddenly she remembered that it was an anniversary one week ago that day in the old garden at beaulieu had occurred the momentous event that had changed the current of her life     chapter ix wylie street  there was a little spindlesupported porch before honoras front door and had she chosen she might have followed the example of her neighbours and sat there in the evenings she preferred to watch the life about her from the windowseat in the little parlour the word exile suggests perhaps to those who have never tried it empty wastes isolation loneliness she had been prepared for these things and wylie street was a shock to her in sending her there at this crisis in her life fate had perpetrated nothing less than a huge practical joke next door for instance in the twin house to hers flaunted in the face of liberal divorce laws was a young couple with five children honora counted them from the eldest ones that ran over her little grass plot on their way to and from the public school to the youngest that spent much of his time gazing skyward from a perambulator on the sidewalk six days of the week about six oclock in the evening there was a celebration in the family father came home from work he was a smoothfaced young man whom a fortnight in the woods might have helped wonderfullya clerk in the big department store  he radiated happiness when opposite honoras front door he would open his armsthe signal for a race across her lawn sometimes it was the little girl with pigtails the colour of pulled molasses candy who won the prize of the first kiss again it was her brother a year her junior and when he was raised it was seen that the seat of his trousers was obviously double but each of the five received a reward and the baby was invariably lifted out of the perambulator and finally there was a conjugal kiss on the spindled porch  the wife was a rolypoly little body in the mornings at the side windows honora heard her singing as she worked and sometimes the sun struck with a blinding flash the pan she was in the act of shining and one day she looked up and nodded and smiled strange indeed was the effect upon our heroine of that greeting it amazed honora herself a strange current ran through her and left her hot and even as she smiled and nodded back unbidden tears rose scalding to her eyes what was it why was it  she went downstairs to the little bookcase filled now with volumes that were not trash for hughs sake she would try to improve herself this winter by reading serious things but between her eyes and the book was the little womans smile a month before at newport how little she would have valued it  one morning as honora was starting out for her lonely walkthat usually led her to the bare clay banks of the great rivershe ran across her neighbour on the sidewalk the little woman was settling the baby for his airing and she gave honora the same dazzling smile  good morning mrs spence she said  good morning replied honora and in her strange confusion she leaned over the carriage oh what a beautiful baby  isnt he cried the little woman of all of em i think hes the prize his father says so i guess she added i guess it was because i didnt know so much about em when they first began to come you take my word for it the best way is to leave em alone dont dandle em its hard to keep your hands off em but its right  im sure of it said honora who was very red  they made a strange contrast as they stood on that new street with its new vitrified brick paving and white stone curbs and new little trees set out in front of new little houses mrs mayo for such honoras cook had informed her was her name in a housekeepers apron and a shirtwaist and honora almost a head taller in a walking costume of dark grey that would have done justice to fifth avenue the admiration in the little womans eyes was undisguised  youre getting a bill i hear she said after a moment  a bill repeated honora  a bill of divorce explained mrs mayo  honora was conscious of conflicting emotions astonishment resentment andmost curiouslyof relief that the little woman knew it  yes she answered  but mrs mayo did not appear to notice or resent her brevity  i took a fancy to you the minute i saw you she said i cant say as much for the other easterner that was here last year but i made up my mind that it must be a mighty mean man who would treat you badly  honora stood as though rooted to the pavement she found a reply impossible  when i think of my luck her neighbour continued im almost ashamed we were married on fifteen dollars a week of course there have been trials we must always expect that and weve had to work hard butit hasnt hurt us she paused and looked up at honora and added contritely there i shouldnt have said anything its mean of me to talk of my happiness ill drop in some afternoonif youll let mewhen i get through my work said the little woman  i wish you would replied honora  she had much to think of on her walk that morning and new resolutions to make here was happiness growing and thriving so far as she could see without any of that rarer nourishment she had once thought so necessary and she had come two thousand miles to behold it  she walked many miles as a part of the regimen and discipline to which she had set herself her haunting horror in this place as she thought of the colony of which mr beckwith had spoken and of mrs boutwells row of french novels was degeneration she was resolved to return to chiltern a better and a wiser and a truer woman unstained by the ordeal at the outskirts of the town she halted by the rivers bank breathing deeply of the pure air of the vast plains that surrounded her  she was seated that afternoon at her desk in the sittingroom upstairs when she heard the tinkle of the doorbell and remembered her neighbours promise to call with something of a pang she pushed back her chair since the episode of the morning the friendship of the little woman had grown to have a definite value for it was no small thing in honoras situation to feel the presence of a warm heart next door all day she had been thinking of mrs mayo and her strange happiness and longing to talk with her again and dreading it and while she was bracing herself for the trial mathilde entered with a card  tell mrs mayo i shall be down in a minute she said  it was not a lady mathilde replied but a monsieur  honora took the card for a long time she sat staring at it while mathilde waited it read               mr peter erwin  madame will see monsieur  a great sculptor once said to the statesman who was to be his model wear your old coat there is as much of a man in the back of his old coat i think as there is in his face as honora halted on the threshold peter was standing looking out of the fivefoot plateglass window and his back was to her  she was suddenly stricken not since she had been a child not even in the weeks just passed had she felt that pain and as a child selfpity seized heras a lost child when darkness is setting in and the will fails and distance appalls scalding tears welled into her eyes as she seized the frame of the door but it must have been her breathing that he heard he turned and crossed the room to her as she had known he would and she clung to him as she had so often done in days gone by when hurt and bruised he had rescued and soothed her for the moment the delusion that his power was still limitless prevailed and her faith whole again so many times had he mended a world all awry  he led her to the windowseat and gently disengaged her hands from his shoulders and took one of them and held it between his own he did not speak for his was a rare intuition and gradually her hand ceased to tremble and the uncontrollable sobs that shook her became less frequent  why did you come why did you come she cried  to see you honora  but you might havewarned me  yes he said its true i might  she drew her hand away and gazed steadfastly at his face  why arent you angry she said you dont believe in what i have doneyou dont sympathize with ityou dont understand it  i have come here to try he said  she shook her head  you cantyou cantyou never could  perhaps he answered it may not be so difficult as you think  grown calmer she considered this what did he mean by it to imply a knowledge of herself  it will be useless she said inconsequently  no he said it will not be useless  she considered this also and took the broader meaning that such acts are not wasted  what do you intend to try to do she asked  he smiled a little  to listen to as much as you care to tell me honora  she looked at him again and an errant thought slipped in between her larger anxieties wherever he went how extraordinarily he seemed to harmonize with his surroundings at silverdale and in the drawingroom of the new york house and in the little parlour in this far western town what was it his permanence was it his power she felt that but it was a strange kind of powernot like other mens she felt as she sat there beside him that his was a power more difficult to combat that to defeat it was at once to make it stronger and to grow weaker she summoned her pride she summoned her wrongs she summoned the ego which had winged its triumphant flight far above his kindly disapproving eye he had the ability to make her taste defeat in the very hour of victory and she knew that when she fell he would be there in his strength to lift her up  diddid they tell you to come she asked  there was no question of that honora i was away whenwhen they learned you were here as soon as i returned i came  tell me how they feel she said in a low voice  they think only of you and the thought that you are unhappy overshadows all others they believe that it is to them you should have come if you were in trouble instead of coming here  how could i she cried how can you ask that is what makes it so hard that i cannot be with them now but i should only have made them still more unhappy if i had gone they would not have understoodthey cannot understand who have every reason to believe in marriage why those to whom it has been a mockery and a torture should be driven to divorce  why divorce he said  do you meando you mean that you wish me to give you the reasons why i felt justified in leaving my husband  not unless you care to he replied i have no right to demand them i only ask you to remember honora that you have not explained these reasons very clearly in your letters to your aunt and uncle they do not understand them your uncle was unable on many accounts to come here and he thought thatthat as an old friend you might be willing to talk to me  i cant live withwith my husband she cried i dont love him and he doesnt love me he doesnt know what love is  peter erwin glanced at her but she was too absorbed then to see the thing in his eyes he made no comment  we havent the same tastes nornor the same way of looking at thingsthe same views about making moneyfor instance we became absolute strangers what more is there to say she added a little defiantly  your husband committed noflagrant offence against you he inquired  that would have made him human at least she cried it would have proved that he could feelsomething no all he cares for in the world is to make money and he doesnt care how he makes it no woman with an atom of soul can live with a man like that  if peter erwin deemed this statement a trifle revolutionary he did not say so  so you justleft him he said  yes said honora he didnt care he was rather relieved than otherwise if i had lived with him till i died i couldnt have made him happy  you tried and failed said peter  she flushed  i couldnt have made him happier she declared correcting herself he has no conception of what real happiness is he thinks he is happyhe doesnt need me hell be much morecontented without me i have nothing against him i was to blame for marrying him i know but i have only one life to live and i cant throw it away peter i cant and i cant believe that a woman and a man were intended to live together without love it is too horrible surely that isnt your idea of marriage  my idea of marriage isnt worth very much im afraid he said if i talked about it i should have to confine myself to theories andand dreams  the moment i saw your card peter i knew why you had come here she said trying to steady her voice it was to induce me to go back to my husband you dont know how it hurts me to give you pain i love youi love you as i love uncle tom and aunt mary you are a part of me but oh you cant understand i knew you could not you have never made any mistakesyou have never lived it is useless i wont go back to him if you stayed here for weeks you could not make me change my mind  he was silent  you think that i could have preventedthis if i had been less selfish she said  where you are concerned honora i have but one desire he answered and that is to see you happyin the best sense of the term if i could induce you to go back and give your husband another trial i should return with a lighter heart you ask me whether i think you have been selfish i answer frankly that i think you have i dont pretend to say your husband has not been selfish also neither of you have ever tried apparently to make your marriage a success it cant be done without an honest effort you have abandoned the most serious and sacred enterprise in the world as lightly as though it had been a piece of embroidery all that i can gather from your remarks is that you have left your husband because you have grown tired of him  yes said honora and you can never realize how tired unless you knew him as i did when love dies it turns into hate  he rose and walked to the other end of the room and turned  could you be induced he said for the sake of your aunt and uncle if not for your own to consider a legal separation  for an instant she stared at him hopelessly and then she buried her face in her hands  no she cried no i couldnt you dont know what you ask  he went to her and laid his hand lightly on her shoulder  i think i do he said  there was a moments tense silence and then she got to her feet and looked at him proudly  yes she cried it is true and i am not ashamed of it i have discovered what love is and what life is and i am going to take them while i can  she saw the blood slowly leave his face and his hands tighten it was not until then that she guessed at the depth of his wound and knew that it was unhealed for him had been reserved this supreme irony that he should come here to plead for her husband and learn from her own lips that she loved another man she was suddenly filled with awe though he turned away from her that she might not see his face and she sought in vain for words she touched his hand fearfully and now it was he who trembled  peter she exclaimed why do you bother with me ii am what i am i cant help it i was made so i cannot tell you that i am sorry for what i have donefor what i am going to do i will not lie to youand you forced me to speak i know that you dont understand and that i caused you pain and that i shall causethem pain it may be selfishnessi dont know god alone knows whatever it is it is stronger than i it is what i am though i were to be thrown into eternal fire i would not renounce it  she looked at him again and her breath caught while she had been speaking he had changed there was a fire in his eyes she had never seen before in all the years she had known him  honora he said quietly the man who has done this is a scoundrel  she stared at him doubting her senses her pupils wide with terror  how dare you peter how dare you she cried  i dare to speak the truth he said and crossed the room to where his hat was lying and picked it up she watched him as in a trance then he came back to her  some day perhaps you will forgive me for saying that honora i hope that day will come although i shall never regret having said it i have caused you pain sometimes it seems pain is unavoidable i hope you will remember that with the exception of your aunt and uncle you have no better friend than i nothing can alter that friendship wherever you go whatever you do goodby  he caught her hand held it for a moment in his own and the door had closed before she realized that he had gone for a few moments she stood motionless where he had left her and then she went slowly up the stairs to her own room     chapter x the price of freedom  had he hugh chiltern been anathematized from all the high pulpits of the world honoras belief in him could not have been shaken ivanhoe and the knights of the round table to the contrary there is no chivalry so exalted as that of a woman who loves no courage higher no endurance greater her knowledge is complete and hers the supreme faith that is unmoved by calumny and unbelief she alone knows the old chiltern did not belong to her hers was the new man sprung undefiled from the sacred fire of their love and in that fire she too had been born again petereven peter had no power to share such a faith though what he had said of chiltern had wounded herwounded her because peter of all others should misjudge and condemn him sometimes she drew consolation from the thought that peter had never seen him but she knew he could not understand him or her or what they had passed through that kind of understanding comes alone through experience  in the long days that followed she thought much about peter and failed to comprehend her feelings towards him she told herself that she ought to hate him for what he had so cruelly said and at times indeed her resentment was akin to hatred again his face rose before her as she had seen it when he had left her and she was swept by an incomprehensible wave of tenderness and reverence and yetparadox of paradoxeschiltern possessed her  on the days when his letters came it was as his emissary that the sun shone to give her light in darkness and she went about the house with a song on her lips they were filled these letters with an elixir of which she drank thirstily to behold visions and the weariness of her exile fell away the elixir of high purpose never was love on such a plane he lifting herno marvel in this and sheby a magic power of levitation at which she never ceased to wondersustaining him by her aid he would make something of himself which would be worthy of her at last he had the incentive to enable him to take his place in the world he pictured their future life at grenoble until her heart was strained with yearning for it to begin here would be dutylet him who would gainsay it duty and love combined with a wondrous happiness he at a mans labour she at a womans labour not for themselves alone but for others a paradise such as never was heard ofa godfearing paradise and the reward of courage  he told her he could not go to grenoble now and begin the life without her until that blessed time he would remain a wanderer avoiding the haunts of men first he had cruised in the folly and then camped and shot in canada and again as winter drew on apace had chartered another yacht a larger one and sailed away for the west indies whence the letters came stamped in strange ports and sometimes as many as five together he too was in exile until his regeneration should begin  well he might be at such a time one bright day in early winter honora returning from her walk across the bleak plains in the hope of letters found newspapers and periodicals instead addressed in an unknown hand it matters not whose hand honora never sought to know she had long regarded as inevitable this acutest phase of her martyrdom and the long nights of tears when entire paragraphs of the loathed stuff she had burned ran ceaselessly in her mind would she had burned it before reading it an insensate curiosity had seized her and she had read and read again until it was beyond the reach of fire  save for its effect upon honora it is immaterial to this chronicle it was merely the heaviest of her heavy payments for liberty but what she asked herself shamefully would be its effect upon chiltern her face burned that she should doubt his loyalty and love and yetthe question returned there had been a sketch of howard dwelling upon the prominence into which he had sprung through his connection with mr wing there had been a sketch of her and how she had taken what the writer was pleased to call society by storm it had been intimated with a cruelty known only to writers of such paragraphs that ambition to marry a chiltern had been her motive there had been a sketch of chilterns career in carefully veiled but thoroughly comprehensible language which might have made a bluebeard shudder this of course she bore best of all or let it be said rather that it cost her the least suffering was it not she who had changed and redeemed him  what tortured her most was the intimation that chilterns family connections were bringing pressure to bear upon him to save him from this supremest of all his follies and when she thought of this the strange eyes and baffling expression of mrs grainger rose before her was it true and if true would chiltern resist even as she honora had resisted loyally might this love for her not be another of his mad caprices  how honora hated herself for the thought that thus insistently returned at this period of snows and blasts it was january had he seen the newspapers he had not for he was cruising he had for of course they had been sent him and he must have received from his relatives protesting letters a fortnight passed and her mail contained nothing from him perhaps something had happened to his yacht visions of shipwreck cause her to scan the newspapers for storms at seabut the shipwreck that haunted her most was that of her happiness how easy it is to doubt in exile with happiness so far away one morning when the wind dashed the snow against her windows she found it impossible to rise  if the big doctor suspected the cause of her illness mathilde knew it the maid tended her day and night and sought with the tact of her nation to console and reassure her the little woman next door came and sat by her bedside cruel and infinitely happy little woman filled with compassion who brought delicacies in the making of which she had spent precious hours and which honora could not eat the lord when he had made mrs mayo had mercifully withheld the gift of imagination one topic filled her she lived to one end her alpha and omega were husband and children and she talked continually of their goodness and badness of their illnesses of their health of their likes and dislikes of their accomplishments and defects until one day a surprising thing happened surprising for mrs mayo  oh dont cried honora suddenly oh dont i cant bear it  what is it cried mrs mayo frightened out of her wits a turn shall i telephone for the doctor  no relied honora butbut i cant talk any moretoday  she apologized on the morrow as she held mrs mayos hand itit was your happiness she said i was unstrung i couldnt listen to it forgive me  the little woman burst into tears and kissed her as she sat in bed  forgive you deary she cried i never thought  it has been so easy for you honora faltered  yes it has i ought to thank god and i doevery night  she looked long and earnestly through her tears at the young lady from the far away east as she lay against the lace pillows her paleness enhanced by the pink gown her dark hair in two great braids on her shoulders  and to think how pretty you are she exclaimed  it was thus she expressed her opinion of mankind in general outside of her own family circle once she had passionately desired beauty the high school and the story of helen of troy notwithstanding now she began to look at it askance as a fatal gift and to pity rather than envy its possessors  as a byindustry mrs mayo raised geraniums and carnations in her front cellar near the furnace and once in a while peggy with the pulledmolasses hair or chubby abraham lincoln would come puffing up honoras stairs under the weight of a flowerpot and deposit it triumphantly on the table at honoras bedside abraham lincoln did not object to being kissed he had at least grown to accept the process as one of the unaccountable mysteries of life but something happened to him one afternoon on the occasion of his giving proof of an intellect which may eventually bring him in the footsteps of his great namesake to the white house entering honoras front door he saw on the hall table a number of letters which the cook not gifted with his brains had left there he seized them in one fat hand while with the other he hugged the flowerpot to his breast mounted the steps and arrived breathless but radiant on the threshold of the beautiful ladys room and there calamity overtook him in the shape of one of the thousand articles which are left on the floor purposely to trip up little boys  great was the disaster letters geranium pieces of flowerpot a quantity of black earth and a howling abraham lincoln bestrewed the floor and similar episodes in his brief experience with this world had not brought rewards it was from sheer amazement that his tears ceased to flowamazement and lack of breathfor the beautiful lady sprang up and seized him in her arms and called mathilde who eventually brought a white and gold box and while abraham sat consuming its contents in ecstasy he suddenly realized that the beautiful lady had forgotten him she had picked up the letters every one and stood reading them with parted lips and staring eyes  it was mathilde who saved him from a violent illness closing the box and leading him downstairs and whispered something incomprehensible in his ear as she pointed him homeward  le vrai medecincest toi mon mignon  there was a reason why chilterns letters had not arrived and great were honoras selfreproach and penitence with a party of englishmen he had gone up into the interior of a central american country to visit some famous ruins he sent her photographs of them and of the englishmen and of himself yes he had seen the newspapers if she had not seen them she was not to read them if they came to her and if she had she was to remember that their love was too sacred to be soiled and too perfect to be troubled as for himself as she knew he was a changed man who thought of his former life with loathing she had made him clean and filled him with a new strength  the winter passed the last snow melted on the little grass plot which changed by patches from brown to emerald green and the children ran over it again and tracked it in the soft places but honora only smiled warm still days were interspersed between the windy ones when the sky was turquoise blue when the very river banks were steeped in new colours when the distant shadowy mountains became real liberty ran riot within her if he thought with loathing on his former life so did she only a year ago she had been penned up in a new york street in that prisonhouse of her own making hemmed in by surroundings which she had now learned to detest from her soul  a few more penalties remained to be paid and the heaviest of these was her letter to her aunt and uncle even as they had accepted other things in life so had they accepted the hardest of all to bearhonoras divorce a memorable letter her uncle tom had written her after peters return to tell them that remonstrances were useless she was their daughter in all but name and they would not forsake her when she should have obtained her divorce she should go back to them their house which had been her home should always remain so honora wept and pondered long over that letter should she write and tell them the truth as she had told peter it was not because she was ashamed of the truth that she had kept it from them throughout the winter it was because she wished to spare them as long as possible cruellest circumstance of all that a love so divine as hers should not be understood by them and should cause them infinite pain  the weeks and months slipped by their letters after that first one were such as she had always received from them accounts of the weather and of the doings of her friends at home but now the time was at hand when she must prepare them for her marriage with chiltern for they would expect her in st louis and she could not go there and if she wrote them they might try to stop the marriage or at least to delay it for some years  was it possible that a lingering doubt remained in her mind that to postpone her happiness would perhaps be to lose it in her exile she had learned enough to know that a divorced woman is like a rudderless ship at sea at the mercy of wind and wave and current she could not go back to her life in st louis her situation there would be unbearable her friends would not be the same friends no she had crossed her rubicon and destroyed the bridge deep within her she felt that delay would be fatal both to her and chiltern long enough had the banner of their love been trailed in the dust  summer came again with its anniversaries and its dragging interminable weeks demoralizing summer when mrs mayo quite frankly appeared at her side window in a dressing sacque and honora longed to do the same but time never stands absolutely still and the day arrived when mr beckwith called in a carriage honora with an audibly beating heart got into it and they drove down town past the department store where mr mayo spent his days and new blocks of banks and business houses that flanked the wide street where the roaring and clanging of the ubiquitous trolley cars resounded  honora could not define her sensationsexcitement and shame and fear and hope and joy were so commingled the colours of the red and yellow brick had never been so brilliant in the sunshine they stopped before the new courthouse and climbed the granite steps in her sensitive state honora thought that some of the people paused to look after them and that some were smiling one woman she thought looked compassionate within they crossed the marble pavement the honourable dave handed her into an elevator and when it stopped she followed him as in a dream to an oakpanelled door marked with a legend she did not read within was an office with leather chairs a large oak desk a spittoon and portraits of grave legal gentlemen on the wall  this is judge whitmans office explained the honourable dave hell let you stay here until the case is called  is he the judgebefore whomthe case is to be tried asked honora  he surely is answered the honourable dave whitmans a good friend of mine in fact i may say without exaggeration i had something to do with his election now you mustnt get flustered he added it isnt anything like as bad as goin to the dentist it dont amount to shucks as we used to say in missouri  with these cheerful words of encouragement he slipped out of a side door into what was evidently the court room for honora heard a droning after a long interval he reappeared and beckoned her with a crooked finger she arose and followed him into the court room  all was bustle and confusion there and her counsel whispered that they were breaking up for the day the judge was stretching himself several men who must have been lawyers and with whom mr beckwith was exchanging amenities behind the railing were arranging their books and papers some of the people were leaving and others talking in groups about the room the honourable dave whispered to the judge a tall lank cadaverous gentleman with irongrey hair who nodded honora was led forward the honourable dave standing very close to the judge and some distance from her read in a low voice something that she could not catchsupposedly the petition it was all quite as vague to honora as the trial of the jack of hearts the buzzing of the groups still continued around the court room and nobody appeared in the least interested this was a comfort though it robbed the ceremony of all vestige of reality it seemed incredible that the majestic and awful institution of the ages could be dissolved with no smoke or fire with such infinite indifference and so much spitting what was the use of all the pomp and circumstance and ceremony to tie the knot if it could be cut in the routine of a days business  the solemn fact that she was being put under oath meant nothing to her this too was slurred and mumbled she found herself trembling answering questions now from her counsel now from the judge and it is to be doubted to this day whether either heard her answers most convenient and considerate questions they were when and where she was married how long she had lived with her husband what happened when they ceased to live together and had he failed ever since to contribute to her support mercifully mr beckwith was in the habit of coaching his words beforehand a reputable citizen of salomon city was produced to prove her residence and somebody cried out something not loudly in which she heard the name of spence mentioned twice the judge said take your decree and picked up a roll of papers and walked away her knees became weak she looked around her dizzily and beheld the triumphant professional smile of the honourable dave beckwith  it didnt hurt much did it he asked allow me to congratulate you  is itis it all over she said quite dazed  just like that he said youre free  free the word rang in her ears as she drove back to the little house that had been her home the honourable dave lifted his felt hat as he handed her out of the carriage and said he would call again in the evening to see if he could do anything further for her mathilde who had been watching from the window opened the door and led her mistress into the parlour  itsits all over mathilde she said  mon dieu madame said mathilde cest simple comme bonjour     volume 7     chapter xi in which it is all done over again  all morning she had gazed on the shining reaches of the hudson their colour deepening to blue as she neared the sea a goldbound volume of shelley with his name on the flyleaf lay in her lap and two lines she repeated softly to herselftwo lines that held a vision         he was as the sun in his fierce youth         as terrible and lovely as a tempest  she summoned him out of the chaos of the past and the past became the present and he stood before her as though in the flesh nay she heard his voice his laugh she even recognized again the smouldering flames in his eyes as he glanced into hers and his characteristic manners and gestures honora wondered in vain during those long months of exile had she tried to reconstruct him thus the vision in its entirety would not come rare fleeting partial and tantalizing glimpses she had been vouchsafed it is true the whole of him had been withheld until this breathless hour before the dawn of her happiness  yet though his own impatient spirit had fared forth to meet her with this premature gift of his attributes she had to fight the growing fear within her now that the days of suffering were as they had not been insistent questions dinned in her ears was she entitled to the joys to come what had she done to earn them had hers not been an attempt on a gigantic scale to cheat the fates nor could she say whether this feeling were a wholly natural failure to grasp a future too big or the old sense of the unreality of events that had followed her so persistently  the hudson disappeared factories bridges beflagged weekend resorts ramshackle houses and blocks of new buildings were scattered here and there the train was running on a causeway between miles of tenements where women and children overtaken by lassitude hung out of the windows then the blackness of the tunnel and honora closed her eyes four minutes three minutes two minutes the motion ceased at the steps of the car a uniformed station porter seized her bag and she started to walk down the long narrow platform suddenly she halted  drop anything miss inquired the porter  no answered honora faintly he looked at her in concern and she began to walk on again more slowly  it had suddenly come over her that the man she was going to meet she scarcely knew shyness seized her a shyness that bordered on panic and what was he really like that she should put her whole trust in him she glanced behind her that way was closed she had a mad desire to get away to hide to think it must have been an obsession that had possessed her all these months the porter was looking again and he voiced her predicament  theres only one way out miss  and then amongst the figures massed behind the exit in the grill she saw him his face redbronze with the sea tan his crisp curly head bared his eyes alight with a terrifying welcome and a tremor of a fear akin to ecstasy ran through her the fear of the women of days gone by whose courage carried them to the postern or the strand and fainted there she could have taken no step fartherand there was no need new strength flowed from the hand she held that was to carry her on and on  he spoke her name he led her passive obedient through the press to the side street and then he paused and looked into her burning face  i have you at last he said are you happy  i dont know she faltered oh hugh it all seems so strange i dont know what i have done  i know he said exultantly but to save my soul i cant believe it  she watched him bewildered while he put her maid into a cab and by an effort roused herself  where are you going hugh  to get married he replied promptly  she pulled down her veil  please be sensible she implored ive arranged to go to a hotel  what hotel  thethe barnstable she said the place had come to her memory on the train its very nice andand quietso ive been told and ive telegraphed for my rooms  ill humour you this once he answered and gave the order  she got into the carriage it had blue cushions with the familiar smell of carriage upholstery and the people in the street still hurried about their business as though nothing in particular were happening the horses started and some forgotten key in her brain was touched as chiltern raised her veil again  youll tear it hugh she said and perforce lifted it herself her eyes met hisand she awoke not to memories or regrets but to the future for the recording angel had mercifully destroyed his book  did you miss me she said  miss you my god honora how can you ask when i look back upon these last months i dont see how i ever passed through them and you are changed he said i could not have believed it possible but you are you areyou are finer  he had chosen his word exquisitely and then as they trotted sedately through madison avenue he strained her in his arms and kissed her  oh hugh she cried scarlet as she disengaged herself you mustnthere  youre free he exclaimed youre mine at last i cant believe it look at me and tell me so  she tried  yes she faltered  yeswhat  yes ii am yours  she looked out of the window to avoid those eyes was this new york or jerusalem were these the streets through which she had driven and trod in her former life her whole soul cried out denial no episode no accusing reminiscences stood outnot one the very corners were changed would it all change back again if he were to lessen the insistent pressure on the hand in her lap  honora  yes she answered with a start  you missed me look at me and tell me the truth  the truth she faltered and shuddered the contrast was too greatthe horror of it too great for her to speak of the pen of dante had not been adequate dont ask me hugh she begged i cant talk about iti never shall be able to talk about it if i had not loved you i should have died  how deeply he felt and understood and sympathized she knew by the quivering pressure on her hand ah if he had not if he had failed to grasp the meaning of her purgatory  you are wonderful honora was what he said in a voice broken by emotion  she thanked him with one fleeting tearful glance that was as a grant of all her priceless possessions the carriage stopped but it was some moments before they realized it  you may come up in a little while she whispered and lunch with meif you like  if i like he repeated  but she was on the sidewalk following the bell boy into the cool marblelined area of the hotel a smiling clerk handed her a pen and set the new universe to rocking  mrs leffingwell i presume we have your telegram  mrs leffingwell who was that person for an instant she stood blankly holding the pen and then she wrote rapidly if a trifle unsteadily mrs leffingwell and maid a pause where was her home then she added the words st louis  her rooms were above the narrow canon of the side street looking over the roofs of the inevitable brownstone fronts opposite while mathilde in the adjoining chamber unpacked her bag honora stood gazing out of the sittingroom windows trying to collect her thoughts her spirits had unaccountably fallen the sense of homelessness that had pursued her all these months overtaken her once more never never she told herself would she enter a hotel again alone and when at last he came she clung to him with a passion that thrilled him the more because he could not understand it  hughyou will care for me she cried  he kissed away her tears he could not follow her he only knew that what he held to him was a woman such as he had never known before tender and again strangely and fiercely tender an instrument of such miraculous delicacy as to respond quivering to the lightest touch an harmonious and perfect blending of strength and weakness of joy and sorrowof all the warring elements in the world what he felt was the supreme masculine joy of possession  at last they sat down on either side of the white cloth the waiter had laid for even the gods must eat not that our deified mortals ate much on this occasion vesta presided once more and after the feast was over gently led them down the slopes until certain practical affairs began to take shape in the mind of the man presently he looked at his watch and then at the woman and made a suggestion  marry you nowthis of afternoon she cried aghast hugh are you in your right senses  yes he said im reasonable for the first time in my life  she laughed and immediately became serious but when she sought to marshal her arguments she found that they had fled  oh but i couldnt she answered and besides there are so many things i ought to do ii havent any clothes  but this was a plea he could not be expected to recognize he saw no reason why she could not buy as many as she wanted after the ceremony  is that all he demanded  nothat isnt all cant you see thatthat we ought to wait hugh  no he exclaimed no i cant see it i can only see that every moment of waiting would be a misery for us both i can only see that the situation as it is today is an intolerable one for you  she had not expected him to see this  there are others to be thought of she said after a moments hesitation  what others  the answer she should have made died on her lips  it seems soindecorous hugh  indecorous he cried and pushed back his chair and rose whats indecorous about it to leave you here alone in a hotel in new york would not only be indecorous but senseless how long would you put it off a weeka montha year where would you go in the meantime and what would you do  but your friends hughand mine  friends what have they got to do with it  it was the woman now who for a moment turned practicaland for the mans sake she loved and the fair fabric of the future which they were to weave together and the plans with which his letters had been filled and of which she had dreamed in exile had become today as the stuff of which moonbeams are made as she looked up at him eternity itself did not seem long enough for the fulfilment of that love but he would the time not come when he would demand something more and suppose that something were denied she tried to rouse herself to think to consider a situation in which her instinct had whispered just oncethere must be some hidden danger but the electric touch of his hand destroyed the process and made her incapable of reason  what should we gain by a weeks or a fortnights delay he was saying except so much misery  she looked around the hotel sittingroom and tried to imagine the desolation of it stripped of his presence why not there was reason in what he said and yet if she had known it it was not to reason she yielded but to the touch of his hand  we will be married today he decreed i have planned it all i have bought the adhemar the yacht which i chartered last winter she is here well go off on her together away from the world for as long as you like and then he ended triumphantly then well go back to grenoble and begin our life  and begin our life she repeated but it was not to him that she spoke hugh i positively have to have some clothes  clothes his voice expressed his contempt for the mundane thought  yes clothes she repeated resolutely  he looked at his watch once more  very well he said well get em on the way  on the way she asked  well have to have a marriage license im afraid he explained apologetically  honora grew crimson a marriage license  she yielded of course who could resist him nor need the details of that interminable journey down the crowded artery of broadway to the centre of things be entered into an ignoble errand honora thought and she sat very still with flushed cheeks in the corner of the carriage chilterns finer feelings came to her rescue he too resented this senseless demand of civilization as an indignity to their olympian loves and he was a man to chafe at all restraints but at last the odious thing was over grim and implacable law satisfied after he had compelled them to stand in line for an interminable period before his grill and mingle with those whom he chose in his ignorance to call their peers honora felt degraded as they emerged with the hateful paper bought at such a price the city hall park with its moving streams of people etched itself in her memory  leave me hugh she said i will take this carriageyou must get another one  for once he accepted his dismissal with comparative meekness  when shall i come he asked  she smiled a little in spite of herself  you may come for me at six oclock she replied  six oclock he exclaimed but accepted with resignation and closed the carriage door enigmatical sex  enigmatical sex indeed honora spent a feverish afternoon rest and reflection being things she feared an afternoon in familiar places and strangest of all facts to be recorded memories and regrets troubled her not at all her old dressmakers her old milliners welcomed her as one risen radiant from the grave risen in their estimation to a higher life honora knew this and was indifferent to the wealth of meaning that lay behind their discretion milliners and dressmakers read the newspapers and periodicalscertain periodicals well they knew that the lady they flattered was the future mrs hugh chiltern  nothing whatever of an indelicate nature happened there was no mention of where to send the bill or of whom to send it to such things as she bought on the spot were placed in her carriage and happiest of all omissions she met no one she knew the praise that madame barriere lavished on honoras figure was not flattery because the paris models fitted her to perfection a little after five she returned to her hotel to a mathilde in a high state of suppressed excitement and at six the appointed fateful hour arrayed in a new street gown of dark green cloth she stood awaiting him  he was no laggard the bell on the church near by was still singing from the last stroke when he knocked flung open the door and stood for a moment staring at her not that she had been shabby when he had wished to marry her at noon no selfrespecting woman is ever shabby not that her present costume had any of the elements of overdress far from it being a woman she had her thrill of triumph at his exclamation diana had no need perhaps of a french dressmaker but it is an open question whether she would have scorned them honora stood motionless but her smile for him was like the first quivering shaft of day he opened a box and with a strange mixture of impetuosity and reverence came forward and she saw that he held in his hand a string of great glistening pearls  they were my mothers he said i have had them restrungfor you  oh hugh she cried she could find no words to express the tremor within and she stood passively her eyes half closed while he clasped the string around the lace collar that pressed the slender column of her neck and kissed her  even the humble beings who work in hotels are responsive to unusual disturbances in the ether at the barnstable a gala note prevailed bell boys porters clerk and cashier proud of their sudden wisdom were wreathed in smiles a new automobile in chilterns colours with his crest on the panel was panting beside the curb  i meant to have had it this morning he apologized as he handed her in but it wasnt ready in time  honora heard him and said something in reply she tried in vain to rouse herself from the lethargy into which she had fallen to cast off the spell up fifth avenue they sped past meaningless houses to the park the crystal air of evening was suffused with the level evening light and as they wound in and out under the spreading trees she caught glimpses across the shrubbery of the deepening blue of waters pools of mystery were her eyes  the upper west side is a definite place on the map and full undoubtedly of palpitating human joys and sorrows so far as honora was concerned it might have been bagdad the automobile had stopped before a residence and she found herself mounting the steps at chilterns side a swedish maid opened the door  is mr white at home chiltern asked  it seemed that the reverend mr white was he appeared a portly gentleman with frock coat and lawn tie who resembled the man in the moon his head like polished ivory increased the beaming effect of his welcome and the hand that pressed honoras was large and soft and warm but dreams are queer things in which no events surprise us  the reverend gentleman as he greeted chiltern pronounced his name with unction his air of hospitality of goodfellowship of taking the world as he found it could not have been improved upon he made it apparent at once that nothing could surprise him it was the most natural circumstance in life that two people should arrive at his house in an automobile at halfpast six in the evening and wish to get married if they chose this method instead of the one involving awnings and policemen and uncomfortablyarrayed relations and friends it was none of mr whites affair he led them into the gothic sanctum at the rear of the house where the famous sermons were written that shook the soundingboard of the temple where the gentleman preachedthe sermons that sometimes got into the newspapers mr white cleared his throat  i amvery familiar with your name mr chiltern he said and it is a pleasure to be able to serve you and the lady who is so shortly to be your wife your servant arrived with your note at four oclock ten minutes later and i should have missed him  and then honora heard chiltern saying somewhat coldlyin order to save time mr white i wish to tell you that mrs leffingwell has been divorced  the reverend mr white put up a hand before him and looked down at the carpet as one who would not dwell upon painful things  unfortunateahemmistakes will occur in life mr chilternin the best of lives he replied say no more about it i am sure looking at you both  very well then said chiltern brusquely i knew you would have to know and here he added is an essential paper  a few minutes later in continuation of the same strange dream honora was standing at chilterns side and the reverend mr white was addressing them what he saidapart of it at leastseemed curiously familiar chiltern put a ring on a finger of her ungloved hand it was a supreme moment in her destinythis she knew between her responses she repeated it to herself but the mighty fact refused to be registered and then suddenly rang out the words     those whom god hath joined together let no man put asunder  those whom god hath joined together mr white was congratulating her other people were in the roomthe ministers son his wife his brotherinlaw she was in the street again in the automobile without knowing how she got there and chiltern close beside her in the limousine  my wife he whispered  was she could it be true be lasting be binding for ever and ever her hand pressed his convulsively  oh hugh she cried care for mestay by me forever will you promise  i promise honora he repeated henceforth we are one  honora would have prolonged forever that honeymoon on summer seas in those blissful days she was content to sit by the hour watching him as bareheaded in the damp salt breeze he sailed the great schooner and gave sharp orders to the crew he was a man who would be obeyed and even his flashes of temper pleased her he was her master too and she gloried in the fact by the aid of the precious light within her she studied him  he loved her mightily fiercely but withal tenderly with her alone he was infinitely tender and it seemed that something in him cried out for battle against the rest of the world he had his way in port and out of it he brooked no opposition and delighted to carry against his captains advice more canvas than was wise when it blew heavily but the yacht like a woman seemed a creature of his will to know no fear when she felt his guiding hand even though the green water ran in the scuppers  and every day anew she scanned his face even as he scanned the face of the waters what was she searching for to have so much is to become miserly to fear lest a grain of the precious store be lost on the second day they had anchored for an hour or two between the sandy headlands of a small new england port and she had stood on the deck watching his receding figure under the flag of the gasoline launch as it made its way towards the deserted wharves beyond the wharves was an elmarched village street and above the verdure rose the white cupola of the house of some prosperous seacaptain of bygone times honora had not wished to go ashore first he had begged and then he had laughed as he had leaped into the launch she lay in a chaise longue watching it swinging idly at the dock  the night before he had written letters and telegrams once he had looked up at her as she sat with a book in her hand across the saloon and caught her eyes she had been pretending not to watch him  wedding announcements he said  and she had smiled back at him bravely such was the first acknowledgment between them that the world existed  a little late he observed smiling in his turn as he changed his pen but theyll have to make allowances for the exigencies of the situation and theyve been after me to settle down for so many years that they ought to be thankful to get them at all ive told them that after a decent period they may come to grenoblein the late autumn we dont want anybody before then do we honora  no she said faintly and added i shall always be satisfied with you alone hugh  he laughed happily and presently she went up on deck and stood with her face to the breeze there were no sounds save the musical beat of the water against the strakes and the low hum of wind on the towering vibrant sails one moulten silver star stood out above all others to the northward somewhere beyond the spot where sea and sky met in the hidden kiss of night was newportwere his relations and her friends what did they think he at least had no anxieties about the world why should she their defiance of it had been no greater than that of an hundred others on whom it had smiled benignly but had not the others truckled more to its conventions little she cared about it indeed and if he had turned the prow of the adhemar towards the unpeopled places of the earth her joy would have been untroubled  one after another the days glided by while with the sharpened senses of a great love she watched for a sign of the thing that slept in himof the thing that had driven him home from his wanderings to recreate his life when it awoke she would have to share him now he was hers alone her feelings towards this thing did not assume the proportions of jealousy or fear they were merely alert vaguely disquieting the sleeping thing was not a monster no but it might grow into one if its appetite were not satisfied and blame her  she told herself that had he lacked ambition she could not have loved him and did not stop to reflect upon the completeness of her satisfaction with the viking he seemed indeed in these weeks one whom the sea has marked for its own and her delight in watching him as he moved about the boat never palled his nose reminded her of the prow of a ship of war and his deepset eyes were continually searching the horizon for an enemy such were her fancies in the early morning when he donned his sleeveless bathing suit she could never resist the temptation to follow him on deck to see him plunge into the cold ocean it gave her a delightful little shiverand he was made like one of the gods of valhalla  she had discovered too in these intimate days that he had the northmans temperament she both loved and dreaded his moods and sometimes when the yacht glided over smoother seas it was his pleasure to read to her even poetry and the great epics that he should be fond of the cruel scotch ballads she was not surprised but his familiarity with the book of job and his love for it astonished her it was a singular library that he had put on board the adhemar  one evening when the sails flapped idly and the blocks rattled when they had been watching in silence the flaming orange of the sunset above the amethystine camden hills he spoke the words for which she had been waiting  honora what do you say to going back to grenoble  she succeeded in smiling at him  whenever you like hugh she said  so the bowsprit of the adhemar was turned homewards and with every league of water they left behind them his excitement and impatience seemed to grow  i cant wait to show it to you honorato see you in it he exclaimed i have so long pictured you there and our life as it will be     chapter xii the entrance into eden  they had travelled through the night and in the early morning left the express at a junction honora sat in the straightbacked seat of the smaller train with parted lips and beating heart gazing now and again at the pearly mists rising from the little river valley they were climbing chiltern was like a schoolboy  well soon be there he cried but it was nearly nine oclock when they reached the gothic station that marked the end of the line it was a chiltern line he told her and she was already within the feudal domain time indeed that she awoke she reached the platform to confront a group of upturned staring faces and for the moment her courage failed her somehow with chilterns help she made her way to a waiting omnibus backed up against the boards the footman touched his hat the greyheaded coachman saluted and they got in as the horses started off at a quick trot honora saw that the group on the station platform had with one consent swung about to stare after them  they passed through the main street of the town lined with plateglass windows and lively signs and already bustling with the business of the day through humbler thoroughfares and presently rumbled over a bridge that spanned a rushing stream confined between the foundation walls of mills hundreds of yards of mills stretched away on either side mills with windows wide open and within them honora heard the clicking and roaring of machinery and saw the men and women at their daily tasks life was a strange thing that they should be doing this while she should be going to live in luxury at a great country place on one of the walls she read the legend chiltern and company  they still keep our name said hugh although they are in the trust  he pointed out to her with an air of pride every landmark by the roadside in future they were to have a new meaningthey were to be shared with her and he spoke of the timesas child and youth home from the seashore or college he had driven over the same road it wound to the left behind the mills threaded a village of neat wooden houses where the better class of operatives lived reached the river again and turned at last through a brick gateway past a lodge in the dense shade of sheltering boughs into a wooded drive that climbed by gentle degrees a slope human care for generations had given to the place a tradition people had lived here and loved those treeshis people and could it be that she was to inherit all this with him was her name really chiltern  the beating of her heart became a pain when in the distance through the spreading branches she caught a glimpse of the long low outline of the house a vision at once familiar and unreal how often in the months gone by had she called up the memory of the photograph she had once seen only to doubt the more that she should ever behold that house and these trees with him by her side they drew up before the door and a venerable ruddyfaced butler stood gravely on the steps to welcome them hugh leaped out he was still the schoolboy  starling he said this is mrs chiltern  honora smiled tremulously  how do you do starling she said  starlings an old friend honora hes been here ever since i can remember  the blue eyes of the old servant were fixed on her with a strange searching expression was it compassion she read in them on this that should be the happiest of her days in that instant unaccountably her heart went out to the old man and something of what he had seen and something of what was even now passing within him came to her intuitively it was as though unexpectedly she had found a friendand a friend who had had no previous intentions of friendship  im sure i wish you happiness madameand mr hugh he said in a voice not altogether firm  happiness cried hugh ive never known what it was before now starling  the old mans eyes glistened  and youve come to stay sir  all my life starling said hugh  they entered the hall it was wide and cool white panelled to the ceiling with a dark oak floor at the back of it was an eighteenthcentury stairway with a band of red carpet running up the steps and a wroughtiron guard with a velvetcovered rail halfway up the stairway divided at a landing lighted by great triple windows of small panes  you may have breakfast in half an hour starling said chiltern and led honora up the stairs into the east wing where he flung open one of the high mahogany doors on the south side these are your rooms honora i have had keller do them all over for you and i hope youll like them if you dont well change them again  her answer was an exclamation of delight there was a bedroom in pink with brocaded satin on the walls and an oriel window thrust out over the garden a panelled boudoir at the corner of the house with a marble mantel before which one of marie antoinettes duchesses had warmed her feet and shelves lined with goldlettered books from its windows across the flowering shrubbery and through the trees she saw the gleaming waters of a lake and the hills beyond from this view she turned and caught her breath and threw her arms about her husbands neck he was astonished to see that her eyes were filled with tears  oh hugh she cried its too perfect it almost makes me afraid  we will be very happy dearest he said and as he kissed her he laughed at the fates  i hope soi pray so she said as she clung to him butdont laughi cant bear it  he patted her cheek  what a strange little girl you are he said i suppose i shouldnt be mad about you if you werent that way sometimes i wonder how many women i have married  she smiled at him through her tears  isnt that polygamy hugh she asked  it was all like a breathless tale out of one of the wonder books of youth so at least it seemed to honora as she stood refreshed with a new white linen gown hesitating on the threshold of her door before descending some time the bell must ring or the cock crow or the fairy beckon with a wand and she would have to go back back where she did not knowshe could not remember cinderella dreaming by the embers perhaps  he was awaiting her in the little breakfast room its glass casements open to the garden with the wall and the round stone seat the simmering urn the white cloth the shining silver the big green melons that the hot summer sun had ripened for them alone and hughs eyes as they rested on hersuch was her illusion nor was it quite dispelled when he lighted a pipe and they started to explore their eden wandering through chambers with low ceilings in the old part of the house and larger higher apartments in the portion that was called new in the great darkened library side by side against the spanish leather on the walls hung the portraits of his father and mother in heavy frames of gilt  her husband was pleased that she should remain so long before them and for a while as she stood lost in contemplation he did not speak once she glanced at him and then back at the stern face of the generalstern yet kindly the eyes deepset under bushy brows like hughs were full of fire and yet the artist had made them human too a dark reddish brown closetrimmed mustache and beard hid the mouth and chin hugh had inherited the nose but the fathers forehead was wider and fuller hugh was at once a newer type and an older the face and figure of the general were characteristic of the midcentury american of the northern states a mixture of boldness and caution and puritanism who had won his battles in war and commerce by a certain native quality of mind  i never appreciated him said hugh at length until after he diedlong after until now in fact at times we were good friends and then something he would say or do would infuriate me and i would purposely make him angry he had a time and a rule for everything and i could not bear rules breakfast was on the minute an hour in his study to attend to affairs about the place so many hours in his office at the mills in the presidents room at the bank vestry and charity meetings at regular intervals no movement in all this country round about was ever set on foot without him he was one to be finally reckoned with and since his death many proofs have come to me of the things he did for people of which the world was ignorant i have found out at last that his way of life was in the main the right way but i know now honora he added soberly slipping his hand within her arm i know now that without you i never could do all i intend to do  oh dont say that she cried dont say that  why not he asked smiling at her vehemence it is not a confession of weakness i had the determination it is true i couldi should have done something but my deeds would have lacked the one thing needful to lift them above the commonplaceat least for me you are the inspiration with you here beside me i feel that i can take up this work with joy do you understand  she pressed his hand with her arm  hugh she said slowly i hope that i shall be a help and notnot a hindrance  a hindrance he exclaimed you dont know you cant realize what you are to me  she was silent and when she lifted her eyes it was to rest them on the portrait of his mother and she seemed to read in the sweet sad eyes a questiona question not to be put into words chiltern following her gaze did not speak for a space they looked at the portrait together and in silence  from one end of the house to the other they went hugh reviving at the sight of familiar objects a hundred memories of his childhood and she trying to imagine that childhood so different from her own passed in this wonderful place in the glass cases of the gun room among the shining blue barrels which he had used in all parts of the world was the little shotgun his father had had made for him when he was twelve years old hugh locked the door after them when they came out and smiled as he put the key in his pocket  my destroying days are over he declared  honora put on a linen hat and they took the gravelled path to the stables where the horses one by one were brought out into the courtyard for their inspection in anticipation of this hour there was a blood bay for honora which chiltern had bought in new york she gave a little cry of delight when she saw the horse shining in the sunlight his nostrils in the air his brown eyes clear his tapering neck patterned with veins and then there was the dairy with the fawncoloured cows and calves and the hillside pastures that ran down to the river and the farm lands where the stubbled grain was yellowing they came back by the path that wound through the trees and shrubbery bordering the lake to the walled garden ablaze in the mellow sunlight with reds and purples salvias and zinnias dahlias gladioli and asters  here he left her for a while sitting dreamily on the stone bench mrs hugh chiltern of grenoble over and over she repeated that name to herself and it refused somehow to merge with her identity yet was she mistress of this fair domain of that house which had sheltered them race for a century and the lines of which her eye caressed with a loving reverence and the chiltern pearls even then lay hidden around her throat  her thoughts went back at this to the gentle lady to whom they had belonged and whose look began again to haunt her honoras superstition startled her what did it mean that look she tried to recall where she had seen it before and suddenly remembered that the eyes of the old butler had held something not unlike it compassionatethis was the only word that would describe it no it had not proclaimed her an intruder though it may have been ready to do so the moment before her appearance for there was a note of surprise in itsurprise and compassion  this was the lady in whose footsteps she was to walk whose charities and household cares she was to assume tradition order observance responsibility authority it was difficult to imagine these as a logical part of the natural sequence of her life she would begin today if god would only grant her these things she had once contemned and that seemed now so precious her lifeher real life would begin today why not how hard she would strive to be worthy of this incomparable gift it was hers hers she listened but the only answer was the humming of the bees in the still september morning  chilterns voice aroused her he was standing in the breakfast room talking to the old butler  youre sure there were no other letters starling besides these bills  honora became tense  no sir she heard the butler say and she seemed to detect in his deferential voice the note of anxiety suppressed in the others im most particular about letters sir as one who lived so many years with your father would be all that came were put in your study mr hugh  it doesnt matter answered chiltern carelessly and stepped out into the garden he caught sight of her hesitated the fraction of a moment and as he came forward again the cloud in his eyes vanished and yet she was aware that he was regarding her curiously  what he said gayly still here  it is too beautiful she cried i could sit here forever  she lifted her face trustfully smilingly to his and he stooped down and kissed it  to give the jealous fates not the least chance to take offence the higher life they were to lead began at once and yet it seemed at times to honora as though this higher life were the gift the fates would most begrudge a gift reserved for others the pretensions to which were a kind of knavery merriment forgetfulness music the dance the cup of pleasure and the feast of babylonthese might more readily have been vouchsafed even deemed to have been bargained for but to take that which supposedly had been renouncedvirtue sobriety security respectwould this be endured she went about it breathlessly like a thief  never was there a more exemplary household they rose at halfpast seven they breakfasted at a quarter after eight at nine young mr manning the farm superintendent was in waiting and hugh spent two or more hours in his company inspecting correcting planning for two thousand acres of the original chiltern estate still remained two thousand acres which since the generals death had been at sixes and sevens the generals study which was hughs now was piled high with new and bulky books on cattle and cultivation of the soil government and state and private experts came and made tests and went away again new machinery arrived and hugh passed hours in the sun often with honora by his side installing it general chiltern had been president and founder of the grenoble national bank and hugh took up his duties as a director  honora sought with an energy that had in it an element of desperation to keep pace with her husband for she was determined that he should have no interests in which she did not share in those first days it was her dread that he might grow away from her and instinct told her that now or never must the effort be made she too studied farming not from books but from him in their afternoon ride along the shady river road which was the event of her day she encouraged him to talk of his plans and problems that he might thus early form the habit of bringing them to her and the unsuspecting male in him responded innocent of the simple subterfuge after an exhaustive discourse on the elements lacking in the valley soil to which she had listened in silent intensity he would exclaim  by george honora youre a continual surprise to me i had no idea a woman would take an interest in these things or grasp them the way you do  lordly commendations these and she would receive them with a flush of gratitude  nor was it ever too hot or she too busy with household cares for her to follow him to the scene of his operations whatever these might be she would gladly stand for an hour listening to a consultation with the veterinary about an ailing cow her fear was lest some matter of like importance should escape her she had private conversations with mr manning that she might surprise her husband by an unsuspected knowledge such were her ruses  the housekeeper who had come up from new york was the subject of a conjugal conversation  i am going to send her away hugh honora announced i dont believeyour mother had one  the housekeepers departure was the beginning of honoras real intimacy with starling complicity perhaps would be a better word for the commencement of this relationship first of all there was an inspection of the family treasures the tablelinen the silver and the chinasevres royal worcester and minton and the priceless dinnerset of lowestoft which had belonged to alexander chiltern reserved for great occasions only occasions that starling knew by heart their dates and the guests the lowestoft had honoured his air was ceremonial as he laid reverently the sample pieces on the table before her but it seemed to honora that he spoke as one who recalls departed glories who held a conviction that the lowestoft would never be used again  although by unalterable custom he submitted at breakfast the menus of the day to hugh the old butler came afterwards to honoras boudoir during her struggle with the account books sometimes she would look up and surprise his eyes fixed upon her and one day she found at her elbow a long list made out in a painstaking hand  whats this starling she asked  if you please madame he answered theyre the current prices in the marketshere  she thanked him nor was his exquisite delicacy in laying stress upon the locality lost upon her that he realized the magnitudefor herof the task to which she had set herself that he sympathized deeply with the spirit which had undertaken it she was as sure as though he had said so he helped her thus in a dozen unobtrusive ways never once recognizing her ignorance but he made her feel the more that that ignorance was a shameful thing not to be spoken of speculations upon him were irresistible she was continually forgetting the nature of his situation and he grew gradually to typify in her mind the grenoble of the past she knew his principles as well as though he had spoken themwhich he never did for him the world had become awry he abhorred divorce and that this modern abomination had touched the house of chiltern was a calamity that had shaken the very foundations of his soul in spite of this he had remained why perhaps from habit perhaps from love of the family and hughperhaps to see  and having stayed fascination had laid hold of himof that she was sureand his affections had incomprehensibly become involved he was as one assisting at a high tragedy not unworthy of him the outcome of which he never for an instant doubted and he gave honora the impression that he alone inscrutable could have pulled aside the curtain and revealed the end     chapter xiii of the world beyond the gates  honora paused in her toilet and contemplated for a moment the white skirt that her maid presented  i think ill wear the blue pongee today mathilde she said  the decision for the blue pongee was the culmination of a struggle begun with the opening of her eyes that morning it was sunday and the time was at hand when she must face the world might it not be delayed a little whilea week longer for the remembrance of the staring eyes which had greeted her on her arrival at the station at grenoble troubled her it seemed to her a cruel thing that the house of god should hold such terrors for her today she had a longing for it that she had never felt in her life before  chiltern was walking in the garden waiting for her to breakfast with him and her pose must have had in it an element of the selfconscious when she appeared smilingly at the door  why youre all dressed up he said  its sunday hugh  so it is he agreed with what may have been a studied lightnessshe could not tell  im going to church she said bravely  i cant say much for old stopford declared her husband his sermons used to arouse all the original sin in me when i had to listen to them  she poured out his coffee  i suppose one has to take ones clergyman as one does the weather she said we go to church for something else besides the sermondont we  i suppose so if we go at all he replied old stopford imposes a pretty heavy penalty  too heavy for you she asked and smiled at him as she handed him the cup  too heavy for me he said returning her smile to tell you the truth honora i had an overdose of church in my youth here and at school and ive been trying to even up ever since  youd like me to go wouldnt you hugh she ventured after a silence  indeed i should he answered and again she wondered to what extent his cordiality was studied or whether it were studied at all im very fond of that church in spite of the fact thatthat i may be said to dissemble my fondness she laughed with him and he became serious i still contributethe familys share toward its support my father was very proud of it but it is really my mothers church it was due to her that it was built  thus was comedy playedand honora by no the means sure that it was a comedy even her alert instinct had not been able to detect the acting and the intervening hours were spent in speculating whether her fears had not been overdone nevertheless under the eyes of starling at twenty minutes to eleven she stepped into the victoria with an outward courage and drove down the shady avenue towards the gates sweettoned bells were ringing as she reached the residence portion of the town and subdued pedestrians in groups and couples made their way along the sidewalks they stared at her and she in turn with heightened colour stared at her coachmans back after all this first sunday would be the most difficult  the carriage turned into a street arched by old elms and flanked by the houses of the most prosperous townspeople some of these were of the oldfashioned classic type and others new examples of a national architecture seeking to find itselfwhite and yellow colonial roughcast modifications of the shakespearian period and nondescript mixtures of cobblestones and shingles each was surrounded by trim lawns and shrubbery the church itself was set back from the street it was of bluish stone and half covered with virginia creeper  at this point had the opportunity for a secret retreat presented itself honora would have embraced it for until now she had not realized the full extent of the ordeal had her arrival been heralded by sounding trumpets the sensation it caused could not have been greater in her eden the world had been forgotten the hum of gossip beyond the gates had not reached her but now as the horses approached the curb their restive feet clattering on the hard pavement in the darkened interior of the church she saw faces turned and entering worshippers pausing in the doorway something of what the event meant for grenoble dawned upon her something not all but all that she could bear  if it be true that there is no courage equal to that which a great love begets in a woman honoras at that moment was sublime her cheeks tingled and her knees weakened under her as she ran the gantlet to the church door where she was met by a gentleman on whose face she read astonishment unalloyed amazement perhaps is not too strong a word for the sensation it conveyed to her and it occurred to her afterwards that there was an element in it of outrage it was a countenance peculiarly adapted to such an expressionyellow smoothshaven heavyjowled with one drooping eye and she needed not to be told that she had encountered at the outset the very pillar of pillars the frock coat the heavy watch chain the squaretoed boots all combined to make a presence  an instinctive sense of drama amongst the onlookers seemed to create a hush as though these had been the unwilling witnesses to an approaching collision and were awaiting the crash the gentleman stood planted in the inner doorway his drooping eye fixed on hers  i am mrs chiltern she faltered  he hesitated the fraction of an instant but he somehow managed to make it plain that the information was superfluous he turned without a word and marched majestically up the aisle before her to the fourth pew from the front on the right there he faced about and laid a protesting hand on the carved walnut as though absolving himself in the sight of his god and his fellowcitizens honora fell on her knees  she strove to calm herself by prayer but the glances of a congregation focussed between her shoulderblades seemed to burn her back and the thought of the concentration of so many minds upon her distracted her own she could think of no definite prayer was this gods tabernacle or the marketplace and she at the tail of a cart and was she not hugh chilterns wife entitled to his seat in the place of worship of his fathers she rose from her knees and her eyes fell on the softly glowing colours of a stainedglass window in memoriamalicia reyburn chiltern hughs mother the lady in whose seat she sat  the organist a sprightly young man came in and began turning over his music and the choir took theirplaces in the oldfashioned manner then came the clergyman his beard was white his face long and narrow and shrivelled his forehead protruding his eyes of the cold blue of a winters sky the service began and honora repeated the familiar prayers which she had learned by heart in childhooduntil her attention was arrested by the words she spoke we have offended against thy holy laws had she would not god bless her marriage it was not until then that she began to pray with an intensity that blotted out the world that he would not punish her if she had done wrong in his sight surely if she lived henceforth in fear of him he would let her keep this priceless love which had come to her and it was impossible that he should regard it as an inordinate and sinful affectionsince it had filled her life with light as the wife of hugh chiltern she sought a blessing would god withhold it he would not she was sure if they lived a sober and a righteous life he would take that into account for he was just  then she grew calmer and it was not until after the doctrinal sermon which hugh had predicted that her heart began to beat painfully once more when the gentleman who had conducted her to her seat passed her the plate he inspired her with an instinctive fear and she tried to imagine in contrast the erect and soldierly figure of general chiltern performing the same office would he have looked on her more kindly  when the benediction was pronounced she made her way out of the church with downcast eyes the people parted at the door to let her pass and she quickened her step gained the carriage at last and drove awayseemingly leaving at her back a buzz of comment would she ever have the courage to do it again  the old butler as he flung open the doors at her approach seemed to be scrutinizing her  wheres mr chiltern starling she asked  hes gone for a ride madame  hugh had gone for a ride  she did not see him until lunch was announced when he came to the table in his riding clothes it may have been that he began to talk a little eagerly about the excursion he had made to an outlying farm and the conversation he had had with the farmer who leased it  his lease is out in april said chiltern and when i told him i thought id turn the land into the rest of the estate he tried to bribe me into a renewal  bribe you  chiltern laughed  only in joke of course the mans a character and hes something of a politician in these parts he intimated that there would be a vacancy in this congressional district next year that grierson was going to resign and that a man with a long purse who belonged to the soil might have a chance i suppose he thinks i would buy it  andwould you like to go to congress hugh  well he said smiling a man never can tell when he may have to eat his words i dont say i shouldntin the distant future it would have pleased the general but if i go he added with characteristic vigour it will be in spite of the politicians not because of them if i go i shant go bound and ill fight for it i should enjoy that  and she was able to accord him the smile of encouragement he expected  i am sure you would she replied i think you might have waited until this afternoon and taken me she reproached him you know how i enjoy going with you to those places  it was not until later in the meal that he anticipated in an admirably accidental manner the casual remark she had intended to make about church  your predictions were fulfilled she answered the sermon wasnt thrilling  he glanced at her and instead of avoiding his eyes she smiled into them  did you see the first citizen of grenoble he inquired  i am sure of it she laughed if hes yellow with a drooping eye and a presence he was kind enough to conduct me to the pew  yes he exclaimed thats israel simpsonyou couldnt miss him how i used to hate him when i was a boy i havent quite got over it yet i used to outdo myself to make things uncomfortable for him when he came up herei think it was because he always seemed to be truckling he was ridiculously servile and polite in those days hes changed since added hugh dryly he must quite have forgotten by this time that the general made him  isis he so much said honora  her husband laughed  is it possible that you have seen him and still ask that said he he is grenoble once the chilterns were he is the head of the honoured firm of israel simpson and sons the president of the grenoble national bank the senior warden of the church a director in the railway twice a year in the columns of the new york newspapers dedicated to the prominent arrivals at the hotels you may read the name of israel simpson of grenoble three times has he been abroad respectably accompanied by maria who invariably returns to read a paper on the cathedrals and art before the womans club  maria is his wife i suppose  yes didnt you run across maria shes quite as pronounced in her way as israel a very tower of virtue  i didnt meet anybody hugh said honora illill look for her next sunday i hurried out it was a little embarrassing the first time she added your family being so prominent in grenoble  upon this framework the prominence of his family she built up during the coning week a new structure of hope it was strange she had never thought before of this quite obvious explanation for the curiosity of grenoble perhapsperhaps it was not prejudice after allor not all of it the wife of the chiltern heir would naturally inspire a considerable interest in any event and mrs hugh chiltern in particular and these people would shortly understand if they did not now understand that hugh had come back voluntarily and from a sense of duty to assume the burdens and responsibilities that so many of his generation and class had shirked this would tell in their favour surely at this point in her meditations she consulted the mirror to behold a modest slimwaisted young woman becomingly arrayed in white linen whose cheeks were aglow with health whose eyes seemingly reflected the fire of a distant high vision not a poppaea certainly nor a delila no it was unbelievable that this the very field itself of their future labours should be denied them her heart at the mere conjecture turned to stone  during the cruise of the adhemar she had often watched in the gathering darkness those revolving lights on headland or shoal that spread now a bright band across the sea and again left the waters desolate in the night thus ceaselessly revolving from white hope to darker doubt were her thoughts until sometimes she feared to be alone with them and surprised him by her presence in his busiest moments for he was going ahead on the path they had marked out with a faith in which she could perceive no flaw if faint and shadowy forms had already come between them he gave no evidence of having as yet discerned these there was the absence of news from his family for instancethe graingers the stranger the shorters and the pendletons whom she had never seen he had never spoken to her of this and he seemed to hold it as of no account her instinct whispered that it had left its mark a hidden mark and while she knew that consideration for her prompted him to hold his peace she told herself that she would have been happier had he spoken of it  always she was brought back to grenoble when she saw him thus manlike with his gaze steadily fixed on the task if new york itself withheld recognition could grenobleprovincial and conservative grenoble preserving still the ideas of the last century for which his family had so unflinchingly stoodbe expected to accord it new york new york was many many things she knew the great house could have been filled from weekend to weekend from new york but not with graingers and pendletons and stranger not with those around the walls of whose fortresses the currents of modernity still swept impotently not with those who while not contemning pleasure still acknowledged duty not with those whose assured future was that for which she might have sold her soul itself social free lances undoubtedly and unattached men those who lived in the world of fashion but were not squeamishmrs kame for example and ladies like mrs eustace rindge who had tried a second throw for happinesssuch votaries of excitement would undoubtedly have been more than glad to avail themselves of the secluded hospitality of grenoble for that which they would have been pleased to designate as a lively time honora shuddered at the thought and as though the shudder had been prophetic one morning the mail contained a letter from mrs kame herself  mercifully hugh had not noticed it honora did not recognize the handwriting but she slipped the envelope into her lap fearful of what it might contain and when she gained the privacy of her rooms read it with quickening breath mrs kames touch was light and her imagination sympathetic she was the most adaptable of the feminine portion of her nation and since the demise of her husband she had lived abroad and at home among men and women of a world that does not dot its is or cross its ts nevertheless the letter filled honora with a deep apprehension and a deeper resentment plainly and clearly stamped between its delicately worded lines was the claim of a comradeship born of honoras recent act she tore the paper into strips and threw it into the flames and opened the window to the cool air of the autumn morning she had a feeling of contamination that was intolerable  mrs kame had proposed herselfagain the word delicately must be usedfor one of honoras first houseparties only an acute perception could have read in the ladys praise of hugh a masterly avoidance of that part of his career already registered on the social slate mrs kame had thought about them and their wonderful happiness in these autumn days at grenoble to intrude on that happiness yet awhile would be a sacrilege later perhaps they would relent and see something of their friends and throw open again the gates of a beautiful place long closed to the world andwithout the air of having picked the single instance but of having chosen from manymrs kame added that she had only lately seen elsie shorter whose admiration for honora was greater than ever a sentiment honora reflected a little bitterly that mrs shorter herself had not taken the pains to convey consistency was not elsies jewel  it must perhaps be added for the sake of enlightenment that since going to newport honoras view of the writer of this letter had changed in other words enlarging ideals had dwarfed her somewhat it was strictly true that the lady was a boon companion of everybody her catholicism had two limitations only that she must be amused and that she must notin what she deemed the vulgar sensebe shocked  honora made several attempts at an answer before she succeeded in saying simply that hugh was too absorbed in his work of reconstruction of the estate for them to have houseparties this autumn and even this was a concession hard for her pride to swallow she would have preferred not to reply at all and this slightest of references to his workand hersseemed to degrade it before she folded the sheet she looked again at that word reconstruction and thought of eliminating it it was too obviously allied to redemption and she felt that mrs kame could not understand redemption and would ridicule it honora went downstairs and dropped her reply guiltily into the mailbag it was for hughs sake she was sending it and from his eyes she was hiding it  and while we are dealing with letters one or part of one from honoras aunt may perhaps be inserted here it was an answer to one that honora had written a few days after her installation at grenoble the contents of which need not be gone into we who know her would neither laugh nor weep at reading it and its purport may be more or less accurately surmised from her aunts reply     as i wrote you at the time my dearso it ran the shock which    your sudden marriage with mr chiltern caused us was greatso great    that i cannot express it in words i realize that i am growing old    and perhaps the world is changing faster than i imagine and i    wrote you too that i would not be true to myself if i told you    that what you have done was right in my eyes i have asked myself    whether my horror of divorce and remarriage may not in some degree    be due to the happiness of my life with your uncle i am    undoubtedly an exceptionally fortunate woman and as i look    backwards i see that the struggles and trials which we have shared    together were really blessings     nevertheless dear honora you are as your uncle wrote you our    child and nothing can alter that fact in our hearts we can only    pray with all our strength that you may find happiness and peace in    your new life i try to imagine as i think of you and what has    happened to you in the few years since you have left ushow long    they seemi try to imagine some of the temptations that have    assailed you in that world of which i know nothing if i cannot it    is because god made us different i know what you have suffered    and my heart aches for you     you say that experience has taught you much that you could not    havelearned in any other way i do not doubt it you tell me    that your new life just begun will be a dutiful one let me    repeat that it is my anxious prayer that you have not builded upon    sand that regrets may not come i cannot say more i cannot    dissemble perhaps i have already said too much                    your loving                         aunt mary  an autumn wind was blowing and honora gazed out of the window at the steelblue ruffled waters of the lake unconsciously she repeated the words to herself  builded upon sand     chapter xiv containing philosophy from mr grainger  swiftly came the autumn days and swiftly went a bewildering ever changing and glorious panorama presented itself green hillsides struck first with flaming crimsons and yellows and later mellowing into a wondrous blending of gentler tenderer hues lavender and wine and the faintest of rose colours where the bare beeches massed thus the slopes were spread as with priceless carpets for a festival sometimes honora watching beheld from her window the russet dawn on the eastern ridge and the white mists crouching in strange ghostly shapes abode the lake and the rushing river and she saw these same mists gather again shivering at nightfall in the afternoon they threaded valleys silent save for the talk between them and the stirring of the leaves under their horses feet  so the indian summer passedthat breathless season when even happiness has its premonitions and its pangs the umber fields all ploughed and harrowed lay patiently awaiting the coming again of the quickening spring then fell the rain the first cold winter rain that shrouded the valley and beat down upon the defenceless dismantled garden and made pools in the hollows of the stone seat that flung itself against honoras window as though begrudging her the warmth and comfort within sometimes she listened to it in the night  she was watching how intent was that vigil how alert and sharpened her senses a woman who has watched alone may answer now she felt was the crisis at hand the moment when her future and his was to hang in the balance the work on the farms which had hitherto left chiltern but little time for thought had relaxed in these wet days had he begun to brood a little did he show signs of a reversion to that other personality the chiltern she had not known yet glimpses of whom she had had she recalled the third time she had seen him the morning at the lilacs in newport that had left upon her the curious sense of having looked on a superimposed portrait that chiltern which she called her viking and which with a womans perversity she had perhaps loved most of all was but one expression of the other man of days gone by the life of that man was a closed book she had never wished to open was he dead or sleeping and if sleeping would he awake how softly she tread  and in these days with what exquisite yet tremulous skill and courage did she bring up the subject of that other labour they were to undertake togetherthe life and letters of his father in the early dusk when they had returned from their long rides she contrived to draw chiltern into his study the cheerfulness the hopefulness the delight with which she approached the task the increasing enthusiasm she displayed for the character of the general as she read and sorted the letters and documents and the traits of his she lovingly traced in hugh were not without their effect it was thus she fanned ceaselessly and with a smile and with an art the rarest women possess the drooping flame and the flame responded  how feverishly she worked unknown to him he never guessed so carefully and unobtrusively planted her suggestions that they were born again in glory as his inspiration the mist had lifted a little and she beheld the next stage beyond to reach that stage was to keep him intent on this workandafter that to publish ah if he would only have patience or if she could keep him distracted through this winter and their night she might save him love such as hers can even summon genius to its aid and she took fire herself at the thought of a book worthy of that love of a bookthough signed by him that would redeem them and bring a scoffing world to its knees in praise she spent hours in the big library preparing for chilterns coming with volumes in her lap and a notebook by her side  one night as they sat by the blazing logs in his study which had been the generals chiltern arose impulsively opened the big safe in the corner and took out a leatherbound book and laid it on her lap honora stared at it it was marked highlawns visitors book  its curious i never thought of it before he said but my father had a habit of jotting down notes in it on important occasions it may be of some use to us honora  she opened it at random and read july 5 1893 picnic at psalters falls temperature 71 at 9 am bar 30 weather clear charles left for washington summons from president in the midst of it agatha and victor again look at the farrar property hugh has a ducking ps at dinner night bessie announces her engagement to cecil grainger present sarah and george grenfell agatha and victor strange gerald shorter lord kylie  honora looked up hugh was at her shoulder with his eyes on the page  psalters falls he exclaimed how well i remember that day i was just home from my junior year at harvard  who was charles inquired honora  senator pendletonbessies father just after i jumped into the millpond the telegram came for him to go to washington and i drove him home in my wet clothes the old man had a terrible tongue a whiplash kind of humour and he scored me for being a fool but he rather liked me on the whole he told me if id only straighten out i could be anything in reason  what made you jump in the millpond honora asked laughing  bessie grainger she had a devil in her too in those days but she always kept her head and i didnt he smiled im willing to admit that i was madly in love with her and she treated me outrageously we were standing on the bridgei remember it as though it were yesterdayand the water was about eight feet deep with a clear sand bottom she took off a gold bracelet and bet me i wouldnt get it if she threw it in that night right in the middle of dinner when there was a pause in the conversation she told us she was engaged to cecil grainger it turned out by the way to have been his bracelet i rescued i could have wrung his neck and i didnt speak to her for a month  honora repressed an impulse to comment on this incident with his arm over her shoulder he turned the pages idly and the long lists of guests which bore witness to the former life and importance of highlawns passed before her eyes distinguished foreigners peers of england churchmen and men renowned in literature famous american statesmen scientists and names that represented more than one generation of wealth and achievementall were here there were his school and college friends five and six at a time and besides them those of young girls who were now women some of whom honora had met and known in new york or newport  presently he closed the book abruptly and returned it to the safe to her sharpened senses the very act itself was significant there were other and blank pages in it for future years and under different circumstances he might have laid it in its timehonoured place on the great table in the library  it was not until some weeks later that honora was seated one afternoon in the study waiting for him to come in and sorting over some of the letters that they had not yet examined when she came across a new lot thrust carelessly at the bottom of the older pile she undid the elastic tucked away in one of the envelopes she was surprised to find a letter of recent dateoctober she glanced at it read involuntarily the first lines and then with a little cry turned it over it was from cecil grainger she put it back into the envelope whence it came and sat still  after a while she could not tell how long she heard hugh stamping the snow from his feet in the little entry beside the study and in a few moments he entered rubbing his hands and holding them out to the blaze  hello honora he said are you still at it whats the mattera hitch  she reached mechanically into the envelope took out the letter and handed it to him  i found it just now hugh i didnt read much of iti didnt mean to read any its from mr grainger and you must have overlooked it  he took it  from cecil he said in an odd voice i wasnt aware that he had sent me anythingrecently  as he read she felt the anger rise within him she saw it in his eyes fixed upon the sheet and the sense of fear of irreparable loss that had come over her as she had sat alone awaiting him deepened and yet long expected verdicts are sometimes received in a spirit of recklessness he finished the letter and flung it in her lap  read it he said  oh hugh she protested tremulously perhapsperhaps id better not he laughed and that frightened her the more it was the laugh she was sure of the other man she had not known  ive always suspected that cecil was a foolnow im sure of it read it he repeated in a note of command that went oddly with his next sentence you will find that it is only ridiculous  this assurance of the comedy it contained however did not serve to fortify her misgivings it was written from a club     dear hugh herewith a few letters for the magnum opus which i have    extracted from aunt agatha judge gaines and others and to send    you my humble congratulations by george my boy you have dashed    off with a prize and no mistake ive never made any secret you    know of my admiration for honorai hope i may call her so now    and i just thought id tell you you could count on me for a friend    at court not that im any use now old boy ill have to be frank    with youi always was discreet silence and all that sort of    thing as much as my head is worth to open my mouth but i had an    idea it would be an act of friendship to let you know how things    stand let time and works speak and cecil will give the thing    a push at the proper moment i understand from one of the    intellectual journals i read that you have gone in for simple life    and scientific farming a deuced canny move and for the love of    heaven old man keep it up for a while anyhow i know its    difficult but keep it up i speak as a friend     they received your letters all right announcing your marriage    you always enjoyed a rowi wish you could have been on hand to see    and hear this one it was no place for a man of peace and i spent    two nights at the club ive never made any secret you know of    the fact that i think the pendleton connection hidebound and you    understand bessietheres no good of my explaining her youd have    thought divorce a brandnew invention of the devil instead of a    comparatively old institution and if you dont mind my saying so    my boy you took this fence a bit on the run the way you do    everything     the fact is divorce is going out of fashion maybe its because    the pendletongrenfell element have always set their patrician faces    against it maybe its been a bit overdone most people who have    tried it have discovered that the fire is no better than the frying    panboth hot as soon as they warm up of course old boy theres    nothing personal in this sit tight and stick to the simple life    thats your game as i see it no newsive never known things to    be so quiet jerry won over two thousand night before lasthe made    it no trumps in his own hand four times running                 yours                      cecil  honora returned this somewhat unique epistle to her husband and he crushed it there was an illrepressed terrifying savagery in the act and her heart was torn between fear and pity for this lone message of goodwill whatever its wording such it was a dark red flush had mounted his forehead to the roots of his short curly hair  well he said  she was fighting for her presence of mind flashes of his temper she had known but she had never seen the cruel fiendish thinghis anger not his anger but the anger of the destroyer that she beheld waking now after its long sleep and taking possession of him and transforming him before her very eyes she had been able to cope with the new man but she felt numb and powerless before the resuscitated demon of the old  what do you expect me to say hugh she faltered with a queer feeling that she was not addressing him  anything you like he replied  defend cecil  why should i defend him she said dully  because you have no pride  a few seconds elapsed before the full import and brutality of this insult reached her intelligence and she cried out his name in a voice shrill with anguish but he seemed to delight in the pain he had caused  you couldnt be expected i suppose to see that this letter is a dd impertinence filled with an outrageous flippancy a deliberate affront an implication that our marriage does not exist  she sat stunned knowing that the real pain would come later that which slowly awoke in her now as he paced the room was a high sense of danger and a persistent inability to regard the man who had insulted her as her husband he was rather an enemy to them both and he would overturn if he could the frail craft of their happiness in the storm she cried out to hugh as across the waters  noi have no pride hughit is gone i have thought of you only the fear that i might separate you from your family from your friends and ruin your future has killed my pride hemr grainger meant to be kind he is always like thatits his way of saying things he wishes to show that he is friendly to youto me  in spite of my relations cried chiltern stopping in the middle of the room they cease to be my relations from this day i disown them i say it deliberately so long as i live not one of them shall come into this house all my life they have begged me to settle down to come up here and live the life my father did very well now ive done it and i wrote to them and told them that i intended to live henceforth like a gentleman and a decent citizenmore than some of them do no i wash my hands of them if they were to crawl up here from the gate on their knees id turn them out  although he could not hear her she continued to plead  hugh try to think of howhow our marriage must have appeared to them not that i blame you for being angry we only thought of one thingour love her voice broke at the word and our own happiness we did not consider others it is that which sometimes has made me afraid that we believed ourselves above the law and now that we havebegun so well dont spoil it hugh give them time let them see by our works that we are in earnest that we intend to live useful lives  i dont mean to beg them she cried at sight of his eyes oh i dont mean that i dont mean to entreat them or even to communicate with them but they are your flesh and bloodyou must remember that let us prove that we arenotlike the others she said lifting her head and then it cannot matter to us what any one thinks we shall have justified our act to ourselves  but he was striding up and down the room again it was as she fearedher pleahad fallen on unheeding ears a sudden convulsive leaping of the inner fires sent him to his desk and he seized some notepaper from the rack honora rose to her feet and took a step towards him  hughwhat are you going to do  do he cried swinging in his chair and facing her im going to do what any man with an ounce of selfrespect would do under the circumstances im going to do what i was a fool not to have done three months agowhat i should have done if it hadnt been for you if in their contemptible pharisaical notions of morality they choose to forget what my mother and father were to them they cease to exist for me if its the last act of my life im going to tell them so  she stood gazing at him but she was as one of whom he took no account he turned to the desk and began to write with a deliberation all the more terrible to her because of the white anger he felt and still she stood he pressed the button on his desk and starling responded  i want a man from the stable to be ready to take some letters to town in half an hour he said  it was not until then that she turned and slowly left the room a mortal sickness seemed to invade her vitals and she went to her own chamber and flung herself face downward on the lace covering of the bed and the sobs that shook her were the totterings of the foundations of her universe for a while in the intensity of her anguish all thought was excluded presently however when the body was spent the mind began to practise its subtle and intolerable torture and she was invaded by a sense of loneliness colder than the space between the worlds  where was she to go whither flee now that his wrath was turned against her on the strength of his love alone she had pinned her faith discarded and scorned all other help and at the first contact with that greater power which he had taught her so confidently to despise that strength had broken  slowly she gazed back over the path she had trod where roses once had held up smiling heads it was choked now by brambles that scratched her nakedness at every step ah how easily she had been persuaded to enter it we have the right to happiness he had said and she had looked into his eyes and believed him what was this strange elusive happiness that she had so pantingly pursued and never overtaken that essence pure and unalloyed with baser things ecstasy perhaps she had foundfor was it delirium fear was the boon companion of these or better the pestilence that stalked behind them ever ready to strike  then as though some one had turned on a lighta sickening yet penetrating blue lightshe looked at hugh chiltern she did not wish to look but that which had turned on the light and bade her was stronger than she she beheld as it were the elements of his being the very sources of the ceaseless restless energy that was driving him on and scan as she would no traces of the vaunted illimitable power that is called love could she discern love he possessed that she had not doubted and did not doubt even now but it had been given her to see that these springs had existed before love had come and would flow perchance after it had departed now she understood his anger it was like the anger of a fiercely rushing river striving to break a dam and invade the lands below with devastating floods all these months the waters had been mounting  turning at length from the consideration of this figure she asked herself whether if with her present knowledge she had her choice to make over again she would have chosen differently the answer was a startling negative she loved him incomprehensible unreasonable and un reasoning sentiment that she had received a wound she knew whether it were mortal or whether it would heal and leave a scar she could not say one salient awful fact she began gradually to realize that if she sank back upon the pillows she was lost little it would profit her to save her body she had no choice between her present precarious foothold and the abyss and wounded as she was she would have to fight there was no retreat  she sat up and presently got to her feet and went to the window and stared through the panes until she distinguished the blue whiteness of the fallen snow on her little balcony the night despite the clouds had a certain luminous quality then she drew the curtains searched for the switch and flooded the room with a soft glowthat beautiful room in which he had so proudly installed her four months before she smoothed the bed and walking to the mirror gazed intently at her face and then she bathed it afterwards she opened her window again admitting a flurry of snow and stood for some minutes breathing in the sharp air  three quarters of an hour later she was dressed and descending the stairs and as she entered the library dinner was announced let us spare honora the account of that repast or rather a recital of the conversation that accompanied it what she found to say under the eyes of the servants is of little value although the fact itself deserves to be commended as a high accomplishment and while she talked she studied the brooding mystery that he presented and could make nothing of it his mood was new it was not sullenness nor repressed rage and his answers were brief but he was not taciturn it struck her that in spite of a concentration such as she had never in her life bestowed on any other subject her knowledge of him of the chiltern she had marriedwas still wofully incomplete and that in proportion to the lack of perfection of that knowledge her danger was great perhaps the chiltern she had married was as yet in a formative state be this as it may what she saw depicted on his face tonight corresponded to no former experience  they went back to the library coffee was brought and carried off and honora was standing before the fire suddenly he rose from his chair crossed the room and before she could draw away seized and crushed her in his arms without a word she lay there inert bewildered as in the grip of an unknown force until presently she was aware of the beating of his heart and a glimmering of what he felt came to her nor was it an understandable thing except to the woman who loved him and yet and yet she feared it even in that instant of glory  when at last she dared to look up he kissed away the tears from her cheeks  i love you he said you must never doubt itdo you understand  yes hugh  you must never doubt it he repeated roughly  his contrition was a strange thingif it were contrition and lovewomans loveis sometimes the counsellor of wisdom her sole reproach was to return his kiss  presently she chose a book and he read to her     chapter xv the pillars of society  one morning as he gathered up his mail chiltern left lying on the breakfast table a printed circular an appeal from the trustees of the grenoble hospital as honora read it she remembered that this institution had been the favourite charity of his mother and that mrs chiltern at her death had bequeathed an endowment which at the time had been ample but grenoble having grown since then the deficit for this year was something under two thousand dollars and in a lower corner was a request that contributions be sent to mrs israel simpson  with the circular in her hand honora went thoughtfully up the stairs to her sittingroom the month was february the day overcast and muggy and she stood for a while apparently watching the holes made in the snow by the steady drip from the cap of the garden wall what she really saw was the face of mrs israel simpson a face that had haunted her these many months for mrs simpson had gradually grown in honoras mind to typify the hardness of heart of grenoble with grenoble obdurate what would become of the larger ambitions of hugh chiltern  mrs simpson was indeed a redoubtable lady whose virtue shone with a particular high brightness on the sabbath her lamp was brimming with oil against the judgment day and she was as one divinely appointed to be the chastener of the unrighteous so at least honora beheld her her attire was rich but not gaudy and had the air of proclaiming the prosperity of israel simpson alone as its unimpeachable source her nose was long her lip slightly marked by a masculine and masterful emblem and her eyes protruded in such a manner as to give the impression of watchfulness on all sides  it was this watchfulness that our heroine grew to regard as a salient characteristic it never slepteven during mr stopfords sermons she was aware of it when she entered the church and she was sure that it escorted her as far as the carriage on her departure it seemed to oppress the congregation and honora had an idea that if it could have been withdrawn her cruel proscription would have ended for at times she thought that she read in the eyes of some of those who made way for her friendliness and even compassion  it was but natural perhaps in the situation in which our heroine found herself that she should have lost her sense of proportion to the extent of regarding this lady in the light of a remorseless dragon barring her only path to peace and those who might have helped herif any there werefeared the dragon as much as she mrs simpson undoubtedly would not have relished this characterization and she is not to have the opportunity of presenting her side of the case we are looking at it from honoras view and honora beheld chimeras the woman changed for honora the very aspect of the house of god it was she who appeared to preside there or rather to rule by terror and honora as she glanced at her during the lessons often wondered if she realized the appalling extent of her cruelty was this woman who begged so audibly to be delivered from pride vainglory and hypocrisy in reality a christian honora hated her and yet she prayed that god would soften her heart was there no way in which she could be propitiated appeased for the sake of the thing desired and which it was given this woman to withhold she was willing to humble herself in the dust  honora laid the hospital circular on the desk beside her account book she had an ample allowance from hugh but lying in a new york bank was what remained of the unexpected legacy she had received from her father and it was from this that she presently drew a cheque for five hundred dollarsa little sacrifice that warmed her blood as she wrote not for the unfortunate in the hospital was she making it but for him and that she could do this from the little store that was her very own gave her a thrill of pride she would never need it again if he deserted her it mattered little what became of her if he deserted her  she sat gazing out of the window over the snow and a new question was in her heart was it as a husbandthat he loved her did their intercourse have that intangible quality of safety that belonged to married life and was it not as a mistress rather than a wife that in their isolation she watched his moods so jealously a mistress her lips parted and she repeated the word aloud for selftorture is human  her mind dwelt upon their intercourse there were the days they spent together and the evenings working or reading ah but had the time ever been when in the depths of her being she had felt the real security of a wife when she had not always been dimly conscious of a desire to please him of a struggle to keep him interested and contented and there were the days when he rode alone the nights when he read or wrote alone when her joy was turned to misery there were the alternating periods of passion and alienation alienation perhaps was too strong a word nevertheless at such times her feeling was one of desolation  his heart she knew was bent upon success at grenoble and one of the books which they had recently read together was a masterly treatise by an englishman on the lifework of an american statesman the vast width of the country from the atlantic to the pacific was stirred with politics a better era was coming the pulse of the nation beating with renewed life a stronger generation was arising to take the republic into its own hands a campaign was in progress in the state and twice her husband had gone some distance to hear the man who embodied the new ideas and had come back moody and restless like a warrior condemned to step aside suppose his hopes were blightedwhat would happen would the spirit of reckless adventure seize him again would the wilds call him or the city she did not dare to think  it was not until two mornings later that hugh tossed her across the breakfast table a pink envelope with a wide flap and rough edges its sender had taken advantage of the law that permits onecent stamps for local use  whos your friend honora he asked  she tried to look calmly at the envelope that contained her fate  its probably a dressmakers advertisement she answered and went on with the pretence of eating her breakfast  or an invitation to dine with mrs simpson he suggested laughingly as he rose its just the stationery she would choose  honora dropped her spoon in her eggcup it instantly became evident however that his remark was casual and not serious for he gathered up his mail and departed her hand trembled a little as she opened the letter and for a moment the large gold monogram of its sender danced before her eyes     dear madam permit me to thank you in the name of the trustees of    the grenoble hospital for your generous contribution and believe    me sincerely yours                    maria w simpson  the sheet fluttered to the floor  when sunday came for the first time her courage failed her she had heard the wind complaining in the night and the day dawned wild and wet she got so far as to put on a hat and veil and waterproof coat starling had opened the doors and through the frame of the doorway on the wet steps she saw the footman in his long mackintosh his umbrella raised to escort her to the carriage then she halted irresolute the impassive old butler stood on the sill a silent witness she knew to the struggle going on within her it seemed ridiculous indeed to play out the comedy with him who could have recited the lines and yet she turned to him  starling you may send the coachman back to the stable  very good madam  as she climbed the stairs she saw him gravely closing the doors she paused on the landing her sense of relief overborne by a greater sense of defeat there was still time she heard the wheels of the carriage on the circleyet she listened to them die away starling softly caught the latch and glanced up for an instant their looks crossed and she hurried on with palpitating breast reached her boudoir and closed the door the walls seemed to frown on her and she remembered that the sittingroom in st louis had worn that same look when as a child she had feigned illness in order to miss a day at school with a leaden heart she gazed out on the waste of melting snow and then tried in vain to read a novel that a review had declared amusing but a question always came between her and the pages was this the turning point of that silent but terrible struggle when she must acknowledge to herself that the world had been too strong for her after a while her loneliness became unbearable chiltern was in the library  home from church he inquired  i didnt go hugh  he looked up in surprise  why i thought i saw you start he said  its such a dreary day hugh  but that has never prevented you before  dont you think im entitled to one holiday she asked  but it was by a supreme effort she kept back the tears he looked at her attentively and got up suddenly and put his hands upon her shoulders she could not meet his eyes and trembled under his touch  honora he said why dont you tell me the truth  what do you mean hugh  i have been wondering how long youd stand it i mean that these women who call themselves christians have been brutal to you they havent so much as spoken to you in church and not one of them has been to this house to call isnt that so  dont let us judge them yet hugh she begged a little wildly feeling again the gathering of another destroying storm in him that might now sweep the last vestige of hope away and she seized the arguments as they came some of them may be prejudiced i know but othersothers i am sure are kind and they have had no reason to believe i should like to know themto work among them ii could not go to see them first i am glad to wait patiently until some accident brings me near them and remember hugh the atmosphere in which we both lived before we came herean atmosphere they regard as frivolous and pleasureloving people who are accustomed to it are not usually supposed to care to make friends in a village or to bother their heads about the improvement of a community society is not what it was in your mothers day who knew these people or their mothers and took an interest in what they were doing perhaps they think mehaughty she tried to smile i have never had an opportunity to show them that i am not  she paused breathless and saw that he was unconvinced  do you believe that honora he demanded  ii want to believe it and i am sure that if it is not true now it will become so if we only wait  he shook his head  never he said and dropped his hands and walked over to the fire she stood where he had left her  i understand she heard him say i understand that you sent mrs simpson five hundred dollars for the hospital simpson told me so yesterday at the bank  i had a little money of my ownfrom my father and i was glad to do it hugh that was your mothers charity  her selfcontrol was taxed to the utmost by the fact that he was moved she could not see his face but his voice betrayed it  and mrs simpson he asked after a moment  mrs simpson  she thanked you  she acknowledged the cheque as president i was not giving it to her but to the hospital  let me see the letter  ii have destroyed it  he brought his hands together forcibly and swung about and faced her  damn them he cried from this day i forbid you to have anything to do with them do you hear i forbid you theyre a set of confounded selfrighteous hypocrites give them time in all conscience they have had time enough and opportunity enough to know what our intentions are how long do they expect us to fawn at their feet for a word of recognition what have we done that we should be outlawed in this way by the very people who may thank my family for their prosperity where would israel simpson be today if my father had not set him up in business without knowing anything of our lives they pretend to sit in judgment on us why because you have been divorced and i married you ill make them pay for this  no she begged taking a step towards him you dont know what youre saying hugh i implore you not to do anything wait a little while oh it is worth trying so far the effort carried her and no farther perhaps at sight of the relentlessness in his eyes hope left her and she sank down on a chair and buried her face in her hands her voice broken by sobs it is my fault and i am justly punished i have no right to youi was wicked i was selfish to marry you i have ruined your life  he went to her and lifted her up but she was like a child whom passionate weeping has carried beyond the reach of words he could say nothing to console her plead as he might assume the blame and swear eternal fealty one fearful supreme fact possessed her the wreck of chiltern breaking against the rocks driven there by her  that she eventually grew calm again deserves to be set down as a tribute to the organism of the human body  that she was able to breathe to move to talk to go through the pretence of eating was to her in the nature of a mild surprise life went on but it seemed to honora in the hours following this scene that it was life only of the ability to feel she was utterly bereft her calmness must have been appalling her own indifference to what might happen nowif she could have realized iteven more so and in the afternoon wandering about the house she found herself in the conservatory it had been built on against the library and sometimes on stormy afternoons she had tea there with hugh in the redcushioned chairs beside the trickling fountain the flowers giving them an illusion of summer  under ordinary circumstances the sound of wheels on the gravel would have aroused her for hugh scarcely ever drove and it was not until she glanced through the open doors into the library that she knew that a visitor had come to highlawns he stood beside the rack for the magazines and reviews somewhat nervously fingering a heavy watch charm his large silk hat bottom upward on the chair behind him it was mr israel simpson she could see him plainly and she was by no means hidden from him by the leaves and yet she did not move he had come to see hugh she understood and she was probably going to stay where she was and listen it seemed of no use repeating to herself that this conversation would be of vital importance for the mechanism that formerly had recorded these alarms and spread them refused to work she saw chiltern enter and she read on his face that he meant to destroy it was no news to her she had known it for a long long timein fact ever since she had came to grenoble her curiosity strangely enoughor so it seemed afterwardswas centred on mr simpson as though he were an actor she had been very curious to see  it was this man and not her husband whom she perceived from the first was master of the situation his geniality was that of the commander of an overwhelming besieging force who could afford to be generous she seemed to discern the cloudy ranks of the legions behind him and they encircled the world he was aware of these legions and their presence completely annihilated the ancient habit of subserviency with which in former years he had been wont to enter this room and listen to the instructions of that formidable old lion the general so much was plain from the orchestra he went forward with a cheerful if ponderous bonhomie  ah hugh said he i got your message just in time i was on the point of going over to see old murdock seriously illyou knowlast time im afraid and mr simpson shook his head he held out his hand hugh did not appear to notice it  sit down mr simpson he said  mr simpson sat down chiltern took a stand before him  you asked me the other day whether i would take a certain amount of the stock and bonds of the grenoble light and power company in which you are interested and which is i believe to supply the town with electric light the present source being inadequate  so i did replied mr simpson urbanely and i believe the investment to be a good one there is no better power in this part of the country than psalters falls  i wished to inform you that i do not intend to go into the light and power company said chiltern  i am sorry to hear it mr simpson declared in my opinion if you searched the state for a more profitable or safer thing you could not find it  i have no doubt the investment is all that could be desired mr simpson i merely wished you to know as soon as possible that i did not intend to put my money into it there are one or two other little matters which you have mentioned during the week you pointed out that it would be an advantage to grenoble to revive the county fair and you asked me to subscribe five thousand dollars to the fair association  this time mr simpson remained silent  i have come to the conclusion today not to subscribe a cent i also intend to notify the church treasurer that i will not any longer rent a pew or take any further interest in the affairs of st johns church my wife was kind enough i believe to send five hundred dollars to the grenoble hospital that will be the last subscription from any member of my family i will resign as a director of the grenoble bank tomorrow and my stock will be put on the market and finally i wished to tell you that henceforth i do not mean to aid in any way any enterprise in grenoble  during this announcement which had been made with an ominous calmness mr simpson had gazed steadily at the brass andirons he cleared his throat  my dear hugh said he what you have said pains me excessivelyexcessively iahemfail to grasp it as an old friend of your familyof your fatheri take the liberty of begging you to reconsider your words  chilterns eyes blazed  since you have mentioned my father mr simpson he exclaimed i may remind you that his son might reasonably have expected at your hands a different treatment than that you have accorded him you have asked me to reconsider my decision but i notice that you have failed to inquire into my reasons for making it i came back here to grenoble with every intention of devoting the best efforts of my life in aiding to build up the community as my father had done it was natural perhaps that i should expect a little tolerance a little friendliness a little recognition in return my wife was prepared to help me we did not ask much but you have treated us like outcasts neither you nor mrs simpson from whom in all conscience i looked for consideration and friendship have as much as spoken to mrs chiltern in church you have made it clear that while you are willing to accept our contributions you cared to have nothing to do with us whatever if i have overstated the case please correct me  mr simpson rose protestingly  my dear hugh he said this is very painful i beg that you will spare me  my name is chiltern answered hugh shortly will you kindly explain if you can why the town of grenoble has ignored us  israel simpson hesitated a moment he seemed older when he looked at chiltern again and in his face commiseration and indignation were oddly intermingled his hand sought his watch chain  yes i will tell you he replied slowly although in all my life no crueller duty has fallen on me it is because we in grenoble are oldfashioned in our views of morality and i thank god we are so it is because you have married a divorced woman under circumstances that have shocked us the church to which i belong and whose teachings i respect does not recognize such a marriage and you have in my opinion committed an offence against society to recognize you by social intercourse would be to condone that offence to open the door to practices that would lead in a short time to the decay of our people  israel simpson turned and pointed a shaking forefinger at the portrait of general augus chiltern  and i affirm here fearlessly before you that he your father would have been the last to recognize such a marriage  chiltern took a step forward and his fingers tightened  you will oblige me by leaving my fathers name out of this discussion he said  but israel simpson did not recoil  if we learn anything by example in this world mr chiltern he continued and it is my notion that we do i am indebted to your father for more than my start in life through many years of intercourse with him and contemplation of his character i have gained more than richesyou have forced me to say this thing i am sorry if i have pained you but i should not be true to the principles to which he himself was consistent in life and which he taught by example so many others if i ventured to hope that social recognition in grenoble would be accorded you or to aid in any way such recognition as long as i live i will oppose it there are apparently larger places in the world and less humble people who will be glad to receive you i can only hope as an old friend and wellwisher of your family that you may find happiness  israel simpson fumbled for his hat picked it up and left the room for a moment chiltern stood like a man turned to stone and then he pressed the button on the wall behind him     volume 8     chapter xvi in which a mirror is held up  spring came to highlawns eden tinted with myriad tender greens yellowgreens like the beech boughs over the old wall and gentle bluegreens like the turf and the waters of the lake were blue and white in imitation of the cloudflecked sky it seemed to honora as she sat on the garden bench that the yellow and crimson tulips could not open wide enough their cups to the sun  in these days she looked at her idol and for the first time believed it to be within her finite powers to measure him she began by asking herself if it were really she who had ruined his life and whether he would ultimately have redeemed himself if he had married a woman whom the world would have recognized thus did the first doubt invade her heart it was of him she was thinking still and always but there was the doubt if he could have stood this supreme test of isolation of the worlds laughter and scorn although it would have made her own heavy burden of responsibility heavier yet could she still have rejoiced that he should crumble was the greatest of her punishments  was he crumbling in these months she could not quite be sure and she tried to shut her eyes when the little pieces fell off to remind herself that she must make allowances for the severity of his disappointment spring was here the spring to which he had so eagerly looked forward and yet the listlessness with which he went about his work was apparent sometimes he did not appear at breakfast although honora clung with desperation to the hour they had originally fixed sometimes mr manning waited for him until nearly ten oclock only to receive curt dismissal he went off for long rides alone and to the despair of the groom brought back the horses in a lather with drooping heads and heaving sides one of them he ruined he declared there wasnt a horse in the stable fit to give him exercise  often he sat for hours in his study brooding inaccessible she had the tenniscourt rolled and marked but the contests here were pitifullyunequal for the row of silver cups on his mantel engraved with many dates bore witness to his athletic prowess she wrote for a book on solitaire but after a while the sight of cards became distasteful with a secret diligence she read the reviews and sent for novels and memoirs which she scanned eagerly before they were begun with him once when she went into his study on an errand she stood for a minute gazing painfully at the cleared space on his desk where once had lain the papers and letters relative to the life of general angus chiltern  there were intervals in which her hope flared in which she tasted fearfully and with bated breath something that she had not thought to know again it was characteristic of him that his penitence was never spoken nor did he exhibit penitence he seemed rather at such times merely to become normally himself as one who changes personality apparently oblivious to the moods and deeds of yesterday and these occasions added perplexity to her troubles she could not reproach himwhich perhaps in any event she would have been too wise to do but she could not try as she would bring herself to the point of a discussion of their situation the risk she felt was too great now at least there were instances that made her hope that the hour might come  one fragrant morning honora came down to find him awaiting her and to perceive lying on her napkin certain distilled drops of the spring sunshine in language less poetic diamonds to be worn in the ears the wheel of fashion it appeared had made a complete revolution since the early days of his mothers marriage she gave a little exclamation and her hand went to her heart  they are brazilian stones he explained with a boyish pleasure that awoke memories and held her speechless i believe its very difficult if not impossible to buy them now my father got them after the war and i had them remounted and he pressed them against the pink lobes of her ears you look like the queen of sheba  how do you know she asked tremulously you never saw her  according to competent judges he replied she was the most beautiful woman of her time go upstairs and put them on  she shook her head an inspiration had come to her  wait she cried and that morning when hugh had gone out she sent for starling and startled him by commanding that the famous lowestoft set be used at dinner he stared at her and the corners of his mouth twitched and still he stood respectfully in the doorway  that is all starling  i beg pardon madam howhow many will there be at the table  just mr chiltern and i she replied but she did not look at him  it was superstition undoubtedly she was well aware that starling had not believed that the set would be used again an extraordinary order that might well have sent him away wondering for the lowestoft had been reserved for occasions ah but this was to be an occasion a festival the whimsical fancy grew in her mind as the day progressed and she longed with an unaccustomed impatience for nightfall and anticipation had a strange taste mathilde with the sympathetic gift of her nation shared the excitement of her mistress in this fete the curtains in the pink bedroom were drawn and on the bed in all its splendour of lace and roses was spread out the dinnergowna chefdoeuvre of madame barrieres as yet unworn and no vulgar worldly triumph was it to adorn  her heart was beating fast as she descended the stairway bright spots of colour flaming in her cheeks and the diamonds sparkling in her ears a prima donna might have guessed her feelings as she paused a little breathless on the wide landing under the windows she heard a footstep hugh came out of the library and stood motionless looking up at her but even those who have felt the silence and the stir that prefaces the clamorous applause of the thousands could not know the thrill that swept her under his tribute she came down the last flight of steps slowly and stopped in front of him  you are wonderful honora he said and his voice was not quite under control he took her hand that trembled in his and he seemed to be seeking to express something for which he could find no words thus may the king have looked upon rosamond in her bower upon a beauty created for the adornment of courts which he had sequestered for his eyes alone  honora as though merely by the touch of his hand in hers divined his thought  if you think me so dear she whispered happily its all i ask  and they went in to dinner as to a ceremony it was indeed a ceremony filled for her with some occult sacred meaning that she could not put into words a feast symbolical starling was sent to the winecellar to bring back a cobwebbed madeira near a century old brought out on rare occasions in the family and hugh when his glass was filled looked at his wife and raised it in silence to his lips  she never forgot the scene the red glow of light from the shaded candles on the table and the corners of the dining room filled with gloom the old butler like a high priest standing behind his masters chair the long windows with the curtains drawn in the deep panelled arches the carved white mantelpiece the glint of silver on the sideboard with its winecooler underneaththese spoke of generations of respectability and achievement would this absorbed isolation this marvellous wild love of theirs be the end of it all honora as one detached as a ghost in the corner saw herself in the picture with startling clearness when she looked up she met her husbands eyes always she met them and in them a questioning almost startled look that was new is it the earrings she asked at last i dont know he answered i cant tell they seem to have changed you but perhaps they have brought out something in your face and eyes i have never seen before  andyou like it hugh  yes i like it he replied and added enigmatically but i dont understand it  she was silent and oddly satisfied trusting to fate to send more mysteries  two days had not passed when that restlessness for which she watched so narrowly revived he wandered aimlessly about the place and flared up into such a sudden violent temper at one of the helpers in the fields that the man ran as for his life and refused to set foot again on any of the chiltern farms in the afternoon he sent for honora to ride with him and scolded her for keeping him waiting and he wore a spur and pressed his horse so savagely that she cried out in remonstrance although at such times she had grown to fear him  oh hugh how can you be so cruel  the beast has no spirit he said shortly ill get one that has  their road wound through the western side of the estate towards misty rolling country in the folds of which lay countless lakes and at length they caught sight of an unpainted farmhouse set amidst a white cloud of apple trees in bloom on the doorstep whittling sat a bearded unkempt farmer with a huge frame in answer to hughs question he admitted that he had a horse for sale stuck his knife in the step rose and went off towards the barn near by and presently reappeared leading by a halter a magnificent black the animal stood jerking his head blowing and pawing the ground while chiltern examined him  hes been ridden he asked  the man nodded  chiltern sprang to the ground and began to undo his saddle girths a sudden fear seized honora  oh hugh youre not going to ride him she exclaimed  why not how else am i going to find out anything about him  he looksdangerous she faltered  im tired of horses that havent any life in them he said as he lifted off the saddle  i guess wed better get him in the barn said the farmer  honora went behind them to witness the operation which was not devoid of excitement the great beast plunged savagely when they tightened the girths and closed his teeth obstinately against the bit but the farmer held firmly to his nose and shut off his wind they led him out from the barn floor  your name chiltern asked the farmer  yes said hugh curtly  thought so said the farmer and he held the horses head  honora had a feeling of faintness  hugh do be careful she pleaded  he paid no heed to her his eyes she noticed had a certain feverish glitter of animation of impatience such as men of his type must wear when they go into battle he seized the horses mane he put his foot in the stirrup the astonished animal gave a snort and jerked the bridle from the farmers hand but chiltern was in the saddle with knees pressed tight  there ensued a struggle that honora will never forget and although she never again saw that farmhouse its details and surroundings come back to her in vivid colours when she closes her eyes the great horse in every conceivable pose with veins standing out and knotty muscles twisting in his legs and neck and thighs once when he dashed into the apple trees she gave a cry a branch snapped and chiltern emerged still seated with his hat gone and the blood trickling from a scratch on his forehead she saw him strike with his spurs and in a twinkling horse and rider had passed over the dilapidated remains of a fence and were flying down the hard clay road disappearing into a dip a reverberating sound like a single stroke told them that the bridge at the bottom had been crossed  in an agony of terror honora followed her head on fire her heart pounding faster than the hoof beats but the animal she rode though a good one was no match for the great infuriated beast which she pursued presently she came to a wooded corner where the road forked thrice and beyond not without difficultybrought her sweating mare to a stand the quality of her fear changed from wild terror to cold dread a hermit thrush in the wood near by broke the silence with a song inconceivably sweet at last she went back to the farmhouse hoping against hope that hugh might have returned by another road but he was not there the farmer was still nonchalantly whittling  oh how could you let any one get on a horse like that she cried  youre his wife aint you he asked  something in the mans manner seemed to compel her to answer in spite of the form of the question  i am mrs chiltern she said  he was looking at her with an expression that she found incomprehensible his glance was penetrating yet here again she seemed to read compassion he continued to gaze at her and presently when he spoke it was as though he were not addressing her at all  you put me in mind of a young girl i used to know he said seems like a long time ago youre pretty and youre young and ye didnt know what you were doin ill warrant lost your head he has a way of gittin emalways had  honora did not answer she would have liked to have gone away but that which was stronger than her held her  she didnt live here he explained waving his hand deprecatingly towards the weatherbeaten house we lived over near morrisville in them days and he dont remember me your husband dont i aint surprised ive got considerable older  honora was trembling from head to foot and her hands were cold  ive got her picture in there if yed like to look at it he said after a while  oh no she cried oh no  well i dont know as i blame you he sat down again and began to whittle funny thing chance he remarked whod a thought i should have owned that there hoss and he should have come around here to ride it  she tried to speak but she could not the hideous imperturbability of the mans hatred sickened her and her husband the chips fell in silence until a noise on the road caused them to look up chiltern was coming back she glanced again at the farmer but his face was equally incapable or equally unwilling to express regret chiltern rode into the dooryard the blood from the scratch on his forehead had crossed his temple and run in a jagged line down his cheek his very hair as she had sometimes seen it was damp with perspiration blacker kinkier his eyes hard reckless bloodshot so in the past must he have emerged from dozens of such wilful brutal contests with man and beast he had beaten the sweatstained horse temporarilysuch was the impression honora received but she knew that he would like to have killed it for its opposition  give me my hat will you he cried to the farmer  to her surprise the man obeyed chiltern leaped to the ground  what do you want for him he demanded  ill take five hundred dollars  bring him over in the morning said chiltern curtly  they rode homeward in silence honora had not been able to raise her voice against the purchase and she seemed powerless now to warn her husband of the mans enmity she was thinking rather of the horror of the tragedy written on the farmers face to which he had given her the key hugh chiltern to whom she had intrusted her life and granted her all had done this thing ruthlessly even as he had satisfied today his unbridled cravings in maltreating a horse and she thought of that other woman on whose picture she had refused to look what was the essential difference between that woman and herself he had wanted them both he had taken them both for his pleasure heedless of the pain he might cause to others and to them for her perhaps the higher organism had been reserved the higher torture she did not know the vision of the girl in the outer darkness reserved for castaways was terrible  up to this point she had as it were been looking into one mirror now another was suddenly raised behind her and by its aid she beheld not a single but countless images of herself endlessly repeated how many others besides this girl had there been the question gave her the shudder of the contemplation of eternity it was not the first time honora had thought of his past but until today it had lacked reality until today she had clung to the belief that he had been misunderstood until today she had considered those acts of his of the existence of which she was collectively aware under the generic term of wild oats he had had too much money and none had known how to control him now through this concrete example of anothers experience she was given to understand that which she had strangely been unable to learn from her own and she had fancied in her folly that she could control him unable as yet to grasp the full extent of her calamity she rode on by his side until she was aware at last that they had reached the door of the house at highlawns  you look pale he said as he lifted her off her horse the demon in him she perceived was tired  do i  whats the matter  nothing she answered  he laughed  its confoundedly silly to get frightened that way he declared the beast only wants riding  three mornings later she was seated in the garden with a frame of fancy work sometimes she put it down the weather was overcast langourous and there was a feeling of rain in the air chiltern came in through the gaffe and looked at her  im going to new york on the noon train he said  to new york  yes why not  theres no reason why you shouldnt if you wish to she replied picking up her frame  anything i can get you he asked  no thank you  youve been in such a deuced queer mood the last few days i cant make you out honora  you ought to have learned something about women by this time she said  it seems to me he announced that we need a little livening up     chapter xvii the renewal of an ancient hospitality  there were six letters from him written from a club representing the seven days of his absence he made no secret of the fact that his visit to the metropolis was in the nature of a relaxation and a change of scene but the letters themselves contained surprisingly little information as to how he was employing his holiday he had encountered many old friends supposedly all of the male sex among themmost welcome of surprises to himmr george pembroke a boon companion at harvard and this mention of boon companionship brought up to honora a sufficiently vivid idea of mr pembrokes characteristics the extent of her knowledge of this gentleman consisted in the facts that he was a bachelor a member of a prominent philadelphia family and that time hung heavy on his hands  one morning she received a telegram to the effect that her husband would be home that night bringing three people with him he sent his love but neglected to state the names and sexes of the prospective guests and she was still in a quandary as to what arrangements to make when starling appeared in answer to her ring  you will send the omnibus to the five oclock train she said there will be three extra places at dinner and tea when mr chiltern arrives  although she strove to speak indifferently she was sure from the way the old man looked at her that her voice had not been quite steady of late her curious feeling about him had increased in intensity and many times during this week she had spent alone she had thought that his eyes had followed her with sympathy she did not resent this her world having now contracted to that wide house there was a comfort in knowing that there was one in it to whom she could turn in need for she felt that she could turn to starling he alone apparently had measured the full depth of her trouble nay had silently predicted it from the beginning and today as he stood before her she had an almost irresistible impulse to speak just a worda human word would have been such a help to her and how ridiculous the social law that kept the old man standing there impassive respectful when this existed between them her tragedy was his tragedy not in the same proportion perhaps nevertheless he had the air of one who would die of it  and she would she die what would become of her when she thought of the long days and months and years that stretched ahead of her she felt that her soul would not be able to survive the process of steady degradation to which it was sure to be subjected for she was a prisoner the uttermost parts of the earth offered no refuge today she knew was to see the formal inauguration of that process she had known torture but it had been swift obliterating excruciating and hereafter it was to be slow one turn at a time of the screws squeezing by infinitesimal degrees the life out of her soul and in the endmost fearful thought of allin the end painless painless she buried her head in her arms on the little desk shaken by sobs  how she fought that day to compose herself fought and prayed prayed wildly to a god whose help nevertheless she felt she had forfeited who was visiting her with just anger at halfpast four she heard the carriage on the far driveway going to the station and she went down and walked across the lawn to the pond and around it anything to keep moving she hurried back to the house just in time to reach the hall as the omnibus backed up and the first person she saw descend after hugh was mrs kame  here we are honora she cried i hope youre glad to see us and that youll forgive our coming so informally you must blame hugh weve brought adele  the second lady was indeed none other than mrs eustace rindge formerly mrs dicky farnham and she is wortheven at this belated stage in our chronicle an attempted sketch or at least an attempted impression she was fair and slim as a schoolgirl not very tall not exactly petite at first sight she might have been taken for a particularly immature debutante and her dress was youthful and rather mannish her years at this period of her career were in truth but two and twenty yet she had contrived in the comparatively brief time since she had reached the supposed age of discretion to marry two men and build two houses and incidentally to see a considerable portion of what is known as the world the suspicion that she was not as innocent as a dove came to one on closer inspection as a shock her eyes were tired though not from loss of sleep and her mannerhow shall it be described to those whose happy lot in life has never been to have made the acquaintance of mrs rindges humbler sisters who have acquiredmore coarsely it is truethe same camaraderie she was one of those for whom seemingly sex does not exist her air of goodfellowship with men was eloquent of a precise knowledge of what she might expect from them and she was prepared to do her own policingnot from any deep moral convictions she belonged logically to that world which is disposed to take the law into its own hands and she was the possessor of five millions of dollars  i came along she said to honora as she gave her handbag to a footman i hope you dont mind abby and i were shopping and we ran into hugh and georgie yesterday at sherrys and weve been together ever since not quite thatbut almost hugh begged us to come up and there didnt seem to be any reason why we shouldnt so we telephoned down to banbury for our trunks and maids and weve played bridge all the way by the way georgie wheres my pocketbook  mr pembroke handed it over and was introduced by hugh he looked at honora and his glance somehow betokened that he was in the habit of looking only once he had apparently made up his mind about her before he saw her but he looked again evidently finding her at variance with a preconceived idea and this time she flushed a little under his stare and she got the impression that mr pembroke was a man from whom few secrets of a certain kind were hid she felt that he had seized at a second glance a situation that she had succeeded in hiding from the women he was surprised but cynically so he was the sort of person who had probably possessed at harvard the knowledge of the world of a tammany politician he had long ago written his booksuch as it wasand closed it or rather he had worked out his system at a precocious age and it had lasted him ever since he had decided that undergraduate life freed from undergraduate restrictions was a good thing and he did not even in these days object to breaking something valuable occasionally  his physical attributes are more difficult to describe so closely were they allied to those which for want of a better word must be called mental he was neither tall nor short he was well fed but hard his shoulders too broad his head a little large if he should have happened to bump against one the result would have been a bruisenot for him his eyes were blue his light hair short and there was a slight baldness beginning his face was redtanned there was not the slightest doubt that he could be effectively rude and often was but it was evident for some reason that he meant to be gracious for mr pembroke to honora perhaps this was the result of the second glance one of his name had not lacked indeed for instructions in gentility it must not be thought that she was in a condition to care much about what mr pembroke thought or did and yet she felt instinctively that he had changed his greeting between that first and second glance  i hope youll forgive my coming in this way he said im an old friend of hughs  im very glad to have hughs friends she answered  he looked at her again  is tea ready inquired mrs kame im famished and as they walked through the house to the garden where the table was set beside the stone seat i dont see how you ever can leave this place honora ive always wanted to come here but its even more beautiful than i thought  its very beautiful said honora  ill have a whiskey and soda if i may announced mrs rindge open one georgie  the third today said mr pembroke sententiously as he obeyed  i dont care i dont see what business it is of yours  except to open them he replied  youd have made a fortune as a barkeeper she observed dispassionately as she watched the process  hes made fortunes for a good many said chiltern  not without some expert assistance i could mention mr pembroke retorted  at this somewhat pointed reference to his ancient habits chiltern laughed  youve each had three today yourselves said mrs rindge in whose bosom mr pembrokes remark evidently rankled without counting those you had before you left the club  afterwards mrs kame expressed a desire to walk about a little a proposal received with disfavour by all but honora who as hostess responded  i feel perfectly delightful declared mrs rindge whats the use of moving about and she sank back in the cushions of her chair  this observation was greeted with unrestrained merriment by mr pembroke and hugh honora sick at heart led mrs kame across the garden and through the gate in the wall it was a perfect evening of early june the great lawn a vivid green in the slanting light all day the cheerful music of the horsemowers had been heard and the air was fragrant with the odour of grass freshly cut the long shadows of the maples and beeches stretched towards the placid surface of the lake dimpled here and there by a fishs swirl the spiraeas were laden as with freshly fallen snow a lone judastree was decked in pink the steep pastures beyond the water were touched with gold while to the northward on the distant hills tender blue lights gathered lovingly around the copses mrs kame sighed  what a terrible thing it is she said that we are never satisfied its the men who ruin all this for us i believe and prevent our enjoying it look at adele  honora had indeed looked at her  i found out the other day what is the matter with her shes madly in love with dicky  withwith her former husband  yes with poor little innocent dicky farnham whos probably still congratulating himself like a canary bird thats got out of a cage somehow dickys always reminded me of a canary perhaps its his name isnt it odd that she should be in love with him  i think replied honora slowly that its a tragedy  it is a tragedy mrs kame hastily agreed to me this case is one of the most incomprehensible aspects of the tender passion adeles idea of existence is a steeplechase with nothing but waterjumps dickys to loiter around in a gypsy van and sit in the sun during his brief matrimonial experience with her he nearly died for want of breathor rather the life was nearly shaken out of him and yet she wants dicky again shed run away with him tomorrow if he should come within hailing distance of her  and her husband asked honora  eustace did you ever see him that accounts for your question he only left france long enough to come over here and make love to her and he swears hell never leave it again if she divorces him hell have to have alimony  at last honora was able to gain her own room but even seclusion though preferable to the companionship of her guests was almost intolerable the tragedy of mrs rindge had servedif such a thing could beto enhance her own a sudden spectacle of a woman in a more advanced stage of desperation would she honora ever become like that up to the present she felt that suffering had refined her and a great love had burned away all that was false but nownow that her god had turned to clay what would happen desperation seemed possible notwithstanding the awfulness of the example no she would never come to that and she repeated it over and over to herself as she dressed as though to strengthen her will  during her conversation with mrs kame she had more than once suspected in spite of her efforts that the lady had read her state of mind for mrs kames omissions were eloquent to the discerning chilterns relatives had been mentioned with a casualness intended to imply that no breach existed and the fiction that honora could at any moment take up her former life delicately sustained mrs kame had adaptably chosen the attitude after a glance around her that honora preferred highlawns to the world a choice of which she let it be known that she approved while deploring that a frivolous character put such a life out of the question for herself she made her point without overemphasis on the other hand honora had read mrs kame no very careful perusal was needed to convince her that the lady was unmoral and that in characteristics she resembled the chameleon but she read deeper she perceived that mrs kame was convinced that she honora would adjust herself to the new conditions after a struggle and that while she had a certain sympathy in the struggle mrs kame was of opinion that the sooner it was over with the better all women were born to be disillusionized such was the key at any rate to the ladys conduct that evening at dinner when she capped the anecdotes of mr pembroke and mrs rindge and even of chiltern with others not less risque but more fastidiously and ingeniously suggestive the reader may be spared their recital  since the meeting in the restaurant the day before which had resulted in hughs happy inspiration that the festival begun should be continued indefinitely at highlawns a kind of freemasonry had sprung up between the four honora found herself mercifully outside the circle for such was the lively character of the banter that a considerable adroitness was necessary to obtain between the talk andlaughter the ear of the company and so full were they of the reminiscences which had been crowded into the thirty hours or so they had spent together that her comparative silence remained unnoticed to cite an example mr pembroke was continually being addressed as the third vicepresident an allusion that mrs rindge eventually explained  you ought to have been with us coming up on the train she cried to honora i thought surely wed be put off we were playing bridge in the little room at the end of the car when the conductor came for our tickets georgie had em in his pocket but he told the man to go away that he was the third vicepresident of the road and we were his friends the conductor asked him if he were mr wheeler or some such name and georgie said he was surprised he didnt know him well the man stood there in the door and georgie picked up his hand and made it heartsor was it diamonds georgie  spades said that gentleman promptly  at any rate mrs rindge continued we all began to play although we were ready to blow up with laughter and after a while georgie looked around and said what are you there yet my dear you ought to have seen the conductors face he said it was his duty to establish georgies identity or something like that and georgie told him to get off at the next station and buy warings magazinewas that it georgie  how the deuce should i know  well some such magazine georgie said hed find an article in it on the railroad kings and princes of america and that his picture georgies was among the very first at this juncture in her narrative mrs rindge shrieked with laughter in which she was joined by mrs kame and hugh and she pointed a forefinger across the table at mr pembroke who went on solemnly eating his dinner georgie gave him ten cents with which to buy the magazine she added a little hysterically well there was a frightful row and a lot of men came down to that end of the car and we had to shut the door the conductor said the most outrageous things and georgie pretended to be very indignant too and gave him the tickets under protest he told georgie he ought to be in an asylum for the criminally insane and georgie advised him to get a photograph album of the high officials of the railroad the conductor said georgies picture was probably in the rogues gallery and we lost two packs of cards out of the window  such had been the more innocent if eccentric diversions with which they had whiled away the time when dinner was ended a renewal of the bridge game was proposed for it had transpired at the dinnertable that mrs rindge and hugh had been partners all day as a result of which there was a considerable balance in their favour this balance mr pembroke was palpably anxious to wipe out or at least to reduce but mrs kame insisted that honora should cut in and the others supported her  we tried our best to get a man for you said mrs rindge to honora didnt we abby but in the little time we had it was impossible the only man we saw was ned carrington and hugh said he didnt think youd want him  hugh showed a rare perception said honora  be it recorded that she smiled one course had been clear to her from the first although she found it infinitely difficult to follow she was determined cost what it might to carry through her part of the affair with dignity but without stiffness this is not the place to dwell upon the tax to her strength  come on honora said hugh cut in his tone was of what may be termed a rough good nature she had not seen him alone since his return but he had seemed distinctly desirous that she should enjoy the festivities he had provided and not to yield would have been to betray herself  the game with its intervals of hilarity was inaugurated in the library and by midnight it showed no signs of abating at this hour the original four occupied the table for the second time and endurance has its limits the atmosphere of liberty hall that prevailed made honoras retirement easier  im sure you wont mind if i go to bed she said ive been so used to the routine ofof the chickens she smiled and ive spent the day in the open air  certainly my dear said mrs kame i know exactly how one feels in the country im sure its dreadfully late well have one more rubber and then stop  oh dont stop replied honora please play as long as you like  they didnt stopat least after one more rubber honora as she lay in the darkness looking through the open square of her window at the silver stars heard their voiced and their laughter floating up at intervals from below and the little clock on her mantel had struck the hour of three when the scraping of chairs announced the breaking up of the party and even after that an unconscionable period elapsed beguiled undoubtedly by anecdotes spells of silencewhen she thought they had goneending in more laughter finally there was a crash of breaking glass a climax of uproarious mirth and all was still  she could not have slept much but the birds were singing when she finally awoke the sunlight pouring into her window and the hands of her clock pointed to halfpast seven when she rang her bell it was a relief to breakfast alone or at least to sip her coffee in solitude and the dew was still on the grass as she crossed the wide lawn and made her way around the lake to the path that entered the woods at its farther end she was not tired yet she would have liked to have lain down under the green panoply of the forest where the wild flowers shyly raised sweet faces to be kissed and lose herself in the forgetfulness of an eternal sleep never to go back again to an eden contaminated but when she lingered the melody of a thrush pierced her through and through at last she turned and reluctantly retraced her steps as one whose hour of reprieve has expired  if mrs rindge had a girlish air when fully arrayed for the day she looked younger and more angular still in that article of attire known as a dressing gown and her eyes honora remarked were peculiarly bright glittering perhaps would better express the impression they gave as though one got a glimpse through them of an inward consuming fire her laughter rang shrill and clear as honora entered the hall by the rear door and the big clock proclaimed that the hour was halfpast eleven hugh and mr pembroke were standing at the foot of the stairs gazing upward and honora following their glances beheld the two ladies in the negligee referred to above with their elbows on the railing of the upper hall and their faces between their hands engaged in a lively exchange of compliments with the gentlemen mrs kame looked sleepy  such a night she said suppressing a yawn my dear you did well to go to bed  and to cap it all cried mrs rindge georgie fell over backwards in one of those beautiful adam chairs and theres literally nothing left of it if an ocean steamer had hit it or a freight train it couldnt have been more thoroughly demolished  you pushed me declared mr pembroke  did i hugh i barely touched him  you knocked him into a cocked hat said hugh and if youd been in that kimono you could have done it even easier  georgie broke the whole whiskey serviceor whatever it is mrs rindge went on addressing honora again he fell into it  hes all right this morning observed mrs kame critically  i think ill take to swallowing swords and glass and things in public i can do it so well said mr pembroke  i hope you got what you like for breakfast said honora to the ladies  hurry up and come down adele said hugh if you want to look over the horses before lunch  its georgies fault replied mrs rindge hes been standing in the door of my sittingroom for a whole halfhour talking nonsense  a little later they all set out for the stables these buildings at highlawns framed by great trees were oldfashioned and picturesque surrounding three sides of a court with a yellow brick wall on the fourth the roof of the main building was capped by a lantern the home of countless pigeons mrs rindge was in a habit and one by one the saddle horses were led out chiefly for her inspection and she seemed to honora to become another woman as she looked them over with a critical eye and discussed them with hugh and ogrady the studgroom and talked about pedigrees and strains for she was renowned in this department of sport on many fields both for recklessness and skill  where did you get that brute hugh she asked presently  honora who had been talking to pembroke looked around with a start and at the sight of the great black horse bought on that unforgettable day she turned suddenly faint  over here in the country about ten miles chiltern was saying i heard of him but i didnt expect anything until i went to look at him last week  what do you call him asked mrs rindge  i havent named him  ill give you a name  chiltern looked at her what is it he said  oblivion she replied  by george adele he exclaimed you have a way of hitting it off  will you let me ride him this afternoon she asked  im aa candidate for oblivion she laughed a little and her eyes shone feverishly  no you dont he said im giving you the grey hes got enough in him for any womaneven for you and besides i dont think the black ever felt a side saddle or any other kind until last week  ive got another habit she said eagerly id rather ride him astride ill match you to see who has him  chiltern laughed  no you dont he repeated ill ride him today and consider it tomorrow  ii think ill go back to the house said honora to pembroke its rather hot here in the sun  im not very keen about sunshine either he declared  at lunch she was unable to talk to sustain at least a conversation that word oblivion which mrs rindge had so aptly applied to the horse was constantly on her lips and it would not have surprised her if she had spoken it she felt as though a heavy weight lay on her breast and to relieve its intolerable pressure drew in her breath deeply she was wild with fear the details of the great room fixed themselves indelibly in her brain the subdued light the polished table laden with silver and glass the roses and the purple hothouse grapes all this seemed in some way to be an ironic prelude to disaster hugh pausing in his badinage with mrs rindge looked at her  cheer up honora he said  im afraid this first houseparty is too much for her said mrs kame  honora made some protest that seemed to satisfy them tried to rally herself and succeeded sufficiently to pass muster after lunch they repaired again to the bridge table and at four hugh went upstairs to change into his riding clothes five minutes longer she controlled herself and then made some paltry excuse indifferent now as to what they said or thought and followed him she knocked at his dressingroom door and entered he was drawing on his boots hello honora he said  honora turned to his man and dismissed him  i wish to speak to mr chiltern alone  chiltern paused in his tugging at the straps and looked up at her  whats the matter with you today honora he asked you looked like the chief mourner at a funeral all through lunch  he was a little on edge that she knew he gave another tug at the boot and while she was still hesitating he began again  i ought to apologize i know for bringing these people up without notice but i didnt suppose youd object when you understood how naturally it all came about i thought a little livening up as i said wouldnt hurt us weve had a quiet winter to put it mildly he laughed a little i didnt have a chance to see you until this morning and when i went to your room they told me youd gone out  hugh she said laying her hand on his shoulder it isnt the guests if you want people and they amuse you imim glad to have them and if ive seemed to becold to them im sorry i tried my besti mean i did not intend to be cold ill sit up all night with them if you like and i didnt come to reproach you hugh ill never do thative got no right to  she passed her hand over her eyes if she had any wrongs if she had suffered any pain the fear that obsessed her obliterated all in spite of her disillusionment in spite of her newly acquired ability to see him as he was enough love remained to scatter when summoned her pride to the winds  having got on both boots he stood up  whats the trouble then he asked and he took an instants hold of her china habit he hadand smiled at her  he little knew how sublime in its unconscious effrontery his question was she tried to compose herself that she might be able to present comprehensively to his finite masculine mind the ache of today  hugh its that black horse she could not bring herself to pronounce the name mrs rindge had christened him  what about him he said putting on his waistcoat  dont ride him she pleaded iim afraid of himive been afraid of him ever since that day  it may be a foolish feeling i know sometimes the feelings that hurt women most are foolish if i tell you that if you ride him you will torture me im sure youll grant what i ask its such a little thing and it means so muchso much agony to me id do anything for yougive up anything in the world at your slightest wish dont ride him  this is a ridiculous fancy of yours honora the horse is all right ive ridden dozens of worse ones  oh im sure he isnt she cried call it fancy call it instinct call it anything you likebut i feel it hugh that womanmrs rindgeknows something about horses and she said he was a brute  yes he interrupted with a short laugh and she wants to ride him  hugh shes reckless iive been watching her since she came here and im sure shes reckless withwith a purpose  youre morbid he said shes one of the best sportswomen in the countrythats the reason she wanted to ride the horse look here honora id accede to any reasonable request but what do you expect me to do he demanded go down and say im afraid to ride him or that my wife doesnt want me to id never hear the end of it and the first thing adele would do would be to jump on him herselfa little wisp of a woman that looks as if she couldnt hold a shetland pony cant you see that what you ask is impossible  he started for the door to terminate a conversation which had already begun to irritate him for his anger in these days was very near the surface she made one more desperate appeal  hughthe man who sold himhe knew the horse was dangerous im sure he did from something he said to me while you were gone  these country people are all idiots and cowards declared chiltern ive known em a good while and they havent got the spirit of mongrel dogs i was a fool to think that i could do anything for them theyre kind and neighbourly arent they he exclaimed if that old rascal flattered himself he deceived me he was mistaken hed have been mightily pleased if the beast had broken my neck  hugh  i cant honora thats all there is to it i cant now dont cut up about nothing im sorry but ive got to go adeles waiting  he came back kissed her hurriedly turned and opened the door she followed him into the hallway knowing that she had failed knowing that she never could have succeeded there she halted and watched him go down the stairs and stand with her hands tightly pressed together voices reached her a hurrah from george pembroke and the pounding of hoofs on the driveway it had seemed such a little thing to ask  but she did not dwell upon this now when fear was gnawing her how she had humbled her pride for days and weeks and months for him and how he had refused her paltry request lest he should be laughed at her reflections then were not on his waning love she was filled with the terror of losing himof losing all that remained to her in the world presently she began to walk slowly towards the stairs descended them and looked around her the hall at least had not changed she listened and a bee hummed in through the open doorway a sudden longing for companionship possessed herno matter whose and she walked hurriedly as though she were followed through the empty rooms until she came upon george pembroke stretched at full length on the leathercovered lounge in the library he opened his eyes and got up with alacrity  please dont move she said  he looked at her although his was not what may be called a sympathetic temperament he was not without a certain knowledge of women superficial perhaps but most men of his type have seen them in despair and since he was not related to this particular despair what finer feelings he had were the more easily aroused it must have been clear to her then that she had lost the power to dissemble all the clearer because of mr pembrokes cheerfulness  i wasnt going to sleep he assured her circumstantial evidence is against me i know wheres abby reading french literature  i havent seen her replied honora  she usually goes to bed with a play at this hour its a horrid habitgoing to bed i mean dont you think would you mind showing me about a little  do you really wish to asked honora incredulously  i havent been here since my senior year said mr pembroke if the old general were alive he could probably tell you something of that visithe wrote to my father about it i always liked the place although the general was something of a drawback fine old man with no memory  i should have thought him to have had a good memory she said  i have always been led to believe that he was once sent away from college in his youthfor his health he explained significantly no man has a good memory who cant remember that perhaps the battle of gettysburg wiped it out  thus in his own easygoing fashion mr pembroke sought to distract her she put on a hat and they walked about the various scenes recalling incidents of holidays he had spent at highlawns and after a while honora was thankful that chance had sent her in this hour to him rather than to mrs kame for the sight that morning of this lady in her dressinggown over the stairway had seemingly set the seal on a growing distaste her feeling had not been the same about mrs rindge mrs kames actions savoured of deliberate choice of an inherent and calculating wickedness  had the distraction of others besides himself been the chief business of mr pembrokes life he could not have succeeded better that afternoon he must be given this credit his motives remain problematical at length he even drew laughter from her the afternoon wore on they returned to the garden for tea and a peaceful stillness continued to reign about them the very sky smiling placidly at her fears not by assuring her that hugh was unusual horseman that he had passed through many dangers beside which this was a bagatelle could the student of the feminine by her side have done half so well and it may have been that his success encouraged him as he saw emerging as the result of his handiwork an unexpectedly attractiveif still somewhat seriouswoman from the gloom that had enveloped her that she should still have her distrait moments was but natural  he talked to her largely about hugh of whom he appeared sincerely fond the qualities which attracted mr pembroke in his own sex were somewhat peculiar and seemingly consisted largely in a readiness to drop the business at hand whatever it might be at the suggestion of a friend to do something else the something else of course to be the conception of an ingenious mind and it was while he was in the midst of an anecdote proving the existence of this quality in his friend that he felt a sudden clutch on his arm  they listened faintly very faintly could be heard the sound of hoof beats rapid though distant  do you hear she whispered and still held his arm  its just like them to race back said pembroke with admirable nonchalance  but they wouldnt come back at this timeits too early hugh always takes long rides they started for hubbardsits twelve miles  adele changes her mind every minute of the day he said  listen she cried and her clutch tightened the hoof beats grew louder its only oneits only one horse  before he could answer she was already halfway up the garden path towards the house he followed her as she ran panting through the breakfast room the dining room and drawingroom and when they reached the hall starling the butler and two footmen were going out at the door a voicemrs kamescried out what is it over the stairs but they paid no heed as they reached the steps they beheld the slight figure of mrs rindge on a flying horse coming towards them up the driveway her black straw hat had slipped to the back of her neck her hair was awry her childish face white as paper honora put her hand to her heart there was no need to tell her the newsshe had known these many hours  mrs rindges horse came over the round grassplot of the circle and planted his fore feet in the turf as she pulled him up she lurched forward it was starling who lifted her offgeorge pembroke stood by honora  my god adele he exclaimed why dont you speak  she was staring at honora  i cant she cried i cant tell youits too terrible the horse she seemed to choke  it was honora who went up to her with a calmness that awed them  tell me she said is he dead  mrs rindge nodded and broke into hysterical sobbing  and i wanted to ride him myself she sobbed as they led her up the steps  in less than an hour they brought him home and laid him in the room in which he had slept from boyhood and shut the door honora looked into his face it was calm at last and his body strangely at rest the passions which had tortured it and driven it hither and thither through a wayward life had fled the power gone that would brook no guiding hand that had known no master it was not until then that she fell upon him weeping     chapter xviii in which mr erwin seek paris  as she glanced around the sittingroom of her apartment in paris one september morning she found it difficult in some respects to realize that she had lived in it for more than five years after chilterns death she had sought a refuge and she had found it here a refuge in which she meantif her intention may be so definitely statedto pass the remainder of her days  as a refuge it had become dear to her when first she had entered it she had looked about her numbly thankful for walls and roof thankful for its remoteness from the haunts of the prying as a shipwrecked castaway regards at the first light the cave into which he has stumbled into the darknessgratefully and gradually castaway that she felt herself to be she had adorned it lovingly as one above whose horizon the sails of hope were not to rise filled it with friends not chosen in a day whose faithful ministrations were not to cease her books but only those worthy to be bound and read again the pictures she had bought when she had grown to know what pictures were the music she had come to love for its eternal qualitiesthese were her companions  the apartment was in the old quarter across the seine and she had found it by chance the ancient family of which this hotel had once been the home would scarce have recognized if they had returned the part of it honora occupied the room in which she mostly lived was above the corner of the quiet street and might have been more aptly called a sittingroom than a salon its panels were the most delicate of bluegray fantastically designed and outlined by ribbings of blue some of them contained her pictures the chairs the sofas the little tabourets were upholstered in yellow their wood matching the panels above the carved mantel of yellowing marble was a quaintly shaped mirror extending to the high ceiling and flanked on either side by sconces the carpet was a golden brown the hangings in the tall windows yellow and in the morning the sun came in not boisterously but as a wellbred and cheerful guest an amiable proprietor had permitted her also to add a wroughtiron balcony as an adjunct to this room and sometimes she sat there on the warmer days reading under the seclusion of an awning or gazing at the mysterious facades of the houses opposite or at infrequent cabs or pedestrians below  an archway led out of the sittingroom into a smaller room once the boudoir of a marquise now honoras library this was in blue and gold and she had so far modified the design of the decorator as to replace the mirrors of the cases with glass she liked to see her books beyond the library was a dining room in grey with dark red hangings it overlooked the forgotten garden of the hotel  one item alone of news from the outer world vital to her had drifted to her retreat newspapers filled her with dread but it was from a newspaper during the first year of her retirement that she had learned of the death of howard spence a complication of maladies was mentioned but the true underlying cause was implied in the article and this had shocked but not surprised her a ferment was in progress in her own country the affairs of the orange trust company being investigated and its president under indictment at the hour of his demise her feelings at the time and for months after were complex she had been moved to deep pity for in spite of what he had told her of his business transactions it was impossible for her to think of him as a criminal that he had been the tool of others she knew but it remained a question in her mind how clearly he had perceived the immorality of his course and of theirs he had not been given to casuistry and he had been brought up in a school the motto of which he had once succinctly stated the survival of the fittest he had not been alas one of those to survive  honora had found it impossible to unravel the tangled skein of their relationship and to assign a definite amount of blame to each she did not shirk hers and was willing to accept a full measure that she had done wrong in marrying him and again in leaving him to marry another man she acknowledged freely wrong as she knew this to have been severely though she had been punished for it she could not bring herself to an adequate penitence she tried to remember him as he had been at silverdale and in the first months of their marriage and not as he had afterwards become there was no question in her mind now that it was given her to see things more clearly that she might have tried harder much harder to make their marriage a success he might indeed have done more to protect and cherish her it was a mans part to guard a woman against the evils with which she had been surrounded on the other hand she could not escape the fact nor did she attempt to escape it that she had had the more light of the two and that though the task were formidable she might have fought to retain that light and infuse him with it  that she did not hold herself guiltless is the important point many of her hours were spent in retrospection she was in a sense as one dead yet retaining her faculties and these became infinitely keen now that she was deprived of the power to use them as guides through life she felt that the power had come too late like a legacy when one is old and she contemplated the honora of other daysof the flesh as though she were now the spirit departed from that body sorrowfully poignantly regretful of the earthly motives of the tarnished ideals by which it had been animated and led to destruction  even hugh chiltern had left her no illusions she thought of him at times with much tenderness whether she still loved him or not she could not say she came to the conclusion that all capacity for intense feeling had been burned out of her and she found that she could permit her mind to rest upon no period of her sojourn at grenoble without a sense of horror there had been no hour when she had seemed secure from haunting terror no day that had not added its mite to the gathering evidence of an ultimate retribution and it was like a nightmare to summon again this spectacle of the man going to pieces under her eyes the whole incident in her life as time wore on assumed an aspect bizarre incredible as the follies of a night of madness appear in the saner light of morning her great love had bereft her of her senses for had the least grain of sanity remained to her she might have known that the thing they attempted was impossible of accomplishment  her feeling now after four years might be described as relief to employ again the figure of the castaway she often wondered why she of all others had been rescued from the tortures of slow drowning and thrown up on an island what had she done above the others to deserve preservation it was inevitable that she should on occasions picture to herself the years with him that would have stretched ahead even as the vision of them had come to her that morning when in obedience to his telegram she had told starling to prepare for guests her escape had indeed been miraculous  although they had passed through a ceremony the conviction had never taken root in her that she had been married to chiltern the tie that had united her to him had not been sacred though it had been no less binding more so in fact that tie would have become a shackle her perception of this after his death had led her to instruct her attorney to send back to his relatives all but a small income from his estate enough for her to live on during her lifetime there had been some trouble about this matter mrs grainger in particular had surprised her in making objections and had finally written a letter which honora received with a feeling akin to gratitude whether her own action had softened this ladys feelings she never understood she had cherished the letter for its unexpectedly charitable expressions chilterns family had at last agreed to accept the estate on the condition that the income mentioned should be tripled and to this honora had consented money had less value than ever in her eyes  she lived here in paris in what may be called a certain peace made no demands upon the world and had no expectations from it she was now in half mourning and intended to remain so her isolation was of her own choice if a stronger expression be not used she was by no means an enforced outcast and she was even aware that a certain sympathy for her had grown up amongst her former friends which had spread to the colony of her compatriots in paris in whose numbers there were some by no means unrecognized who had defied the conventions more than she hugh chilterns reputation and the general knowledge of his career had no doubt aided to increase this sympathy but the dignity of her conduct since his death was at the foundation of it sometimes on her walks and drives she saw people bowing to her and recognized friends or acquaintances of what seemed to her like a former existence  such had been her life in paris until a certain day in early september a month before this chapter opens it was afternoon and she was sitting in the balcony cutting a volume of memoirs when she heard the rattle of a cab on the cobbles below and peered curiously over the edge of the railing although still half a block away the national characteristics of the passenger were sufficiently apparent he was an americanof that she was sure and many americans did not stray into that quarter the length of his legs for one thing betrayed him he found the seat of the fiacre too low and had crossed one knee over the other other and less easily definable attributes he did not lack and as he leaned against the faded blue cushions regarding with interest the buildings he passed he seemed like an ambassador to convert the cab in which he rode into united states territory then she saw that it was peter erwin  she drew back her head from the balcony rail and tried to sit still and to think but she was trembling as one stricken with a chill the cab stopped and presently after an interval his card was handed her she rose and stood for a moment with her hand against the wall before she went into the salon none of the questions she had asked herself were answered was she glad to see him and what would be his attitude towards her when she beheld him standing before her she had strength only to pronounce his name  he came forward quickly and took her hand and looked down into her face she regarded him tremulously instinctively guessing the vital importance of this moment for him and she knew then that he had been looking forward to it in mingled hope and dread as one who gazes seaward after a night of tempest for the ship he has seen at dusk in the offing what had the tempest done to her such was his question and her heart leaped as she saw the light growing in his eyes for it meant much to her that he should see that she was not utterly dismantled she fell his own hand tremble as he relinquished hers he was greatly moved his voice too betrayed it  you see i have found you he said  yes she answered why did you come  why have i always come to you when it was possible he asked  no one ever had such a friend peter of that i am sure  i wanted to see paris he said before i grew too decrepit to enjoy it  she smiled and turned away  have you seen much of it  enough to wish to see more  when did you arrive  some time in the night he said from cherbourg and im staying at a very grand hotel which might be anywhere a man i crossed with on the steamer took me there i think id move to one of the quieter ones the french ones if i were a little surer of my pronunciation and the subjunctive mood  you dont mean to say youve been studying french  he coloured a little and laughed  you think it ridiculous at my time of life i suppose youre right you should have seen me trying to understand the cabmen the way these people talk reminds me more of a gatling gun than anything i can think of it certainly isnt human  perhaps you have come over as ambassador she suggested when i saw you in the cab even before i recognized you i thought of a bit of our soil broken off and drifted over here  her voice did not quite sustain the lighter notethe emotion his visit was causing her was too great he brought with him into her retreat not so much a flood of memories as of sensations he was a man whose image time with difficulty obliterates whose presence was a shining thing so she had grown to value it in proportion as she had had less of it she did inevitably recall the last time she had seen him in the little western city and how he had overwhelmed her invaded her with doubts and aroused the spirit which had possessed her to fight fiercely for its foothold and today his coming might be likened to the entrance of a great physician into the room of a distant and lonely patient whom amidst wide ministrations he has not forgotten she saw now that he had been right she had always seen it clearly indeed when he had been beside her but the spirit within her had been too strong until now now when it had plundered her soul of treasuresonce so little valuedit had fled such were her thoughts  the great of heart undoubtedly possess this highest quality of the physicianif the statement may thus be put backhandedlyand peter erwin instinctively understood the essential of what was going on within her he appeared to take a delight in the fancy she had suggested that he had brought a portion of the newer world to france  not a piece of the atlantic coast certainly he replied one of the muddy islands perhaps of the mississippi  all the more representative she said you seem to have taken possession of paris peternot paris of you you have annexed the seat of the capets and brought democracy at last into the faubourg  without a reign of terror he added quizzically  if you are not ambassador what are you she asked i have expected at any moment to read in the figaro that you were president of the united states  i am the american tourist he declared with baedeker for my bible who desires to be shown everything and i have already discovered that the legend of the fabulous wealth of the indies is still in force here there are many who are willing to believe that in spite of my modest appearancemaybe because of iti have sailed over in a galleon filled with gold already i have been approached from every side by confidential gentlemen who announced that they spoke englishone of them said americanwho have offered to show me many things and who have betrayed enough interest in me to inquire whether i were married or single  honora laughed they were seated in the balcony by this time and he had the volume of memoirs on his knee fingering it idly  what did you say to them she asked  i told them i was the proud father of ten children he replied that seemed to stagger them but only for a moment they offered to take us all to the louvre  peter you are ridiculous but in spite of your nationality you dont look exactly gullible  that is a relief he said i had begun to think i ought to leave my address and my watch with the consul general  of such a nature was the first insidious rupture of that routine she had grown to look upon as changeless for the years to come of the life she had chosen for its very immutable quality even its pangs of loneliness had acquired a certain sweet taste partly from a fear of a world that had hurt her partly from fear of herself she had made her burrow deep that heat and cold the changing seasons and love and hate might be things far removed she had sought to remove comparisons too from the limits of her vision to cherish and keep alive indeed such regrets as she had but to make no new ones  often had she thought of peter erwin and it is not too much to say that he had insensibly grown into an ideal he had come to represent to her the great thing she had missed in life missed by feverish searching in the wrong places digging for gold where the ground had glittered and if the choice had been given her she would have preferred his spiritual to his bodily companionshipfor a while at least some day when she should feel sure that desire had ceased to throb when she should have acquired an unshakable and absolute resignation she would see him it is not too much to say if her feeling be not misconstrued and stretched far beyond her own conception of it that he was her one remaining interest in the world she had scanned the letters of her aunt and uncle for knowledge of his doings and had felt her curiosity justified by a certain proprietorship that she did not define faith in humankind or the lack of it usually makes itself felt through ones comparative contemporaries that her uncle was a good man for instance had no such effect upon honora as the fact that peter was a good man and that he had held a true course had gradually become a very vital thing to her perhaps the most vital thing and she could have imagined no greater personal calamity now than to have seen him inconsistent for there are such men and most people have known them they are the men who unconsciously keep life sweet  yet she was sorry he had invaded her hidingplace she had not yet achieved peace and much of the weary task would have to be done over after he was gone  in the meantime she drifted with astounding ease into another existence for it was she and not the confidential gentlemen who showed peter paris not the careless pleasureloving paris of the restaurants but of the cluny and the carnavalet the louvre even was not neglected and as they entered it first she recalled with still unaccustomed laughter his reply to the proffered services of the guide indeed there was much laughter in their excursions his native humour sprang from the same well that held his seriousness she was amazed at his ability to strip a sham and leave it grotesquely naked shams the risible aspect of which she had never observed in spite of the familiarity four years had given her some of his own countrymen and countrywomen afforded him the greatest amusement in their efforts to carry off acquired european personalities combinations of assumed indifference and effrontery and an accent the like of which was never heard before but he was neither bitter nor crude in his criticisms he made her laugh but he never made her ashamed his chief faculty seemed to be to give her the power to behold with astonishing clearness objects and truths which had lain before her eyes and yet hidden and she had not thought to acquire any more truths  the depth of his pleasure in the things he saw was likewise a revelation to her she was by no means a bad guide to the louvre and the luxembourg but the light in her which had come slowly flooded him with radiance at the sight of a statue or a picture he would stop with an exclamation and stand gazing selfforgetful for incredible periods and she would watch him filled with a curious sense of the limitations of an appreciation she had thought complete where during his busy life had he got this thing which others had sought in many voyages in vain  other excursions they made and sometimes these absorbed a day it was a wonderful month that parisian september which honora when she allowed herself to think felt that she had no right to a month filled to the brim with colour the stone facades of the houses which in certain lights were what the french so aptly call bleuatre the dense green foliage of the horsechestnut trees the fantastic iron grills the arc de triomphe in the centre of its circle at sunset the wide shaded avenues radiating from it the bewildering champs elysees the blue waters of the seine and the graceful bridges spanning it notre dame against the sky their walks took them too into quainter forgotten regions where history was grim and halfeffaced and they speculated on the france of other days  they went farther afield and it was given them to walk together down green vistas cut for kings to linger on terraces with the river far below them and the roofs of paris in the hazy distance that paris sullen so long the mutterings of which the kings who had sat there must have heard with dread that paris which had finally risen in its wrath and taken the pleasurehouses and the parks for itself  once they went out to chantilly the cameolike chateau that stands mirrored in its waters and wandered through the alleys there honora had left her parasol on the parapet and as they returned peter went to get it while she awaited him at a little distance a group was chatting gayly on the lawn and one of them a middleaged welldressed man hailed him with an air of fellowship and peter stopped for a moments talk  we were speaking of ambassadors the other day he said when he joined her that was our own minturn  we were speaking of them nearly a month ago she said  a month ago i cant believe it he exclaimed  what did he say to you honora inquired presently  he was abusing me for not letting him know i was in paris  peter you ought to have let him know  i didnt come over here to see the ambassador answered peter gayly  she talked less than usual on their drive homeward but he did not seem to notice the fact dusk was already lurking in the courtyards and byways of the quiet quarter when the porter let them in and the stone stairway of the old hotel was almost in darkness the sittingroom with its yellow hangings snugly drawn and its pervading but soft light was a grateful change and while she was gone toremove her veil and hat peter looked around it  it was redolent of her a high vase of remarkable beauty filled with white roses stood on the gueridon he went forward and touched it and closed his eyes as though in pain when he opened them he saw her standing in the archway  she had taken off her coat and was in a simple white muslin gown with a black belta costume that had become habitual her age was thirty the tragedy and the gravity of her life during these later years had touched her with something that before was lacking in the street in the galleries people had turned to look at her not with impudent stares she caught attention aroused imagination once the year before she had had a strange experience with a wellknown painter who in an impulsive note had admitted following her home and bribing the concierge he craved a few sittings her expression now as she looked at peter was graver than usual  you must not come tomorrow she said  i thought we were going to versailles again he replied in surprise i have made the arrangements  i have changed my mind im not going  you want to postpone it he asked  she took a chair beside the little blaze in the fireplace  sit down peter i wish to say something to you i have been wishing to do so for some time  do you object if i stand a moment he said i feel so much more comfortable standing especially when i am going to be scolded  yes she admitted i am going to scold you your conscience has warned you  on the contrary he declared it has never been quieter if i have offended it is through ignorance  it is through charity as usual she said in a low voice if your conscience be quiet mine is not it is in myself that i am disappointedi have been very selfish i have usurped you i have known it all along and i have done very wrong in not relinquishing you before  who would have shown me paris he exclaimed  no she continued you would not have been alone if i had needed proof of that fact i had it today  oh minturn he interrupted think of me hanging about an embassy and trying not to spill tea and he smiled at the image that presented  her own smile was fleeting  you would never do that i know she said gravely  you are still too modest peter but the time has gone by when i can be easily deceived you have a great reputation among men of affairs an unique one in spite of the fact that you are distinctly american you have a wide interest in what is going on in the world and you have an opportunity here to meet people of note people really worth while from every point of view you have no right to neglect it  he was silent a moment looking down at her she was leaning forward her eyes fixed on the fire her hands clasped between her knees  do you think i care for that he asked  you ought to care she said without looking up and it is my duty to try to make you care  honora why do you think i came over here he said  to see paris she answered i have your own word for it toto continue your education it never seems to stop  did you really believe that  of course i believed it what could be more natural and you have never had a holiday like this  no he agreed i admit that  i dont know how much longer you are going to stay she said you have not been abroad before and there are other places you ought to go  ill get you to make out an itinerary  peter cant you see that im serious i have decided to take matters in my own hands the rest of the time you are here you may come to see me twice a week i shall instruct the concierge  he turned and grasped the mantel shelf with both hands and touched the log with the toe of his boot  what i told you about seeing paris may be called polite fiction he said i came over here to see you i have been afraid to say it until today and i am afraid to say it now  she sat very still the log flared up again and he turned slowly and looked at the shadows in her face  youyou have always been good to me she answered i have never deserved iti have never understood it if it is any satisfaction for you to know that what i have saved of myself i owe to you i tell you so freely  that he said is something for which god forbid that i should take credit what you are is due to the development of a germ within you a development in which i have always had faith i came here to see you i came here because i love you because i have always loved you honora  oh no not that she cried not that  why not he asked it is something i cannot help something beyond my power to prevent if i would but i would not i am proud of it and i should be lost without it i have had it always i have come over to beg you to marry me  its impossible cant you see its impossible  you dont love me he said into those few words was thrown all the suffering of his silent years  i dont know what i feel for you she answered in an agonized voice her fingers tightening over the backs of her white hands if reverence be loveif trust be love infinite and absolute trustif gratitude be loveif emptiness after you are gone be a sign of ityes i love you if the power to see clearly only through you to interpret myself only by your aid be love i acknowledge it i tell you so freely as of your right to know and the germ of which you spoke is you you have grown until you have taken possession ofof what is left of me if i had only been able to see clearly from the first peter i should be another woman today a whole woman a wise woman oh i have thought of it much the secret of life was there at my side from the time i was able to pronounce your name and i couldnt see it you had it you stayed you took duty where you found it and it has made you great oh i dont mean to speak in a worldly sense when i say that it is to express the highest human quality of which i can think and feel but i cant marry you you must see it  i cannot see it he replied when he had somewhat gained control of himself  because i should be wronging you  how he asked  in the first place i should be ruining your career  if i had a career he said smiling gently you couldnt ruin it you both overestimate and underestimate the worlds opinion honora as my wife it will not treat you cruelly and as for my career as you call it it has merely consisted in doing as best i could the work that has come to me i have tried to serve well those who have employed me and if my services be of value to them and to those who may need me in the future they are not going to reject me if i have any worth in the world you will but add to it without you i am incomplete  she looked up at him wonderingly  yes you are great she said you pity me you think of my loneliness  it is true i cannot bear to picture you here he exclaimed the thought tortures me but it is because i love you because i wish to take and shield you i am not a man to marry a woman without love it seems to me that you should know me well enough to believe that honora there never has been any other woman in my life and there never can be i have given you proof of it god knows  i am not what i was she said i am not what i was i have been dragged down  he bent and lifted her hand from her knee and raised it to his lips a homage from him that gave her an exquisite pain  if you had been dragged down he answered simply my love would have been killed i know something of the horrors you have been through as though i had suffered them myself they might have dragged down another woman honora but they have strangely ennobled you  she drew her hand away  no she said i do not deserve happiness it cannot be my destiny  destiny he repeated destiny is a thing not understandable by finite minds it is not necessarily continued tragedy and waste of that i am certain only a little thought is required it seems to me to assure us that we cannot be the judges of our own punishment on this earth and of another world we know nothing it cannot be any ones destiny to throw away a life while still something may be made of it you would be throwing your life away here that no other woman is possible or ever can be possible for me should be a consideration with you honora what i ask of you is a sacrificewill you make me happy  her eyes filled with tears  oh peter do you care so much as that ifif i could be sure that i were doing it for you if in spiteof all that has happened to me i could be doing something for you  he stooped and kissed her  you can if you will he said     pg editors bookmarks        best way is to leave em alone dont dandle em babies       blessed are the ugly for they shall not be tempted       comparisons as shakespeare said are odorous       constitutionally honest       conversation was a mockery       every one man or woman has the right to happiness       fact should be written like fiction and fiction like fact       fetters of love       happy the people whose annals are blank in historys book       he has always been too honest to make a great deal of money       her words of comfort were as few as her silent deeds were many       how can you talk of things other people have and not want them       immutable love in a changing heedless selfish world       intense longing is always followed by disappointment       little better than a gambling place stock exchange       no reason why we should suffer all our lives for a mistake       often in real danger at the moment when they feel most secure       providence is accepted by his beneficiaries as a matter of fact       regarding favourable impressions with profound suspicion       resented the implication of possession       rocks to which one might cling successful or failing       selftorture is human       she had never known the necessity of making friends       sleep a despised waste of time in childhood       so glad to have what other people havent       sought to remove comparisons       taking him like daily bread to be eaten and not thought about       that magic word change       the greatest wonders are not at the ends of the earth but near       the days of useless martyrdom are past       thinking that because you have no ideals other people havent       those who walk on ice will slide against their wills       time the unbribeable       weak coffee and the protestant religion seemed inseparable       why should i desire what i cannot have
