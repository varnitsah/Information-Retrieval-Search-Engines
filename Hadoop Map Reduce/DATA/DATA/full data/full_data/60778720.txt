with this i present to you the rover boys on the farm the twelfth volume in the rover boys series for young americans  it is a large number of volumes to write about one set of characters isnt it when i started the series many years ago i had in mind as i have told you before to pen three books possibly four but as soon as i had written the rover boys at school the rover boys on the ocean and the rover boys in the jungle there was a cry for more and so i wrote the rover boys out west on the great lakes in the mountains on land and sea in camp on the river on the plains and then in southern waters where we last left our heroes  in the present story as promised in the last volume the scene is shifted back to the farm and to dear old putnam hall with their many pleasant associations as before sam tom and dick are to the front along with several of their friends and there are a number of adventures some comical and some strange and mystifying at the school the rivalries are as keen as ever but the rover boys are on their mettle and prove their worth on more than one occasion  again i thank my numerous readers for all the kind words they have spoken about my stories i hope the present volume will please them in every way  affectionately and sincerely yours  edward stratemeyer     contents          i something about the rover boys        ii what happened on the mountain

it tom  weve missed our way went on tom rover with a serious look on his usually sunny face  it looks that way to me answered sam rover his younger brother i think we made a wrong turn after we slid down the cliff  what is keeping dick  i dont know  lets call to him went on tom and set up a loud cry in which his brother joined the pair listened intently but no answer came back  i dont like this said sam an anxious look in his clear eyes maybe dick is in trouble  perhaps so answered tom rover  the two boys were far up on a mountainside and all around them were tall trees thick brushwood and immense ridges of rocks it had been a clear sunshiny day but now the sky was overcast and it looked like rain  weve got to go back for dick said tom after a painful pause no use of going on without him  i hope he hasnt fallen over some cliff and hurt himself returned his younger brother  i dont see why he doesnt answer us if hes all right was the unsatisfactory reply come on or the storm will overtake us before we get down from the mountain and well be soaked by the time we reach home  side by side the brothers retraced their stepsa hard task for it is much easier to climb down a steep mountainside than to climb up  to those who have read the previous volumes in this rover boys series the two brothers just mentioned will need no special introduction the rover boys were three in number dick being the oldest funloving tom coming next and sam bringing up the rear all were bright lively uptodate lads and honest and manly to the core they lived on a farm called valley brook in new york statea beautiful spot owned by their uncle randolph rover and his wife martha their father anderson rover also lived at the farm when at home but he was away a great deal on business  from the farm the boys had been sent some years before to putnam hall an ideal place of learning of which we shall learn more as our tale proceeds what the lads did there on their arrival has already been related in the rover boys at school the first volume of this series  a short term at putnam hall was followed by a trip on the ocean and then a long journey to the jungles of africa in search of anderson rover who had disappeared then came a grand outing out west and another outing on the great lakes followed by some stirring adventures in the mountains of new york state  coming from the mountains the three youths had expected to go back to putnam hall at once but fate ordained otherwise and they were cast away in the pacific ocean as related in the rover boys on land and sea they had a hard task of it getting home and then returned to the school and had some splendid times while in camp with the other cadets  when vacation was once more at hand the boys soon solved the problem of what to do their uncle randolph had taken a houseboat for debt the craft was located on the ohio river and it was resolved to make a trip down the mississippi  it will be the best ever tom declared and they started with much enthusiasm taking with them songbird powell a school chum addicted to the making of doggerel which he called poetry fred garrison a plucky boy who had stood by them through thick and thin and hans mueller a german youth who was still struggling with the mysteries of the english tongue with the boys went an old friend mrs stanhope and her sister mrs laning with mrs stanhope was her only daughter dora whom dick rover considered the sweetest girl in the whole world and mrs laning had with her two daughters grace and nellie especial friends of sam and dick  the trip on the houseboat proved a long and eventful one and during that time the boys and their company fell in with dan baxter lew flapp and several other enemies on the mississippi the craft was damaged and while it was being repaired the party took a trip inland as related in the rover boys on the plains then the houseboat was stolen and what this led to has been related in detail in the rover boys in southern waters in that volume they brought to book several of the rascals who had annoyed them and they caused dan baxter to feel so ashamed of himself that the bully made up his mind to reform  tired out from their long trip the rover boys were glad enough to get back home again for nearly a week their friends remained with them at valley brook farm and then they departed the stanhopes and lanings for their homes and fred hans and songbird for putnam hall  of course youre coming back to the hall fred had said on leaving  coming back had been toms answer why you couldnt keep us away with a gatling gun  to be sure well be back answered dick rover  and well have the greatest times ever chimed in sam i am fairly aching to see the dear old school again  and captain putnam and all the rest continued tom  and have some fun eh tom and sam poked his funloving brother in the ribs  well when we go back weve got to do some studying dick had put in do you know what father said yesterday  no what came simultaneously from his brothers  he said we were getting too old to go to putnam hallthat we ought to be thinking of going to college or of getting into business  hum murmured tom and he became suddenly thoughtful  i know why he said that said sam with a wink at his big brother he knows how sweet dick is on dora and  hi you let up cried dick his face reddening it wasnt that at all we are getting pretty old for putnam hall and you know it  it seems id never want to leave the dear old school murmured tom why its like a second home to us think of all the jolly times weve had thereand the host of friends weve made  and the enemies added sam dont forget them or they may feel slighted  dan baxter was our worst enemy in that school and he is going to reform sam  perhaps i wont feel sure of it until i really see it answered the youngest rover  by the way i got a postal from dan today said dick he is in philadelphia and working for a carpet manufacturer  well if hes gone to work thats a good sign said tom  on their arrival at the farm the boys had been met by their father but now anderson rover had gone away on a business trip which was to last for several days as usual he left the lads in charge of his brother and the boys aunt  now just take it easy for awhile was mr rovers advice on leaving rest up all you can and then when you go back to the school youll feel as bright as a dollar  silver or paper dad asked tom mischievously  now tom  oh i know what you mean dad and ill be as quiet as a mule with a sandbag tied to his tail answered the funloving offspring  the day after anderson rovers departure from the farm was quiet enough but on the morning following the boys uncle received a letter in the mail which seemed to trouble him not a little  i must attend to this matter without delay said randolph rover to his wife  what is wrong randolph  i dont think i can explain to you martha its about those traction company bonds i purchased a few months ago  those you paid ten thousand dollars for  yes  what about them  as i said before i cant explainit is rather a complicated affair  they are yours arent they randolph  oh yes but  arent they worth what you gave for them  i hope so  cant you find out and make sure  that is what i am going to do replied randolph rover and heaved a deep sigh as my old readers know he was a very retired individual given to scientific research especially in regard to farming and knew little about business  if youve been swindled in any way you must go after the men who sold you the bonds said mrs rover we cannot afford to lose so much money  i dont believe ive been swindledat least if i have i think the party who sold me the bonds will make them good martha ill know all about it tomorrow answered randolph rover and there the conversation came to an end     chapter ii  what happened on the mountain   it was on the day that randolph rover was to go to the town of carwell fifteen miles away to see about the bonds that the three rover boys planned for a days outing  let us go to the top of chase mountain suggested sam i havent been up there for three years  second the suggestion replied tom we can take a lunch along and make a day of it and so it was arranged  chase mountain was about three miles away on the other side of humpback falls where sam had once had such a stirring adventure as told in detail in the rover boys at school it was a ragged eminence and from the top a view could be had of the country for many miles around  the day seemed to be a perfect one when the three youths started and when they reached the top of the mountain they enjoyed the vast panorama spread before them they likewise enjoyed the substantial lunch their aunt martha had provided and ate until tom was ready to bust his buttons as he expressed it  let us try a new path down said sam when it came time to go home and he and tom led the way over a series of rocky ridges and cliffs anything but easy to traverse in some places they had to drop ten and fifteen feet and once tom came down on his ankle in a manner that made him cry with pain  you look out for yourself warned dick if you sprain an ankle up here well have a job of it getting you home  no sprained ankle for mine thank you replied tom and he was more careful after that  as dick came after his brothers he saw something peculiar at one side of the path he was pursuing it appeared to be a tin lunch box suspended from a tree limb by a bit of wire the box was painted red and seemed to be new  thats strange said the eldest rover boy to himself who would leave such a thing as that in that position ill have to investigate  without telling sam and tom what he was going to do dick left the path and plunged into the bushes which grew between himself and the tree from which the tin box was suspended among the bushes the footing was uncertain and hardly had he taken a dozen steps when he felt himself sinking  hi this wont do he cried in alarm and then plunged down into a big hole some bushes moss and dead leaves coming down on top of him  in the meantime sam and tom had gone on coming to where the path appeared to divide they turned to the right only to find five minutes later that they had made a mistake  where in the world can dick be murmured sam after he and his brother had called again i thought he was right behind us  so did i sam its mighty queer whats become of him if he fell over a cliff tom did not finish but heaved a deep sigh  with anxious hearts the two boys endeavored to retrace their steps up the mountainside they had to climb up one of the cliffs and just as this was accomplished it began to rain  more bad luck grumbled sam if this keeps on well soon be soaked  spit spat spo where did that mountain path go cried tom repeating a doggerel often used by children dick dick he yelled at the top of his lungs then sam joined in the call once again but as before there was no answer  it must be confessed that the two rover boys were now thoroughly alarmed as they had climbed up the mountainside they knew they must be close to the spot where they had last seen dick what had become of their big brother  tom do you think he could have fallen over some cliff and rolled to the bottom of the mountain questioned sam anxiously  how could he roll to the bottom with the trees so thick he would have plenty of chance to catch hold of one of them  not if he was knocked unconscious  well where can he be  i dont know  it was now raining steadily and to protect themselves the two boys pulled their caps well down over their heads and turned up their coat collars they came to a halt under the widespreading branches of a hemlock tree  it beats the nation thats what it does declared tom maybe the earth opened and swallowed him up  tom this is no joke  and im not joking sam i cant understand it at all  is that the path over yonder continued the youngest rover pointing to a spot beyond the opposite side of the hemlock tree  it looks a little like it was toms reply might as well go over and make sure  leaving the shelter of the tree they made their way through the bushes which were now beginning to drip from the rain as they progressed sam pushed a big branch from him and let it swing back suddenly thereby catching tom full in the face  wow spluttered the funloving rover as he staggered back hi sam do you think i need a shower bath im wet enough already and tom commenced to brush the water from his face  i didnt mean to let it slip answered sam but say  what sam was going to say further will never be known for just then he felt himself slipping down into some sort of a hole he tried to leap back and made a clutch at toms legs and the next instant both rolled over and over and shot downward out of the daylight into utter darkness  they were taken so completely by surprise that neither said a word over and over they went a shower of dirt sticks and dead leaves coming after them then they brought up on a big pile of decayed leaves and lay there the breath all but knocked out of them  whawhatwhere are we gasped sam when he felt able to speak  say is thithis a nenew shootthethechutes asked tom who was bound to have his fun no matter what occurred  are you hurt  i dont think i am but i reckon my liver turned over about ten times how about you  shook up thats all answered sam after rising to his feet say we came down in a hurry didnt we  yes and got no return ticket either tom looked upward gracious the top of this hole is about fifty feet away we are lucky that we didnt break our necks  now we are down here the question is how do we get out tom  dont ask me any conundrums  weve got to get out somehow  unless we want to stay here and save the expense of a cemetery lot  tom  oh i know its no joke sam but what is there to do heres a hole at least fifty feet deep and the sides are almost perpendicular do you think we can climb up i am afraid if we try it well end by breaking our necks  it certainly is steep answered the youngest brother looking upward say he added suddenly do you suppose dick went down in some such hole as this  perhaps where there is one hole there may be more if he went down let us hope he didnt get killed  as well as they were able the two boys gazed around them the hole was irregular in form but about fifteen feet in diameter one side was of rough rocks and the other dirt and tree roots at the top the treacherous bushes overhung all sides of the opening partly concealing the yawning pit below  the rain is coming in pretty lively was sams comment presently i wonder if there is any danger of this hole filling up with water  i dont think so but if it does we can swim out  or get drowned  now who is getting blue demanded tom  to keep out of the worst of the rain sam leaned against one of the sides of the hole he felt it give beneath his weight and before he could save himself he went down into another hole and tom came after him  the boys were scared and both cried out lustily they did not fall far howeverin fact they rather rolled for the second opening was on a slant of fortyfive degrees they brought up against something soft but this time it was not a bank of decayed leaves  sam and tom  dick  where did you come from  how did you get here  are you hurt  no are you  no  these were some of the questions asked and answered as the three rover boys stared at each other other questions quickly followed and dick told how he had started to get the tin box and gone down so unexpectedly  you want to be careful he cautioned this mountainside is full of holes and pitfalls i came down one hole and then shot right into another  and we did the same thing cried tom thank heaven none of us have broken bones  didnt you hear us call to you asked the youngest rover  i thought i heard somethingbut i was not sure i called back  we didnt hear you answered tom  dick had been trying to get out of the hole into which he had tumbled but without success now the sides were growing slippery from the rain so the ascent became more difficult than ever  were in a pickle sighed sam  oh weve got to get out somehow answered his big brother we cant stay here forever  the opening was almost square with three sides of rough rock in trying to climb up some of the rocks tom gave one a shove and it slid from sight revealing an opening beyond  hullo another hole cried the youth leaping back in consternation why the old mountain is fairly honeycombed with them  i was never on this side of the mountain before said dick they used to tell some queer stories about this side  didnt they say some parts were haunted asked sam  yes and it was said that years ago many travelers coming this way disappeared  well why shouldnt they with so many holes around came from tom if we get out alive well be lucky  with great care they got down on their hands and knees and examined the opening beyond the rocks  i believe its a big cave announced dick a few minutes later and if it is im rather inclined to look around inside perhaps it will lead to some opening on the mountainside where we can get out     chapter iii  a mysterious cave   at first sam and tom demurred to entering the cavewhich looked dark and forbidding but dick insisted that he was going ahead and rather than be left behind they went along  well light some kind of a torch said the eldest rover got some matches  yes i brought along a pocketful answered sam didnt know but what wed want to build a campfire this noon  well want one nowto dry our clothing by said tom let us pick up the driest of the sticks  this they did and having entered the cave they made a goodsized blaze this sent a ruddy glow around the cavern and as the boys moved about fantastic shadows went dancing on the rocky walls adding to the weirdness of the scene  from the fire each of the youths provided himself with a torch and thus equipped they moved around the cave with care taking precautions not to fall into any more holes they soon found the opening on the mountainside long and narrow and running downward  we dont want to get lost cautioned sam  oh we can always go back to the fire answered dick  unless it goes out on us  it wont burn itself out for an houri saw to that before we left it  as the boys advanced into the cave they came across a heap of bones dick examined them carefully  skeletons queried sam and his voice trembled slightly  yesof lambs and pigs was the dry answer somebody has been making this a rendezvous and living on the fat of the land  maybe that accounts for jerry burdens losses suggested tom he said he lost a lamb last spring and two pigs  yes and old richard feltham lost a pig and some chickens added dick maybe this has been a hangout for tramps  do you think they are here still questioned sam we dont want to have any trouble  i am sure i dont know sam but this proves one thing  that we can get out of the cave  exactly see here is an old coat and a pair of old shoes somebody has been in the habit of coming hereand he wasnt in the habit of getting in the way we got in  they moved on and soon reached a larger opening here they found a bit of old harness and further on where the ground was soft the tracks of wagon wheels  somebody has been in the habit of driving right in here exclaimed tom we are sure to get out and his face showed his relief  hark whats that cried sam and shrank back as a strange rumbling was heard is it an earthquake or a landslide  its thunder thats all said dick a minute later as they listened  to be surethe storm was on us when we fell into the first hole answered the youngest rover  perhaps we can be glad we are under shelterif the storm is going to be a bad one came from tom but come on i want to see daylight again  he moved on and then gave a cry of astonishment  look  his brothers did so on one side of the cave were piled thirty or forty packing cases the majority of them were empty but three directed to one jackson dwight carwell were full and nailed up  well i never murmured sam dick  the freight thieves ejaculated the eldest rover dont you remember what was in the paper before we went south and what was in again only yesterday they have been missing freight from carwell and boxton and half a dozen other stations for over a year the thieves must have brought their stuff here and then taken some of it from the packing cases and carted it away again  it certainly looks like it answered tom only three full cases left i wonder when these were taken  most likely only a short time ago said dick the cases look new  do you suppose any of the freight thieves are around if they are we want to keep out of their wayif they are desperate characters  they moved on and then dick called a sudden halt  i can see daylight ahead he said and somebody is moving around let us put out the torches  his suggestion was speedily followed and the three rover boys advanced with caution at its outer end the cave became broader while the roof was only about ten feet high  hullo heres another surprise whispered dick as they came closer to the opening look at that  he pointed to one side of the cave and there the others saw an automobile runabout standing and on the seat two men dressed for a tour they were talking to a third man who was lounging against a front wheel smoking a brierroot pipe  maybe they are the freight thieves whispered tom let us get out of sight and listen to what they have to say  it was an easy matter to keep out of sight for the walls of the cave were very uneven at this point they got behind a projection and by crawling up a rocky ledge managed to reach a point above and to one side of the runabout and not over a dozen feet from it  then you werent going to stop here merrick asked the man leaning against the wheel  not now dangler was the reply of the man with the pipe the storm drove us in here  when do you expect to meet this randolph rover  very soon  he ought to be easyhe is so simple minded  oh i think we can work him right enough put in the third man who was tall and thincheeked  well if you do dont forget that i get my share pike said the man called dangler  havent you always gotten your share demanded pike  i suppose i have  and havent we given you the information whenever any valuable freight was coming this way put in the man called merrick  yes and got your full share of the proceeds while i ran the risk growled dangler its getting dangerousim going to quitafter the next big haul went on the man with the pipe  all rightas you wish answered merrick i wish this storm would let up the road will be something fierce for our runabout  and bad for my wagon growled dangler in return  the boys listened to the conversation with deep interest the reference to their uncle amazed them and they wondered what the two men in the runabout had in mind to do by their talk it was evident they meant to accomplish something unlawful  they are going to play uncle randolph some trick whispered sam we must get home and warn him  what we ought to do is to have the whole crowd arrested answered tom they are all implicated in the theft of freight  thats the talk said dick the question is how can we do it we are no match for those three men and more than likely they are armed  after this the three men conversed in such a low tone the boys could not hear a quarter of what was said but they learned enough to know that merrick and pike were going to meet their uncle and play him false in some way and they heard the words traction bonds and coupons several times  uncle randolph had ten thousand dollars worth of traction company bonds said dick he bought them only a short while ago they pay five and a half per cent interest and he thought them a firstclass investment  oh well have to warn him said sam he is so openhearted he would trust most anybody  merrick had descended from the runabout and gone out of the cave now he came back said something to the others and started up the auto in another moment he had the machine turned around then it spun out of the cave and down a fairly good road in the direction of carwell the man named dangler followed the runabout to the road and watched it disappear around a turn bordered by trees the storm was now rolling away to the westward and the rain had ceased  they have gone cried tom where to  perhaps to our farmto see uncle randolph answered sam we ought to follow them as quickly as we can  i think we had better capture the fellow left behind said dick we ought to be able to do it  thats the talk said tom sure we can do it being three to one  dangler watched the runabout and then gazed up and down the mountain for several minutes then of a sudden he started in a direction opposite to that taken by the machine  he is going away cried sam  come on after him called his big brother and ran from the cave with the others at his heels just as he did this dangler glanced back and saw them  hey you he cried in consternation  stop called out dick we want you  at this command dangler was more amazed than ever but of a sudden he appeared to realize something of what had happened and commenced to run  stop cried tom and sam but at this the man only ran the faster  come onweve got to catch that rascal exclaimed dick and started to sprint the others followed as quickly as they could and a rapid chase along the mountain road ensued but if the boys could run so could the freight robber and he made the best possible use of his legs until he gained a side trail then he darted into this and when the rover boys came up he had disappeared  where is he panted sam  he took to this path but he isnt in sight answered dick he was almost winded himself  come on he must be somewhere around put in tom and ran down the path several hundred feet then he tripped over a fallen log and went headlong in the bushes and wet grass he got up looking tired out and cross  weve missed him announced dick rather dismally its a pity too he deserves to be put under arrest  i think we had better get home and warn uncle randolph returned sam if we dont there is no telling what that fellow merrick and that pike may do     chapter iv  at the farm   the others considered sams advice good and after another look around for dangler they turned in the direction of home they were a good three miles from the farm and had to cross the river above the falls thus adding half a mile more to the journey it was wet and muddy walking and they had not covered over a mile when tom called a halt  i am about fagged out he announced wonder if we cant hire a buggy at the next farmhouse  we can try anyway answered dick  directly after crossing the river they came to a small farmhouse and walked around to the kitchen where they saw an old woman shelling peas  we cant let you have any carriage she said the men folks are to town and theyve got the horses  the boys were about to turn away when dick thought of something  by the way do you know a man named dangler he asked  sure i do was the answer  does he live around here  i guess he lives where he pleases he is an old bachelor and comes and goes as he likes he used to have a cottage down the pike but it burnt down last winter  then you havent any idea where he is stopping now  no  do you know a man named merrick and another man named pike went on the eldest rover boy  at this the old woman shook her head  never heard tell of them she said  has this dangler any relatives around here asked tom  none that i know of  do you know what kind of man he is asked sam  i never talk about my neighbors answered the old woman and drew up her thin lips and went on shelling peas  feeling it would be useless to ask any more questions the three boys journeyed wearily on to the next farmhouse this belonged to a fat german named gus schmidt who knew the rovers fairly well  yah i let you haf a carriage alretty said gus schmidt put you must pring him back tomorrow hey  we will answered dick  i vos hear some putty goot stories apout you rofer poys went on mr schmidt while he was hooking up his horse you vos on der mississippi rifer hey  we were answered sam  und you vos go owid on der blains und catch some counterfeiters hey  yes we had something to do with it came from tom  und den you vos go py der gulluf of mexico alretty und find a steampoat vos has nopotty got on it pursued gus schmidt ach it vos vonderful vot vos habben

cellar full of vater i vos run on a poard und der poys turn dot poard  and you fell into the water finished tom  not much i chumped back to der sidevalk answered gus schmidt and then laughed heartily at his little joke  the three rover boys were soon in the carriage and on the way to the farm the horse that had been loaned to them was a speedy animal and they made good time despite the muddiness of the road the brief storm had been a severe one and in one spot the roadbed was considerably washed out  the boys took the carriage around to the barn and left it in charge of jack ness the man of all work then they hurried to the house  oh boys i am so glad that you are back exclaimed mrs rover on seeing them i suppose you are wet through better dry your clothing at once or change them and ill get you some hot tea to drink  we are all right aunt martha answered dick we were under shelter during the worst of the storm is uncle randolph around  no he went to carwell on business i am worried about him for i am afraid he got caught in the storm for he drove over  what did he go for questioned tom quickly  oh it was a private matter  about some traction company bonds asked sam who could not hold back his curiosity  yes but how do you happen to know about it demanded his aunt in astonishment  we found something out today aunty said dick its a queer piece of business do you know where uncle randolph was going  you mean in carwell  yes  i think to the hotel  hum mused the eldest of the rover boys wonder if i can get him on the telephone for a telephone line had been put up from oak run to the farm  why dick is there anything wrong demanded mrs rover turning pale  i hope not aunt martha well soon know dont worry please  your uncle was very much disturbed when he went away  i am going to try to telephone to him at once said dick  the telephone was on a landing of the stairs where the bell could readily be heard upstairs and down and dick lost no time in taking down the receiver and calling up the office at oak run  i want to get the hotel at carwell he told the operator this is 685 w he added  i cannot give you carwell was the answer  why not  the lightning struck down some of our poles and the line is out of commission  this was dismaying news and for the moment dick was nonplussed then he spoke to the operator again  can you reach farleytown  yes but the line from farleytown to carwell is down too came over the wire  can you reach deemings corners  no cant get to carwell in any way at all was the decided answer and dick hung up the receiver much crestfallen  the storm has knocked the telephone service into a cocked hat he explained to the others the only way for us to reach carwell is to drive there  then let us do that and right away cried tom who had been talking to his aunt uncle randolph took those ten thousand dollars worth of traction company bonds with him and aunt martha says the bonds were unregistered so anybody could use them  do you think somebody is going to steal the bonds asked the aunt  two men are up to some gamethat is as much as we know said dick thinking it unwise to keep his aunt in the dark any longer and we know the men are rascals he added  oh will theythey attack your uncle  i dont think they are that kind said sam i think theyll try to get the bonds away by some slick game  the aunt hated to see the boys go on a mission of possible peril and yet she wanted to have her husband warned the lads ran down to the barn and had jack ness hitch up a fresh team to a buckboard it was now growing dark  take good care of yourselves cried mrs rover as they drove off if the telephone and telegraph poles are down on the road see that you do not run into any of them  they were driving to the gateway of the big farm when they saw alexander pop running after them flourishing something in his hand aleck was a colored man who had once worked at putnam hall but who was now attached to the rover household  i was jess athinkin that maybe yo boys wasnt armed he said if yo aint dont yo want dis pistol and he held up a weapon he had purchased while on the river trip with them  i didnt think there would be any shooting answered dick but now youve brought it i might as well take the pistol along and he placed the weapon in his pocket  perhaps yo would like to hab dis chicken along went on the colored man he delighted to be with the rover boys on every possible occasion  no the buckboard is crowded now answered dick you do what you can to quiet mrs rover  yes tell her not to worry about us added tom  and dont mention the pistol called sam as the turnout moved on again  after leaving the vicinity of the farm the boys had a distance of thirteen miles to cover part of the road lay through the valley which had given the farm its name but then it ran up and over a series of hills and through several patches of woods under the trees it was dark and they had to slacken their speed for fear of accident  danger ahead cried sam presently and dick who was driving brought the team to a halt across the road lay an uprooted tree  cant drive around that announced sam after an inspection and it will be hard work dragging it out of the way  well drive over it announced dick hold tight if you dont want to be bounced off  he called to the horses and the team moved forward slowly they had not been out of the stable for several days and were inclined to dance and prance they stepped in among the tree branches and then one animal reared and tried to back  get up there dan cried dick none of that tomfoolery get up i say  the other horse wanted to go ahead and he dragged his mate deeper into the tree limbs then without warning the balky animal made a leap cleared the tree and started down the road at breakneck speed  look out the team is running away yelled sam and then stopped short for he as well as the others were in danger of being thrown from the buckboard     chapter v  randolph rovers story   it was a time of peril and all of the rover boys realized this fully the buckboard was a strong one but the road had been washed out so much by the storm that it was very uneven and the jouncing threatened each moment to land one lad or another out on his head  whoa whoa yelled dick and did his best to rein in the team but as mentioned before they had not been out for several days and were consequently fresh and inclined to keep on each had the bit in his teeth so pulling on the lines was of little avail  if we dont stop soon something is going to happen was toms comment and scarcely had he spoken when they went down into a rut and sam was flung up and over a wheel into some brushwood then the team went on as before  the woods left behind they came to a large open field where the ground was rather soft  turn in here dick if you can cried tom  that is what i am trying to do answered the eldest rover boy pulling on one rein with might and main  at first the horses refused to leave the road but at last the strain on the one rein told and dan swerved to the right dragging his mate with him as the wheels of the buckboard sank into the soft soil of the field the pulling became harder and at last the horses dropped into a walk and were then brought to a stop with ease  wonder if sam was hurt were dicks first words as he leaped to the ground and ran to the heads of the team to quiet them  he went out in a hurry thats sure was toms answer can you hold them now  yesthe fire is all out of them  then ill run back and see to sam and tom set off on a dog trot toward the spot where the mishap to his younger brother had occurred he found sam sitting on a rock rubbing his left wrist  hurt he sang out anxiously  this wrist is a little lame and my knee is skinned was the answer did they get away and throw you out  no dick managed to stop them by turning into a soft field it is lucky you didnt break your neck  i might have if i hadnt tumbled into the bushes tom gracious how the buckboard did jounce up and down  limping a little on account of the bruised knee sam followed his brother down the road they found dick had led the team from the field he too was glad to learn sam was not seriously injured  whats to do now asked tom i dont like to trust that team much  oh theyre tamed down now asserted dick i am sure they wont want to run away again  we want to get to carwell as soon as possible but we dont want to do it by breaking our necks went on the funloving rover  once more the three youths got on the buckboard and dick started the team the fire was now all out of them and they went along at their regular gait it had grown so dark the boys had to light a lantern they had brought along  listen said sam presently and held up his hand from out of the darkness they heard the steady chugchug of an automobile it seemed to be coming toward them  maybe its the runabout with those two men cried tom  if it is let us try to stop them answered dick  they brought the team to a halt and listened for a few seconds the chugchug came closer then it died away in the distance on their left  the machine must have taken to a side road was dicks comment  yes and we may as well go on answered tom  once more they proceeded on their way less than a hundred yards were covered when they reached the side road in the muddy roadway the tracks of the rubber tires of the automobile were plainly to be seen  if we were sure they were the men we might go after them said sam  wed not catch them with the horses answered dick  and it might be another machine added tom there are plenty of them in carwell  they were now within two miles of the town and the farmhouses were becoming more numerous just as they struck a paved street tom uttered an exclamation  here comes uncle randolph now  he pointed ahead to where a street light fell on a horse and buggy on the seat of the latter sat randolph rover driving along contentedly  hullo uncle randolph sang out dick and brought the buckboard to a halt  why dick exclaimed the uncle staring at the three boys in surprise what brings you here this time of night  we came to find you uncle randolph said tom and added are your traction company bonds safe  my bonds what do you know of my bonds and now the buggy halted beside the buckboard  we know two men are after them said sam  oh i thought that was a secret answered mr rover  but did you see the men asked dick impatiently  oh yes and i have had a narrow escape from being swindled answered the uncle calmly  oh then you escaped said dick and he and his brothers breathed a sigh of relief  yes i escaped answered randolph rover it was very kind of mr jardell to come to me as he did he went on  mr jardell asked tom who is he  why the treasurer of the traction company  then you havent seen a man named merrick and another named pike asked sam  why no who are they  two rascals who were up to some game we think they were after your traction company bonds  ha perhapsbut no that couldnt be murmured mr rover wiping off the spectacles he wore ieri really do not understand this boys  tell us what youve been doing uncle and then well tell what we know said dick  um well you know that some time ago i invested in ten thousand dollars worth of traction company bondsgot them through an agent in new york  yes  well about a week ago i received a private letter from mr jardell of the traction company stating that there was something wrong with the bonds some plates had been stolen and counterfeit bonds printed  yes  i was asked to keep quiet about the matter for if the facts became generally known the public would become frightened and the bonds would go down in the stock market mr jardell said he would meet me at carwell and have the printer look at my bonds and find out if they were genuine or not  and what did you do then asked dick who began to smell a mouse as the saying goes  i sent mr jardell word i would meet him at the carwell hotel today we met and he and his printer a man named grimes said the bonds i possessed were counterfeits  and then what  of course i was very much distressed went on randolph rover calmly i did not know what to do but mr jardell was very nice about it he said he would take the bonds and get the company to issue good ones in their place he gave me a receipt for them and i am to have the good bonds next week  why should he give you good bonds for bad ones said tom who like dick was almost certain something was wrong  i asked that question too thomas but he said the reputation of his company was at stake he did not want the public at large to know that bogus bonds were on the market  uncle randolph do you know this mr jardell personally asked dick  whyernot exactly but his letters  how did he look  as well as he was able mr rover described the man and also his companion the boys exchanged glances  merrick and pike muttered tom  what is that you say thomas  we think those men were swindlers said sam  swindlers oh my dear samuel impossible cried randolph rover aghast why they were very nice gentlemen very nice they asked me how my scientific farming was getting along and both had read my article in the review on the grafting of grape vines and  but we know these chaps said dick and they are called merrick and pike  and they talked about getting the best of you added tom that is why we followed you to carwell where are the men now  they have gone away but  were they in a green runaboutan auto runabout  they had a runabout yes i do not remember what color it was  the same fellows cried dick uncle randolph unless we are very much mistaken you have been tricked swindled they have robbed you of the ten thousand dollars worth of bonds     chapter vi  waiting for news   it took randolph rover several minutes to comprehend the various statements made by the boys that he had really been swindled by such nicelyspoken men as he had met at the carwell hotel seemed extraordinary to him  i understand the bonds were not registered said dick  that is true groaned his uncle  then anybody could use them  yes although i have the numberson a sheet in my desk at home  well that will make it more difficult for the rascals to dispose of them said sam  id like to catch that merrick and that pike and punch their heads for them commented tom it angered him exceedingly to see how readily his openminded relative had fallen into the swindlers trap  but there may be some mistake said randolph rover in a forlorn tone would that merrick dare to impersonate mr jardell  swindlers will do anything answered sam  we can make sure of that point by sending word to the traction company offices answered dick you are sure mr jardell is the treasurer  yesmr andrew d jardell  let us go back to town and see if we can catch him by long distance phone or by telegraph  shaking his head sadly randolph rover turned his buggy around and followed the boys to the central office of the telephone company here all was activity on account of the brokendown wires but communications were being gradually resumed they looked into the telephone book and at last got a connection which a few minutes later put them into communication with andrew d jardells private residence in the city  is mr jardell at home asked dick who was doing the telephoning  mr jardell is away was the answer  is he at or near carwell new york state  no he is in paris and has been for two weeks  you are sure of this  yes  who are you  i am mrs jardell who are you  my name is richard rover my uncle randolph rover has been swindled out of some traction company bonds by a man who said he was mr jardell  mercy me you dont say so well my husband had nothing to do with it you may be sure he went to london first and then to paris and in a day or two he is to start for switzerland his health is very poor and the doctor said he needed the trip  some more talk followed and mrs jardell advised dick to communicate with the traction company at once and he said he would do so  it wasnt mr jardell at all uncle randolph said the youth as he hung up the receiver the whole thing was a cleverlyplanned swindle and unless you can get the bonds back youll be out the money  at this announcement mr rover nearly collapsedfor he was rather a retired man and had had little to do in a business way since his trip to africa with the boys as related in the rover boys in the jungle he did not know what to do and stood rubbing his hands nervously  the swindlers he murmured really it is getting so that nobody can be trusted  the best thing we can do is to send word to the various towns to stop the runabout with the two men in it on sight and have the rascals held by the authorities said dick who felt he must take charge of affairs  thats the talk cried tom and the sooner we get at it the better  let us find out where that side road leads to added sam i mean the road on which we heard the auto  inside of an hour various messages had been sent by telephone and telegraph it was now growing late and the rovers hardly knew what to do next from their uncle the boys got the whole tale concerning the bonds but the new light shed on the subject did not help matters  they also told the authorities about the cave and the boxes stored there and some men were at once sent off to investigate and take possession of whatever could be found  i think some of us ought to go home said sam aunt martha wont go to bed until we get back and she will be greatly worried  it was finally decided that tom and dick should remain at the carwell hotel over night and sam and his uncle should go home in the buggy the team was put up at the hotel barn and then all hands went to the dining room for a late supper  im as hungry as two bears announced tom  well i shant say no to a good feed answered sam  randolph rover could eat but little now that he realized what had occurred he upbraided himself bitterly for having been so deluded  they talked about scientific farming just to get me into good humor he said bitterly i see it all oh if i can only get my hands on them  after mr rover and sam had departed dick and tom wandered around the hotel and the vicinity for three hours they anxiously awaited some message regarding the two swindlers but nothing came then worn out by the strenuous day they had put in they went to bed and slept soundly until morning  before having breakfast they asked for messages there was one from a village called bahan saying a green runabout with two men had passed through there about midnight but the men had not been captured and it was not known what had become of them  at noon the telephone line between oak run and carwell was in working order once more and the boys sent word home then they left directions at the hotel so that any messages coming in might be transmitted to the rover farm  well i never cried dick suddenly  what now asked his brother  that freight thief and that stuff in the cave  humph it slipped my mind entirely i was thinking only of uncle randolphs bonds  let us find out if anything has been done  at the local police headquarters they found that a wagon had just come in loaded with the three full boxes of goods located at the cave a search was still in progress for dangler but so far he had not been located  this clears up the mystery of the freight thefts said an officer to the boys i only hope we can get our hands on bill dangler  you know him asked dick  oh yes years ago he used to work for the freight division of the railroad  do you know anything of this merrick and the fellow called pike  no but our idea is that the three men were in the deal together probably this merrick and this pike pulled off this affair of the traction company bonds as a side issue  have the freight robberies been large asked sam  not so large at one time but they have been going on for months and the total from four different stations along the line foots up to a good many thousand dollars  well i hope we catch all three of the menand any others who may be in league with them said dick and then he and tom walked off a little later they were on the buckboard and bound for home  when they arrived at the farm they found that their uncle had sent a long letter to the officers of the traction company relating in full what had occurred in return the officials of the concern said they would put a private detective on the case and this was done but weeks went by and nothing was seen or heard of merrick and pike and what had become of the missing bonds remained a mystery  i am anxious to take a look at that cave where the stolen freight was stored said sam one day supposing we drive to it  that will suit me answered dick i want to learn about something elsethat red tin box i saw hanging from a tree  oh yes i had forgotten about that put in tom well shall we walk or drive over  it was decided to drive as far as the cave and not knowing how long they would be gone the boys took a lunch along  now take care of yourselves warned randolph rover dont fall into any more holes  well try to watch out sang out tom  then dick cracked the whip and off the team started at a good pace the eldest rover however holding them well under control it was a clear and beautiful day the boys did not dream of the odd adventure in store for them     chapter vii  a strange letter box   it wont be long now before well have to get back to putnam hall observed sam as they drove along dear old school how i love it  its too bad that we are getting too old to go there said tom but we cant be boys always  i shall be glad to see the other fellows again came from dick  do you know what i think declared tom i think the putnam hall cadets are the finest lot of boys in the world  throwing bouquets at yourself tom said sam with a laugh  well dont you agree with me  i certainly do sam and captain putnam is the best teacher in the world my but wont we have fun when we get back  well have to have a feast in honor of our return said dick and smiled that quiet smile of his which meant so much  the distance to the cave was soon covered and the boys tied their team to a tree in that vicinity they went inside and found that everything even to the empty boxes had been taken away the place had been explored by a number of curiosity seekers  it is queer that this cave wasnt discovered before was dicks comment after they had spent half an hour in walking around  perhaps the opening to the road wasnt so large formerly suggested tom dangler may have enlarged it so he could drive in  that is true well it will be a regular picnic place after this its fame will spread for miles around and dick was right and the cave is a wellknown spot in that portion of new york state to this day  the boys had brought with them two electric pocket lights as they are calledlights they had purchased while on their river outingand with these turned on they walked to the extreme rear of the cave and along the various passageways running up the mountainside  here is where we dropped in said dick pointing out the spot  i wish we could drop outand land up on the mountain outside returned his youngest brother then maybe you could locate that tin lunch box or whatever it was      id get up         very soon     if i had         a big balloon  sang out tom merrily but as there doesnt seem to be a balloon handy whats the matter with trying to climb up he added  and pull down several tons of dirt and rock on your head said dick better go slow we already know how treacherous these holes are youll get out of one by getting into another thats worse  i brought a lariat along said sam  a lariat queried the others  surethe one i bought when we were out west i thought we might use it for climbing purposes it is light but strong and we can lasso a tree or stump up there with it  hurrah sam has solved the problem of how the rover boys shall rise in the world exclaimed tom gaily sam try your skill by all means  show me the tree or stump and i will answered his brother readily  as well as they were able they crawled from one part of the hole to a spot that was somewhat higher then they found a projecting rock above them and sam threw the noose of his lariat over this  will it hold queried dick you dont want to try to climb up and fall  with caution sam pulled on the lariat it held and he went up hand over hand for he was a fair athlete then his brothers followed they now stood on a ledge of rock and the top of the hole was still twelve feet above them  there is a small tree sam said tom looking upward if you can lasso that i think well be all right  once more the youngest rover started to use the lariat as it swung upward it missed the tree and swished out of sight over the edge of the hole  ouch came the unexpected cry from above oh my eye  hullo youve lashed somebody ejaculated dick  i didnt know there was anybody up there answered sam as the noose of the lasso slipped downward  the three rover boys looked upward they heard a hasty movement in the bushes and caught a brief glimpse of a mans face on the instant the man disappeared muttering something to himself  it was dangler ejaculated dick  are you sure asked both of the others in a breath  almost positive  dick had scarcely spoken the last words when down into the hole came a shower of dirt and stones shoved over the edge above the boys were struck by the stones and got some of the dirt in their eyes then down came a second mass of the same sort  stostop that spluttered tom when he could speak do you want to kill us  there was no answer but down came more dirt and stones until the boys were almost covered what to do they did not know until dick suggested they drop from the ledge and seek safety in the cave as they went down a fairsized rock followed scraping toms shoulder and causing him to utter a sharp cry of pain  are you hurt tom asked his two brothers  oh it isnt much panted tom but i wish i could get my hands on that rascal thats all  i am sure now that it must be dangler said dick nobody else around here would try to injure us he is mad because we have exposed him he must know the officers of the law are looking for him  i wish we could catch the rascal muttered tom  supposing we climb the mountain from the outside suggested sam it is a perfectly clear day and is early yet well know enough to look out for pitfalls if we can catch this dangler the three of us ought to be able to manage him  if we are going to try anything like that we want to hurry returned dick he wont remain in this locality longnow he knows he is discovered  maybe he thinks we didnt see him came from tom  well that will be in our favor but hell know somebody will be after him for throwing down the dirt and stones  having eaten a hasty lunch and washed it down with water from a nearby spring the three lads began the ascent of the mountain this was hard work and caused them to perspire freely  im glad im not fat said tom if i was id be winded sure  i think wed better keep quiet as soon as we reach the vicinity of the holes cautioned dick  half an hour of hard climbing brought the boys to the vicinity where they had first fallen into the holes leading to the cave and then they advanced cautiously and in almost absolute silence they stopped to listen several times but heard nothing but the calls of some birds and the trickling of water over the rocks  arriving at the top of the hole from where the dirt and stones had been thrown they gazed around with interest where the soil was soft they could see the footprints of shoes much larger than those they themselves wore  here is his trail going away said dick after a close examination  there is your tin box cried sam pointing to the object still dangling from a distant tree  wait till i see what is in it answered his big brother it wont take but a minute or two  beware of holes cautioned tom  feeling his way through the brushwood dick approached the dangling tin box it was a small affair and now hung open he felt certain in his mind that when he had seen it before it had been closed  the box proved to be empty and dick was somehow disappointed he glanced on the ground and saw a number of bits of paper some old looking and some new he picked up some of the bits and saw they had been written on in pencil but the words or parts of words were undecipherable  well what do you make of it questioned sam as he and tom came up  i think i know what this is answered dick  what  a sort of a private postoffice somebody was in the habit of leaving messages here and dangler or somebody else got the messages from time to time     chapter viii  last days on the farm   i believe you are right said tom after he too had looked over some of the bits of paper strewn around here is the word box and here is the word saturday  yes and here are the words fast freight added sam this was nothing more than a letter box for the freight thieves  but why was it placed here questioned dick its a very outoftheway place and hard to get to  maybe somebody had to come this way answered tom see here is something of a trail  yes and here are those same big footprints exclaimed sam for all we know they may lead to some house or hut on the mountainside  having picked up the majority of the bits of paper and put them in their pockets for future examination the three rover boys followed the path or trail they had discovered it led along the mountainside to where there was a small clearing backed up by a series of rocks from which a spring gushed forth sparkling brightly in the sunshine  id like to get another drink said sam i am terribly thirsty today  wait warned dick and caught his youngest brother by the arm  whats up dick  i see a log cabinover yonder among the trees  yes and i see dangler yelled tom suddenly there he goes with a big bundle over his shoulder and he pointed to the rear of the log cabin a man was just disappearing behind a fringe of brushwood the bundle he carried appeared to be tied up in a horse blanket he was running as hard as he could  for a moment the boys did not know what to do then they ran to the cabin and entered it contained but one room and this they soon discovered was deserted in the chimney a fire was smouldering and the remains of a meal lay scattered over a box that did duty as a table  this must have been danglers hangout was dicks comment he must have come back for his things  yes and this explains why the queer letter box was stationed back there said tom  arent you going to try to catch him asked sam impatiently  to be sure answered dick and rushed out and the others after him  keep back there they heard dangler cry as they appeared on the trail back of the log cabin keep back or it will be the worse for you  stop called dick you might as well give up dangler you are bound to be caught some time  not much i am armed and i warn you to keep back answered the freight thief and then a bend of the trail hid him from view  do you think hed dare to shoot asked tom  there is no telling what a desperate man will do replied dick we had better be cautious  after that they advanced with care presently the trail came out on a mountain road and this passed over some rocks and crossed two other roads they saw no more of dangler and the footprints had disappeared  he has slipped us said tom coming to a halt and resting on a fallen tree hang the luck anyway  he came back to the cabin for his things mused sam i guess he is going to leave the neighborhood and maybe for good  chagrined over their failure to catch the freight thief the boys looked around that neighborhood for awhile and then retraced their steps to the log cabin here they found several old articles of wearing apparel and a few newspapers  here is an envelope said sam fishing the object out from behind the box that had done duty as a table it is addressed to william dangler must have been some letter he got  anything in it  no  what is the postmark  it is almost blurred out said sam he took the envelope to the light well i declare ithaca  ithaca cried tom  why thats the city we stop at to take the boat for putnam hall exclaimed dick  i know it  this is interesting to say the least was the comment of the oldest rover boy wonder if dangler has friends or confederates in ithaca  we must notify the police of this said tom and the sooner the better  satisfied that they could learn nothing more by remaining around the log cabin the boys departed and inside of an hour were on their buckboard and bound for the farm from that place they called up the authorities and informed them of what they had learned another search was at once instituted for bill dangler but the rascal was not captured  the next day mr anderson rover came home and the boys and randolph rover had to acquaint him with all that had taken place he shook his head when he heard of the unregistered bonds  i am afraid you will never see them again randolph he said to his brother  i am afraid so myself was the mournful reply  anderson rover had come home to see his boys off to school  i want you to make the most of your opportunities while at putnam hall this term he said for it is to be your last  yes i know that answered tom but after that what  we will talk that over later tom you must either go to college or get ready to go into business  id like to go to college put in dick  so would iif i knew what kind of a place it was added tom  if it was as fine a place as putnam hall id jump at it came from sam  the next few days flew by quickly during that time dick received a letter from dan baxter the former bully of putnam hall which interested him not a little this letter ran in part as follows  i am glad to say that i am now doing fairly well i tried several positions and am now a traveling salesman for a large carpet house i get fifteen dollars per week all my expenses and a commission on sales so i consider myself lucky  when i look back on what i once was dick i can scarcely realize what a change has come but i feel happier than i ever was and i am in hopes that i shall live to make a man of myself yet i am trying to give up all my bad habits and i havent smoked or drank a glass of liquor since i left you in the south                                       thats the kind of a letter i like to get said dick as he let his brothers peruse the communication it does a fellows heart good doesnt it  i am glad we let him have that hundred dollars said sam do you think hell pay it back  here is a postscript in which he says he will send a money order next week  he certainly means to pull himself together said tom well now he has turned over a new leaf i wish him the best of luck  almost before they knew it it was time to leave the farm and journey to putnam hall everybody was sorry to see them go  i cant abide yo boys being away nohow wailed aleck pop it jess dont seem natural to have yo gone dats wot it dont  oh well be back some day aleck answered dick and if we go off on some trip later maybe well take you along  i most wish i was a waiter agin at de hall sighed the colored man  they cant spare you from here said sam  oh i know dat sam  the boys trunks had been packed and sent on ahead so all they carried with them were their dresssuit cases their father drove them to the railroad station at oak run and their aunt and uncle and the others around the farm came out on the piazza to see them off  now be good boys admonished their aunt martha and take care and dont get sick  and be sure and study all you can said their uncle randolph remember nothing is quite so grand as learning in this world  yo keep out ob mischief cried aleck pop shaking a warning finger at tom who grinned broadly  and then the carriage started off and the journey to putnam hall was begun     chapter ix  at the wild west show   as my old readers know putnam hall was located not far from the village of cedarville on cayuga lake to get to the school the boys had to take a train to ithaca and then board a little lake steamer stopping at cedarville and various other points along the shore  it seems a long time since we were at the hall observed dick as they settled down in the train  and what a lot of things have happened since then exclaimed sam i can tell you what well have a story to tell to the others wont we  i guess songbird fred and hans mueller have already told everything returned tom more than likely songbird has concocted some verses about it  the run to ithaca took several hours and they lunched at noon in the dining car it was a beautiful day and the boys enjoyed the scenery as much as if they had never seen it before  i hope we can make a good connection for cedarville said sam as they left the train and started for the dock from which the golden star made her trips on the lake but they were doomed to disappointment the steamboat had had a breakdown and would be delayed two hours or more  as there was nothing to do but to wait the boys checked their dresssuit cases and then started for a stroll through the city they soon learned that a wild west show was giving an exhibition there and consequently the place was crowded with folks from the surrounding districts  i shouldnt mind going to the wild west show observed tom do you think we have time  we could spend an hour there anyway answered sam  it depends on where the show is to be held came from dick  they soon ascertained that the show grounds were not far off and made their way thither the exhibition had already started and they got inside the big tentlike enclosure as speedily as possible  the show was a fairly good one and the boys thoroughly enjoyed the trick riding by cowboys and the fancy rifle shooting then came some wild riding by real indians  almost makes a fellow feel as if hed like to be on a horse himself said tom he liked horseback riding very well  say i want you to look over there said sam pointing to the seats some distance away do you see that man sitting near the bottomright beside that boy with the basket of peanuts  tom and dick looked in the direction pointed out and the eldest rover gave a start  sam do you think it is the fellow called merrick he exclaimed  doesnt he look like it  he certainly doesnow you speak of it came from tom and by the way dont you remember about that envelope picked up in the log cabin it was postmarked ithaca  so it was perhaps this merrick lives here  let us go over and get a closer look at him said dick and left his seat followed by the others  there was a large crowd so they had some difficulty in making their way to where the man was located in his haste dick bumped against a waiter selling lemonade and spilled the contents of two glasses on the ground  excuse me he said  hi youve got to pay for the lemonade roared the waiter angrily you pay up you clumsy clown  see here my man ill pay you but i want you to understand you cant call me a clown said dick angrily  ah go on wid yer pay up see  heres your money and dick held out ten cents now am i a clown or not  well er  am i or not and the eldest rover boy doubled up his fists he knew he must take the bull by the horns with such an individual as that before him  excuse me mumbled the fellow and moved away iersuppose yer couldnt help it  sam and tom had gone ahead and they were now close to the man they took to be merrick  no mistake here declared sam as he got a good square look at the fellows face  he sees us exclaimed tom a second later he is trying to get away  the boy was right merrick had seen them he was greatly amazed for he had not dreamed of their being in that vicinity he left his seat in a hurry and elbowing his way through the crowd started for the entrance to the big tentlike enclosure  by this time dick was coming up and sam and tom quickly acquainted him with what was going on all three of the rovers pushed through the big crowd after merrick but before they could draw near the rascal was outside and running between a number of carriages and wagons standing in that vicinity  come on after him cried tom we must capture him if we can  they set off on a smart run but merrick could run also and fear now lent speed to his flying feet on and on went the swindler with the rover boys less than a square behind him then as they came to a number of tall buildings merrick darted around a corner and out of sight  when the rover boys reached the corner they looked in every direction for the man only a few people were about the majority of the town folks being at the show  wonder if he went straight on or took to some side street mused dick  ill go straight on said sam dick you can take one side street and tom can take the other and away went the youngest rover at a fresh burst of speed  sams advice was considered good and soon all of the boys had scattered the street tom followed was lined with tall tenements and ended in little more than an alleyway  coming to another corner tom paused and gazed in all directions as he turned his head he saw a man look out from a tenement doorway then the head was drawn back quickly  merrick muttered tom to himself and turned back to the tenement which was a building four stories high on one side was something of an alleyway and beyond were other tenements and the rear of a big building used for a factory and offices  tom found the front door of the tenement wide open and he did not hesitate to go in nobody was in sight but he heard hasty footsteps on the floor above  merrick you might as well give up he called out come down here  go on about your business young fellow came the reply if you try to follow me youll get the worst of it  undaunted by this threat tom mounted the stairs two steps at a time as he did so he heard merrick go up a second flight and then a third  must think he can hide on the roof thought tom well ill corner him if i can  as tom ran through the hallway on the third floor a door opened and an old woman confronted him  what do yez want here she demanded in strong irish accents  i am after a thief answered tom  a thafe sure an theres no thafe in this house  he just ran in here from the street  bedad is that true now where did he go to  i dont know how do you get to the roof  be the laddher at the back av the hall  the old woman pointed in the direction and tom sped on soon he reached a common wooden ladder leading to a scuttle which was wide open as the youth mounted the ladder the scuttle was banged shut almost hitting him on the top of the head then he heard hasty footsteps across the roof  maybe he thinks he can jump to one of the other buildings said tom to himself well if he can do it so can i  he pushed the scuttle up with difficulty for it was heavy then with caution for he did not want to receive a kick in the head he gazed around the roof of the tenement nobody was in sight  with caution tom stepped out on the roof a number of chimneys were not far off and he wondered if merrick was concealed behind them  i wish i had a club or something he thought id have a tough time of it up here if it came to a handtohand struggle  with eyes on the alert tom made his way to one chimney and then another the swindler was not there nor was he on the adjoining roof then the youth got down on his hands and knees and looked over the edge of the tenement on the alleyway side here was an iron fire escape running from the fourth story to the second on the fire escape he saw merrick descending to the bottom with all possible rapidity     chapter x  jolly old schoolmates   evidently the swindler had dropped from the roof to the upper landing of the fire escape he was now almost to the bottom  stop cried tom but he knew the command was a useless one at the sound of his voice merrick looked up and muttered something the boy could not catch then he swung himself from the bottom landing of the fire escape and dropped to the ground  if he can get down that way so can i thought tom and in another moment he was descending the escape in the same fashion as the swindler had done as he reached the second landing of the escape he saw merrick turn the corner of the alleyway and disappear on the street beyond  when tom came out on the street he almost ran into the arms of two burly men who had come out of the tenement both caught him by the arms  what does this mean young fellow asked one savagely doing the sneakthief act  i am after a thief was the answer did you see a man running away  no and we dont think there was a man answered one of the tenement dwellers  well there was a man said tom come if you will help me catch him i will reward you well  what did he steal  some bonds worth ten thousand dollarsthey belonged to my uncle explained tom hastily  the promise of a reward made the men attentive and they soon agreed to assist tom as much as possible then dick and sam came in sight and had to be told of what had happened  the two men knew the tenement and factory district well and they led in a hunt lasting over half an hour and a policeman was likewise called into service  ive heard of that bond case said the policeman id like to lay my hands on merrick  but the hunt was a useless one for merrick could not be found for their trouble tom gave the two men from the tenement a dollar each with which they had to be satisfied the policeman promised to report the matter at headquarters and as there seemed to be nothing else to do the three rover boys walked down to the steamboat dock first however sending a telegram to randolph rover relating briefly what had occurred  its a great pity we didnt catch this merrick sighed tom when they were steaming along the lake shore perhaps well never see or hear of him again  well we dont want merrick as much as we want uncle randolphs traction company bonds answered dick if he has disposed of the bonds it wont do much good to catch himunless of course he can get the bonds back  and he may not have had the bonds put in sam that fellow pike may have handled them  that is true tooalthough i somehow think merrick is the prime mover in this swindle  i think that too said tom  the golden star was a trim little sidewheeler with a fairsized deck fore and aft the boys sat on the forward deck and as the boat ran along the shore of the lake they pointed out many localities known to them  there is where we went on the paper chase said sam  yes and that is where we went on one of the encampments added tom  we came fishing down here once put in dick one of the boys went overboard  it was john fenwick the fellow we used to call mumps said tom by the way i wonder what has become of him  went west i think answered sam one of the boys said he was in the insurance business with some relative  he was a great toady to dan baxter  so he was but he had some good points too  so the talk ran on until cedarville was reached on account of the delay it was dark and the boys wondered if they would find any conveyance to take them to the hall  hullo here is peleg snuggers with the carryall cried sam as the general utility man of the school appeared how are you peleg  fust rate replied the man grinning been waiting a long time for you  sorry but we couldnt make the captain hurry the boat answered dick  peleg youre a sight for tired optics said tom giving the mans hand a squeeze that made him wince hows your grandmother  why master tom i aint  and your greatgranduncle is he over the shingles yet  why master tom i aint got no  and your second cousin by your first wifes sister did she get over the heart failure she had when the canary took a fit  now see here master tom dont you go for to joking an old man  joking peleg returned tom solemnly why you know i never joke and he took on an injured look  dont joke eh well if you aint the greatest joker putnam hall ever see then ill eat my hat declared peleg jump in an dont ask me about no grandfathers or wifes sisters nor nuthing aint you hungry  hungry i could eat a brickbat fried in lemon oil  then unless you hurry you wont get no supper  oh mrs green will get something for us never fear said dick mentioning the matron of putnam hall who was a warmhearted and generous woman even though a little bit peppery at times  all the other boys here now asked dick as they drove off in the direction of putnam hall  i reckon the most of em are master dick so many coming an going i can hardly keep track of em  fred garrison songbird powell and hans mueller back asked sam  yes an they told me some wonderful stories of your doings down south  are larry colby and george granbury here questioned dick  yes  ill be glad to meet larry and george again went on dick i suppose theyll have something to tell of what they did during vacation  every time i come to the hall i think of the first time i came said tom do you remember how i set off that giant firecracker  yes and how old josiah crabtree put you under arrest for it added sam wonder where old crabtree is now  he is out of prison answered peleg snuggers i got that from a man in cedarville the man said as how crabtree went to canada  hope he stays there and never attempts to bother mrs stanhope again was dicks comment  about half the distance to the hall had been covered when there came a shout on the road and peleg snuggers had to rein in his team then several boys appeared dressed in cadet uniforms for putnam hall was a military academy  whoop here they are fellows hurrah for the rovers  rovers by name and rovers by nature  say tom how do you like being adrift on the gulf of mexico  sam dont you want to become a regular cowboy  dick when i buy a houseboat im going to engage you as captain  and then the students in the road clambered into the carryall and tumbled all over the rovers hugging them and trying to shake hands at the same time  larry glad to see you but please dont smother me  ill love you george if only you wont put your elbow through my ribs  i knew fred would meet us  you gif me der honor of dis came from hans mueller i tole dem fellers to come along alretty  good for you hansy old boy cried sam and gave the german cadet a tight squeeze  songbird why dont you turn on the poetry pipe line and let her flow queried larry colby who even though an officer of one of the companies was as jolly as the rest of the students  yes give us something by all means said tom something about stilly night fond recollections starved cats and the like  humph stilly night and starved cats snorted songbird powell you must think im running a hash mill instead of  by no means songbird dear piped tom we all know youre the sole owner of the largest poem factory in new york state let her flow by all means  if you dont recite well sing said dick  no dont do thatyet pleaded songbird ive got a verse or two all ready and he began in slow measured tones      back to dear old putnam hall         back to the days of yore     back to the good old times we had         may we have many more     back to our lessons and our books         and to the teachers too     back to the drills and hours off      and to the mutton stew  finished tom dont forget to put in mrs greens wonderful mutton stews  no mutton stews in this snorted songbird the last line was when days were bright and blue and then he continued      we love to gather here again         and talk of times to come     and plot and plan and plan and plot         and plan and plotand plot and plot     and planand planand plan  songbird youve plotted and planned too much interrupted dick as the wouldbe poet hesitated lets sing a song  thats the talk cried fred garrison and started up the song well known to all of them      putnam halls the place for me         tra la lee tra la lee     putnam halls the place for me         the best old school i know  and then as the carryall swung up to the campus they set up the school yell which brought out a score of students to witness the arrival of the rover boys     chapter xi  william philander tubbs   as my old readers know putnam hall was a handsome structure of brick and stone standing in the center of a large plot of ground bounded on two sides by cedar woods to the front was the campus and the wagon road and beyond this a slope leading to the lake to the rear were rich farm lands cultivated solely for the benefit of the institution besides the school there were a building fitted up as a gymnasium and also several barns and carriage houses the hall was built in the form of the letter e and was three stories high it contained numerous classrooms a private office a large mess hall or dining room and both large and small dormitories  the master of the school was captain victor putnam who was a bachelor and as kind as he was strict captain putnam was a west point graduate and had modeled his school somewhat after that famous government institution when the school was first organized the rover boys did not go there but a number of other bright and lively lads did and what these cadets accomplished has already been related in a line of stories called the putnam hall series starting with the putnam hall cadets these lads had some awful quarrels with the head assistant josiah crabtree and they were glad when the rovers appeared and made it so hot for crabtree that he had to leave george strong was now first assistant in place of crabtree and the cadets found him a teacher after their own heart  hurrah here are the rovers was the cry from the campus welcome back  boys i am glad to see you again came from captain putnam as he appeared at the front door and shook hands from what i have heard you have had rather strenuous times during the past vacation  that is true captain answered dick i am glad to get back here  so am i glad came from tom and sam and all shook hands then the boys were told to go to the mess hall where a hot supper awaited them here mrs green met them with her round ruddy and smiling face  its wonderful stories ive heard of you said the matron i declare youll have to go into a museum  not until after supper anyhow answered tom dryly and then everybody present laughed  the supper over the boys went up to their dormitory and here as many of the cadets as could crowded in to talk over the doings of the past vacation larry colby had spent the time on the coast of maine and george granbury had been to the thousand islands and to montreal  yes crabtree is in canada said george i met him in montreal and i can tell you he looked seedy enough  well he deserves to be seedy was dicks comment he could not forget how the former teacher had endeavored to hypnotize the widow stanhope into marrying him so that he could gain possession of the money she was holding in trust for dora  of course all the boys wanted to know about dan baxter for he had been a leading character at the hall for many years some shook their heads at the idea of the former bully reforming  it will be the greatest surprise i ever heard of was larrys comment  hell do itmark my words said dick  let us hope so said george  well it would seem that putnam hall is not to suffer for the want of a bully came from fred weve got a new one here who is as bad as dan baxter ever was  who is he questioned dick with interest  a chap named tad sobber he is a big overbearing fellow with hardly any education and he wants to rule everybody i cant understand how captain putnam took him as a pupil  he came well recommended thats why answered songbird but i guess the captain has found out that the recommendation was false  he shant rule me said tom decidedly  we want no bullies here put in dick the day for all such is past  so say we all of us cried several cadets  at that moment came a knock on the door and a tall youth wearing an unusually high collar and very large cuffs came in  well if it isnt our old chum william philander tubbs cried dick running forward and grasping the hand of the dude student  hullo tubbsey old man said tom gaily whats the price of the best cologne now  veryahglad to meet you again drawled tubbs buterplease dont call me tubbsey because it isnt my name dont you know  to be sure buttertubi mean washtub answered tom had your hair crimped lately  now tom i never crimp my hairit hurts the color dont you know explained william philander i use  glue with an egg beater finished tom with a wink at his friends by the way tubblets do you know what i heard some girls say last week they said they thought you were a regular fashion plate  now did they really gushed the dude much pleased whoersaid it  two girls living not many miles from here  youahdont happen to know their names  no but i can tell you all about them  ah then please do tom said the dude eagerly to have any young ladies think of him pleased him immensely  well these are a couple of young ladies who work in a laundry maybe they wash your shirts they are colored and  colored gasped the dude and then a shout of laughter went up in the midst of which william philander started to leave the room  dont go away mad billy cried tom isnt it nice even to have two dusky damsels think of you  no it is notit isis horrid answered william philander i think you areerpoking fun at me  never did such a thing in my life my dear fellowits against my internal regulations but how have you been since the week before next month  i had a delightful vacation  took the girls out to icecream sociables and yellow teas every day you wasnt playing golf or hopscotch i suppose  iertook the young ladies out somewe had glorious times dont you know one moonlight night on lake george i shall never forget dont you know we were out in a tiny rowboat and the moon was sparkling over the water and geraldine and i  lucky geraldine sighed tom and thrice lucky philander willanderi mean william philander  cant you make up a poem about geraldine songbird asked sam  and dont forget to put in the moonlight came from dick  and the silvery waves and murmuring breeze added fred  how much older than you is geraldine any how quizzed tom  geraldine is  you havent got to tell her age if she is over thirty billy said larry her age is sacred after that you know  and dont tell us even if she has false teeth came from sam  and it doesnt make any real difference whether her hair is her own or not  its hers if it is paid for said tom you dont suppose a girl that billy would fall in love with would wear tresses that were stolen  and to think she may be fat sighed sam i hope she doesnt weigh over two hundred willy  oh dear me cried the dude in desperation i want you to remember  that she is yours and yours only finished tom yes nobody shall walk in your corn patch billnot over my dead body but tell ussecretly if you mustdoes she wear a number eight shoe or a twelve  if you dont stop your fooling gasped the dude  he is going to keep his dreadful secrets to himself cried tom mournfully alack and too bad but never mind well all come to the wedding tubblets and bring lemons if you say so  who said i was going to get married  is it to be a church affair or just a little private home gathering went on tom seriously if its to be in a church and you want us all for rushersi mean ushers why  well all be on the job finished dick wouldnt miss the chance for a farm with a blind mule thrown in  vots der madder mid me peing a flower girl asked hans grinning broadly  no hansy youll have to carry billys coattails for him said fred the latest style from london dont you know is to have them trailing on behind like  oh stop stop screamed william philander putting his hands to his ears you are all perfectly horrid dont you know ill not remain another minute and he fled from the dormitory the laughter of the crowd ringing in his ears as he departed     chapter xii  what happened on the stairs   in a few days the rover boys felt perfectly at home once moreindeed it was as if they had never been away so sam said the majority of the students were old friends although there was a fair sprinkling of new boys  it was not until the end of the week that dick rover came into contact with tad sobber a stocky youth with a shock of black hair and eyes which were cold and penetrating sobber was with a chum named nick pell and both eyed dick in a calculating manner which was highly offensive  hes the fellow who does the hero act whispered sobber to pell in a manner meant to reach dicks ears wants to make a regular grandstand play all the time  without hesitation dick wheeled about  was that remark intended for me he demanded sharply  his suddenness took tad sobber off his guard  what if it was he demanded in return  i dont like it thats all  humph i dont care whether you like it or not grunted sobber  see here tad sobber let us have an understanding said dick calmly i understand that you are trying to bully everybody in this school now this cannot be we have had several bullies here and we have gotten rid of them all we want no more  humph trying to be the bully yourself eh sneered sobber  no i am only giving you warning the other boys have told me about you  tad has a right to act as he pleases put in nick pell  no he has not captain putnam expects every student here to be a gentleman  oh dont preach rover cried tad sobber i can take care of myself without your advice  well i warn you to keep your distance so far as i am concerned and keep a civil tongue in your head said dick  what this war of words might have led to there is no telling just at that moment the school bell rang and all of the students had to hurry to their respective classes  it may be mentioned here that sam tom and dick were now in the same grade this may be wondered at but the fact of the matter was that sam by hard work the term previous had caught up to tom while dick because of being away on some business for his father at various times had dropped a little behind  had a little runin with sobber said dick to his brothers when he got the chance and related the particulars  he said something about me behind my back said sam i dont know what it was but i am certain it was nothing complimentary  we must watch him said tom if we do not he may try to play us foul  as this was to be their last term at putnam hall all of the rovers determined to do their best in their studies so they spent no time in fooling while at their classes once or twice tom found it hard to resist playing a joke but a look from dick usually made him turn to his books again  it was now the season for football and several school teams had been organized tom and dick were on one team headed by larry colby there was another team headed by tad sobber and on this nick pell was a quarterback how sobber had ever gotten the captaincy of this team was a mystery  they want to play us next saturday said larry one afternoon what do you fellows say he put the question to his fellow members of the eleven  i dont care much to play sobber and pell said tom promptly  exactly the way i feel about it added dick but ill play if the rest want to  some demurred but in the end the match was arranged and it started on the school grounds at two oclock the following saturday afternoon  i think it will be useless to try any mass playing said larry sobber and pell and some of the others are too heavy for us well have to trust to some swift passes and quick runs  in the first half of the game sobbers eleven got ten points while larrys team got nothing  sobber is too brutal for me said tom he deliberately kicked me in the shins  if he does it again knock him down advised dick promptly  larrys eleven went into the second half with vigor they soon got a goal and followed it up by two more then sobber claimed a foul but it was not granted  if anybody is fouling it is you said dick you fouled tom twice if you do it again  never mind dick interrupted larry go on and play or give up he added to tad sobber  i want dick rover to understand that he began sobber when another player pulled him back some hot words followed and then the game proceeded larrys eleven made another touchdown and kicked the goaland thus won a substantial victory much to sobbers disgust and that of his crony nick pell  no use of talking those rover boys make me sick said sobber when he and nick pell were alone everybody in this school seems to toady to them  if i had been you id have pitched into dick rover on the gridiron answered pell  well i wanted to but the others wouldnt have it but ill polish him off some dayand polish off tom too added sobber uglily  two of the small boys of the school had been taken sick and in order to keep them quiet they were removed to the top floor of the institution and one of the colored waiters was ordered to carry their meals up to them dick knew both of the lads and he frequently went up to pay them a visit and cheer them up a bit  one day he was just returning from a visit to the sick students when he heard a noise in the hallway on the second floor he looked down the stairs and saw tom and tad sobber near a landing having a wordy quarrel nick pell was approaching and so were fred and hans  for two pins id give you a good thrashing rover the bully was saying you cant lord it over me understand that  well i want you to keep your distance tad sobber returned tom and i stick to it that you kicked me on purpose during the football game  both boys were walking to the stairs landing and dick and the others who heard the words followed then of a sudden the crowd that was gathered saw sobber catch tom by the throat  lelet go gasped tom  take that retorted the bully and banged toms head against the wall  there was a scuffle near the stairs and both boys fell up against the railing  look out tom cried dick hell throw you down the stairs and he tried to go to his brothers assistance but before he could reach the spot the two contestants had separated  that for you roared sobber and aimed a blow for toms eye tom dodged and then let out with his right fist the blow landed on the bullys chin he tottered backward lost his balance and pitched down the stairs  just as the bully went backwards a side door of the mess hall opened and the colored waiter who carried the food to the sick lads upstairs came out he held a trayful of dainties in his hands crash came sobber into the tray and he and the dishes and the waiter went to the floor in a confused heap  illustration crash came sobber into the tray  fo de lan sake gasped the waiter what fo you dun dat to me  oh groaned the bully and tried to get up on one cheek he had a dab of jelly and his hand and shirt front were covered with broth the sight was such a comical one that the boys on the landing could not help but laugh  yo dun bust de whole dinnah up was the waiters comment as he arose and surveyed the wreck the food had been scattered in all directions and half of the dishes were broken  it wasnt my fault growled tad sobber tom rover knocked me down the stairs  it was your own fault cried tom you started the fight i didnt  somebodys got to pay fo dis smash said the waiter i aint gwine to do it why i ought to sue yo fo damages dats wot he added glaring wrathfully at sobber  ill fix tom rover for this exclaimed the bully and looked up the stairs at the laughing students ill make him laugh on the other side of his face  and he ran up the stairs with the intention of attacking tom again     chapter xiii  dora grace and nellie   that tad sobber was in a thorough rage was easily to be seen his eyes were full of hate and he looked ready to fly at tom and tear him to pieces  all of the boys expected to see a great fight and some backed away from the landing to give the contestants more room  but before anything could be done dick leaped to the front and barred the bullys further progress  stop it sobber he said quietly but firmly  get out of my way dick rover roared the bully this is none of your affair  then ill make it my affair answered the eldest rover boy you shall not attack my brother here  dont worry dicki can take care of him put in tom undauntedly and doubled up his fists maybe hed like to go down stairs again and smash some more dishes  not when john fly am carryin dem put in the colored waiter who stood looking at the wreckage with a sober face i dont want no moah such knockovers i dont and he shook his woolly head decidedly  the noise had summoned numerous cadets to the scene and now george strong the head teacher appeared  what is the trouble here he demanded  for the moment nobody answered him and he gazed in wonderment at the broken dishes and the scattered food  been a accident sah said john fly dat young genman dun fall down de stairs an knock me ober tray an all sah  did you fall down stairs sobber  no sir i was thrown down by tom rover replied the bully  thrown down repeated the head teacher in surprise  he attacked me and i hit back explained tom it was his own fault that he fell down stairs had he let me alone there would have been no trouble  it is falsehe hit me first said the bully  that is not so cried fred sobber struck the first blow  yah dot is der fact alretty put in hans he vos caught dom py der throat und knock his head py der vall chust so hard like nefer vos  he hit me first didnt he nick said the bully turning to his crony  ii think he did stammered nick pell he did not dare to tell an outright falsehood i think it was all tom rovers fault he added after a surly look from sobber  all of you know it is against the rules to fight in this school said mr strong sternly  well i only fought after i was attacked answered tom doggedly  mr strong whether you believe it or not my brother speaks the plain truth came from dick i was coming from larmores room and saw it all had you been in toms place you would have done as he did  these plain words from dick made george strong hesitate he knew the rover boys well and knew that they were generally in the right more than this he had caught tad sobber in a falsehood only the day before  you may all go to your rooms and i will see about this later he said sobber as you broke the dishes you will have to pay for them  cant rover pay half the bill growled the bully  no for i cannot see how he is to blame for that  after this some sharp words followed tad sobber was impudent and as a consequence was marched off to a storeroom which was occasionally used as a guardhouse by the teachers and captain putnam here he had to stay in solitary confinement for twentyfour hours and on the plainest kind of a diet this imprisonment made sobber furious and he vowed he would get square with tom and dick for it if it cost him his life  they may have been able to down other fellows in this school but they shant down me was what he told nick pell  well you want to go slow in what you do answered pell ive been talking to some of the others and ive learned that they got the best of several fellows who were here at different timesdan baxter lew flapp and some others  humph i am not afraid of them growled tad sobber i suppose they think because they are rich and have traveled some they can lord it over everybody well ill show them a trick or two before im done with them  after tad sobber came out of confinement the rover boys thought he might try to play some underhand trick on tom and consequently kept their eyes open but nothing developed for some days and then it came in a most unexpected way  the boys settled down to their studies but it was not in their nature to go in for all work and no play on the following saturday they asked for permission to visit cedarville to buy some things sam and tom needed they took with them songbird and hans and went on foot the weather being ideal for walking just before leaving they saw sobber and pell hurry away also in the direction of the town  i wonder where they are going mused dick  sobber is going to take a run by steamboat to ithaca answered songbird i heard him speak to captain putnam about it  is pell going along  i dont think so  the three rover boys and their friends were soon on the way they felt in the best of spirits and powell could not resist the temptation to break out into his usual doggerel      i love to roam oer hill and dale     in calm or storm or windy gale     i love the valley and the hill     the brooklet and the running rill     i love the broad and placid lake      where we can swim or take a skate  finished tom and then went on      and just remember of the rest     i love old putnam hall the best  that last sentiment hits me said fred tell you what fellows no place like our school  i dink i make me some boetry alretty said hans solemnly and began      i lof to hear der insects hum     i lof to chew on chewing gum     i lof to see der moon shine owit      and love to eat my sauerkraut  added tom gaily songbird cant you get up some real nice bit of verse about sauerkraut and limburger cheese for hans benefit  the idea of poetry about sauerkraut and limburger cheese snorted the verse maker in disgust  well anyway the lines about the cheese would be good and strong was dicks comment  a poem about sauerkraut wouldnt do for this automobile age said sam dryly  why not asked tom  because sauerkraut belongs to the cabbage answered the youngest rover and then dodged a blow tom playfully aimed at him  i shant try to make up any more verses said songbird every time i try  hullo here comes a carriage with three young ladies in it called out dick  they look familiar to me announced tom yes they are dora stanhope and grace and nellie laning he cried  well this is a pleasure said songbird and forgot all about what he was going to say concerning his verse making  the carriage was soon up to them it was a twoseated affair and on the front seat were dora and nellie and in the rear grace and mrs stanhope  we were going to stop at putnam hall for a few minutes said dora after the greetings were over it was such a lovely day we couldnt resist the temptation to go out for a long drive  sorry we wont be at the hall to receive you answered dick and he gave dora such an earnest look that the pretty girl blushed  the girls have something up their sleeve said mrs stanhope and they wanted to see you and captain putnam about it  we are getting up a little party announced nellie it is to come off at doras home some time this fall we wanted to find out if captain putnam

they do  stood right in the middle of the road and would not get out of the way explained grace i think they were perfectly horrid  they made us drive around to one side and we nearly went into a ditch added dora  and then after we had passed they burst out laughing at us continued nellie they certainly werent a bit nice  well have to settle with sobber and pell for this said dick and his face took on a serious look that bode no good for the cadets who had played so ungallant a part towards his lady friends     chapter xiv  at the icecream establishment   the lanings and the stanhopes had been in the best of health since returning from the south mrs stanhope was no more the pale and delicate person she had been and her former nervous manner was entirely gone the cheeks of the three girls were like roses and it was no wonder that the rovers thought them the nicest young ladies in the whole world  wish we were in a carriage observed tom after the turnout had gone on then we might have gone for a drive together  i know what tom would like said sam a nice buggy and a slow horse and nellie beside him  humph please change the names to sam and grace and youll hit it closer answered tom his face growing red  im going to make up a poem about them some day said songbird i shall call itlet me seeah yesthe three fair maidens of cedarville  dont cried dick songbird if you dare to do anything like that  youll have to leave dora out anyway said tom if you dont dick will get in your wool sure he  say what about sobber and pell broke in the eldest rover his face quite red i feel like punishing them for making the ladies drive into the ditch  well remember it answered sam if we catch them in cedarville lets speak of it and see what they have to say for themselves  speaking about a party observed songbird as they approached the village do you realize that we havent had any sort of a feast at the hall since we got back to the grind  fred was saying the same thing only a few days ago answered tom we certainly ought to have some sort of a blowout  vot you vos going to plow owid asked hans innocently  blow out the stuffings from a mince pie hansy  vere you vos plow dem to dom  blow them into your stomach have a spreada feasta fillup so to speaksomething to eat cheese sandwiches cake pie pudding jam oranges bananas lard salt plum pudding toothpicks icecream turnips and other delicacies went on the funloving rover rapidly  ach yah i understand now aint it i like dem feasts ve haf him in von of der pedrooms alretty yet hey  if the crowd is willing said sam for one i vote in favor of it  second the nomination put in tom promptly it is elected by a unanimous vote we have a feast at the school some night in the near future at eleven oclock g m  the idea of a feast pleased all the boys they always got enough to eat during regular meal hours at the hall but there was something enticing in the idea of having a feast on the sly some night in one of the dormitories they had had a number of such in the past and these had been productive of a good deal of sport  let us go down to the steamboat landing and see if we can see anything of pell and sobber suggested dick if sobber is going to ithaca hell most likely go by the golden star  they were walking along the main street of cedarville when they chanced to look into the principal candy store there in front of the soda fountain were the bully of the hall and his crony they were drinking soda and talking to a young girl who had served them  hullo here they are cried sam and came to a halt  as they looked into the place they saw tad sobber reach over the counter and catch the girl clerk by her curls he held fast grinning into her face while she tried to pull away from him  the mean wretch cried dick he tries to make himself as obnoxious as he can to everybody he meets  oh please let go came in the girls voice through the open doorway you hurt me  dont worry i wont hurt you replied sobber still grinning  but ii dont want my curls pulled pleaded the frightened girl oh please let go wont you  i want you began the bully but did not finish for at that moment he felt dicks hand on his ear then he received a yank that pained him exceedingly  ouch he yelled and dropped his hold of the girl oh my ear dick rover what did you do that for  i did it to make you behave yourself answered dick sternly sobber i didnt really think you could be so mean he went on  ii wasnt hurting the girl grumbled the bully and its none of your business anyway he added suddenly in a blaze of passion  after this you leave her alone  tad sobber glared at dick for an instant then he raised his glass of soda and attempted to dash it into dicks face but sam saw the movement knocked up the bullys arm and the soda went into nick pells ear  hi stop roared nick pell as the soda trickled down his neck what did you do that for  it was sam rovers fault answered sobber  my brand new collar is spoilt  charge it to your crony said tom  ill fix you fellows roared the bully and raised the empty soda glass over dicks head but now tom rushed in and wrenched the glass from sobbers hand in the meantime the girl behind the counter had become more frightened than ever and she ran to the back of the store to summon assistance  it looked as if there might be a regular fight but in a few seconds the proprietor of the store appeared armed with a mop stick he had picked up he happened to be the father of the girl and she told him how tad sobber had caught her by the hair  see here began the candy store keeper and flourished his mop stick at the bully then sobber retreated from the establishment and nick pell did likewise and both started on a run up the street  what do you cadets mean by coming in here and annoying my daughter demanded the storekeeper hotly if you cant behave yourselves you had better keep away  we didnt hurt your daughter said sam  my brother here did what he could to save her from annoyance said tom  oh i know you cadets you are all tarred with the same brush muttered the storekeeper i want you to get outand stay out  yes but began dick  no buts about it young man i want you to get out  father he made the other boy let go of my curls explained the girl he caught the other boy by the ear  that may be fanny but these young bloods are all alike i dont want their trade they must clear out and stay away  come on fellows said dick well not stay if we are not wanted he turned again to the storekeeper but i want you to remember one thing we had nothing to do with annoying your daughter  did they pay for the soda asked the man suddenly  no replied the girl  then this crowd has got to pay went on the storekeeper unreasonably how much was it  ten cents  we havent bought anything and well not pay for anything said sam  not a cent shall i pay put in songbird  did vos a outrages burst out hans of you insult us some more i vos call a bolicemans alretty and he puffed up his chest indignantly  well you get out and be quick about it cried the man and raised his stick dont let me catch any of you in here again either  dont worrywe can spend our money elsewhere said tom  where we are treated decently added dick and walked from the candy store  once outside the boys talked the situation over for all of ten minutes but without satisfaction all were indignant over the way the storekeeper had treated them and tom wanted to go back on the sly and play a trick on him but dick demurred  let it go tom he is a mean man thats all  well i am going to show folks how generous he is answered tom with a sudden grin wait here a few minutes and he darted into a nearby store where they sold stationery when he came out he had a goodsized sheet of paper in his hand and also several big red seals  whats that asked sam  its a sign for the candy storekeepers front window  with caution tom went back to the store he saw that the proprietor was in the rear parlor dishing out icecream to several customers who had come in the girl was also at the back swiftly tom stuck the sheet of paper up under the show window fastening it with the gummy seals the paper read as follows  free bouquets of roses to all young ladies buying icecream here today come in  now let us watch for some fun said tom  they had not long to wait the steamboat had come in and a number of passengers were walking up the street soon a party of three girls and a young man espied the sign  oh clara cried one of the girls free roses this time of year just think of it  come on right in said the young man and led the way into the store then another young man came along with a girl and they also read the sign and entered soon two old maids stopped and read the announcement  i do love icecream angelina said one let us go in and get chocolate and get the bouquets too and they followed the crowd inside  the store had two side windows to it which were opened a few inches from the bottom for ventilation and the cadets stole up to these windows to listen to the talk everybody ordered cream and began to eat and then asked for the bouquets  bouquets asked the storekeeper mystified  why yes said the young man who had brought in the three girls  if you dont mind id like jack roses said one of the maidens  and i like american beauties said another  i dont care what kind i get so long as it is a big bunch added the third girl  what are you talking about demanded the storekeeper  we are talking about the bouquets you are giving away said the young man he had eaten nearly all of his cream and the girls had almost finished  i am giving away no bouquets  why yes you are cried the girls  of course put in one of the old maids suspiciously and i want just as good a bunch of roses as anybody  so do i added the second old maid  are you folks all crazy demanded the storekeeper i am not giving away anything  what demanded the young man who had come in with one girl your sign dont read that way it says free bouquets of roses to all young ladies buying icecream here today youve got to give this young lady her bouquet or i wont pay for this cream  where is that sign demanded the storekeeper and when told rushed out and tore the announcement down and into shreds this is aan outrage i didnt put the sign up  after this there was a wordy war lasting several minutes nobody wanted to pay for the cream eaten and as he could not furnish the bouquets the storekeeper could not collect in a rage he chased the wouldbe customers out and then started to look for the person who had played him such a trick but the cadets of putnam hall had withdrawn from that vicinity and they took good care to keep out of sight     chapter xv  an astonishing gift   the steamboat had to take on considerable freight at cedarville so she remained at the little dock for the best part of half an hour during that time the rovers and their friends saw tad sobber and nick pell walking around the village but did not speak to them  hullo here is something new said songbird as they walked past the stores a dime museum  such a thing as that will never pay here was dicks comment not enough people  it is to remain only one week said sam after reading the sign over the door  wonder if they really have one hundred snakes in the collection mused tom also reading the sign if so there would be some fun if the bunch broke loose  want to go in and look at the snakes asked songbird  i tont answered hans of i look at so many of dem nasty dings i couldnt sleep for a month or sefen days aint it and he shuddered  while the boys were walking away they chanced to look back and saw tad sobber and nick pell come from the museum so called the bully was talking to a man connected with the show a fellow who usually stood outside barking as it is calledthat is asking folks to come up and walk in and see the wonders inside  sobber must know that fellow was dicks comment but thought no more of this until long afterwards a little later they saw the bully embark on the steamboat and nick pell started back for putnam hall alone  the boys purchased the things they wanted and returned to the school they did not see nick pell until the following day and then the latter paid no attention to them sobber did not return to putnam hall for the best part of a week then he appeared very thoughtful and he eyed all of the rover boys in a crafty speculative way  he has got it in for us said tom but how much tad sobber had it in for the rovers was still to be learned  the boys had not forgotten about the proposed feast and it was arranged that it should come off in the dormitory occupied by the rovers and some others on the following tuesday night as soon as all the lights were out word was passed around quietly and the rover boys thought that only their intimate friends knew of what was going on but they were mistaken  by pure accident nick pell overheard larry colby and fred garrison speaking of the feast it had been arranged that larry and fred should contribute a big raisin cake and the two boys were wondering how they could get it from the bake shop in cedarville and up to the dormitory without being seen  never mind well manage it somehow if we have to use a rope said larry  they are going to have a spread said nick pell running up to tad sobber with the story we ought to tell captain putnam and spoil things for them  that wont do us any good nick answered the bully the captain thinks too much of the rovershe wouldnt punish them much especially as this is their last term here ill think up something else i want to do something to em that they will remember as long as they live  you seem to be extra bitter against the rovers since you got back from ithaca said pell curiously  am i well i have good cause to be bitter growled tad sobber just let me put on my thinking cap and ill fix em and dont you forget it  that night the bully asked for permission to go to cedarville on important business he went alone and once in the town hurried directly to the museum already mentioned the proprietor had done little or no business in the village and was about to move to another place  when tad sobber returned to putnam hall he carried under his arm a heavy pasteboard box which he carried with great care this box he hid away in a corner of the barn among some loose hay  im ready to fix the rovers now he told nick pell keep your mouth shut but your eyes wide open  what are you going to do  just wait and see  at the appointed time the rovers and their chums assembled in the dormitory for the feast a large quantity of good things had been procured including chicken sandwiches cake oranges and lemonade tom had even had a dealer in cedarville pack him up several bricks of icecream and these now rested in some cracked ice in a washbowl  say but this is a touch of old times said sam do you remember the first feast we had here when mumps got scared to death  indeed i do cried one of the other students heres to the good old times and he raised his glass of lemonade to his lips  in a short while the feast was in full swing there was a hall monitor supposed to be on guard but tom had bought him off with a slice of cake some candy and an orange and he was keeping himself in a front hallway where he could not hear what was going on  if it wasnt for the noise we might have a song said sam as it is i move songbird recite mary had a little cow or something equally elevating  i can give you an original bit of verse which i have entitled when the blossoms fill the orchard molly dear answered the doggerel maker  gracious that sounds like a new ninecent piece of sheet music murmured dick  cant you whistle it suggested tom it may sound better  play it out on a finetooth comb suggested larry  who is ready for icecream asked tom after a general laugh had ensued this isnt going to keep hard forever  all were ready and the bricks were cut the pieces laid on tiny wooden plates which had been provided and passed around then came more cake and fruit  in the midst of the jollification there came a sudden and unexpected knock on the door  who can that be whispered several in alarm  put out the lights said tom those who dont belong here get under the beds and he began to get the evidences of the feast out of sight dick and sam assisting him  with quaking hearts the merrymakers waited for the knock to be repeated and waited to hear the sound of captain putnams voice or that of the first assistant teacher  bartlett might have warned us whispered fred bartlett was the monitor who had been bribed  no other knock came on the door nor did anybody demand admittance the boys waited for several seconds each holding his breath in anxiety  who can it be asked sam of his oldest brother  i suppose i might as well go and see said dick maybe some of the other fellows are up to some tricks  with caution he approached the hall door and opened it only a dim light was burning and for the instant he could see nothing then he caught sight of a white object on the floor and picked it up it was a pasteboard box tied with a strong string  this must be some kind of a joke he said and came back into the dormitory with the box in his hands light up and let me see what this is  the lights were lit and several of the boys began to eat the stuff that had been swept out of sight they all gazed curiously at the pasteboard box  heres a card on the top said dick and commenced to read it the inscription was as follows       to the rover boys from their friends dora grace and nellie       keep it a secret among you and your chums at the feast  how in the world did they know we were going to have a feast questioned sam  and how did they manage to smuggle the box into the hall asked larry  open it and see whats inside dick came from tom ill wager they have sent us something good  maybe its a loaf cake said fred  oder a pudding broke in hans i lof chocolate puddings yah  you cant pack a pudding in a box very well commented songbird  holding the box in one hand dick undid the string and threw off the cover  the next instant he let out a yell of horror and tom who was near by did likewise and fell over a chair in his fright  for out of the box glided a real live snake fully three feet long and with beady and dangerous looking eyes  illustration from out of the box glided a real live snake     chapter xvi  the hunt for a snake   its a snake  and its alive  look out or hell bite you  there he goes on the floor  these and a number of other cries rang through the dormitory as the cadets saw the contents of the box several tried to back away and hans pitched over tom and both went in a heap  tont you let dot snake bite me roared the german youth  maybe hes poisonous came from larry he had sought safety by leaping on a bed  slowly the snake had lifted itself from the box to glare at several of the boys then its cold beady eyes were fixed on dick and it uttered a vicious hiss this was more than the eldest rover could stand and he let box and snake drop in a hurry the snake glided out of sight under a bed  this is a joke right enough murmured sam wonder who played it  do you think the girls would send a snake queried larry  of course not answered tom who had scrambled up this is the work of some enemy  look out the snake is getting busy screamed sam and he was right the reptile had left the shelter of the bed and was darting across the room in the direction of songbird  the wouldbe poet did not stop to argue with his snakeship but letting out a wild yell leaped to the top of a small stand which stood in a corner the stand was frail and down it went with a crash the wreckage catching the snake on the tail it whipped around and made a lunge at songbirds foot but the youth was too nimble and leaped on the bed  weve got to kill that snake observed dick after the reptile had disappeared for a moment under a washstand if we dont  crash it was a plate which sam shied at the snake as its head showed for a moment then down went a shower of shoes brushes plates and a cake of soap but the snake was not seriously hurt it hissed viciously and darted from one side of the dormitory to the other and made all the boys climb up on the furniture  this racket will wake up everybody in the school said dick and he was right the boys had hardly time to get the most of the evidence of the feast out of the way when they heard a knock on the door  look out there yelled tom dont open that door if you value your life  whats the matter came in george strongs voice  a snake answered dick and then went on in a whisper quick boys get the rest of the stuff out of the way  his chums understood and the remains of the feast were swept under bed covers in a jiffy  did you say there was a snake in there demanded the teacher  yes sir said sam hes right close to the door now and what he said was true  thinking the youngest rover might be fooling the first assistant teacher opened the door cautiously and peered into the dormitory then he too let out a cry of alarm for the snake darted forward and made as if to bite him in the foot not to be caught he fell back leaving the door open about a foot through this opening the snake glided and disappeared in the semidark hallway  by this time putnam hall was in an uproar and boys were pouring into the hallways demanding to know if there was a fire or a robbery soon captain putnam appeared wrapped in a dressing robe and wearing slippers  beware all of you cried george strong its a snake and it is loose in this hallway somewhere  a snake ejaculated the master of putnam hall where did it come from  it was in the dormitory over there i heard a noise and went to see what was the matter and the snake came out of the room and made off in that direction and george strong pointed with his hand  humph muttered captain putnam this must be looked into what kind of a snake was it  i dont know sir but it was fully three feet long and it hissed loudly as it went past me  some more of the boys tricks i suppose but this is going too far especially if the reptile is poisonous  lights were lit and turned up as high as possible and a search of all the hallways followed when the cadets learned that a snake was really at large in the school many of the timid ones were badly frightened  he might poison a fellow and kill him said one lad  oh i cant bear snakes said another if he came for me id have a fit sure  the search for the snake was kept up the best part of an hour but without success peleg snuggers was forced to join in the hunt and nearly collapsed when he saw something under a stand in a far corner  the snake the snake he yelled and started to run away but what he had seen proved to be nothing but a piece of old window cord and the general utility man was laughed at so heartily he was glad to sneak out of sight  he must have gone downstairs said dick and then a hunt was made below here some windows had been left open for ventilation and captain putnam said it was possible the reptile had made its escape in that manner he did not quite believe this but he thought the snake must be harmless and he wanted to say something to quiet those pupils who were timid  how did the snake get in your room he asked later on of the rovers and their dormitory fellows  it came in this box answered dick and brought forth the pasteboard box in question somebody knocked on the door and when we opened it the box was on the floor  captain putnam looked at the box and the inscription  your lady friends must have peculiar tastes he said smiling  of course that was a trickjust to get us to take the box and open it answered tom  do you suspect anybody thomas  wellnot exactly said the funloving rover slowly  what have you to say samuel  im sure i cant imagine who could send that box  richard what can you tell of this  dick paused and took a long breath  i cant tell you anything just now captain putnam he answered slowly but ive got something of an idea of how that box got here but id hate to accuse anybody unless i was sure of it  mr strong said the snake was at least three feet long  it was certainly all of that  was it a poisonous snake do you think  it was not a rattlesnake nor was it any kind of a snake such as are usually found in this part of our country of that i am sure  you got a good look at it then  yes  i certainly had no idea snakes of such size could be found close to the school  i am pretty sure that snake was never found around here during my travels i have studied snakes a little and that variety was a stranger to me  i see the master of putnam hall mused for a moment well it is very queer but as the snake has disappeared i think we may as well retire once more i do not imagine we have anything to fear  it was a good hour before the school was quiet many of the boys were afraid to go to bed and the teachers could not blame them the rovers and their chums got together to discuss the situation in whispers and at the same time remove all traces of the feast which had been so curiously interrupted  dick what do you make of this asked tom  i think tad sobber is guilty tombut i didnt want to tell captain putnam so  you think he got the snake out of that museum  i do  i think that myself put in sam dont you remember how he was talking to that barker just as if they were friends it was surely sobber who played that trick  if it was sobber we ought to pay him back came from songbird grimly a snake ugh it makes me creep to think of it  dont you want to compose an ode in its honor questioned tom dryly might go like this      a hissing gliding snake     kept all the school awake     each boy in awful fright     was looking for a bite  you can make fun if you want to but i think it is no laughing matter observed fred supposing a fellow goes to sleep and wakes up to find that snake crawling over him phew talk about nightmares  it certainly would make a fellow feel queer answered sam but i say dick if you are sure sobber did it why cant we pay him back in his own coin  im willing but how can it be done  wait until tomorrow night and ill show you answered the youngest rover that is unless the snake is caught in the meantime  have you a plan to get square asked larry  yes  den go ahead sure came from hans of dot sobber fellow peen guilty he ought to be hung up on der pottom of der sea alretty quick  just wait and well fix mr tad sobber answered dick hell wish he never saw a snake he had an inkling of what was in his brother sams mind to do     chapter xvii  a stirring scene in the schoolroom   the hunt for the snake was continued all of the next day but without success by that time the excitement had died down and a good many of the cadets forgot all about the incident a few said it must be a joke and they laughed behind george strongs back  its one of tom rovers tricks said one pupil ill wager he is laughing in his sleeves at mr strong and captain putnam  do you think it was a live snake asked another  no it was probably a toy affair on a string  in the secrecy of their room tad sobber and nick pell laughed heartily over the excitement createdthat is pell laughed and the bully laughed with him but sobber behind it all was worried  the truth of the matter was he had hoped that the snake would be killed the man who had sold him the reptile had said it was from central america and poisonous but had added that the snake was sick and not liable to do any harm sobber would not have cared had dick or his brothers been bitten by the snake but that the reptile was at large was another story  do you think hed be poisonous enough to kill anybody asked pell suddenly and he sobered down as he spoke  oh no of course not answered the bully but he turned his face away as he spoke he had given five dollars for the snake and now he was willing to give a like sum to make certain of its death  in the afternoon sam led the way to a little case of reptiles which hung on the wall of the school laboratory in this was a stuffed snake almost the size of that which had disappeared  i guess we can frighten sobber and pell with that he said to his brothers  anyway we can try answered tom falling in with the plan at once  we want to be careful of what we do added dick otherwise the pair will smell a mouse  they talked the matter over and managed to get the snake upstairs without anybody seeing them then they paid a visit to the dormitory occupied by the bully and his cronies and passed some strong black threads across the floor and elsewhere after that they told songbird and their other chums of what had been done  that night sobber pell and their friends went to bed as usual but hardly had they turned out the lights when they heard a curious rustling sound on the floor near the door  what is that asked pell who was inclined to be nervous  i dont know im sure answered sobber  the rustling continued and something seemed to move across the floor wondering what it could be the bully got up and lit a light then he gave a yell and leaped back  the snake  where is it screamed pell sitting bolt upright and his hair raising on ends  there it is over in the corner  the snake the snake called out the other boys in the room and some were so scared that they dove under the bed clothing  the light was not strong enough to see clearly and nobody had the courage to make more of an illumination sobber stood in the center of the room and as he did this the snake suddenly seemed to fly through the air right at him  oh he screamed go away and he flopped on his bed and threw a blanket over him he felt the reptile cross the bed and lay there quaking in mortal terror then he heard something moving across the floor  that snake is bound to bite me he muttered to himself oh why did i bring it to the school  call captain putnam somebody came from nick pell he was so frightened he could scarcely speak  there was an emergency bell near the door to be used in case of fire and this one of the boys touched at once the alarm sounded out and in a few minutes the hallways were filled with pupils as on the previous night while some of the teachers and peleg snuggers appeared with chemical fire extinguishers in their hands  where is the fire  shall i telephone for the cedarville fire department  has anybody been burnt  what room is it in  such were some of the questions asked then captain putnam rushed on the scene  its the snake again wailed one of the cadets who now stood bolt upright on his bed his eyes bulging from his head  are you sure  yes the snake is in here answered tad sobber why it fairly jumped over my bed  he tried to bite me in the face came from nick pell who was so excited he scarcely knew what he was saying  more lights were lit and captain putnam went off to get a shotgun  if i catch sight of it ill blow it to pieces he said to george strong  a long search followed and then came a sudden cry from a corner of the dormitory  there he is  shoot him captain putnam  the master of the hall took aim and came up slowly then he suddenly dropped the barrel of his shotgun stepped forward and took hold of the snake by the tail  its a stuffed snake he said it belongs in the case in the laboratory  a stuffed snake queried tad sobber and when he realized the truth he was the maddest boy in that school  see here said the master of the hall turning to dick was this what you saw last night  no sir was the prompt reply what we saw was a real live snake  indeed it was said george strong  are you sure this one is from the case in the laboratory captain putnam questioned andrew garmore one of the teachers  yes i know it well besides here is the label on it  well i looked at the case early this morning and it was filled as it has always been  its a trick on me roared tad sobber angrily just wait ill get square with somebody for this and he looked sharply at the rovers  sobber must like snakesi saw him at the museum in cedarville one day answered dick and eyed the bully boldly at this sobber grew red in the face and slunk out of sight  get to bed all of you said captain putnam sharply ill investigate this in the morning  as on the night before it took the school a long time to quiet down the rover boys and their chums had a hearty laugh over the success of the trick  my but sobber is mad said fred you want to watch out hell do almost anything to get square  the promised investigation the next day did not materialize for the reason that captain putnam was called away on important business thus two days passed and the snake incident was again practically forgotten by the majority of the students  on the following day the master of the hall came back and said he would start his investigation that afternoon after the school session  and let me tell you one thing he announced whoever brought that real snake into this academy will have to suffer for it  that afternoon in one of the classrooms some of the pupils were reciting history when of a sudden a wild shriek rang through the air and nick pell was seen to bounce up out of his seat and run away from his desk as if a demon was after him  what is it pell demanded the teacher  thethe snake groaned nick oh im a dead boy  where is it asked a score of voices  in my desk it just bit me in the hand oh im a dead boy i know i am and nick pell shook from head to foot in his terror  the announcement that the snake was in nicks desk was received in various ways by the boys present some thought it must be the real snake and others thought it might be only a trick with caution the teacher approached the desk armed with a ruler then came a hissing sound and the snake stuck out its head  its alive yelled a dozen cadets  kill it kill it  you go and kill it  i havent anything  neither have i  throw a book at it suggested tom and let fly his cæsar his aim was good and the snake was hit in the neck and tumbled to the floor then the boys threw books rulers and inkwells at the reptile and it was driven into a corner dick took up a big geography let it fall on top of the snake and stood on it the reptile squirmed but could not get away and in a few seconds more it was killed  thats the end of that snake said sam breathing a sigh of relief and i am mighty glad of it  i am poisoned i am poisoned screamed nick pell see my hand is swelling up already  do you think he was really bitten whispered tom  it looks like it answered dick too badif the snake really was poisonous  by this time captain putnam had come in he glanced at the dead snake and gave a start  did that thing bite you pell he questioned  yes sir right hereinthethe palm of the hand cried the youth addressed see how it is swelling  ill telephone for a doctor at once come to my office and i will see what i can do for you  nick had certainly been bitten and now the hand was twice its ordinary size while the pain was acute the boy shook like a leaf  im poisoned i know i am he wailed its all tad sobbers fault too oh if i should die and then of a sudden he fell to the floor in convulsions     chapter xviii  in which tad sobber disappears   all standing near nick pell were amazed to see the boy fall to the floor captain putnam and dick rover raised him up his eyes were rolling frightfully and his jaws opened and shut with a snap that was sickening  something is certainly wrong with him whispered sam to tom  yes he wouldnt act that way if he was simply frightened was the reply and see his hand  we will carry him up to one of the spare bedrooms said captain putnam and mr strong see to it that we get a doctor here as soon as possible tell him it is a case of snake poisoning and ask him over the telephone what we had best do  nick pell was carried upstairs by this time he had ceased to move and lay like a log in the hands of those who supported him  many had heard him mention tad sobber and all looked at the bully inquiringly sobber was deadly pale but managed to keep up a bold front  i am not to blame he said in answer to a question from one of the teachers i didnt put the snake in pells desk  did you bring the snake into the school  certainly not answered the bully shamelessly he made up his mind to keep out of hot water even if it was necessary to lie to do it  a hurry call was sent to doctor fremley of cedarville and he came as quickly as his mare could bring him only the teachers and the physician were allowed in the bedroom with pell so the cadets did not know what took place  its as plain as day said dick to his brother and his chums sobber got the snake and put it in the box that is why pell said he was to blame  but sobber told a teacher he did not bring the snake into the hall answered songbird  i do not believe him came from tom  nor do i added sam hes a bad egg if ever there was one  the poisoning of nick pell cast a damper over the whole school and neither the teachers nor the pupils could settle down to lessons the doctor remained with the sufferer for two hours and when he went away he looked very grave  he is by no means out of danger announced the physician but let us hope for the best i think his parents ought to be notified  this was done and mr and mrs pell came on the very next day to see their son they found him in something of a fever and out of his mind crying continually for sobber to take the snake away  richard i want to see you said captain putnam that evening and led dick to his private office there he demanded to know what the eldest rover knew of the snake incident  captain putnam i will tell you everything from beginning to end answered dick if i am to suffer ill take my punishment and tom and sam say they stand ready to do the same and thereupon dick related the particulars of the trouble with the bully and pell and of how he and his brothers and songbird and hans had seen sobber and pell at the museum where the snakes had been then he told of the feast and how the snake had been discovered in the box  i have kept the box he added and you can look at the writing if you wish i think it is in tad sobbers hand although somewhat disguised  the address on the box was investigated by the master of the hall who sent for several compositions tad sobber had written the bully was much disturbed when he had to give up the compositions to george strong  whats that for he asked with a scowl on his face  captain putnam wants them answered the teacher and would say no more  with anxious eyes the bully watched the first assistant disappear into the office with the compositions then looking to make sure that he was not observed he stole up to the door and applied his ear to the keyhole what he heard filled him with increased alarm  it is sobbers handwriting beyond a doubt said captain putnam after comparing the compositions with the address on the box cover i wonder if he knew that the snake was a poisonous one  perhaps nick pell can tell thatafter he gets over his trouble returned dick  provided he does get over it richard  dont you think hell recover cried dick in consternation  he may not it is a very serious case so doctor fremley informs me  what does mr pell say about it  he wants me to investigate he says he may have somebody arrested for thisand i can hardly blame him it was a vile thing to dobring a poisonous snake into the school  at the mention of arrest tad sobber shut his teeth hard  i guess its about time i made myself scarce he muttered perhaps i had better leave and join uncle sid and he walked away silently and up to his room he remained there about ten minutes then stole forth and down a back way a fairsized bundle under his arm  at the conclusion of the interview in the office captain putnam sent for tad sobber one of the monitors went on the errand and came back in quarter of an hour with the information that the youth could not be found  did he have permission to leave the grounds asked the captain of the teachers  not from me said one instructor after another  then peleg snuggers was sent out to hunt the bully up and soon came back with the information that sobber was not around the grounds but had been seen by two of the cadets walking in the direction of cedarville sobber had given one of the cadets a note for the master of the hall this ran as follows       must go to the village on a matter of great importance will      explain when i returnt sobber  maybe he has gone to find out about that snake suggested tom  how could he came from his younger brother the museum keeper has moved away  tad may know where he moved to put in larry  a whole day passed and the bully did not show himself then captain putnam drove over to the village and attempted to hunt him up but without success he learned that the museum man had shipped his outfit to boston  he has run away said the master of the hall to mr pell and george strong i am satisfied now that he was guilty but as nick knew of it he must have had something to do with it he added  i trust my son recovers answered mr pell with a deep sigh but the days went by and nick pell still remained in bad shape very weak and out of his mind for the greater part of the time during his lucid intervals he told how sobber had purchased the snake for five dollars the owner saying it was sick and liable to die in the near future he added that the bully had said he hoped the snake would bite one of the rovers  i didnt want him to use the snake said the sufferer but he insisted and told me to keep my mouth shut about it after that poor nick began to rave again and had to be given some medicine to keep him quiet during one of his good spells he was removed to a house located about half a mile from putnam hall where he could get the benefit of absolute quietness his father went back to business but his mother remained behind to nurse her boy  the thanksgiving holidays were now at hand but the rover boys decided to remain at the hall and not go home until christmas besides they were preparing for the party at the stanhope cottage which was to come off on the following wednesday evening they had seen dora nellie and grace several times and all had prepared for the best time ever as the girls put it captain putnam gave the boys permission to take the carryall and allowed them to leave the school on the day of the party at six oclock  whoop here we go cried tom as he took the whip and cracked it loudly hold on everybody peleg dont let the team lag he went on to the driver  an dont you go for to make em run away master tom answered the driver grimly  its a pretty long drive and we dont want to be late said dick so push ahead as fast as you can  say tubby wheres your stovepipe hat asked sam of the dude cadet who formed one of the party  iahthought it would not beahquite appropriate lisped william philander notahbeing full dress you know  he was afraid of having it mashed said fred hurrah were off now for a good nights fun  they were to have a good nights funand a most unusual adventure with it     chapter xix  what happened at the party   it was a clear bright evening when the boys drove over to the stanhope cottage all were in high spirits and sang and joked to their hearts content for the time being the trouble with tad sobber was totally forgotten so far nothing more had been heard of the bully and all were satisfied that he had left both putnam hall and cedarville and perhaps for good  one boy told me he used to live with an uncle in new york city said larry he didnt know the uncles name  when the carryall arrived at the stanhope place they found the cottage well lit up dora had invited a number of her girl friends and these with her cousins grace and nellie were already on hand the boys let out a ringing cheer as they stopped at the horseblock and the girls came out to greet them  all here cried dora  all here was the answer  good cried several of the girls  i guess we are a bit early observed dick but we wanted to make sure we wouldnt be late and its a long drive over  you are not a bit too early answered dora and gave him her dainty hand which he squeezed ardently  soon the boys were piling out on the ground and a general handshaking followed those who did not know each other were introduced and everybody walked into the house where a room upstairs had been prepared for the cadets reception  now everyone must feel perfectly at home said mrs stanhope who was being assisted by mrs laning and mr laning the older folks prepared the refreshments while the young people sat down in the parlor and the sitting room  at first as at all parties there was a little stiffness but this was soon broken by tom asking in a solemn voice  say did anybody bring an iceberg in his pocket if he did he will please set it on the kitchen stove to thaw out  oh tom shrieked nellie and all the girls giggled then the ice was broken and everybody started to talk at once even william philander was pleased for he had discovered a tall willowy girl who exactly suited him and who thought him charming  at first they played half a dozen different games and gave out riddles and songbird recited a poem written in honor of the occasion the poem was the best effort he had yet made in the verse line and of course everybody applauded then grace said he ought to have it published in the cedarville weekly paper and this pleased the poet very much  maybe you can get a dollar a line for it songbird suggested dick  if he can well let him divide up with us added tom and this caused a laugh  presently refreshments were announced and the boys and girls paired off and entered the dining room here a long table was spread decorated with autumn leaves and the putnam hall colors there were six colored candles on the table each with an elaborate red shade and the general effect was warm and pleasing there were plenty of good things to eat including icecream frozen into all sorts of forms when the forms were passed around dick got a drum major tom an uncle sam and sam an airship hans got a fat dutch boy which tickled him immensely  dot vos look chust like some poys by der fadderlandt he observed  with the icecream came snapper bonbons filled with all sorts of things made of paper and soon one boy was wearing an apron another a nightcap and the like dora got a yellow jacket and nellie a bakers cap while grace skipped around wearing a poke hat over a foot high there was plenty of laughter and the old folks did not hesitate to join in nuts and raisins followed the icecream and then the young folks went back to the sitting room and the parlor to finish their games and have some music  dora you must play for us said dick and led her to the piano then while some of the others gathered around the girl played waiting for the wagon aunt dinahs quilting party and a number of other favorites and these the crowd sang lustily  guess it is about time for us to leave whispered fred to dick presently i know youll like to have dora play all night for you but it cant be done  dick looked at his watch  phew as late as this he exclaimed softly yes well have to go  let us sing home sweet home suggested one of the boys and dora struck up the opening chords they were in the midst of the first verse when dick chanced to glance towards one of the windows and stopped short  a man was outside peering in at the party  illustration a man was outside peering in at the party  it was merrick  well i never burst out the eldest rover boy and his sudden exclamation caused dora to look at him curiously and stop playing  what is the matter dick  did you see that man at the window he is gone now  i didnt see anybody  who was it asked tom quickly  it was that rascal merrick  merrick ejaculated sam the fellow who took uncle randolphs bonds  the same  oh dick you must be mistaken  i was not mistakeni saw him as plain as day i am going to look for him added the eldest rover for the man had now disappeared  he ran for the hall door and the other boys followed the girls remained in the parlor much frightened for it was after midnight  as dick reached the piazza he saw a dark form stealing along a row of bushes near the garden fence  there he is he exclaimed stop he called out loudly stop i tell you  who did you say it was asked john laning as he came from the kitchen with a stout cane in his hand  that rascal merrick one of the two men who stole my uncles traction company bonds explained dick  what can he be doing here  i dont know there he goes over the fence  he is running towards the side road exclaimed sam come on after him  wait till we get our hats and coats said tom and ran back to pick up the articles mentioned this took a couple of minutes and by the time he came back merrick was out of sight  the three rovers ran to the side road fred garrison and mr laning with them  i wish i had a pistol remarked john laning no telling how desperate a character that villain may be  id like to know if he came on foot or with a horse said dick  do you think he followed us to this place asked sam  i am sure i dont know the whole thing looks mighty queer to me  there was no moon but the stars were shining brightly so they could see fairly well on the road as they reached a bend tom pointed forward  there he is just going into the bushes  he had better not go that way was mr lanings remark unless he knows the ground well  why not asked sam  just beyond that patch of timber is nixons swamp as it is calledas boggy and treacherous a spot as can be found for miles around if he dont look out hell get stuck there and never get out  do you know the swamp asked dick i mean the good spots  fairly welli used to come over here when i was a boyto pick huckleberries they are plentiful on the other side of the swamp  then supposing you lead the way and well follow  they were soon in the woods and saw a welldefined path running to the eastward beyond was nixons swamp and still further on another woods  they were afraid they had lost track of the man they were after when they heard a crack ahead of them followed by a short yell of alarm merrick had stumbled over a fallen log and pitched headlong into some thorny bushes it took him some time to extricate himself and meanwhile the pursuers drew closer  i see him cried tom he is turning to the right  he is headed for the worst part of the swamp was mr lanings comment if he doesnt look out  a minute later a wild cry rang out from ahead the cry was repeated twice and then all became as silent as the grave  he must have gone down into the swamp exclaimed dick  yes and more than likely he is drowning to death added john laning     chapter xx  dick and dora   the boys were almost afraid to penetrate further into the woods for they found the ground growing wet and spongy under their feet all halted and gathered around mr laning  do you think he has really been drowned asked sam with a slight shiver  it may be was the farmers reply i know of one man who was drowned here some years ago and every year cattle are lost here the bottom of the swamp is very sticky and once a person gets in he sinks down and under  what shall we do questioned tom  we can go ahead but we want to be mighty careful dont take a step until you are sure of your footing if you find yourself sinking grab hold of some tree or bush  mr laning led the way and the boys followed until they had covered a distance of fifty or sixty feet here the ground was so soft they had to leap from one tree root or clump of bushes to another as they moved forward they listened intently for some further sound from merrick but none came  hullo whats this cried dick presently and moved to one side close to a pool of dark and treacherouslooking water a mans hat  he picked it up and turned it over on the inside were the initials s a m  it must be merricks he went on can he have gone down here  the others came at his call and all looked at the hat which had been lying in the mud at the side of the pool then a match was struck and all gazed around and into the pool while this faint illumination lasted no other trace of the missing man was to be seen  merrick where are you called out dick if you need help say so and well try to get you out  do you think hed answer that call asked fred  i think hed rather go to prison than die in this swamp was the reply  the students and mr laning moved cautiously around the edge of the swamp for half an hour and then returned to the roadway to mark the spot where the hat had been found dick hung the head covering on a tree limb  we can come back in the daylight and make another search said he and we can notify the authorities too  when they got back to the stanhope cottage they found the others anxiously awaiting their return  did you catch him  did he hurt you  no we didnt catch him and nobody is hurt answered mr laning we lost him in the swamp and there is no telling where he is now  i want to get hold of him for two reasonsthat is if he is alive said dick i want to get back those bonds and i want to know what brought him to this cottage  maybe he came here to rob the stanhopes whispered tom but i shouldnt tell them for it will frighten them too much  no dont say a word tom if you do mrs stanhope will be just as nervous as she ever was  i and my family are going to stay here tonight announced mr laning so we can go on a hunt for that man first thing in the morning  and ill drive over if captain putnam will let me answered dick  the appearance of merrick had put a damper on the breaking up of the party and the rovers were rather silent as they went back to the school it was too late to speak to captain putnam that night but dick was up early and saw the master of the hall before breakfast  i trust you had a good time last night said captain putnam smiling  we did have sir said dick but our party broke up in a way we didnt anticipate and then he told of what had occurred  the captain had heard of the missing traction company bonds and he readily allowed dick to go back to the cottage using a horse and buggy for that purpose sam and tom wanted to go too but to this captain putnam demurred  i think one is enough especially as mr laning is there too he said  with a good horse and a light buggy it did not take long for the eldest rover boy to reach the stanhope cottage the family had just had breakfast and were surprised to see him so early  didnt you have anything to eat questioned dora if you didnt come right in and ill make you an omelet and some coffee  no thank you dora he whispered ill have to wait for that until were keeping house together then  oh dick she cried and blushed like a rose  i had breakfast while driving overan orange and some sandwiches went on the youth mrs green got them ready for me is there anything new  no uncle john is waiting for you he is in the woodshed trying on some old rubber boots he says one ought to have rubber boots to go into the swamp with  dick hurried to the woodshed and there found that mr laning had unearthed two pairs of boots and he donned one pair while the farmer put on the other a little later both got in the buggy and drove up the road they had traveled the night previous then they tied the horse to a tree and followed the path leading to the edge of the swamp  hullo the hat is gone exclaimed dick as he came close to the black pool  maybe it dropped to the ground suggested john laning  both looked around but could see nothing of the missing head covering then dick caught sight of a slip of paper pinned to the tree  here is a message of some kind he said and read it the message ran as follows       i reckon i fooled you this trip i was up in the tree all the      time by the time you get this i shall be miles away ta ta until      the next time  humph muttered dick what do you think of that and he passed the message to his companion  he certainly fooled us answered mr laning i suppose those yells were only to put us off our guard its a pity we didnt carry his hat off for a souvenir of the occasionas you youngsters put it and the farmer grinned  perhaps he is still around suggested dick if he tried to fool us once he might try to fool us again  thats so too it wont do any harm to take a good look around while we are at it dick  they spent the whole of the morning walking around the swamp and in trying to trace the movements of merrick but without success nothing concerning the rascal was to be found and when they felt both tired out and hungry they returned to the stanhope cottage here the girls and the ladies had a hot dinner awaiting them and served them liberally finishing up with apple pie that dora had made for dicks especial benefit  its fine he said to her on the sly  then you like it she answered with a smile  do i dora when were keeping house you shall make me a pie like this twice a week he added earnestly  dick if you dont stop your joking  oh im not joking dora of course if youre not willing to make me a pie now and then  oh it isnt thatill make all the pies you want butbut and then dora blushed so furiously that she had to run from the room dick looked after her longingly and heaved a mountainous sigh he wished that all his academy days were over and that he was engaged in business and settled down in life he knew just what kind of a home he wanted and who he wanted in it besides himselfand perhaps dora knew too  but i cant think of those things yet he mused as he finished his dinner ive got to go out into the world first get into business and prove my worth  the meal over it was decided that dick and mr laning should drive to cedarville and get into communication with the local authorities and also the authorities at ithaca this was done and the following day another hunt was made for merrick but he could not be found and there for the time being the affair rested  i think well hear from him again some day said dick and he was right they did hear from the swindler and when they least expected it     chapter xxi  a bob sled race   whoop hurrah its snowing  thus shouted tom one day as he burst into the library of the hall where dick sam and a number of others were perusing books and the latest magazines  hard queried sam dropping the magazine he held  no but steady peleg snuggers says it is going to be a heavy fall and he generally knows  and he loves snowstorms so put in fred with a laugh do you remember the time we made a big fort and had a regular battle  indeed i do cried larry it was great we ought to have something of that sort this winter  i was hoping wed get skating before it snowed put in songbird  well we cant have all the good things at once answered dick i think a heavy snowstorm is jolly somehow when it snows i always feel like whistling and singing  and i feel like making up verses murmured the poet of the school and went on      oh the snow the beautiful snow     coming down when the wind does blow     coming down both day and night     leaving the earth a wonderful sight     oh the snow the heavenly snow      wetting our feet wherever we go  continued tom and added      oh the snow     when the wind doth blow     it sets a pace     and hits our face     and we are froze     down to the toes     and in the slush     thats just like mush     we cannot stop     but go kerflop  tom the first thing you know youll be taking songbirds laurels away from him observed larry  perish the thought answered the funloving rover tragically  i dont hope you call that poetry came from songbird in deep disgust why hans can do better than that cant you dutchy  sure i can make up some find boetry answered hans chust you listen to dis i make him ub von night ven i couldnt go to sleep      der vos a leetle pird          he sits ubon a dree     dot leetle pird vos habby          like von leetle pird could be     a hunter mit a gun          py dot tree did lay     he shoot his awful gun          and dot pirdhe fly avay  good for hans cried dick and there was a general laugh then the gathering in the library broke up and all the cadets went outside to see how the snow looked before long there was enough on the ground to make snowballs and then a battle royal all around ensued so long as they took care not to break any windows captain putnam did not mind this and from his office the master of the hall and george strong watched the sport  makes one feel young again remarked the captain to his first assistant  id half like to go out myself answered george strong  i remember one year we had a great snowball fight at west point went on the captain it was carried out in regular army fashion and lasted half a day our side was victorious but we had to fight desperately to win i was struck in the chin and the ear and three of the cadets were knocked unconscious but it was good practice for it showed us something of what a handtohand struggle meant  the snow came down all that day and night and by the following morning covered the ground to the depth of about a foot it was somewhat moist and firstclass for the making of snow men and snowballs  lets make a statue of captain putnam said fred and this was done the statue being nearly ten feet high it must be confessed it was not a very good likeness but it looked remarkably fierce with some straws for a moustache a flat wooden stick for a sword and an old army cap on the top of the head when he saw it captain putnam laughed as heartily as anybody old as he was getting he never allowed himself to forget the time when he was a boy  some distance from the hall was a fairsized hill and this was used by the cadets for coasting as soon as school was over that day the lads brought out their sleds and bobs and soon the hill was filled with boys their merry laughter ringing far and wide the rovers had a big bob and this was used by the three and also by several of their friends  ill race you shouted dick who was in charge of the bob he addressed another student named peter slade slade had a big bob and had been boasting that this could beat any other bob on the hill  all right answered slade he was a lanky youth rather lazy and given to much boasting  it was soon arranged that each bob should carry six boys and fred hans and songbird went with the rovers the two bobs lined up side by side and larry colby gave the word to go  were off shouted tom giving a shove and leaping on behind  at first the two bobs kept side by side the slide was in fine condition and all the other cadets lined up on either side to watch the outcome of the race  hurrah for the rovers  hurrah for peter slade  may the best bob win cried one student enthusiastically  heres luck to you tom shouted george granbury and threw a snowball that caught tom in the neck  thanks shouted tom shaking his fist ill pay that back with interest when i get the chance  half of the course was soon covered and still the bobs kept side by side but then the rovers bob began to drag behind  hurrah we are going to win cried one of the boys on the other bob  said i could beat you yelled peter slade to dick  the race isnt ended yet flung back the eldest rover boy  on and on went the two bobs and gradually that belonging to peter slade drew a full length ahead dick glanced back anxiously  something seems to be catching under the runners he said look and see if everything is clear  the boys behind looked and then of a sudden songbird let out a cry  it is hans tippet hans go and put that tippet end around your neck and dont let it drag under the bob  the german youth was wearing an oldfashion tippet around his neck the loose ends flying behind one end had gotten under the bob runners and was scratching along in the snow  vell i neffer cried hans and pulled on the tippet so vigorously that the long bob began to switch around sideways  look out there sang out sam dont throw us off  wait ill loosen the tippet came from songbird and guided the muffler free of the bob then hans took up the ends and tied them around his waist  the drag had caused the rovers bob to get two lengths behind the other and peter slade and his companions felt certain of winning  you cant touch us dick rover called slade triumphantly  goodbye called another boy well tell those at the bottom of the hill that you are coming  are we making better time questioned tom anxiously if we are not ill get off and shove he added jokingly  you hold tight now yelled dick and an instant later the bob went down over a ridge of the hill free of the drag it shot forth like an arrow from a bow and soon began to crawl up to peter slades turnout  the rovers are crawling up  yes but its too late to win  weve got to win called out sam  and then both bobs took another ridge and rushed on to the end of the course less than a hundred yards away     chapter xxii  peleg snuggers queer ride   the race had now reached its critical point and all of the cadets on the hill waited for the outcome with keen interest the bob owned by peter slade was still two lengths in advance and it looked very much as if peter would be the victor  but with the passing of the last ridge the rovers bob seemed to become endowed with new life with no drag on the runners it shot forward with a speed that surprised even dick steadily it gained on the other bob until when the end of the course was but fifty yards away the two were almost side by side  let her out pete cried one of the boys on slades bob but peter could do no more  its a tie race called several but hardly had the words been spoken when the rovers bob shot ahead and reached the end of the course a winner by twentyfive feet  hurrah the rovers win  i tell you what you cant get ahead of dick rover and his crowd  peter slade was much chagrinned to have the victory snatched from him and began to mutter something about the race not being a fair one  i agree with you it was not fair answered sam hans tippet caught under our runners and held us up a good deal  if it hadnt been for that we would have won by three times the distance added tom  humph muttered peter slade i guess you jumped off once and pushed  i did not answered tom hotly  i think you did  and i say i didnt and now tom doubled up his fists  oh dont quarrel put in larry who was near if peter isnt satisfied why not race over again  i am willing answered dick promptly  im tired of riding said slade ieri am not feeling extra well and it shakes me up too much  then let some of the others use the bob  no it needs overhauling and i am going to have it fixed up was slades answer and began to move off toward the hall dragging his bob after him  hes afraid to race said george my how mad it makes some fellows to get beaten  it may be mentioned here that peter slade had been one of tad sobbers cronies and now that sobber was gone he took it on his shoulders to fill the bullys place in the particular set to which he belonged he was a quicktempered youth and had been in more than one fight since his arrival at putnam hall  the boys who could not ride on the hill amused themselves by making some big snowballs which they allowed to roll down another hill one of the snowballs made was fully eight feet in diameter and it was a great sight to see this go down getting bigger and bigger as it progressed  hello ive got an idea cried tom as he watched the rolling of the big snowballs  something brand new tom queried larry  i think so let us give peleg snuggers a roll it will do him goodshake up his liver and all that  you mean to roll him down this hill asked a student named morley  thats it  might hurt him  not if we put a snow overcoat on him first answered tom  what do you mean asked another student  let us roll a big ball the shape of an egg and hollow out the middle then by some trick we can get peleg to crawl inside and  thats the thing cried george garrison come on where is peleg  down at the stables  with eager hands the cadets set to work and rolled up a big ball in the shape of an egg and then dug out the middle with a shovel in the meantime a message was sent to the general utility man that he was wanted at the top of the hill at once  must want me to mend a sled he mused and hurried off taking with him some tools nails and cord he often did favors for the cadets who gave him tips in return  when peleg snuggers arrived at the top of the hill the big snowball was ready for use  here is peleg cried tom he can do the trick for us cant you peleg  what is that tom asked the general utility man innocently  we want to fasten this cord in the hole through that big snowball but we dont want to get it crossed went on tom anxiously will you take the cord crawl in there and then pass the end out and over the end of this shovel and then loop it over to the other end  whyeri dont understand stammered peleg snuggers  ill explain after you are inside the ball said tom heres the cord and he led the general utility man to the hole and helped him to get down  not suspecting a trick snuggers crawled into the big snowball before he could do anything with the cord given to him the cadets rushed forward and gave the snowball a push toward the edge of the hill  hi stop that roared the general utility man trying to back out  hold tightthe snowball is getting away from us yelled tom somebody keep it from going down the hill  we cant hold it back screamed larry grinning at the same time  its bound to gotoo bad wailed another  say let me git out yelled peleg snuggers but at that moment the snowball began to turn over ill be killed oh dear i think you did this apurpose you rascals  never came back promptly  enjoy the ride while you have the chance peleg  youve got a free ticket to the bottom of the hill  let me out stop her yelled snuggers and they saw his feet at one end of the big snowball and his hands at the other i cant stand rollin nohow  youre not standing called sam you are just rolling  away went the big snowball down the long hill and the cadets after it as it progressed it grew larger and larger they saw peleg snuggers shove out his head from one end and the head went around and around like a top  i guess hell be rather dizzy when the trips ended observed songbird  at last the snowball came to a stop in a stretch of meadow land the students rushed up just in time to see peleg snuggers crawl out on his hands and knees when he arose he staggered around as if intoxicated  say you young villains he gasped and then had to stop to catch his breath  oh peleg why did you run away with our snowball asked tom innocently  it was a mean thing to do put in dick  we wanted some fun with that ball added sam  irunoffwith thethe snowball gasped the general utility man i want you to know  oh we know all about it interrupted tom i know whats the matter youve been drinking and didnt know what you were doing  perhaps we had better report this to captain putnam said larry drinking isnt allowed around here you know  i haint drunk a dropits the rollin as made me dizzy roared peleg snuggers oh dear i cant stand straight and he bumped up against the big snowball and sat down in a heap  ill tell you what i think you ought to do proceeded tom calmly i think you ought to roll our snowball back up the hill for us  roll it back snorted snuggers why four hosses couldnt pull that weight o snow up the hill i aint going to tech the snowball  then at least pay us for the ride youve had suggested sam  i aint goin to do that nuther its a trick thats what it is growled the general utility man and arose unsteadily ill be sick for a week after this i know i will  never mind said dick soothingly just get mrs green to give you a dose of pink whirl around pills and youll be all right again  i shant never come out to this hill again not fer nobody grumbled the general utility man and walked off then he turned to gaze at the cadets you do anything like that again an ill tell captain putnam on ye see if i dont i aint going to be no merrygoround or spinnin top fer nobody and then he hurried for the stables and disappeared     chapter xxiii  holidays at the farm   almost before they knew it the midwinter holidays were at hand and the rover boys went home to enjoy christmas and new year on their way they stopped at several stores in ithaca where they purchased a number of christmas presents some of these they mailed at the postoffice dick sent a nice book to dora and tom and sam sent books to grace and nellie the boys also united in the gift of a stick pin to mrs stanhope and another to mrs laning and sent mr laning a necktie captain putnam was not forgotten and they likewise remembered george strong the rest of their purchases they took home for distribution there  a number of the other students had come as far as ithaca with them and here the crowd had dinner at one of the hotelsthe same place where tom had once played his great joke on josiah crabtree  by the way who knows anything about nick pell asked one of the students while dining  he has been removed to his home in the city answered george granbury  is he better questioned dick  they say he is better some days but at other times he is worse the poison somehow affected his mind  what a terrible thing to happen murmured the eldest rover and then shuddered to think what might have ensued had the snake bitten him  any news of tad sobber asked another cadet he looked at each of the others but all shook their heads  its queer where he went to said songbird wonder if captain putnam tried to communicate with his folks  he has only an uncle and the captain couldnt find him answered another youth who was present  as the dinner progressed the boys warmed up and at the conclusion they sang several songs then the rovers had to rush for their train and they caught it just as it was pulling out of the station  hullo cried sam as he dropped into a seat and he pointed out of the car window  whats up now queried tom  i saw a fellow on the depot platform who looked like tad sobber  are you sure it was sobber demanded dick  no i am not dead certainbut the fellow looked a good deal like tad  must have been a mistake was toms comment what would he be doing around ithaca  well hes got to stay somewhere tom  but he wouldnt stay so close to cedarvillehed probably go to some big city put in dick  as the train rushed on the rover boys talked the matter over but could make nothing out of it  i suppose he is in hiding waiting to see if nick pell will recover said dick he knows that if nick doesnt get over his trouble hell be liable to prosecution  at the station at oak run the boys found their father awaiting them with the big family sleigh all piled in and over the crisp snow they started for valley brook farm  i need not ask how you are feeling said anderson rover every one of you looks the picture of health  i never felt better in my life declared dick and tom and sam said the same  has uncle randolph heard anything more of his traction company bonds asked tom as they drove along  not a word more answered his father it is a great loss to him  do you suppose the game was tried on anybody else asked sam  we have not heard of it  arriving at home the boys were warmly greeted by their uncle and their aunt and also by the others around the house their aunt had a hot supper awaiting them and while they ate this the whole subject of the missing bonds was thoroughly discussed the boys learned that a private detective was still on the trail of merrick and pike but so far had reported nothing of importance  i believe those rascalsor at least merrickmust belong around lake cayuga observed dick otherwise we shouldnt have seen merrick in ithaca and up at the stanhope place  i was very simple to let them get the best of me the next time i shall be more careful said randolph rover  the boys learned from jack ness that hunting in the woods back of the farm was good and two days before christmas they went out with the hired man they went for rabbits and squirrels and each took his shotgun along and a substantial lunch for they expected to be out the greater part of the day  it was clear cold weather the sun glistening brightly on the snow they journeyed directly for a portion of the woods they knew was a favorite spot for rabbits and it was not long before they started up several  there they go cried dick and took aim bang bang went his gun and the reports of toms firearm followed three rabbits came down and a few minutes later sam brought another one low  four for a starter are not so bad remarked tom as the game was placed in their bags even if we dont get any more we wont have to go home emptyhanded  by noon they had made their way directly through the woods and had eleven rabbits and three squirrels to their credit then tom suggested they build a campfire and rest while eating their lunch and this was done  i wish we could bring down a fox or two said jack ness they have been bothering the chickens again latelycarried off two only night before last  do you know where they hang out asked dick  i think they come from over yonder and the hired man pointed with his hand to the northward  let us travel in that direction after dinner suggested sam even if we dont spot any foxes we may find as many rabbits and squirrels there as anywhere else  the others were willing and half of the afternoon was spent by the four hunters in a locality that was new to them one fox was sighted and jack ness shot the animal in the hind quarters and then sam finished him by a shot in the side  well that makes one fox less anyway said the hired man  they kept on and brought down two rabbits and a wild turkey by this time they were pretty well tired out and tom suggested that they start for home  its a long tramp he said and by the time we get back i guess well all be ready to rest  as for that i am ready to rest now said sam tramping through the snow is no easy task  especially if a fellows legs arent very long returned dick with a grin  well mine are as long as they ought to be came from sam promptly they reach to the ground and yours dont reach any further and then there was a general laugh jack ness guffawing loudly  the hired man said he knew of a short cut to the farm and they followed him to something of a path through the woods and then out on a trail made years before by charcoal burners soon they came in sight of a cabin from the chimney of which the smoke was curling  who lives here asked dick  an old man named derringham answered jack ness he is very old and somewhat out of his head he makes his living by selling herbs and barks for medicine years ago so they say he was an herb doctor but he didnt have a certificate or something like that so the authorities drove him out of business after that he got queer and took to the woods  let us go in and see him said tom whose curiosity was aroused he walked boldly up to the hut and knocked loudly on the dilapidated door  who is that pop he heard somebody ask in a startled voice  i dont know sir was the answer in the voice of an old man  i dont want to see anybody went on the first speaker send him away whoever he is  go away cried the old man i dont want anybody around here  by this time all of the party outside were at the door toms face showed that he was laboring under sudden surprise  evidently the old man doesnt want visitors was dicks comment  there is somebody else in there with him whispered tom from his voice i should say it was bill dangler     chapter xxiv  a capture and a surprise   the others were much astonished by what tom said and they could scarcely believe that they had heard aright  bill dangler cried sam but tom put his hand over his brothers mouth to silence him then he nodded vigorously  what would that freight thief be doing here questioned dick in a whisper  i am sure i dont know but i am almost certain it was danglers voice if you will remember it has a certain shrillness to it  yes i know that  during this talk there were murmurs in the cabin which those outside could not understand then the old man came towards the door and slipped a bolt into place  i want you to go away he said sharply i dont like strangers around here  we wont hurt you mr derringham said dick we came to pay you a friendly visit  wouldnt you like a nice rabbit from us asked tom bound to get into the cabin somehow  i have no money with which to buy rabbits  well make you a present of one said sam  i want no presents from anybody i want you to go away said the old man in a highpitched nervous tone  mr derringham dont you remember me asked jack ness i used to buy herbs and watercress from you id like to speak to you for a minute  who are you  i am jack ness the man who works over on the rover farm  the rover farm muttered a voice in the cabin dont let them in dont you do it  i am sure that is dangler cried tom whose ears were on the alert if he is really there we have him cornered  yes and he shant get away from us again added dick  if he tries it we can halt him with a dose of buckshot put in sam  after that there was a pause the boys not knowing exactly how to proceed tom pressed on the door but it refused to give way  i tell you i want you to leave cried the old man after some more whispering in the cabin if you dont go away ill get my gun  there are four of us and all armed answered dick so you had better not do any shooting but you have got to open that door we will do you no harm  what do you want in here  we want to see who is in there with you answered tom boldly  dont you know that i am alone  you are not alone said sam  well i know best was the hesitating answer if i was sure you wouldnt hurt me id let you in  we will not harm you in the least answered dick  there was a moving around in the cabin and what seemed to be the dropping of a door then old derringham came forward again  you are sure you wont rob me if i open the door he asked  we mean you no harmif you will do what is right said tom  then the door was thrown open and the rover boys and jack ness were confronted by a man at least seventy years of age he had snowwhite hair and a snowy beard that reached to his waist  the boys and the hired man went hastily into the cabin and looked around nobody but derringham was in sight dick looked at the floor under the table and saw something which looked like a trap door  he must have gone into the cellar said he to the others and made a movement forward  stop do not touch that table cried the old man in alarm  mr derringham listen to me said the eldest rover boy firmly we are after a criminala man who for years robbed the railroad company of valuable freight we know he is somewhere around your place if you shield this criminal or aid him in getting away you will be guilty of a crime  at this strong assertion the old man began to tremble and he looked from one to another of those before him in alarm  ii bill dangler said it was not truethat it was a plot against him he murmured  it is true and there is no plot against him excepting to make him pay the penalty of his crimes put in tom if you have hidden him you had better give him up  i know you said old derringham turning to jack ness you used to pay me good prices for what you bought of me can i trust you he went on pleadingly  certainly you can and you can trust these boys too was the hired mans reply if you want to keep out of trouble you had better help us all you can  by this time dick had the table shoved to one side under the bottom of one of the legs he found a small iron ring connecting with the door in the floor he pulled on this and the door came up showing a small cellar below used chiefly by the old man for the storage of winter vegetables and the roots he gathered  dangler you might as well come up called out dick it wont do you any good to try to hide  what do you want of me came in a sullen voice from below  you know very well what we want  i havent done anything  you can tell that to the police after you are locked up come up  slowly and with downcast face bill dangler crawled from the small cellar and pulled himself up to the floor of the cabin he gazed reproachfully at the old man who was again trembling  ill fix you for going back on me he muttered  they say you are a thief answered the old man if you are i want nothing more to do with you i am poor but i am honesteverybody who knows me knows that  he shall not harm you put in tom hell soon be behind the bars  a glance at the party of four with their shotguns convinced the freight thief that escape was out of the question  i suppose ill have to give up he growled but i aint as guilty as you may think i am  you are guilty enough said sam  i didnt plan those freight robberies  who did then questioned tom  merrick and pike i dont mind telling on them for they have gone back on me  is merrick the head of the gang asked dick  yes  where is he now  if i tell will you let me go  i cant do that dangler  well i dont care anyway merrick hasnt treated me right and he ought to suffer he has a hangout a few miles from the city of ithaca if you know where that is  yes on lake cayuga  thats it  you say a few miles from the city pursued sam what do you mean by that  he and some of his friends pike among them have a meeting place along the lake its an old house unpainted and with very narrow windows so ive been told you find that house and likely youll find merrick and pike  i thought those chaps were from the city said sam  they are but every once in a while they find it convenient to disappear and then they go to that place on lake cayuga its an old homestead that used to belong to merricks sister  we ought to be able to find that place said tom to his brothers especially if it was a homestead  was the sisters name merrick too or was she married asked sam  she was a widow so i was told when she died she left her son in charge of merrickbut i dont believe he ever looked after the boy very much  what was her name asked dick  sobbermary ann sobber  sobber ejaculated the three rover boys  thats it  did you ever hear the sons name asked dick  i dont rememberyes i do merrick had a letter from him once the boys name was tad sobber he was at a boarding school somewhere     chapter xxv  christmas at the farm   what do you think of that  isnt that the greatest ever  well im sorry for tad  such were the exclamations from the three rover boys after listening to bill danglers declaration that the lad who had run away from putnam hall was the nephew of merrick  are you certain of this asked dick  certainly i am but why are you so interested in merricks sister and her son  i will tell you answered tom tad sobber used to go to school with us but he ran away a short while ago and we havent heard from him since  phew so thats it maybe hes with his uncle  like as not i wonder if he knows his uncle is a thief  i dont know anything about that sid merrick is a sly one and can put on the most innocent front you ever saw  what do you know about pike  oh john pike is only a tool same as i was  after that bill dangler seemed anxious to relieve his mind and he related many of the particulars of the freight robberies he said that all had been planned by sid merrick and that two other men were implicated besides himself and pike and named the men he said that merrick had sold the stolen stuff in various large cities  did he divide with the others asked dick  he was supposed to do it but i dont think any of us ever got our full share  old derringham listened to the thiefs recital with keen interest but presently he rushed forward and caught bill dangler by the arm  i want you to go he cried almost fiercely i want no thief under my roof  he shall go and at once declared dick it is getting late and it is a long tramp to oak run  he owes me a dollar for keeping him several days went on the old man  then he had better pay you said tom  dangler wanted to demur but in the end he paid for his board and then the whole party left the old man gazing after them curiously that he had been entirely innocent in the affair there could not be the slightest doubt  now dangler it wont do you any good to try to get away said dick as they tramped along through the snow we are four to one and armed  i wont try to run away was the dogged answer  if you give the authorities all the help you can perhaps when it comes to a trial they will be a little easy on you put in tom  i hope so i was coaxed into this i used to be an honest man responded the freight thief  well before you die youll learn that honesty is the best policy observed sam  ive learned that already ive lost all my old friends and i cant show myself anywhere any more  the crowd had to tramp a good mile and a half before they reached a farmhouse where they could procure a team and a sleigh big enough to take all of them to oak run then they set off at a fast pace and at about supper time reached the rover farm  those at the farm were much astonished at the game brought in as anderson rover declared the boys waited long enough to get a meal and gave the prisoner something to eat and then they set off for oak run with their father and dangler here the freight thief was placed in the custody of the local constable who locked the man up in the garret of his own home  that night and the next day the telegraph and telephone were kept busy and some officers of the law from ithaca visited the old sobber homestead they found the place deserted and no trace of merrick pike or tad sobber was to be found  it is too bad declared dick when the news came in i thought sure wed round up the rascals  from the authorities the boys learned one thingthat the sobber homestead was on the same road that ran past the stanhope cottage  that may account for merrick coming and looking in the window that night said dick maybe he was traveling past and wanted to see what was going on  more than likely he was looking for a chance to rob the place was toms grim comment  on christmas day the boys received a number of valuable presents and gave everybody presents in return there was a grand family dinner such as only their aunt martha could prepare and it is needless to say that all did full justice to the spread after dinner the lads went out snowballing and got aleck pop and jack ness to do the same the boys snowballed the colored man and jack ness so vigorously that the pair had to run for the barn  my sakes alibe boys cried aleck pop after he had received a snowball in the ear yo dun work yo snowballs lik da was comin from a gatling gun  during the week between christmas and new year bill dangler was removed to the county jail there to await the action of the grand jury in the meantime the authorities continued the hunt for merrick pike and the others but without success  id really like to know what has become of tad sobber remarked dick it is a pity if he is dependent upon such a fellow as merrick for his support  perhaps his mother left him money said tom  at last came the day when the boys returned to putnam hall on the train they fell in with larry colby and george granbury and told of what they had learned  i heard from nick pell yesterday said larry he is getting better gradually but it will be some time before he is himself again  does he still blame tad sobber  yes and he says he will never have anything to do with sobber again  nobody can blame him for that said sam  i dont believe sobber will ever return to putnam hall came from tom especially when he finds out that we know he is the nephew of such a swindler as merrick  in a few days the boys settled down again to their studies the rovers were exceedingly anxious to make records for themselves and whenever a lesson was too hard for tom or sam dick helped them all he could the eldest rover boy was sorry he had missed his former position by being absent but he was delighted to know that he and his brothers would now finish their schooling at putnam hall together  i couldnt bear to think of being separated from you he said to tom and sam  we dont want to be separated returned tom  thats the talk declared sam well stick together always  about a week after the return to school the snow cleared away and then came a cold snap that made excellent skating at once all the boys got out their skates and during their off hours they had great fun on the lake  one afternoon a race was arranged between half a dozen boys including dick larry colby and peter slade slade was sure he would win and went around boasting of it  i have been in six races on skates he declared and i won every one of them  he must be a famous skater said tom when he learned of this dick i dont think youll stand much show against him  i dont know do you know what i think of peter slade i think he is a big blower  i think that myself still if he has won six races he must know something about racing  well if i lose i shant cry over it said dick and there the talk ended  the race was to be for two milesa mile up the lake shore and a mile back at the appointed hour the contestants lined up and at a word from george strong who had consented to start them they were off  it was easy to see that peter slade was a good skater and with hardly an effort he went to the front during the first quarter of the race but then larry and dick began to push him and when the mile turn was made larry was but two yards in the rear with dick almost on his heels  go it slade you can win easily  catch him larry  put on more steam dick yelled tom enthusiastically  and then the turning point was passed by all the racers and the struggle on the homestretch commenced     chapter xxvi  the skating race   for nearly half a mile peter slade kept the lead with ease but then his breath began to fail him looking over his shoulder he saw both larry and dick crawling up  no you dont he muttered and put on a fresh burst of speed that increased his lead by two yards  peter slade is going to win  see how he is running away from the others  so the cries arose and it certainly looked as if the youth mentioned could not possibly be defeated  but now both larry and dick dug in for all they were worth as they themselves expressed it while there was yet a quarter of a mile to be covered dick made a spurt and ranged up alongside of his chum  sorry but ive got to go ahead he cried gaily  come on well both go yelled larry good naturedly and then the pair put on a fresh effort and in a moment ranged up on either side of peter slade  hullo they are in a line  there goes larry colby ahead  dick rover is going with him  say but that is skating eh just look at dick strike out  sandwick is coming up too  and so is marley  the last reports were true the fourth and fifth boy were now directly behind slade as dick and larry shot ahead still side by side sandwick overtook slade and so did marley in the meantime the sixth boy had lost a skate and dropped out  with a final desperate effort peter slade tried to gain first place but his wind was gone and his strength also and he dropped back further and further  hurrah here they come  its a tie race between dick and larry  marley is third  yes and sandwick fourth  peter slade is fifth  humph and peter said he was bound to win  then over the line shot the skaters dick and larry side by side and laughing merrily as soon as the race was ended they locked arms to show their good feeling then marley came in with sandwick at his heels in deep disgust peter slade refused to finish but circled to one side and hurried to the boathouse there to take off his skates and disappear  it was a wellskated race declared george strong then he asked dick and larry if they wanted to skate off the tie  we wont bother said dick after consulting his chum we are satisfied to let it stand as it is considering that there was no prize to be awarded  the fact that he had lost the skating race made peter slade more sour than ever and after that whenever he met dick he glared at the eldest rover boy defiantly  he acts as if he had a personal grudge against me said dick to his brothers  well he acts that way to me too answered tom  he ought to have his head punched well was sams comment  peter slade did not seem to care that larry had beaten himhis enmity was directed mainly at dick  slade was in one of the lower classes but one day one of the teachers announced a lecture on the battleships of the american navy and a large number of boys came in to listen and to take notes  in the midst of the lecture dick had occasion to pass down one of the aisles as he went by peter slade the latter put out his hand and hit him in the knee slades hand had ink on it and the ink went on dicks clean uniform  what did you do that for demanded dick halting  shut up whispered slade uglily  ive a good mind to box your ears went on dick  will you roared the bully leaping up just try it and so speaking he made a pass at dicks head  the blow landed on dicks shoulder leaving an ink mark behind it the eldest rover boy had leaped to one side but now he leaped forward and a welldirected blow from his fist sent slade reeling backward over a desk  stop that cried the teacher in alarm and brought his lecture to an abrupt end  a fight a fight cried several of the boys and left their seats to surround dick and the bully  slade was dazed for a moment but on recovering he sprang at dick and tried to force him to the floor around and around went the pair bumping against the desks and sending some books to the floor the teacher tried to get at them but before he could do so they had separated then dick hit slade a telling blow in the left eye which caused the bully to fall into a nearby seat  stop this instant cried the teacher and then turning to some of the boys added summon captain putnam at once  the room was in an uproar and many wanted dick and slade to continue the battle but the punch in the eye had taken away the bullys courage and he did not get up to continue the contest  what does this mean demanded captain putnam as he came in and he faced dick and slade sternly  it means that that fellow ought to have a good thrashing sir answered dick boldly and pointed at the bully  its his fault it aint mine put in peter slade hastily he started it  that is not true captain putnam i was passing his seat when he reached out and smeared ink on my knee and dick pointed down to his soiled trousers i wasnt going to stand for that and told him so then he jumped up and hit me in the shoulder leaving more ink on me after that i hit him  it aint so roared peter slade  thats the truth said several peters hand is full of ink  he knocked over an inkwell just before dick came along said fred i saw him do it  so did i added songbird  did you see it questioned captain putnam of the instructor  i saw nothing until the boys were fighting in the aisle answered the teacher who had been delivering the lecture  captain putnam i am sure dick rover is not to blame said a very quiet student named rames slade put the ink on rover and struck the first blowof that i am positive  it was my inkwell he knocked over came from another lad i told him to leave it alone but he wouldnt mind me  oh you are all against me roared peter slade  evidently you are guilty said the master of the hall sternly i want both you and richard rover to come to my office rames you can come too and you also brocton  in the office a thorough investigation was held several other cadets were called upon to testify and it was proved that peter slade was entirely to blame for what had occurred  you should not have attacked him richard said the captain to dick but under the circumstances i cannot blame you you may go  for his misconduct peter slade was confined in the guardhouse for three days the black eye dick had given him did not go away very fast and when he came out and resumed his place among the students he was a sight to behold that he was very angry at the eldest rover boy is easily imagined  ill fix him some day he muttered  dick you want to watch slade said tom one day on passing the bully in the hallway  i guess you had better watch him yourself tom  i am going to do that dont fear what did the captain do about your mussedup uniform  made slade pay for having it cleaned  did he do it  he had to do itcaptain putnam put it on the bill to his folks  that was right  of course it was but i understand it made slade as mad as hops oh he surely has it in for us went on dick and there the subject was dropped     chapter xxvii  on the lake   almost before the boys knew it winter was gone and spring was at hand the ice on the lake disappeared like magic and the hills back of putnam hall took on a fresh greenness pleasant to behold  with the coming of warm weather the cadets spent a large part of their off time outdoors some took up rowing and among the number were sam and tom larry colby had become the owner of a fairsized sloop and he frequently took some of his chums out for a cruise up or down the lake  do you know what id like to do said dick one day id like to visit that old sobber homestead and see how it looks  ive often thought of that answered sam wonder how we can manage it  the matter was talked over in larrys presence and the cadet who owned the sloop said they might make the trip in that craft provided the master of putnam hall would give them the desired permission  well ask captain putnam at once declared dick  permission was granted to leave putnam hall early on the following saturday morning provided the weather was clear and it was arranged that the party should consist of the three rover boys larry fred and songbird the captain said he preferred that they come back saturday night but they could remain away over sunday if they found it necessary  do you think well get any clew to merrick and tad sobber asked dick with a faint smile  possibly answered captain putnam smiling back you rovers are great chaps for finding out things  the sloop was provided with a tiny cuddy or cabin and in this the boys placed a small stock of provisions and also a shotgun and some fishing lines they left the hall after breakfast and were glad of the promise of a warm day with the breeze in just the right direction  you fellows will have to tell me where to steer the sloop to said larry after the mainsail had been run up i dont know where that old house is  we have a general idea where it is answered dick of course we may have some trouble finding it but if we get mixed up we can go ashore and ask the folks living in that vicinity  the distance to be covered along the lake shore was in the neighborhood of twelve miles so the boys had quite a sail before them they took turns at steering and said they liked the sloop very much  about four miles had been covered when the breeze began to die away this was exasperating but could not be helped so the boys made the best of it as the sloop drifted along they got out some fishing tackle and it was not long before sam brought up a fairsized fish of which he felt quite proud  at this rate it will take us till night to reach that old house remarked dick after they had been fishing half an hour it is too bad i thought wed get there by noon when we started even if the breeze did go down  oh i think the breeze will start up again before long said tom hopefully let us enjoy this fishing while we have the chance he added having just pulled in a real piscatorial prize  by noon they had a good mess of fish to their credit and then sam proposed that they go ashore and build a fire and cook some for dinner  there is no use of mourning over the wind said he  if it wasnt for the sloop we might tramp to the old house returned dick  i shouldnt wish to leave my boat just anywhere said larry somebody might run off with herand she cost quite some money  you might leave her in care of some farmer along here suggested songbird and then he added softly      for what is a boat without a breeze     its like a forest minus its trees     its like a table without a leg      or a big blue top without its peg  finished tom but i move we camp and cook fish he continued we can have a dandy meal along with the stuff we brought along  the idea of going ashore prevailed and soon they had tied up the sloop and lowered the mainsail brushwood was handy and having started a fire they cleaned some of the fish and set it to broiling they had a pot along in which they made coffee and they also brought out some bread and crackers cake and some fruit they had some meat with them but left that for possible future use  the cadets took their time over the meal and it was not until two oclock that they again boarded the polly as larry had named his craft  i think the breeze is coming again cried dick holding up his hand  let it come was the cry and as the wind freshened all felt much better soon the polly was bowling over the lake as speedily as when they had first started  do you know what i think said songbird who stood at the stern looking toward the distant hills i think we are going to have more wind than well want before night  do you think a big blow is coming questioned fred  it looks that way to me do you see those dark clouds just beginning to show themselves yonder  well i shant mind a little blow said dick in fact i think id rather like the excitement and the others said the same  they were still about two miles from the spot where they supposed the old house was located when it suddenly grew darker and the breeze freshened greatly then came a puff of air that sent the polly far over on her side  hi this wont do cried fred in alarm we dont want to upset  maybe we had better take in some sail added songbird nervously  he had scarcely spoken when there came another puff of wind that made all cling fast to the deck to keep from being pitched overboard the sky was now very dark and there were a few flakes of snow in the air  its a spring snowsquall thats what it is announced dick i dont think it will last over ten or fifteen minutes  its too much for the polly came from larry put down the mainsail will you  several sprang to do as requested and hardly had the sheet been lowered and stowed away when there came a fierce gust that drove them well in shore  there is a covewe can go in there for shelter cried sam and the sloop was steered accordingly the cove was well protected by trees and they came to anchor at a spot that looked particularly inviting  the boys were afraid it would rain and wondered what they would do to keep from getting wet since the cuddy on the sloop was too small to hold more than two or three of the party but no rain came and soon the flurry of snow disappeared the wind however instead of letting up blew harder than ever  i am glad we are not out in the middle of the lake observed fred wed be capsized sure  this is certainly getting to be a regular gale answered dick and the worst of it is there is no telling how long it is going to last  there was nothing to do but to wait and in order to keep warm the cadets put up a bit of sailcloth on the deck of the sloop and taking in the cuddy there they crouched and told stories and talked for over an hour  i move we go on said tom at last the wind isnt quite as strong as it was  although doubtful of the wisdom of the proceedings the others voted to proceed and they poled their way out of the cove only the jib of the polly was hoisted and this sent them bowling along at a fair rate of speed  dick stood in the bow and at last called upon larry to turn the sloop toward shore  i think we must be in the neighborhood of that house now he said and just ahead is a fine cove where the sloop will be as well sheltered as it was at the other cove  accordingly larry turned the polly in and the other lads lowered the sail they came to anchor between a number of tall trees where the sloop was almost screened from sight  having made certain the boat could not drift away the six boys led by dick made their way along the shore until they struck something of a path coming to a slight rise dick pointed with his hand  isnt that a house on the other side of the hill he asked  yes cried tom and by the appearance of it i should say its the place we are looking for     chapter xxviii  at the old house   the rover boys and their chums approached the old house with a good deal of interest dick led the way setting a pace that made it hard for the others to keep up  dont hurry so dick remonstrated fred the house isnt going to run away  dick wants to make sure if that merrick is around responded songbird and i cant blame him  the old sobber homestead was surrounded by a grove of trees equally aged one of the trees had blown down taking a corner of the roof with it through this opening the birds flitted  i dont believe a soul is around observed tom as they halted in front of the building  nothing like ringing the bell cried sam and mounting the dilapidated piazza he raised the ancient knocker of the door and used it vigorously then came a crash and the youngest rover felt the piazza bottom give way  look out a post is coming down cried dick warningly and sam had just time enough to leap away when the corner post of the piazza fell allowing the roof above to sag several inches  looks to me as if the whole building was on the verge of collapse was songbirds comment  yes and i dont know whether i want to go in or not added larry  it certainly does look shaky admitted dick i dont think anybody would risk staying in it long  leaving the front they walked around the old house and gazed through several of the brokenout windows inside all was dirt and cobwebs with a few pieces of brokendown furniture scattered about as he looked in one window tom saw a big rat scurry across the floor  i guess rats are the only tenants he said dryly and they dont pay rent  with a few birds on the top floor front added sam well do we go in or not  i am going in declared dick and pushed open the old kitchen door it was damp and mouldy in the apartment for the rain had soaked loose much of the plaster and caused it to fall  the big open fireplace looked grimy and forbidding with its iron bars and chains an iron kettle stood on the chimneypiece a crack across the bottom  somebody has had a fire here not so very long ago said dick and picked up a bit of halfburnt newspaper he turned it over here is a date this newspaper is only four days old  then whoever made a fire here visited this house within the past four days said larry in a tragic whisper  whoop just listen to what a detective larry is becoming cried tom regular bowery bob the newsboy sleuth  perhaps it was only some curiosity seeker who came here suggested fred  with caution for the floors were very rotten the cadets moved from one room of the old house to another  anything in there asked tom of sam as the latter peered into a room that was extra dark  i cant make out was the answer and sam took a step forward then of a sudden there was a strange whirring and something hit the youngest rover boy on the ear causing him to fall back in fright  stop that he cried  what was it queried tom while the others came running to the spot  something hit me on the ear  anybody in there  there must be  come out of that whoever you are yelled fred while dick pointed his shotgun at the door  there was no answer but a second later came the whirring again and then a big bat flew into the light just grazing toms face  a bat  let it go said songbird and then the bat flew out of a window and disappeared  oh murmured sam and breathed a sigh of relief ii thought somebody struck at me  ive got one of those electric pocket lights along said tom let me use that  he turned on the little electric lamp and by its rays they inspected the apartment it was a bedroom and in one corner was an old bedstead and on it a musty straw mattress in another corner was a closet containing several shelves  here is an old inkwell said dick and brought it forth and here are the remains of a box of writing paper and envelopes  any letters asked fred  they looked around but at first could find no writings of any kind but behind one of the shelves in a crack they discovered several sheets of paper and took these to the light to read  they are parts of letters from mr sobber to his wife said dick they must have been written by tads father  he speaks here of merrick added tom who was scanning a blurred page merrick is mrs sobbers brother beyond a doubt  from these letters i should say mr sobber had been off on a sea trip continued the eldest rover boy and it looks to me as if he had been an honest man for he tells his wife that he hopes merrick will give up his gambling habits  from the bedroom the boys entered what had been the parlor of the house this was almost bare to one side of the parlor was an entryway and here was a stairs leading to the second story and another leading to the cellar  well shall we go up or down queried dick  let us see what the cellar looks like first answered sam perhaps well find a pot of gold there  or a few skeletons put in tom  ugh dont say skeletons cried songbird with a shiver ive got the creeps already  look out that you dont break your neck on the stairs warned larry and then dick led the way down holding the light before him  if it was damp above it was far more so below and the boys shivered in spite of themselves the cellar had only a mud bottom and this was covered with slime and mold there was little there to interest them outside of an old chest which when they pried it open proved to be empty  listen cried tom suddenly and held up his hand  what did you hear demanded several of the others  i thought i heard somebody walking around upstairs there it is again  all gave attention and heard the unmistakable sounds of footsteps on the stairs leading to the second story  who is up there called out dick and turned to leave the cellar followed by his brothers and chums  stay where you are came back in a harsh voice dont any of you dare to come out of that cellar  it is merrick burst out tom  hardly had he spoken when they heard a door shut sharply and a bolt dropped into place then the footsteps retreated  he has shut the door to the cellar cried dick flashing the light upward we are locked in  hark i heard more than one person running from the house said larry  that pike must be with him  or else tad sobber  as quickly as he could dick ran up the old stairs and tried the door it was in fairly good condition and refused to budge  smash it down called out tom and went to his brothers assistance  we must get out and collar those rascals said sam cant you get the door open  we ought to be able to answered dick here catch the light and take the gun  in a few seconds dick tom and songbird were pressing on the door with all their strength all stood on the top step of the cellar stairs  now then all together cried dick and they shoved with might and main then came a crack below them and an instant later the cellar stairs collapsed carrying them with it as they went down in a confused heap the stairs struck the electric light and smashed it it also knocked the shotgun from sams hand  bang went the firearm with a report in the narrow confines of the cellar that was deafening  im killed im killed came from larry an instant later youve shot my hand off     chapter xxix  a wreck and a capture   get off of my fingers  please let me get out of this hole  say how can i get up if youre going to sit on my legs  these and a few more utterances came from the boys as they endeavored to clear themselves of the wreckage of the fallen stairs the small cellar was filled with smoke from the shotgun and larry was dancing around flipping his hurt hand in the air all was pitch dark for the small windows were covered with dirt and cobwebs to such a depth that no light penetrated through them  beware of that gun called dick when he could speak only one barrel went off remember  larry are you really killed questioned sara who somehow felt responsible since the weapon had been in his hands  nno but im hit in the fingers came from the wounded boy the shot went right past my head too  make a light somebody called out fred songbird youve got some matches  the poet of the hall lit a match and by this faint light the boys first of all looked at larrys damaged hand fortunately the charge of shot had merely grazed the thumb and middle finger and it was found that larry was more frightened than hurt the hand was bound up in a couple of handkerchiefs  when we get back to the boat youll want to wash the wounds well said dick  tom had picked up the electric pocket light but found he could not make it work again they were in darkness until another match was lit  we cant reach that door with the stairs down was dicks comment let us break out a window  this was easily accomplished and one after another the cadets crawled forth from the cellar it was a tight squeeze especially for fred who was rather large at the waist line  i guess those fellows who ran away thought we couldnt get through that window said songbird  if it had been an inch smaller i should have been stuck answered fred  they looked all around the old building but nobody was in sight the front door stood wide open and they rightly surmised that the others had taken their departure that way  the question is which way did they go came from dick  do you think they went on foot asked sam they might have a carriage  or a boat added larry oh i hope we can catch them just to make em pay for these hurt fingers of mine and he shut his teeth hard for the wounds pained him not a little  larry i trust you dont think it was my fault observed sam  not a bit of it sam it was simply an accident thats all i am glad those on the stairs didnt hurt themselves  well my knee doesnt feel any too good came from tom i guess i scratched it quite some  shall we try to find those fellows first or go upstairs and look around asked songbird  let us try to find them first said dick we can come back here any time  i have a plan said tom let us scatter in all directions if anybody sees anything of them give the school whistle  good thats the talk exclaimed sam the sooner the better  in a minute more the six cadets were hunting in as many different directions for those they were after larry songbird and fred took to the lake shore while the three rover boys went up and down the roadway and into the woods beyond  nearly half an hour was spent in the search when the other lads heard a whistle from the lake shore the signal came from larry and was repeated several times  he wants us in a hurry said sam to dick when they met and started on a run they met larry coming towards them beckoning wildly  hurry up he called  whats up asked dick  they just went past in a sailboat and they are bound across the lake  the two men asked sam  yes and tad sobber too  tad  yes their boat couldnt have been very far from mine i saw the two men get on board and then tad came from a cabin and all three hoisted the sails as quickly as they could and stood over in the direction of the point with the three rocksyou remember the spot  i dothe place we once went nutting said dick  by this time the other cadets were coming up and they listened with keen interest to what larry had to tell in the meantime all ran to the polly and the sloop was poled out of the cove and the mainsail and jib were hoisted as larry was in no condition to steer dick took the tiller  they will get away if they possibly can observed songbird do you think if we get too close to them theyll fire at us or anything like that  there is no telling answered dick but i am going to load up that empty barrel of the shotgun and if they dare to shoot ill shoot back he added with determination  the other boat was in sight but a good half mile away and it was a serious question whether the polly could get anywhere near the craft before the point with the three rocks was gained  well if they go ashore we can capture the boat anyway observed sam that will be something  probably the boat was only hired the owner may not know what rascals those chaps are  the craft looked old and clumsy to me said larry if you sail the polly with care perhaps you can catch herif they dont play us some trick  the chase was now on in earnest and the cadets on board the sloop did all in their power to make speed there was a fair breeze the gale having gone down while they were at the house  i dont think they know much about running a boat said tom presently what are they up to now  they are turning back cried sam see they are headed for yonder cove they are not going up to the three rocks  what cove is that asked songbird is it the place we went fishing the day we caught the turtle  yes  then they had better look out dont you remember those sharp rocks right near the mouth of the cove  those who had been fishing the day mentioned did remember the rocks and they watched the boat ahead with keen interest the wind had freshened a little and the craft had swung around swiftly and was rushing for the cove they could see one of the men trying to lower the mainsail  they are in dangerous water cried dick  he had just uttered the words when they saw the boat strike something shiver from stem to stern and back away then she went ahead and struck a second time a second later she went over to larboard throwing the two men and tad sobber into the lake  theyve struck the rocks  the boat is sinking  they are all in the water  lower the mainsail yelled larry we dont want to get caught on the rocks sheer off dick  dick swung the tiller around and in a few seconds the mainsail came down with a bang and was secured by the others the jib was still up and this drew just sufficiently to send them forward slowly to the spot where the catastrophe had occurred  they found pike floundering around in the water yelling lustily for aid sid merrick and tad sobber had struck out for the nearest part of the shore about two hundred feet away  here catch hold of this and ill pull you up said tom reaching down to pike with a pole the floundering man did as told willingly and was quickly hauled to the deck then the polly was turned toward the shore and the jib was lowered  it was no easy task to bring the sloop in for they had to beware of the rocks and by the time this was accomplished sid merrick and tad sobber had landed and were running for the woods with all possible speed dick raised his shotgun and fired to scare them but they kept on and in a few minutes disappeared from sight     chapter xxx  goodbye to putnam hall   leaving john pike in charge of the others the three rover boys set off after sobber and merrick they followed the trail for awhile with ease for the fugitives were dripping wet from their involuntary bath  we have one advantage said dick as they ran along being wet they will attract attention and well be able to follow them up that way  about a quarter of a mile was covered when they heard a crashing in the brushwood not far ahead of them then came a yell of pain from both merrick and tad sobber  ouch im being stung to death  get off of me oh oh oh  they are hornets tad run or theyll be after us  ii cant run oh one stung me in the eye screamed tad sobber  then the rover boys heard the man and the boy plunge on tad screaming with pain at every step  wait we cant go that way cried tom who had no desire to tumble into the hornets nest as the others had probably done lets go around and he leaped to the left  as they progressed they heard tad sobber still crying wildly and they heard sid merrick urging him to run faster  im stung tooin about a dozen places said the bond thief but we mustnt be captured  oh it is awful groaned tad i can hardly bear the pain and he went on clutching his uncle by the arm both were indeed in a sorry plight  but coming out on a road fortune favored them they met a colored man running a touring car he was alone and they quickly hired him to take them to the nearest town  we fell into the lake by accident said sid merrick we want to get where we can change our clothing  and get something for these hornet stings added tad sobber if i dont get something soon ill go crazy from pain  as the three rover boys ran towards the roadway dick saw a big flat pocketbook lying on the ground he darted for it and picked it up  merrick must have dropped this he said its wet and here is a dead hornet stuck fast to it guess the hornets made him forget that he had it  slipping the pocketbook into his pocket dick ran out on the roadway and looked up and down but merrick and sobber were gone and what had become of them the boys did not learn until the next day and then it was too late  whats in that pocketbook asked sam after the hunt had come to an end for the time being  well soon learn said his big brother and opened up the still wet leather inside were several bank bills and a fat envelope  uncle randolphs missing traction company bonds cried dick bringing them forth this is the best ever  are they all there asked tom  dick counted them over rapidly  yesten for one thousand dollars each  hurrah shouted sam wont uncle randolph be glad when he hears of this  the boys were highly elated over the find and now they had the bonds they concluded that a further search for sid merrick could wait they did not care whether tad sobber was captured or not as they did not think the bully was much of a criminal  when they got back to the sloop they found that the others had bound john pikes hands behind him the robber was very meek and he declared that sid merrick was to blame for everything  he wanted to sell the bonds many times said pike but he knew that mr rover had advertised the numbers in the newspapers and he was afraid to do it he said he would wait until the affair blew over then he was going to sell out divide up and go to europe  pike added that the boat had belonged to himself she was an old craft and was allowed to remain on the rocks it came out later that pike had formerly lived on the lake shore and had thus become acquainted with merrick and the sobbers  as soon as possible the captured robber was handed over to the authorities and dick sent a message home acquainting his uncle with what had occurred this brought on both randolph rover and the boys father  you have certainly done wonderfully well said randolph rover as he took his bonds were you not so rich already i should want to reward you  we dont want any reward said dick but i am sorry we didnt catch merrick  for a long time the authorities tried to catch sid merrick and also endeavored to learn the whereabouts of tad sobber but without success they had disappeared and that seemed to be the end of it the old house was visited again but nothing of value was found there later on some tramps set it on fire and it was burnt to the ground a month later john pike and one other freight thief who was captured were tried for their misdeeds and sent to prison the authorities used bill dangler as a witness against them and dangler consequently was let go strange to say dangler turned over a new leaf and became a hard working man in a railroad stone quarry some miles from carwell  with the mystery of the traction company bonds cleared up the rover boys returned to putnam hall to complete their last term at that institution of learning they applied themselves diligently to their studies and when the final examinations came off all passed with flying colors  whoop im glad those exams are over cried tom i feel as if a hundredpound weight was taken off my shoulders  i am glad too answered sam  and i am glad all of us did so well put in dick our reports will please father and uncle randolph and aunt martha  it had been arranged that the commencement exercises should be carried out on rather an elaborate scale and many people were invited to attend this brought all the rovers and also the stanhopes and the lanings to putnam hall dick had been called on to deliver the valedictory and he made such a stirring address that he was vigorously applauded sam and tom appeared in a humor dialogue with fred and larry and this was received with shouts of laughter songbird recited an original poem which was a vast improvement over the most of his doggerel and hans and some of the others sang in a quartet which would have done credit to the average college glee club  oh it was splendid dick said dora after it was over and congratulations were in order and her eyes shone like stars as she pressed his hand  i saw only you dora when i got up to speak he whispered and thats why i did my best  you and sam had better go on the stage said nellie to tom that dialogue was too funny for anything  i laughed till the tears came added grace it was a splendid programme all the way through  well done my boys well done said anderson rover as he took each by the hand i was never so proud of you as i am today  now that we have finished our studies here what are we to do next questioned dick earnestly  we will settle that question this summer answered his father but in the meantime mr rover paused and looked at his oldest son thoughtfully  but what father  i will tell you when we get home dickthere is no use of my trying to do so in this excitement i have something very unusual to propose answered anderson rover and what that proposal was and what came of it will be related in another volume to be entitled the rover boys on treasure isle or the strange cruise of the steam yacht in that volume we shall meet many of our old friends again and also learn something concerning the disappearance of sid merrick and tad sobber  that evening the celebration at putnam hall was continued the cadets lit a huge bonfire on the campus and around this they danced and sang and made speeches they cheered everybody from captain putnam down to peleg snuggers and the festivities were kept up until midnight then the boys went to bedbut not to sleepfor was this not the last night at school innumerable tricks were played including one on peter slade that that youth never forgot this made the bully so angry he declared he was going to quit putnam hall for good and he did and nobody missed him  and now for home cried dick the next morning on dressing  and fresh adventures added tom  but i do hate to leave dear old putnam hall sighed sam and then the others sighed too  it was not until noon that the three rover boys were ready to go having first bid farewell to their numerous friends then they shook hands with captain putnam  we hate awfully to leave you said dick earnestly  and i hate to have you go richard was the reply you must visit the hall some time in the future  and you must come and see us captain putnam said tom  yes indeed added sam  i will answered the master of the hall  then the boys shook hands all over again and ran for the carryall some boys left behind set up a shout  goodbye dick  sorry to have you go tom  may we meet again sam  goodbye everybody was the answering shout goodbye to dear old putnam hall  then the whip cracked the carryall rolled from the door and the rover boys days at putnam hall
