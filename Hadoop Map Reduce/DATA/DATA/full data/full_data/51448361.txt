51448361	my ladys money  by wilkie collins     an episode in the life of a young girl  persons of the story   women   lady lydiard widow of lord lydiard  isabel miller her adopted daughter  miss pink of south morden  the hon mrs drumblade sister to the hon a hardyman   men  the hon alfred hardyman of the stud farm  mr felix sweetsir lady lydiards nephew  robert moody lady lydiards steward  mr troy lady lydiards lawyer  old sharon in the byways of legal bohemia   animal  tommie lady lydiards dog     part the first  the disappearance    chapter i  old lady lydiard sat meditating by the fireside with three letters lying open on her lap  time had discolored the paper and had turned the ink to a brownish hue the letters were all addressed to the same personthe rt hon lord lydiardand were all signed in the same wayyour affectionate cousin james tollmidge judged by these specimens of his correspondence mr tollmidge must have possessed one great merit as a letterwriterthe merit of brevity he will weary nobodys patience if he is allowed to have a hearing let him therefore be permitted in his own highflown way to speak for himself  first lettermy statement as your lordship requests shall be short and to the point i was doing very well as a portraitpainter in the country and i had a wife and children to consider under the circumstances if i had been left to decide for myself i should certainly have waited until i had saved a little money before i ventured on the serious expense of taking a house and studio at the west end of london your lordship i positively declare encouraged me to try the experiment without waiting and here i am unknown and unemployed a helpless artist lost in londonwith a sick wife and hungry children and bankruptcy staring me in the face on whose shoulders does this dreadful responsibility rest on your lordships  second letterafter a weeks delay you favor me my lord with a curt reply i can be equally curt on my side i indignantly deny that i or my wife ever presumed to see your lordships name as a means of recommendation to sitters without your permission some enemy has slandered us i claim as my right to know the name of that enemy  third and last letteranother week has passedand not a word of answer has reached me from your lordship it matters little i have employed the interval in making inquiries and i have at last discovered the hostile influence which has estranged you from me i have been it seems so unfortunate as to offend lady lydiard how i cannot imagine and the allpowerful influence of this noble lady is now used against the struggling artist who is united to you by the sacred ties of kindred be it so i can fight my way upwards my lord as other men have done before me a day may yet come when the throng of carriages waiting at the door of the fashionable portraitpainter will include her ladyships vehicle and bring me the tardy expression of her ladyships regret i refer you my lord lydiard to that day  having read mr tollmidges formidable assertions relating to herself for the second time lady lydiards meditations came to an abrupt end she rose took the letters in both hands to tear them up hesitated and threw them back in the cabinet drawer in which she had discovered them among other papers that had not been arranged since lord lydiards death  the idiot said her ladyship thinking of mr tollmidge i never even heard of him in my husbands lifetime i never even knew that he was really related to lord lydiard till i found his letters what is to be done next  she looked as she put that question to herself at an open newspaper thrown on the table which announced the death of that accomplished artist mr tollmidge related it is said to the late wellknown connoisseur lord lydiard in the next sentence the writer of the obituary notice deplored the destitute condition of mrs tollmidge and her children thrown helpless on the mercy of the world lady lydiard stood by the table with her eyes on those lines and saw but too plainly the direction in which they pointedthe direction of her checkbook  turning towards the fireplace she rang the bell i can do nothing in this matter she thought to herself until i know whether the report about mrs tollmidge and her family is to be depended on has moody come back she asked when the servant appeared at the door moody otherwise her ladyships steward had not come back lady lydiard dismissed the subject of the artists widow from further consideration until the steward returned and gave her mind to a question of domestic interest which lay nearer to her heart her favorite dog had been ailing for some time past and no report of him had reached her that morning she opened a door near the fireplace which led through a little corridor hung with rare prints to her own boudoir isabel she called out how is tommie  a fresh young voice answered from behind the curtain which closed the further end of the corridor no better my lady  a low growl followed the fresh young voice and added in dogs language much worse my ladymuch worse  lady lydiard closed the door again with a compassionate sigh for tommie and walked slowly to and fro in her spacious drawingroom waiting for the stewards return  accurately described lord lydiards widow was short and fat and in the matter of age perilously near her sixtieth birthday but it may be said without paying a compliment that she looked younger than her age by ten years at least her complexion was of that delicate pink tinge which is sometimes seen in old women with wellpreserved constitutions her eyes equally well preserved were of that hard light blue color which wears well and does not wash out when tried by the test of tears add to this her short nose her plump cheeks that set wrinkles at defiance her white hair dressed in stiff little curls and if a doll could grow old lady lydiard at sixty would have been the living image of that doll taking life easily on its journey downwards to the prettiest of tombs in a burialground where the myrtles and roses grew all the year round  these being her ladyships personal merits impartial history must acknowledge on the list of her defects a total want of tact and taste in her attire the lapse of time since lord lydiards death had left her at liberty to dress as she pleased she arrayed her short clumsy figure in colors that were far too bright for a woman of her ages her dresses badly chosen as to their hues were perhaps not badly made but were certainly badly worn morally as well as physically it must be said of lady lydiard that her outward side was her worst side the anomalies of her dress were matched by the anomalies of her character there were moments when she felt and spoke as became a lady of rank and there were other moments when she felt and spoke as might have become the cook in the kitchen beneath these superficial inconsistencies the great heart the essentially true and generous nature of the woman only waited the sufficient occasion to assert themselves in the trivial intercourse of society she was open to ridicule on every side of her but when a serious emergency tried the metal of which she was really made the people who were loudest in laughing at her stood aghast and wondered what had become of the familiar companion of their everyday lives  her ladyships promenade had lasted but a little while when a man in black clothing presented himself noiselessly at the great door which opened on the staircase lady lydiard signed to him impatiently to enter the room  i have been expecting you for some time moody she said you look tired take a chair  the man in black bowed respectfully and took his seat     chapter ii  robert moody was at this time nearly forty years of age he was a shy quiet dark person with a pale closelyshaven face agreeably animated by large black eyes set deep in their orbits his mouth was perhaps his best feature he had firm wellshaped lips which softened on rare occasions into a particularly winning smile the whole look of the man in spite of his habitual reserve declared him to be eminently trustworthy his position in lady lydiards household was in no sense of the menial sort he acted as her almoner and secretary as well as her stewarddistributed her charities wrote her letters on business paid her bills engaged her servants stocked her winecellar was authorized to borrow books from her library and was served with his meals in his own room his parentage gave him claims to these special favors he was by birth entitled to rank as a gentleman his father had failed at a time of commercial panic as a country banker had paid a good dividend and had died in exile abroad a brokenhearted man robert had tried to hold his place in the world but adverse fortune kept him down undeserved disaster followed him from one employment to another until he abandoned the struggle bade a last farewell to the pride of other days and accepted the position considerately and delicately offered to him in lady lydiards house he had now no near relations living and he had never made many friends in the intervals of occupation he led a lonely life in his little room it was a matter of secret wonder among the women in the servants hall considering his personal advantages and the opportunities which must surely have been thrown in his way that he had never tempted fortune in the character of a married man robert moody entered into no explanations on that subject in his own sad and quiet way he continued to lead his own sad and quiet life the women all failing from the handsome housekeeper downward to make the smallest impression on him consoled themselves by prophetic visions of his future relations with the sex and predicted vindictively that his time would come  well said lady lydiard and what have you done  your ladyship seemed to be anxious about the dog moody answered in the low tone which was habitual to him i went first to the veterinary surgeon he had been called away into the country and  lady lydiard waved away the conclusion of the sentence with her hand never mind the surgeon we must find somebody else where did you go next  to your ladyships lawyer mr troy wished me to say that he will have the honor of waiting on you  pass over the lawyer moody i want to know about the painters widow is it true that mrs tollmidge and her family are left in helpless poverty  not quite true my lady i have seen the clergyman of the parish who takes an interest in the case  lady lydiard interrupted her steward for the third time did you mention my name she asked sharply  certainly not my lady i followed my instructions and described you as a benevolent person in search of cases of real distress it is quite true that mr tollmidge has died leaving nothing to his family but the widow has a little income of seventy pounds in her own right  is that enough to live on moody her ladyship asked  enough in this case for the widow and her daughter moody answered the difficulty is to pay the few debts left standing and to start the two sons in life they are reported to be steady lads and the family is much respected in the neighborhood the clergyman proposes to get a few influential names to begin with and to start a subscription  no subscription protested lady lydiard mr tollmidge was lord lydiards cousin and mrs tollmidge is related to his lordship by marriage it would be degrading to my husbands memory to have the beggingbox sent round for his relations no matter how distant they may be cousins exclaimed her ladyship suddenly descending from the lofty ranges of sentiment to the low i hate the very name of them a person who is near enough to me to be my relation and far enough off from me to be my sweetheart is a doublefaced sort of person that i dont like lets get back to the widow and her sons how much do they want  a subscription of five hundred pounds my lady would provide for everythingif it could only be collected  it shall be collected moody i will pay the subscription out of my own purse having asserted herself in those noble terms she spoilt the effect of her own outburst of generosity by dropping to the sordid view of the subject in her next sentence five hundred pounds is a good bit of money though isnt it moody  it is indeed my lady rich and generous as he knew his mistress to be her proposal to pay the whole subscription took the steward by surprise lady lydiards quick perception instantly detected what was passing in his mind  you dont quite understand my position in this matter she said when i read the newspaper notice of mr tollmidges death i searched among his lordships papers to see if they really were related i discovered some letters from mr tollmidge which showed me that he and lord lydiard were cousins one of those letters contains some very painful statements reflecting most untruly and unjustly on my conduct lies in short her ladyship burst out losing her dignity as usual lies moody for which mr tollmidge deserved to be horsewhipped i would have done it myself if his lordship had told me at the time no matter its useless to dwell on the thing now she continued ascending again to the forms of expression which became a lady of rank this unhappy man has done me a gross injustice my motives may be seriously misjudged if i appear personally in communicating with his family if i relieve them anonymously in their present trouble i spare them the exposure of a public subscription and i do what i believe his lordship would have done himself if he had lived my desk is on the other table bring it here moody and let me return good for evil while im in the humor for it  moody obeyed in silence lady lydiard wrote a check  take that to the bankers and bring back a fivehundred pound note she said ill inclose it to the clergyman as coming from an unknown friend and be quick about it i am only a fallible mortal moody dont leave me time enough to take the stingy view of five hundred pounds  moody went out with the check no delay was to be apprehended in obtaining the money the bankinghouse was hard by in st jamess street left alone lady lydiard decided on occupying her mind in the generous direction by composing her anonymous letter to the clergyman she had just taken a sheet of notepaper from her desk when a servant appeared at the door announcing a visitor  mr felix sweetsir     chapter iii  my nephew lady lydiard exclaimed in a tone which expressed astonishment but certainly not pleasure as well how many years is it since you and i last met she asked in her abruptly straightforward way as mr felix sweetsir approached her writingtable  the visitor was not a person easily discouraged he took lady lydiards hand and kissed it with easy grace a shade of irony was in his manner agreeably relieved by a playful flash of tenderness  years my dear aunt he said look in your glass and you will see that time has stood still since we met last how wonderfully well you wear when shall we celebrate the appearance of your first wrinkle i am too old i shall never live to see it  he took an easychair uninvited placed himself close at his aunts side and ran his eye over her illchosen dress with an air of satirical admiration how perfectly successful he said with his wellbred insolence what a chaste gayety of color  what do you want asked her ladyship not in the least softened by the compliment  i want to pay my respects to my dear aunt felix answered perfectly impenetrable to his ungracious reception and perfectly comfortable in a spacious armchair  no penandink portrait need surely be drawn of felix sweetsirhe is too wellknown a picture in society the little lith e man with his bright restless eyes and his long irongray hair falling in curls to his shoulders his airy step and his cordial manner his uncertain age his innumerable accomplishments and his unbounded popularityis he not familiar everywhere and welcome everywhere how gratefully he receives how prodigally he repays the cordial appreciation of an admiring world every man he knows is a charming fellow every woman he sees is sweetly pretty what picnics he gives on the banks of the thames in the summer season what a wellearned little income he derives from the whisttable what an inestimable actor he is at private theatricals of all sorts weddings included did you never read sweetsirs novel dashed off in the intervals of curative perspiration at a german bath then you dont know what brilliant fiction really is he has never written a second work he does everything and only does it once one songthe despair of professional composers one picturejust to show how easily a gentleman can take up an art and drop it again a really multiform man with all the graces and all the accomplishments scintillating perpetually at his fingers ends if these poor pages have achieved nothing else they have done a service to persons not in society by presenting them to sweetsir in his gracious company the narrative brightens and writer and reader catching reflected brilliancy understand each other at last thanks to sweetsir  well said lady lydiard now you are here what have you got to say for yourself you have been abroad of course where  principally at paris my dear aunt the only place that is fit to live infor this excellent reason that the french are the only people who know how to make the most of life one has relations and friends in england and every now and then one returns to london  when one has spent all ones money in paris her ladyship interposed thats what you were going to say isnt it  felix submitted to the interruption with his delightful goodhumor  what a bright creature you are he exclaimed what would i not give for your flow of spirits yesone does spend money in paris as you say the clubs the stock exchange the racecourse you try your luck here there and everywhere and you lose and win win and loseand you havent a dull day to complain of he paused his smile died away he looked inquiringly at lady lydiard what a wonderful existence yours must be he resumed the everlasting question with your needy fellowcreatures where am i to get money is a question that has never passed your lips enviable woman he paused once moresurprised and puzzled this time what is the matter my dear aunt you seem to be suffering under some uneasiness  i am suffering under your conversation her ladyship answered sharply money is a sore subject with me just now she went on with her eyes on her nephew watching the effect of what she said i have spent five hundred pounds this morning with a scrape of my pen and only a week since i yielded to temptation and made an addition to my picturegallery she looked as she said those words towards an archway at the further end of the room closed by curtains of purple velvet i really tremble when i think of what that one picture cost me before i could call it mine a landscape by hobbema and the national gallery bidding against me never mind she concluded consoling herself as usual with considerations that were beneath her hobbema will sell at my death for a bigger price than i gave for himthats one comfort she looked again at felix a smile of mischievous satisfaction began to show itself in her face anything wrong with your watchchain she asked  felix absently playing with his watchchain started as if his aunt had suddenly awakened him while lady lydiard had been speaking his vivacity had subsided little by little and had left him looking so serious and so old that his most intimate friend would hardly have known him again roused by the sudden question that had been put to him he seemed to be casting about in his mind in search of the first excuse for his silence that might turn up  i was wondering he began why i miss something when i look round this beautiful room something familiar you know that i fully expected to find here  tommie suggested lady lydiard still watching her nephew as maliciously as ever  thats it cried felix seizing his excuse and rallying his spirits why dont i hear tommie snarling behind me why dont i feel tommies teeth in my trousers  the smile vanished from lady lydiards face the tone taken by her nephew in speaking of her dog was disrespectful in the extreme she showed him plainly that she disapproved of it felix went on nevertheless impenetrable to reproof of the silent sort dear little tommie so delightfully fat and such an infernal temper i dont know whether i hate him or love him where is he  ill in bed answered her ladyship with a gravity which startled even felix himself i wish to speak to you about tommie you know everybody do you know of a good dogdoctor the person i have employed so far doesnt at all satisfy me  professional person inquired felix  yes  all humbugs my dear aunt the worse the dog gets the bigger the bill grows dont you see i have got the man for youa gentleman knows more about horses and dogs than all the veterinary surgeons put together we met in the boat yesterday crossing the channel you know him by name of course lord rotherfields youngest son alfred hardyman  the owner of the stud farm the man who has bred the famous racehorses cried lady lydiard my dear felix how can i presume to trouble such a great personage about my dog  felix burst into his genial laugh never was modesty more woefully out of place he rejoined hardyman is dying to be presented to your ladyship he has heard like everybody of the magnificent decorations of this house and he is longing to see them his chambers are close by in pall mall if he is at home we will have him here in five minutes perhaps i had better see the dog first  lady lydiard shook her head isabel says he had better not be disturbed she answered isabel understands him better than anybody  felix lifted his lively eyebrows with a mixed expression of curiosity and surprise who is isabel  lady lydiard was vexed with herself for carelessly mentioning isabels name in her nephews presence felix was not the sort of person whom she was desirous of admitting to her confidence in domestic matters isabel is an addition to my household since you were here last she answered shortly  young and pretty inquired felix ah you look serious and you dont answer me young and pretty evidently which may i see first the addition to your household or the addition to your picturegallery you look at the picturegalleryi am answered again he rose to approach the archway and stopped at his first step forward a sweet girl is a dreadful responsibility aunt he resumed with an ironical assumption of gravity do you know i shouldnt be surprised if isabel in the long run cost you more than hobbema who is this at the door  the person at the door was robert moody returned from the bank mr felix sweetsir being nearsighted was obliged to fit his eyeglass in position before he could recognize the prime minister of lady lydiards household  ha our worthy moody how well he wears not a gray hair on his headand look at mine what dye do you use moody if he had my open disposition he would tell as it is he looks unutterable things and holds his tongue ah if i could only have held my tonguewhen i was in the diplomatic service you knowwhat a position i might have occupied by this time dont let me interrupt you moody if you have anything to say to lady lydiard  having acknowledged mr sweetsirs lively greeting by a formal bow and a grave look of wonder which respectfully repelled that vivacious gentlemans flow of humor moody turned towards his mistress  have you got the banknote asked her ladyship  moody laid the banknote on the table  am i in the way inquired felix  no said his aunt i have a letter to write it wont occupy me for more than a few minutes you can stay here or go and look at the hobbema which you please  felix made a second sauntering attempt to reach the picturegallery arrived within a few steps of the entrance he stopped again attracted by an open cabinet of italian workmanship filled with rare old china being nothing if not a cultivated amateur mr sweetsir paused to pay his passing tribute of admiration before the contents of the cabinet charming charming he said to himself with his head twisted appreciatively a little on one side lady lydiard and moody left him in undisturbed enjoyment of the china and went on with the business of the banknote  ought we to take the number of the note in case of accident asked her ladyship  moody produced a slip of paper from his waistcoat pocket i took the number my lady at the bank  very well you keep it while i am writing my letter suppose you direct the envelope what is the clergymans name  moody mentioned the name and directed the envelope felix happening to look round at lady lydiard and the steward while they were both engaged in writing returned suddenly to the table as if he had been struck by a new idea  is there a third pen he asked why shouldnt i write a line at once to hardyman aunt the sooner you have his opinion about tommie the betterdont you think so  lady lydiard pointed to the pen tray with a smile to show consideration for her dog was to seize irresistibly on the highroad to her favor felix set to work on his letter in a large scrambling handwriting with plenty of ink and a noisy pen i declare we are like clerks in an office he remarked in his cheery way all with our noses to the paper writing as if we lived by it here moody let one of the servants take this at once to mr hardymans  the messenger was despatched robert returned and waited near his mistress with the directed envelope in his hand felix sauntered back slowly towards the picturegallery for the third time in a moment more lady lydiard finished her letter and folded up the banknote in it she had just taken the directed envelope from moody and had just placed the letter inside it when a scream from the inner room in which isabel was nursing the sick dog startled everybody my lady my lady cried the girl distractedly tommie is in a fit tommie is dying  lady lydiard dropped the unclosed envelope on the table and ranyes short as she was and fat as she was raninto the inner room the two men left together looked at each other  moody said felix in his lazilycynical way do you think if you or i were in a fit that her ladyship would run bah these are the things that shake ones faith in human nature i feel infernally seedy that cursed channel passagei tremble in my inmost stomach when i think of it get me something moody  what shall i send you sir moody asked coldly  some dry curacoa and a biscuit and let it be brought to me in the picturegallery damn the dog ill go and look at hobbema  this time he succeeded in reaching the archway and disappeared behind the curtains of the picturegallery     chapter iv  left alone in the drawingroom moody looked at the unfastened envelope on the table  considering the value of the inclosure might he feel justified in wetting the gum and securing the envelope for safetys sake after thinking it over moody decided that he was not justified in meddling with the letter on reflection her ladyship might have changes to make in it or might have a postscript to add to what she had already written apart too from these considerations was it reasonable to act as if lady lydiards house was a hotel perpetually open to the intrusion of strangers objects worth twice five hundred pounds in the aggregate were scattered about on the tables and in the unlocked cabinets all round him moody withdrew without further hesitation to order the light restorative prescribed for himself by mr sweetsir  the footman who took the curacoa into the picture gallery found felix recumbent on a sofa admiring the famous hobbema  dont interrupt me he said peevishly catching the servant in the act of staring at him put down the bottle and go forbidden to look at mr sweetsir the mans eyes as he left the gallery turned wonderingly towards the famous landscape and what did he see he saw one towering big cloud in the sky that threatened rain two withered mahoganycolored trees sorely in want of rain a muddy road greatly the worse for rain and a vagabond boy running home who was afraid of the rain that was the picture to the footmans eye he took a gloomy view of the state of mr sweetsirs brains on his return to the servants hall a slate loose poor devil that was the footmans report of the brilliant felix  immediately on the servants departure the silence in the picturegallery was broken by voices penetrating into it from the drawingroom felix rose to a sitting position on the sofa he had recognized the voice of alfred hardyman saying dont disturb lady lydiard and the voice of moody answering i will just knock at the door of her ladyships room sir you will find mr sweetsir in the picturegallery  the curtains over the archway parted and disclosed the figure of a tall man with a closely cropped head set a little stiffly on his shoulders the immovable gravity of face and manner which every englishman seems to acquire who lives constantly in the society of horses was the gravity which this gentleman displayed as he entered the picturegallery he was a finely made sinewy man with clearly cut regular features if he had not been affected with horses on the brain he would doubtless have been personally popular with the women as it was the serene and hippic gloom of the handsome horsebreeder daunted the daughters of eve and they failed to make up their minds about the exact value of him socially considered alfred hardyman was nevertheless a remarkable man in his way he had been offered the customary alternatives submitted to the younger sons of the nobilitythe church or the diplomatic serviceand had refused the one and the other i like horses he said and i mean to get my living out of them dont talk to me about my position in the world talk to my eldest brother who gets the money and the title starting in life with these sensible views and with a small capital of five thousand pounds hardyman took his own place in the sphere that was fitted for him at the period of this narrative he was already a rich man and one of the greatest authorities on horsebreeding in england his prosperity made no change in him he was always the same grave quiet obstinately resolute mantrue to the few friends whom he admitted to his intimacy and sincere to a fault in the expression of his feelings among persons whom he distrusted or disliked as he entered the picturegallery and paused for a moment looking at felix on the sofa his large cold steady gray eyes rested on the little man with an indifference that just verged on contempt felix on the other hand sprang to his feet with alert politeness and greeted his friend with exuberant cordiality  dear old boy this is so good of you he began i feel iti do assure you i feel it  you neednt trouble yourself to feel it was the quietlyungracious answer lady lydiard brings me here i come to see the houseand the dog he looked round the gallery in his gravely attentive way i dont understand pictures he remarked resignedly i shall go back to the drawingroom  after a moments consideration felix followed him into the drawingroom with the air of a man who was determined not to be repelled  well asked hardyman what is it  about that matter felix said inquiringly  what matter  oh you know will next week do  next week wont do  mr felix sweetsir cast one look at his friend his friend was too intently occupied with the decorations of the drawingroom to notice the look  will tomorrow do felix resumed after an interval  yes  at what time  between twelve and one in the afternoon  between twelve and one in the afternoon felix repeated he looked again at hardyman and took his hat make my apologies to my aunt he said you must introduce yourself to her ladyship i cant wait here any longer he walked out of the room having deliberately returned the contemptuous indifference of hardyman by a similar indifference on his own side at parting  left by himself hardyman took a chair and glanced at the door which led into the boudoir the steward had knocked at that door had disappeared through it and had not appeared again how much longer was lady lydiards visitor to be left unnoticed in lady lydiards house  as the question passed through his mind the boudoir door opened for once in his life alfred hardymans composure deserted him he started to his feet like an ordinary mortal taken completely by surprise  instead of mr moody instead of lady lydiard there appeared in the open doorway a young woman in a state of embarrassment who actually quickened the beat of mr hardymans heart the moment he set eyes on her was the person who produced this amazing impression at first sight a person of importance nothing of the sort she was only isabel surnamed miller even her name had nothing in it only isabel miller  had she any pretensions to distinction in virtue of her personal appearance  it is not easy to answer the question the women let us put the worst judges first had long since discovered that she wanted that indispensable elegance of figure which is derived from slimness of waist and length of limb the men who were better acquainted with the subject looked at her figure from their point of view and finding it essentially embraceable asked for nothing more it might have been her bright complexion or it might have been the bold luster of her eyes as the women considered it that dazzled the lords of creation generally and made them all alike incompetent to discover her faults still she had compensating attractions which no severity of criticism could dispute her smile beginning at her lips flowed brightly and instantly over her whole face a delicious atmosphere of health freshness and good humor seemed to radiate from her wherever she went and whatever she did for the rest her brown hair grew low over her broad white forehead and was topped by a neat little lace cap with ribbons of a violet color a plain collar and plain cuffs encircled her smooth round neck and her plump dimpled hands her merino dress covering but not hiding the charming outline of her bosom matched the color of the capribbons and was brightened by a white muslin apron coquettishly trimmed about the pockets a gift from lady lydiard blushing and smiling she let the door fall to behind her and shyly approaching the stranger said to him in her small clear voice if you please sir are you mr hardyman  the gravity of the great horsebreeder deserted him at her first question he smiled as he acknowledged that he was mr hardymanhe smiled as he offered her a chair  no thank you sir she said with a quaintly pretty inclination of her head i am only sent here to make her ladyships apologies she has put the poor dear dog into a warm bath and she cant leave him and mr moody cant come instead of me because i was too frightened to be of any use and so he had to hold the dog thats all we are very anxious sir to know if the warm bath is the right thing please come into the room and tell us  she led the way back to the door hardyman naturally enough was slow to follow her when a man is fascinated by the charm of youth and beauty he is in no hurry to transfer his attention to a sick animal in a bath hardyman seized on the first excuse that he could devise for keeping isabel to himselfthat is to say for keeping her in the drawingroom  i think i shall be better able to help you he said if you will tell me something about the dog first  even his accent in speaking had altered to a certain degree the quiet dreary monotone in which he habitually spoke quickened a little under his present excitement as for isabel she was too deeply interested in tommies welfare to suspect that she was being made the victim of a stratagem she left the door and returned to hardyman with eager eyes what can i tell you sir she asked innocently  hardyman pressed his advantage without mercy  you can tell me what sort of dog he is  yes sir  how old he is  yes sir  what his name iswhat his temper iswhat his illness is what diseases his father and mother hadwhat  isabels head began to turn giddy one thing at a time sir she interposed with a gesture of entreaty the dog sleeps on my bed and i had a bad night with him he disturbed me so and i am afraid i am very stupid this morning his name is tommie we are obliged to call him by it because he wont answer to any other than the name he had when my lady bought him but we spell it with an i e at the end which makes it less vulgar than tommy with a y i am very sorry siri forget what else you wanted to know please to come in here and my lady will tell you everything  she tried to get back to the door of the boudoir hardyman feasting his eyes on the pretty changeful face that looked up at him with such innocent confidence in his authority drew her away from the door by the one means at his disposal he returned to his questions about tommie  wait a little please what sort of dog is he  isabel turned back again from the door to describe tommie was a labor of love he is the most beautiful dog in the world the girl began with kindling eyes he has the most exquisite white curly hair and two light brown patches on his backand oh such lovely dark eyes they call him a scotch terrier when he is well his appetite is truly wonderfulnothing comes amiss to him sir from pate de foie gras to potatoes he has his enemies poor dear though you wouldnt think it people who wont put up with being bitten by him what shocking tempers one does meet with to be sure call him a mongrel isnt it a shame please come in and see him sir my lady will be tired of waiting  another journey to the door followed those words checked instantly by a serious objection  stop a minute you must tell me what his temper is or i can do nothing for him  isabel returned once more feeling that it was really serious this time her gravity was even more charming than her gayety as she lifted her face to him with large solemn eyes expressive of her sense of responsibility hardyman would have given every horse in his stables to have had the privilege of taking her in his arms and kissing her  tommie has the temper of an angel with the people he likes she said when he bites it generally means that he objects to strangers he loves my lady and he loves mr moody and he loves me andand i think thats all this way sir if you please i am sure i heard my lady call  no said hardyman in his immovably obstinate way nobody called about this dogs temper doesnt he take to any strangers what sort of people does he bite in general  isabels pretty lips began to curl upward at the corners in a quaint smile hardymans last imbecile question had opened her eyes to the true state of the case still tommies future was in this strange gentlemans hands she felt bound to consider that and moreover it was no everyday event in isabels experience to fascinate a famous personage who was also a magnificent and perfectly dressed man she ran the risk of wasting another minute or two and went on with the memoirs of tommie  i must own sir she resumed that he behaves a little ungratefullyeven to strangers who take an interest in him when he gets lost in the streets which is very often he sits down on the pavement and howls till he collects a pitying crowd round him and when they try to read his name and address on his collar he snaps at them the servants generally find him and bring him back and as soon as he gets home he turns round on the doorstep and snaps at the servants i think it must be his fun you should see him sitting up in his chair at dinnertime waiting to be helped with his fore paws on the edge of the table like the hands of a gentleman at a public dinner making a speech but oh cried isabel checking herself with the tears in her eyes how can i talk of him in this way when he is so dreadfully ill some of them say its bronchitis and some say its his liver only yesterday i took him to the front door to give him a little air and he stood still on the pavement quite stupefied for the first time in his life he snapped at nobody who went by and oh dear he hadnt even the heart to smell a lamppost  isabel had barely stated this last afflicting circumstance when the memoirs of tommie were suddenly cut short by the voice of lady lydiardreally calling this timefrom the inner room  isabel isabel cried her ladyship what are you about  isabel ran to the door of the boudoir and threw it open go in sir pray go in she said  without you hardyman asked  i will follow you sir i have something to do for her ladyship first  she still held the door open and pointed entreatingly to the passage which led to the boudoir i shall be blamed sir she said if you dont go in  this statement of the case left hardyman no alternative he presented himself to lady lydiard without another moment of delay  having closed the drawingroom door on him isabel waited a little absorbed in her own thoughts  she was now perfectly well aware of the effect which she had produced on hardyman her vanity it is not to be denied was flattered by his admirationhe was so grand and so tall and he had such fine large eyes the girl looked prettier than ever as she stood with her head down and her color heightened smiling to herself a clock on the chimneypiece striking the halfhour roused her she cast one look at the glass as she passed it and went to the table at which lady lydiard had been writing  methodical mr moody in submitting to be employed as bathattendant upon tommie had not forgotten the interests of his mistress he reminded her ladyship that she had left her letter with a banknote inclosed in it unsealed absorbed in the dog lady lydiard answered isabel is doing nothing let isabel seal it show mr hardyman in here she continued turning to isabel and then seal a letter of mine which you will find on the table and when you have sealed it careful mr moody added put it back on the table i will take charge of it when her ladyship has done with me  such were the special instructions which now detained isabel in the drawingroom she lighted the taper and closed and sealed the open envelope without feeling curiosity enough even to look at the address mr hardyman was the uppermost subject in her thoughts leaving the sealed letter on the table she returned to the fireplace and studied her own charming face attentively in the lookingglass the time passedand isabels reflection was still the subject of isabels contemplation he must see many beautiful ladies she thought veering backward and forward between pride and humility i wonder what he sees in me  the clock struck the hour almost at the same moment the boudoirdoor opened and robert moody released at last from attendance on tommie entered the drawingroom     chapter v  well asked isabel eagerly what does mr hardyman say does he think he can cure tommie  moody answered a little coldly and stiffly his dark deeplyset eyes rested on isabel with an uneasy look  mr hardyman seems to understand animals he said he lifted the dogs eyelid and looked at his eyes and then he told us the bath was useless  go on said isabel impatiently he did something i suppose besides telling you that the bath was useless  he took a knife out of his pocket with a lancet in it  isabel clasped her hands with a faint cry of horror oh mr moody did he hurt tommie  hurt him moody repeated indignant at the interest which she felt in the animal and the indifference which she exhibited towards the man as represented by himself hurt him indeed mr hardyman bled the brute  brute isabel reiterated with flashing eyes i know some people mr moody who really deserve to be called by that horrid word if you cant say tommie when you speak of him in my presence be so good as to say the dog  moody yielded with the worst possible grace oh very well mr hardyman bled the dog and brought him to his senses directly i am charged to tell you he stopped as if the message which he was instructed to deliver was in the last degree distasteful to him  well what were you charged to tell me  i was to say that mr hardyman will give you instructions how to treat the dog for the future  isabel hastened to the door eager to receive her instructions moody stopped her before she could open it  you are in a great hurry to get to mr hardyman he remarked  isabel looked back at him in surprise you said just now that mr hardyman was waiting to tell me how to nurse tommie  let him wait moody rejoined sternly when i left him he was sufficiently occupied in expressing his favorable opinion of you to her ladyship  the stewards pale face turned paler still as he said those words with the arrival of isabel in lady lydiards house his time had comeexactly as the women in the servants hall had predicted at last the impenetrable man felt the influence of the sex at last he knew the passion of love misplaced illstarred hopeless love for a woman who was young enough to be his child he had already spoken to isabel more than once in terms which told his secret plainly enough but the smouldering fire of jealousy in the man fanned into flame by hardyman now showed itself for the first time his looks even more than his words would have warned a woman with any knowledge of the natures of men to be careful how she answered him young giddy and inexperienced isabel followed the flippant impulse of the moment without a thought of the consequences im sure its very kind of mr hardyman to speak favorably of me she said with a pert little laugh i hope you are not jealous of him mr moody  moody was in no humor to make allowances for the unbridled gayety of youth and good spirits  i hate any man who admires you he burst out passionately let him be who he may  isabel looked at her strange lover with unaffected astonishment how unlike mr hardyman who had treated her as a lady from first to last what an odd man you are she said you cant take a joke im sure i didnt mean to offend you  you dont offend meyou do worse you distress me  isabels color began to rise the merriment died out of her face she looked at moody gravely i dont like to be accused of distressing people when i dont deserve it she said i had better leave you let me by if you please  having committed one error in offending her moody committed another in attempting to make his peace with her acting under the fear that she would really leave him he took her roughly by the arm  you are always trying to get away from me he said i wish i knew how to make you like me isabel  i dont allow you to call me isabel she retorted struggling to free herself from his hold let go of my arm you hurt me  moody dropped her arm with a bitter sigh i dont know how to deal with you he said simply have some pity on me  if the steward had known anything of women at isabels age he would never have appealed to her mercy in those plain terms and at the unpropitious moment pity you she repeated contemptuously is that all you have to say to me after hurting my arm what a bear you are she shrugged her shoulders and put her hands coquettishly into the pockets of her apron that was how she pitied him his face turned paler and palerhe writhed under it  for gods sake dont turn everything i say to you into ridicule he cried you know i love you with all my heart and soul again and again i have asked you to be my wifeand you laugh at me as if it was a joke i havent deserved to be treated in that cruel way it maddens mei cant endure it  isabel looked down on the floor and followed the lines in the pattern of the carpet with the end of her smart little shoe she could hardly have been further away from really understanding moody if he had spoken in hebrew she was partly startled partly puzzled by the strong emotions which she had unconsciously called into being oh dear me she said why cant you talk of something else why cant we be friends excuse me for mentioning it she went on looking up at him with a saucy smile you are old enough to be my father  moodys head sank on his breast i own it he answered humbly but there is something to be said for me men as old as i am have made good husbands before now i would devote my whole life to make you happy there isnt a wish you could form which i wouldnt be proud to obey you must not reckon me by years my youth has not been wasted in a profligate life i can be truer to you and fonder of you than many a younger man surely my heart is not quite unworthy of you when it is all yours i have lived such a lonely miserable lifeand you might so easily brighten it you are kind to everybody else isabel tell me dear why are you so hard on me  his voice trembled as he appealed to her in those simple words he had taken the right way at last to produce an impression on her she really felt for him all that was true and tender in her nature began to rise in her and take his part unhappily he felt too deeply and too strongly to be patient and give her time he completely misinterpreted her silencecompletely mistook the motive that made her turn aside for a moment to gather composure enough to speak to him ah he burst out bitterly turning away on his side you have no heart  she instantly resented those unjust words at that moment they wounded her to the quick  you know best she said i have no doubt you are right remember one thing however that though i have no heart i have never encouraged you mr moody i have declared over and over again that i could only be your friend understand that for the future if you please there are plenty of nice women who will be glad to marry you i have no doubt you will always have my best wishes for your welfare goodmorning her ladyship will wonder what has become of me be so kind as to let me pass  tortured by the passion that consumed him moody obstinately kept his place between isabel and the door the unworthy suspicion of her which had been in his mind all through the interview now forced its way outwards to expression at last  no woman ever used a man as you use me without some reason for it he said you have kept your secret wonderfully wellbut sooner or later all secrets get found out i know what is in your mind as well as you know it yourself you are in love with some other man  isabels face flushed deeply the defensive pride of her sex was up in arms in an instant she cast one disdainful look at moody without troubling herself to express her contempt in words stand out of my way sirthat was all she said to him  you are in love with some other man he reiterated passionately deny it if you can  deny it she repeated with flashing eyes what right have you to ask the question am i not free to do as i please  he stood looking at her meditating his next words with a sudden and sinister change to selfrestraint suppressed rage was in his rigidly set eyes suppressed rage was in his trembling hand as he raised it emphatically while he spoke his next words  i have one thing more to say he answered and then i have done if i am not your husband no other man shall be look well to it isabel miller if there is another man between us i can tell him thishe shall find it no easy matter to rob me of you  she started and turned palebut it was only for a moment the high spirit that was in her rose brightly in her eyes and faced him without shrinking  threats she said with quiet contempt when you make love mr moody you take strange ways of doing it my conscience is easy you may try to frighten me but you will not succeed when you have recovered your temper i will accept your excuses she paused and pointed to the table there is the letter that you told me to leave for you when i had sealed it she went on i suppose you have her ladyships orders isnt it time you began to think of obeying them  the contemptuous composure of her tone and manner seemed to act on moody with crushing effect without a word of answer the unfortunate steward took up the letter from the table without a word of answer he walked mechanically to the great door which opened on the staircaseturned on the threshold to look at isabelwaited a moment pale and stilland suddenly left the room  that silent departure that hopeless submission impressed isabel in spite of herself the sustaining sense of injury and insult sank as it were from under her the moment she was alone he had not been gone a minute before she began to be sorry for him once more the interview had taught her nothing she was neither old enough nor experienced enough to understand the overwhelming revolution produced in a mans character when he feels the passion of love for the first time in the maturity of his life if moody had stolen a kiss at the first opportunity she would have resented the liberty he had taken with her but she would have thoroughly understood him his terrible earnestness his overpowering agitation his abrupt violenceall these evidences of a passion that was a mystery to himselfsimply puzzled her im sure i didnt wish to hurt his feelings such was the form that her reflections took in her present penitent frame of mind but why did he provoke me it is a shame to tell me that i love some other manwhen there is no other man i declare i begin to hate the men if they are all like mr moody i wonder whether he will forgive me when he sees me again im sure im willing to forget and forgive on my sideespecially if he wont insist on my being fond of him because he is fond of me oh dear i wish he would come back and shake hands its enough to try the patience of a saint to be treated in this way i wish i was ugly the ugly ones have a quiet time of itthe men let them be mr moody mr moody she went out to the landing and called to him softly there was no answer he was no longer in the house she stood still for a moment in silent vexation ill go to tommie she decided im sure hes the more agreeable company of the two andoh good gracious theres mr hardyman waiting to give me my instructions how do i look i wonder  she consulted the glass once moregave one or two corrective touches to her hair and her capand hastened into the boudoir     chapter vi  for a quarter of an hour the drawingroom remained empty at the end of that time the council in the boudoir broke up lady lydiard led the way back into the drawingroom followed by hardyman isabel being left to look after the dog before the door closed behind him hardyman turned round to reiterate his last medical directionsor in plainer words to take a last look at isabel  plenty of water miss isabel for the dog to lap and a little bread or biscuit if he wants something to eat nothing more if you please till i see him tomorrow  thank you sir i will take the greatest care  at that point lady lydiard cut short the interchange of instructions and civilities shut the door if you please mr hardyman i feel the draught many thanks i am really at a loss to tell you how gratefully i feel your kindness but for you my poor little dog might be dead by this time  hardyman answered in the quiet melancholy monotone which was habitual with him your ladyship need feel no further anxiety about the dog only be careful not to overfeed him he will do very well under miss isabels care by the bye her family name is milleris it not is she related to the warwickshire millers of duxborough house  lady lydiard looked at him with an expression of satirical surprise mr hardyman she said this makes the fourth time you have questioned me about isabel you seem to take a great interest in my little companion dont make any apologies pray you pay isabel a compliment and as i am very fond of her i am naturally gratified when i find her admired at the same time she added with one of her abrupt transitions of language i had my eye on you and i had my eye on her when you were talking in the next room and i dont mean to let you make a fool of the girl she is not in your line of life and the sooner you know it the better you make me laugh when you ask if she is related to gentlefolks she is the orphan daughter of a chemist in the country her relations havent a penny to bless themselves with except an old aunt who lives in a village on two or three hundred a year i heard of the girl by accident when she lost her father and mother her aunt offered to take her isabel said no thank you i will not be a burden on a relation who has only enough for herself a girl can earn an honest living if she tries and i mean to trythats what she said i admired her independence her ladyship proceeded ascending again to the higher regions of thought and expression my nieces marriage just at that time had left me alone in this great house i proposed to isabel to come to me as companion and reader for a few weeks and to decide for herself whether she liked the life or not we have never been separated since that time i could hardly be fonder of her if she were my own daughter and she returns my affection with all her heart she has excellent qualitiesprudent cheerful sweettempered with good sense enough to understand what her place is in the world as distinguished from her place in my regard i have taken care for her own sake never to leave that part of the question in any doubt it would be cruel kindness to deceive her as to her future position when she marries i shall take good care that the man who pays his addresses to her is a man in her rank of life i know but too well in the case of one of my own relatives what miseries unequal marriages bring with them excuse me for troubling you at this length on domestic matters i am very fond of isabel and a girls head is so easily turned now you know what her position really is you will also know what limits there must be to the expression of your interest in her i am sure we understand each other and i say no more  hardyman listened to this long harangue with the immovable gravity which was part of his characterexcept when isabel had taken him by surprise when her ladyship gave him the opportunity of speaking on his side he had very little to say and that little did not suggest that he had greatly profited by what he had heard his mind had been full of isabel when lady lydiard began and it remained just as full of her in just the same way when lady lydiard had done  yes he remarked quietly miss isabel is an uncommonly nice girl as you say very pretty and such frank unaffected manners i dont deny that i feel an interest in her the young ladies one meets in society are not much to my taste miss isabel is my taste  lady lydiards face assumed a look of blank dismay i am afraid i have failed to convey my exact meaning to you she said  hardyman gravely declared that he understood her perfectly perfectly he repeated with his impenetrable obstinacy your ladyship exactly expresses my opinion of miss isabel prudent and cheerful and sweettempered as you sayall the qualities in a woman that i admire with good looks tooof course with good looks she will be a perfect treasure as you remarked just now to the man who marries her i may claim to know something about it i have twice narrowly escaped being married myself and though i cant exactly explain it im all the harder to please in consequence miss isabel pleases me i think i have said that before pardon me for saying it again ill call again tomorrow morning and look at the dog as early as eleven oclock if you will allow me later in the day i must be off to france to attend a sale of horses glad to have been of any use to your ladyship i am sure goodmorning  lady lydiard let him go wisely resigning any further attempt to establish an understanding between her visitor and herself  he is either a person of very limited intelligence when he is away from his stables she thought or he deliberately declines to take a plain hint when it is given to him i cant drop his acquaintance on tommies account the only other alternative is to keep isabel out of his way my good little girl shall not drift into a false position while i am living to look after her when mr hardyman calls tomorrow she shall be out on an errand when he calls the next time she shall be upstairs with a headache and if he tries it again she shall be away at my house in the country if he makes any remarks on her absencewell he will find that i can be just as dull of understanding as he is when the occasion calls for it  having arrived at this satisfactory solution of the difficulty lady lydiard became conscious of an irresistible impulse to summon isabel to her presence and caress her in the nature of a warmhearted woman this was only the inevitable reaction which followed the subsidence of anxiety about the girl after her own resolution had set that anxiety at rest she threw open the door and made one of her sudden appearances at the boudoir even in the fervent outpouring of her affection there was still the inherent abruptness of manner which so strongly marked lady lydiards character in all the relations of life  did i give you a kiss this morning she asked when isabel rose to receive her  yes my lady said the girl with her charming smile  come then and give me a kiss in return do you love me very well then treat me like your mother never mind my lady this time give me a good hug  something in those homely words or something perhaps in the look that accompanied them touched sympathies in isabel which seldom showed themselves on the surface her smiling lips trembled the bright tears rose in her eyes you are too good to me she murmured with her head on lady lydiards bosom how can i ever love you enough in return  lady lydiard patted the pretty head that rested on her with such filial tenderness there there she said go back and play with tommie my dear we may be as fond of each other as we like but we mustnt cry god bless you go awaygo away  she turned aside quickly her own eyes were moistening and it was part of her character to be reluctant to let isabel see it why have i made a fool of myself she wondered as she approached the drawingroom door it doesnt matter i am all the better for it odd that mr hardyman should have made me feel fonder of isabel than ever  with those reflections she reentered the drawingroomand suddenly checked herself with a start good heavens she exclaimed irritably how you frightened me why was i not told you were here  having left the drawingroom in a state of solitude lady lydiard on her return found herself suddenly confronted with a gentleman mysteriously planted on the hearthrug in her absence the new visitor may be rightly described as a gray man he had gray hair eyebrows and whiskers he wore a gray coat waistcoat and trousers and gray gloves for the rest his appearance was eminently suggestive of wealth and respectability and in this case appearances were really to be trusted the gray man was no other than lady lydiards legal adviser mr troy  i regret my lady that i should have been so unfortunate as to startle you he said with a certain underlying embarrassment in his manner i had the honor of sending word by mr moody that i would call at this hour on some matters of business connected with your ladyships house property i presumed that you expected to find me here waiting your pleasure  thus far lady lydiard had listened to her legal adviser fixing her eyes on his face in her usually frank straightforward way she now stopped him in the middle of a sentence with a change of expression in her own face which was undisguisedly a change to alarm  dont apologize mr troy she said i am to blame for forgetting your appointment and for not keeping my nerves under proper control she paused for a moment and took a seat before she said her next words may i ask she resumed if there is something unpleasant in the business that brings you here  nothing whatever my lady mere formalities which can wait till tomorrow or next day if you wish it  lady lydiards fingers drummed impatiently on the table you have known me long enough mr troy to know that i cannot endure suspense you have something unpleasant to tell me  the lawyer respectfully remonstrated really lady lydiard he began  it wont do mr troy i know how you look at me on ordinary occasions and i see how you look at me now you are a very clever lawyer but happily for the interests that i commit to your charge you are also a thoroughly honest man after twenty years experience of you you cant deceive me you bring me bad news speak at once sir and speak plainly  mr troy yieldedinch by inch as it were i bring news which i fear may annoy your ladyship he paused and advanced another inch it is news which i only became acquainted with myself on entering this house  he waited again and made another advance i happened to meet your ladyships steward mr moody in the hall  where is he lady lydiard interposed angrily i can make him speak out and i will send him here instantly  the lawyer made a last effort to hold off the coming disclosure a little longer mr moody will be here directly he said mr moody requested me to prepare your ladyship  will you ring the bell mr troy or must i  moody had evidently been waiting outside while the lawyer spoke for him he saved mr troy the trouble of ringing the bell by presenting himself in the drawingroom lady lydiards eyes searched his face as he approached her bright complexion faded suddenly not a word more passed her lips she looked and waited  in silence on his part moody laid an open sheet of paper on the table the paper quivered in his trembling hand  lady lydiard recovered herself first is that for me she asked  yes my lady  she took up the paper without an instants hesitation both the men watched her anxiously as she read it  the handwriting was strange to her the words were these  i hereby certify that the bearer of these lines robert moody by name has presented to me the letter with which he was charged addressed to myself with the seal intact i regret to add that there is to say the least of it some mistake the inclosure referred to by the anonymous writer of the letter who signs a friend in need has not reached me no fivehundred pound banknote was in the letter when i opened it my wife was present when i broke the seal and can certify to this statement if necessary not knowing who my charitable correspondent is mr moody being forbidden to give me any information i can only take this means of stating the case exactly as it stands and hold myself at the disposal of the writer of the letter my private address is at the head of the pagesamuel bradstock rector st annes deansbury london  lady lydiard dropped the paper on the table for the moment plainly as the rectors statement was expressed she appeared to be incapable of understanding it what in gods name does this mean she asked  the lawyer and the steward looked at each other which of the two was entitled to speak first lady lydiard gave them no time to decide moody she said sternly you took charge of the letteri look to you for an explanation  moodys dark eyes flashed he answered lady lydiard without caring to conceal that he resented the tone in which she had spoken to him  i undertook to deliver the letter at its address he said i found it sealed on the table your ladyship has the clergymans written testimony that i handed it to him with the seal unbroken i have done my duty and i have no explanation to offer  before lady lydiard could speak again mr troy discreetly interfered he saw plainly that his experience was required to lead the investigation in the right direction  pardon me my lady he said with that happy mixture of the positive and the polite in his manner of which lawyers alone possess the secret there is only one way of arriving at the truth in painful matters of this sort we must begin at the beginning may i venture to ask your ladyship a question  lady lydiard felt the composing influence of mr troy i am at your disposal sir she said quietly  are you absolutely certain that you inclosed the banknote in the letter the lawyer asked  i certainly believe i inclosed it lady lydiard answered but i was so alarmed at the time by the sudden illness of my dog that i do not feel justified in speaking positively  was anybody in the room with your ladyship when you put the inclosure in the letteras you believe  i was in the room said moody i can swear that i saw her ladyship put the banknote in the letter and the letter in the envelope  and seal the envelope asked mr troy  no sir her ladyship was called away into the next room to the dog before she could seal the envelope  mr troy addressed himself once more to lady lydiard did your ladyship take the letter into the next room with you  i was too much alarmed to think of it mr troy i left it here on the table  with the envelope open  yes  how long were you absent in the other room  half an hour or more  ha said mr troy to himself this complicates it a little he reflected for a while and then turned again to moody did any of the servants know of this banknote being in her ladyships possession  not one of them moody answered  do you suspect any of the servants  certainly not sir  are there any workmen employed in the house  no sir  do you know of any persons who had access to the room while lady lydiard was absent from it  two visitors called sir  who were they  her ladyships nephew mr felix sweetsir and the honorable alfred hardyman  mr troy shook his head irritably i am not speaking of gentlemen of high position and repute he said its absurd even to mention mr sweetsir and mr hardyman my question related to strangers who might have obtained access to the drawingroompeople calling with her ladyships sanction for subscriptions for instance or people calling with articles of dress or ornament to be submitted to her ladyships inspection  no such persons came to the house with my knowledge moody answered  mr troy suspended the investigation and took a turn thoughtfully in the room the theory on which his inquiries had proceeded thus far had failed to produce any results his experience warned him to waste no more time on it and to return to the startingpoint of the investigationin other words to the letter shifting his point of view he turned again to lady lydiard and tried his questions in a new direction  mr moody mentioned just now he said that your ladyship was called into the next room before you could seal your letter on your return to this room did you seal the letter  i was busy with the dog lady lydiard answered isabel miller was of no use in the boudoir and i told her to seal it for me  mr troy started the new direction in which he was pushing his inquiries began to look like the right direction already miss isabel miller he proceeded has been a resident under your ladyships roof for some little time i believe  for nearly two years mr troy  as your ladyships companion and reader  as my adopted daughter her ladyship answered with marked emphasis  wise mr troy rightly interpreted the emphasis as a warning to him to suspend the examination of her ladyship and to address to mr moody the far more serious questions which were now to come  did anyone give you the letter before you left the house with it he said to the steward or did you take it yourself  i took it myself from the table here  was it sealed  yes  was anybody present when you took the letter from the table  miss isabel was present  did you find her alone in the room  yes sir  lady lydiard opened her lips to speak and checked herself mr troy having cleared the ground before him put the fatal question  mr moody he said when miss isabel was instructed to seal the letter did she know that a banknote was inclosed in it  instead of replying robert drew back from the lawyer with a look of horror lady lydiard started to her feetand checked herself again on the point of speaking  answer him moody she said putting a strong constraint on herself  robert answered very unwillingly i took the liberty of reminding her ladyship that she had left her letter unsealed he said and i mentioned as my excuse for speakinghe stopped and corrected himselfi believe i mentioned that a valuable inclosure was in the letter  you believe mr troy repeated cant you speak more positively than that  i can speak positively said lady lydiard with her eyes on the lawyer moody did mention the inclosure in the letterin isabel millers hearing as well as in mine she paused steadily controlling herself and what of that mr troy she added very quietly and firmly  mr troy answered quietly and firmly on his side i am surprised that your ladyship should ask the question he said  i persist in repeating the question lady lydiard rejoined i say that isabel miller knew of the inclosure in my letterand i ask what of that  and i answer retorted the impenetrable lawyer that the suspicion of theft rests on your ladyships adopted daughter and on nobody else  its false cried robert with a burst of honest indignation i wish to god i had never said a word to you about the loss of the banknote oh my lady my lady dont let him distress you what does he know about it  hush said lady lydiard control yourself and hear what he has to say she rested her hand on moodys shoulder partly to encourage him partly to support herself and fixing her eyes again on mr troy repeated his last words suspicion rests on my adopted daughter and on nobody else why on nobody else  is your ladyship prepared to suspect the rector of st annes of embezzlement or your own relatives and equals of theft mr troy asked does a shadow of doubt rest on the servants not if mr moodys evidence is to be believed who to our own certain knowledge had access to the letter while it was unsealed who was alone in the room with it and who knew of the inclosure in it i leave the answer to your ladyship  isabel miller is as incapable of an act of theft as i am there is my answer mr troy  the lawyer bowed resignedly and advanced to the door  am i to take your ladyships generous assertion as finally disposing of the question of the lost banknote he inquired  lady lydiard met the challenge without shrinking from it  no she said the loss of the banknote is known out of my house other persons may suspect this innocent girl as you suspect her it is due to isabels reputationher unstained reputation mr troythat she should know what has happened and should have an opportunity of defending herself she is in the next room moody bring her here  roberts courage failed him he trembled at the bare idea of exposing isabel to the terrible ordeal that awaited her oh my lady he pleaded think again before you tell the poor girl that she is suspected of theft keep it a secret from herthe shame of it will break her heart  keep it a secret said lady lydiard when the rector and the rectors wife both know of it do you think they will let the matter rest where it is even if i could consent to hush it up i must write to them and i cant write anonymously after what has happened put yourself in isabels place and tell me if you would thank the person who knew you to be innocently exposed to a disgraceful suspicion and who concealed it from you go moody the longer you delay the harder it will be  with his head sunk on his breast with anguish written in every line of his face moody obeyed passing slowly down the short passage which connected the two rooms and still shrinking from the duty that had been imposed on him he paused looking through the curtains which hung over the entrance to the boudoir     chapter vii  the sight that met moodys view wrung him to the heart  isabel and the dog were at play together among the varied accomplishments possessed by tommie the capacity to take his part at a game of hideandseek was one his playfellow for the time being put a shawl or a handkerchief over his head so as to prevent him from seeing and then hid among the furniture a pocketbook or a cigarcase or a purse or anything else that happened to be at hand leaving the dog to find it with his keen sense of smell to guide him doubly relieved by the fit and the bleeding tommies spirits had revived and he and isabel had just begun their game when moody looked into the room charged with his terrible errand youre burning tommie youre burning cried the girl laughing and clapping her hands the next moment she happened to look round and saw moody through the parted curtains his face warned her instantly that something serious had happened she advanced a few steps her eyes resting on him in silent alarm he was himself too painfully agitated to speak not a word was exchanged between lady lydiard and mr troy in the next room in the complete stillness that prevailed the dog was heard sniffing and fidgeting about the furniture robert took isabel by the hand and led her into the drawingroom for gods sake spare her my lady he whispered the lawyer heard him no said mr troy be merciful and tell her the truth  he spoke to a woman who stood in no need of his advice the inherent nobility in lady lydiards nature was aroused her great heart offered itself patiently to any sorrow to any sacrifice  putting her arm round isabelhalf caressing her half supporting herlady lydiard accepted the whole responsibility and told the whole truth  reeling under the first shock the poor girl recovered herself with admirable courage she raised her head and eyed the lawyer without uttering a word in its artless consciousness of innocence the look was nothing less than sublime addressing herself to mr troy lady lydiard pointed to isabel do you see guilt there she asked  mr troy made no answer in the melancholy experience of humanity to which his profession condemned him he had seen conscious guilt assume the face of innocence and helpless innocence admit the disguise of guilt the keenest observation in either case failing completely to detect the truth lady lydiard misinterpreted his silence as expressing the sullen selfassertion of a heartless man she turned from him in contempt and held out her hand to isabel  mr troy is not satisfied yet she said bitterly my love take my hand and look me in the face as your equal i know no difference of rank at such a time as this before god who hears you are you innocent of the theft of the banknote  before god who hears me isabel answered i am innocent  lady lydiard looked once more at the lawyer and waited to hear if he believed that  mr troy took refuge in dumb diplomacyhe made a low bow it might have meant that he believed isabel or it might have meant that he modestly withdrew his own opinion into the background lady lydiard did not condescend to inquire what it meant  the sooner we bring this painful scene to an end the better she said i shall be glad to avail myself of your professional assistance mr troy within certain limits outside of my house i beg that you will spare no trouble in tracing the lost money to the person who has really stolen it inside of my house i must positively request that the disappearance of the note may never be alluded to in any way whatever until your inquiries have been successful in discovering the thief in the meanwhile mrs tollmidge and her family must not be sufferers by my loss i shall pay the money again she paused and pressed isabels hand with affectionate fervor my child she said one last word to you and i have done you remain here with my trust in you and my love for you absolutely unshaken when you think of what has been said here today never forget that  isabel bent her head and kissed the kind hand that still held hers the high spirit that was in her inspired by lady lydiards example rose equal to the dreadful situation in which she was placed  no my lady she said calmly and sadly it cannot be what this gentleman has said of me is not to be deniedthe appearances are against me the letter was open and i was alone in the room with it and mr moody told me that a valuable inclosure was inside it dear and kind mistress i am not fit to be a member of your household i am not worthy to live with the honest people who serve you while my innocence is in doubt it is enough for me now that you dont doubt it i can wait patiently after that for the day that gives me back my good name oh my lady dont cry about it pray pray dont cry  lady lydiards selfcontrol failed her for the first time isabels courage had made isabel dearer to her than ever she sank into a chair and covered her face with her handkerchief mr troy turned aside abruptly and examined a japanese vase without any idea in his mind of what he was looking at lady lydiard had gravely misjudged him in believing him to be a heartless man  isabel followed the lawyer and touched him gently on the arm to rouse his attention  i have one relation living siran auntwho will receive me if i go to her she said simply is there any harm in my going lady lydiard will give you the address when you want me spare her ladyship sir all the pain and trouble that you can  at last the heart that was in mr troy asserted itself you are a fine creature he said with a burst of enthusiasm i agree with lady lydiardi believe you are innocent too and i will leave no effort untried to find the proof of it he turned aside again and had another look at the japanese vase  as the lawyer withdrew himself from observation moody approached isabel  thus far he had stood apart watching her and listening to her in silence not a look that had crossed her face not a word that had fallen from her had escaped him unconsciously on her side unconsciously on his side she now wrought on his nature with a purifying and ennobling influence which animated it with a new life all that had been selfish and violent in his passion for her left him to return no more the immeasurable devotion which he laid at her feet in the days that were yet to comethe unyielding courage which cheerfully accepted the sacrifice of himself when events demanded it at a later period of his lifestruck root in him now without attempting to conceal the tears that were falling fast over his cheeksstriving vainly to express those new thoughts in him that were beyond the reach of wordshe stood before her the truest friend and servant that ever woman had  oh my dear my heart is heavy for you take me to serve you and help you her ladyships kindness will permit it i am sure  he could say no more in those simple words the cry of his heart reached her forgive me robert she answered gratefully if i said anything to pain you when we spoke together a little while since i didnt mean it she gave him her hand and looked timidly over her shoulder at lady lydiard let me go she said in low broken tones let me go  mr troy heard her and stepped forward to interfere before lady lydiard could speak the man had recovered his selfcontrol the lawyer took his place again on the scene  you must not leave us my dear he said to isabel until i have put a question to mr moody in which you are interested do you happen to have the number of the lost banknote he asked turning to the steward  moody produced his slip of paper with the number on it mr troy made two copies of it before he returned the paper one copy he put in his pocket the other he handed to isabel  keep it carefully he said neither you nor i know how soon it may be of use to you  receiving the copy from him she felt mechanically in her apron for her pocketbook she had used it in playing with the dog as an object to hide from him but she had suffered and was still suffering too keenly to be capable of the effort of remembrance moody eager to help her even in the most trifling thing guessed what had happened you were playing with tommie he said is it in the next room  the dog heard his name pronounced through the open door the next moment he trotted into the drawingroom with isabels pocketbook in his mouth he was a strong wellgrown scotch terrier of the largest size with bright intelligent eyes and a coat of thick curling white hair diversified by two light brown patches on his back as he reached the middle of the room and looked from one to another of the persons present the fine sympathy of his race told him that there was trouble among his human friends his tail dropped he whined softly as he approached isabel and laid her pocketbook at her feet  she knelt as she picked up the pocketbook and raised her playfellow of happier days to take her leave of him as the dog put his paws on her shoulders returning her caress her first tears fell foolish of me she said faintly to cry over a dog i cant help it goodby tommie  putting him away from her gently she walked towards the door the dog instantly followed she put him away from her for the second time and left him he was not to be denied he followed her again and took the skirt of her dress in his teeth as if to hold her back robert forced the dog growling and resisting with all his might to let go of the dress dont be rough with him said isabel put him on her ladyships lap he will be quieter there robert obeyed he whispered to lady lydiard as she received the dog she seemed to be still incapable of speakingshe bowed her head in silent assent robert hurried back to isabel before she had passed the door not alone he said entreatingly her ladyship permits it isabel let me see you safe to your aunts house  isabel looked at him felt for him and yielded  yes she answered softly to make amends for what i said to you when i was thoughtless and happy she waited a little to compose herself before she spoke her farewell words to lady lydiard goodby my lady your kindness has not been thrown away on an ungrateful girl i love you and thank you with all my heart  lady lydiard rose placing the dog on the chair as she left it she seemed to have grown older by years instead of by minutes in the short interval that had passed since she had hidden her face from view i cant bear it she cried in husky broken tones isabel isabel i forbid you to leave me  but one person could venture to resist her that person was mr troyand mr troy knew it  control yourself he said to her in a whisper the girl is doing what is best and most becoming in her positionand is doing it with a patience and courage wonderful to see sh e places herself under the protection of her nearest relative until her character is vindicated and her position in your house is once more beyond a doubt is this a time to throw obstacles in her way be worthy of yourself lady lydiard and think of the day when she will return to you without the breath of a suspicion to rest on her  there was no disputing with himhe was too plainly in the right lady lydiard submitted she concealed the torture that her own resolution inflicted on her with an endurance which was indeed worthy of herself taking isabel in her arms she kissed her in a passion of sorrow and love my poor dear my own sweet girl dont suppose that this is a parting kiss i shall see you againoften and often i shall see you again at your aunts at a sign from mr troy robert took isabels arm in his and led her away tommie watching her from his chair lifted his little white muzzle as his playfellow looked back on passing the doorway the long melancholy farewell howl of the dog was the last sound isabel miller heard as she left the house      part the second  the discovery  chapter viii  on the day after isabels departure diligent mr troy set forth for the head office in whitehall to consult the police on the question of the missing money he had previously sent information of the robbery to the bank of england and had also advertised the loss in the daily newspapers  the air was so pleasant and the sun was so bright that he determined on proceeding to his destination on foot he was hardly out of sight of his own offices when he was overtaken by a friend who was also walking in the direction of whitehall this gentleman was a person of considerable worldly wisdom and experience he had been officially associated with cases of striking and notorious crime in which government had lent its assistance to discover and punish the criminals the opinion of a person in this position might be of the greatest value to mr troy whose practice as a solicitor had thus far never brought him into collision with thieves and mysteries he accordingly decided in isabels interests on confiding to his friend the nature of his errand to the police concealing the name but concealing nothing else he described what had happened on the previous day at lady lydiards house and then put the question plainly to his companion  what would you do in my place  in your place his friend answered quietly i should not waste time and money in consulting the police  not consult the police exclaimed mr troy in amazement surely i have not made myself understood i am going to the head office and i have got a letter of introduction to the chief inspector in the detective department i am afraid i omitted to mention that  it doesnt make any difference proceeded the other as coolly as ever you have asked for my advice and i give you my advice tear up your letter of introduction and dont stir a step further in the direction of whitehall  mr troy began to understand you dont believe in the detective police he said  who can believe in them who reads his newspaper and remembers what he reads his friend rejoined fortunately for the detective department the public in general forgets what it reads go to your club and look at the criminal history of our own time recorded in the newspapers every crime is more or less a mystery you will see that the mysteries which the police discover are almost without exception mysteries made penetrable by the commonest capacity through the extraordinary stupidity exhibited in the means taken to hide the crime on the other hand let the guilty man or woman be a resolute and intelligent person capable of setting his or her wits fairly against the wits of the policein other words let the mystery really be a mysteryand cite me a case if you can a really difficult and perplexing case in which the criminal has not escaped mind i dont charge the police with neglecting their work no doubt they do their best and take the greatest pains in following the routine to which they have been trained it is their misfortune not their fault that there is no man of superior intelligence among themi mean no man who is capable in great emergencies of placing himself above conventional methods and following a new way of his own there have been such men in the policemen naturally endowed with that faculty of mental analysis which can decompose a mystery resolve it into its component parts and find the clue at the bottom no matter how remote from ordinary observation it may be but those men have died or have retired one of them would have been invaluable to you in the case you have just mentioned to me as things are unless you are wrong in believing in the young ladys innocence the person who has stolen that banknote will be no easy person to find in my opinion there is only one man now in london who is likely to be of the slightest assistance to youand he is not in the police  who is he asked mr troy  an old rogue who was once in your branch of the legal profession the friend answered you may perhaps remember the name they call him old sharon  what the scoundrel who was struck off the roll of attorneys years since is he still alive  alive and prospering he lives in a court or lane running out of long acre and he offers advice to persons interested in recovering missing objects of any sort whether you have lost your wife or lost your cigarcase old sharon is equally useful to you he has an inbred capacity for reading the riddle the right way in cases of mystery great or small in short he possesses exactly that analytical faculty to which i alluded just now i have his address at my office if you think it worth while to try him  who can trust such a man mr troy objected he would be sure to deceive me  you are entirely mistaken since he was struck off the rolls old sharon has discovered that the straight way is on the whole the best way even in a mans own interests his consultation fee is a guinea and he gives a signed estimate beforehand for any supplementary expenses that may follow i can tell you this is of course strictly between ourselves that the authorities at my office took his advice in a government case that puzzled the police we approached him of course through persons who were to be trusted to represent us without betraying the source from which their instructions were derived and we found the old rascals advice well worth paying for it is quite likely that he may not succeed so well in your case try the police by all means and if they fail why there is sharon as a last resort  this arrangement commended itself to mr troys professional caution he went on to whitehall and he tried the detective police  they at once adopted the obvious conclusion to persons of ordinary capacitythe conclusion that isabel was the thief  acting on this conviction the authorities sent an experienced woman from the office to lady lydiards house to examine the poor girls clothes and ornaments before they were packed up and sent after her to her aunts the search led to nothing the only objects of any value that were discovered had been presents from lady lydiard no jewelers or milliners bills were among the papers found in her desk not a sign of secret extravagance in dress was to be seen anywhere defeated so far the police proposed next to have isabel privately watched there might be a prodigal lover somewhere in the background with ruin staring him in the face unless he could raise five hundred pounds lady lydiard who had only consented to the search under stress of persuasive argument from mr troy resented this ingenious idea as an insult she declared that if isabel was watched the girl should know of it instantly from her own lips the police listened with perfect resignation and decorum and politely shifted their ground a certain suspicion they remarked always rested in cases of this sort on the servants would her ladyship object to private inquiries into the characters and proceedings of the servants her ladyship instantly objected in the most positive terms thereupon the inspector asked for a minutes private conversation with mr troy the thief is certainly a member of lady lydiards household this functionary remarked in his politelypositive way if her ladyship persists in refusing to let us make the necessary inquiries our hands are tied and the case comes to an end through no fault of ours if her ladyship changes her mind perhaps you will drop me a line sir to that effect goodmorning  so the experiment of consulting the police came to an untimely end the one result obtained was the expression of purblind opinion by the authorities of the detective department which pointed to isabel or to one of the servants as the undiscovered thief thinking the matter over in the retirement of his own officeand not forgetting his promise to isabel to leave no means untried of establishing her innocencemr troy could see but one alternative left to him he took up his pen and wrote to his friend at the government office there was nothing for it now but to run the risk and try old sharon     chapter ix  the next day mr troy taking robert moody with him as a valuable witness rang the bell at the mean and dirty lodginghouse in which old sharon received the clients who stood in need of his advice  they were led up stairs to a back room on the second floor of the house entering the room they discovered through a thick cloud of tobacco smoke a small fat baldheaded dirty old man in an armchair robed in a tattered flannel dressinggown with a short pipe in his mouth a pugdog on his lap and a french novel in his hands  is it business asked old sharon speaking in a hoarse asthmatical voice and fixing a pair of bright shameless black eyes attentively on the two visitors  it is business mr troy answered looking at the old rogue who had disgraced an honorable profession as he might have looked at a reptile which had just risen rampant at his feet what is your fee for a consultation  you give me a guinea and ill give you half an hour with this reply old sharon held out his unwashed hand across the rickety inksplashed table at which he was sitting  mr troy would not have touched him with the tips of his own fingers for a thousand pounds he laid the guinea on the table  old sharon burst into a fierce laugha laugh strangely accompanied by a frowning contraction of his eyebrows and a frightful exhibition of the whole inside of his mouth im not clean enough for youeh he said with an appearance of being very much amused theres a dirty old man described in this book that is a little like me he held up his french novel have you read it a capital storywell put together ah you havent read it you have got a pleasure to come i say do you mind tobaccosmoke i think faster while i smokethats all  mr troys respectable hand waved a silent permission to smoke given under dignified protest  all right said old sharon now get on  he laid himself back in his chair and puffed out his smoke with eyes lazily half closed like the eyes of the pugdog on his lap at that moment indeed there was a curious resemblance between the two they both seemed to be preparing themselves in the same idle way for the same comfortable nap  mr troy stated the circumstances under which the five hundred pound note had disappeared in clear and consecutive narrative when he had done old sharon suddenly opened his eyes the pugdog suddenly opened his eyes old sharon looked hard at mr troy the pug looked hard at mr troy old sharon spoke the pug growled  i know who you areyoure a lawyer dont be alarmed i never saw you before and i dont know your name what i do know is a lawyers statement of facts when i hear it whos this old sharon looked inquisitively at moody as he put the question  mr troy introduced moody as a competent witness thoroughly acquainted with the circumstances and ready and willing to answer any questions relating to them old sharon waited a little smoking hard and thinking hard now then he burst out in his fiercely sudden way im going to get to the root of the matter  he leaned forward with his elbows on the table and began his examination of moody heartily as mr troy despised and disliked the old rogue he listened with astonishment and admirationliterally extorted from him by the marvelous ability with which the questions were adapted to the end in view in a quarter of an hour old sharon had extracted from the witness everything literally everything down to the smallest detail that moody could tell him having now in his own phrase got to the root of the matter he relighted his pipe with a grunt of satisfaction and laid himself back in his old armchair  well said mr troy have you formed your opinion  yes ive formed my opinion  what is it  instead of replying old sharon winked confidentially at mr troy and put a question on his side  i say is a tenpound note much of an object to you  it depends on what the money is wanted for answered mr troy  look here said old sharon i give you an opinion for your guinea but mind this its an opinion founded on hearsayand you know as a lawyer what that is worth venture your ten poundsin plain english pay me for my time and trouble in a baffling and difficult caseand ill give you an opinion founded on my own experience  explain yourself a little more clearly said mr troy what do you guarantee to tell us if we venture the ten pounds  i guarantee to name the person or the persons on whom the suspicion really rests and if you employ me after that i guarantee before you pay me a halfpenny more to prove that i am right by laying my hand on the thief  let us have the guinea opinion first said mr troy  old sharon made another frightful exhibition of the whole inside of his mouth his laugh was louder and fiercer than ever i like you he said to mr troy you are so devilish fond of your money lord how rich you must be now listen heres the guinea opinion suspect in this case the very last person on whom suspicion could possibly fall  moody listening attentively started and changed color at those last words mr troy looked thoroughly disappointed and made no attempt to conceal it  is that all he asked  all retorted the cynical vagabond youre a pretty lawyer what more can i say when i dont know for certain whether the witness who has given me my information has misled me or not have i spoken to the girl and formed my own opinion no have i been introduced among the servants as errandboy or to clean the boots and shoes or what not and have i formed my own judgement of them no i take your opinions for granted and i tell you how i should set to work myself if they were my opinions tooand thats a guineasworth a devilish good guineasworth to a rich man like you  old sharons logic produced a certain effect on mr troy in spite of himself it was smartly put from his point of viewthere was no denying that  even if i consented to your proposal he said i should object to your annoying the young lady with impertinent questions or to your being introduced as a spy into a respectable house  old sharon doubled his dirty fists and drummed with them on the rickety table in a comical frenzy of impatience while mr troy was speaking  what the devil do you know about my way of doing my business he burst out when the lawyer had done one of us two is talking like a born idiotand mind this it isnt me look here your young lady goes out for a walk and she meets with a dirty shabby old beggari look like a shabby old beggar already dont i very good this dirty old wretch whines and whimpers and tells a long story and gets sixpence out of the girland knows her by that time inside and out as well as if he had made herand mark hasnt asked her a single ques tion and instead of annoying her has made her happy in the performance of a charitable action stop a bit i havent done with you yet who blacks your boots and shoes look here he pushed his pugdog off his lap dived under the table appeared again with an old boot and a bottle of blackening and set to work with tigerish activity im going out for a walk you know and i may as well make myself smart with that announcement he began to sing over his worka song of sentiment popular in england in the early part of the present centuryshes all my fancy painted her shes lovely shes divine but her heart it is anothers and it never can be mine toorallooralloo i like a lovesong brush away brush away till i see my own pretty face in the blacking hey heres a nice harmless jolly old man sings and jokes over his work and makes the kitchen quite cheerful whats that you say hes a stranger and dont talk to him too freely you ought to be ashamed of yourself to speak in that way of a poor old fellow with one foot in the grave mrs cook will give him a nice bit of dinner in the scullery and john footman will look out an old coat for him and when hes heard everything he wants to hear and doesnt come back again the next day to his workwhat do they think of it in the servants hall do they say weve had a spy among us yah you know better than that by this time the cheerful old man has been run over in the street or is down with the fever or has turned up his toes in the parish deadhousethats what they say in the servants hall try me in your own kitchen and see if your servants take me for a spy come come mr lawyer out with your ten pounds and dont waste any more precious time about it  i will consider and let you know said mr troy  old sharon laughed more ferociously than ever and hobbled round the table in a great hurry to the place at which moody was sitting he laid one hand on the stewards shoulder and pointed derisively with the other to mr troy  i say mr silentman bet you five pounds i never hear of that lawyer again  silently attentive all through the interview except when he was answering questions moody only replied in the fewest words i dont bet was all he said he showed no resentment at sharons familiarity and he appeared to find no amusement in sharons extraordinary talk the old vagabond seemed actually to produce a serious impression on him when mr troy set the example of rising to go he still kept his seat and looked at the lawyer as if he regretted leaving the atmosphere of tobacco smoke reeking in the dirty room  have you anything to say before we go mr troy asked  moody rose slowly and looked at old sharon not just now sir he replied looking away again after a moments reflection  old sharon interpreted moodys look and moodys reply from his own peculiar point of view he suddenly drew the steward away into a corner of the room  i say he began in a whisper upon your solemn word of honor you knoware you as rich as the lawyer there  certainly not  look here its half price to a poor man if you feel like coming back on your own accountfive pounds will do from you there there think of itthink of it  now then said mr troy waiting for his companion with the door open in his hand he looked back at sharon when moody joined him the old vagabond was settled again in his armchair with his dog in his lap his pipe in his mouth and his french novel in his hand exhibiting exactly the picture of frowzy comfort which he had presented when his visitors first entered the room  goodday said mr troy with haughty condescension  dont interrupt me rejoined old sharon absorbed in his novel youve had your guineas worth lord what a lovely book this is dont interrupt me  impudent scoundrel said mr troy when he and moody were in the street again what could my friend mean by recommending him fancy his expecting me to trust him with ten pounds i consider even the guinea completely thrown away  begging your pardon sir said moody i dont quite agree with you there  what you dont mean to tell me you understand that oracular sentence of hissuspect the very last person on whom suspicion could possibly fall rubbish  i dont say i understand it sir i only say it has set me thinking  thinking of what do your suspicions point to the thief  if you will please to excuse me mr troy i should like to wait a while before i answer that  mr troy suddenly stood still and eyed his companion a little distrustfully  are you going to turn detectivepoliceman on your own account he asked  theres nothing i wont turn to and try to help miss isabel in this matter moody answered firmly i have saved a few hundred pounds in lady lydiards service and i am ready to spend every farthing of it if i can only discover the thief  mr troy walked on again miss isabel seems to have a good friend in you he said he was perhaps unconsciously a little offended by the independent tone in which the steward spoke after he had himself engaged to take the vindication of the girls innocence into his own hands  miss isabel has a devoted servant and slave in me moody answered with passionate enthusiasm  very creditable i havent a word to say against it mr troy rejoined but dont forget that the young lady has other devoted friends besides you i am her devoted friend for instancei have promised to serve her and i mean to keep my word you will excuse me for adding that my experience and discretion are quite as likely to be useful to her as your enthusiasm i know the world well enough to be careful in trusting strangers it will do you no harm mr moody to follow my example  moody accepted his reproof with becoming patience and resignation if you have anything to propose sir that will be of service to miss isabel he said i shall be happy if i can assist you in the humblest capacity  and if not mr troy inquired conscious of having nothing to propose as he asked the question  in that case sir i must take my own course and blame nobody but myself if it leads me astray  mr troy said no more he parted from moody at the next turning  pursuing the subject privately in his own mind he decided on taking the earliest opportunity of visiting isabel at her aunts house and on warning her in her future intercourse with moody not to trust too much to the stewards discretion i havent a doubt thought the lawyer of what he means to do next the infatuated fool is going back to old sharon     chapter x  returning to his office mr troy discovered among the correspondence that was waiting for him a letter from the very person whose welfare was still the uppermost subject in his mind isabel miller wrote in these terms  dear sirmy aunt miss pink is very desirous of consulting you professionally at the earliest opportunity although south morden is within little more than half an hours railway ride from london miss pink does not presume to ask you to visit her being well aware of the value of your time will you therefore be so kind as to let me know when it will be convenient to you to receive my aunt at your office in london believe me dear sir respectfully yours isabel miller psi am further instructed to say that the regrettable event at lady lydiards house is the proposed subject of the consultation the lawn south morden thursday  mr troy smiled as he read the letter too formal for a young girl he said to himself every word of it has been dictated by miss pink he was not long in deciding what course he should take there was a pressing necessity for cautioning isabel and here was his opportunity he sent for his head clerk and looked at his list of engagements for the day there was nothing set down in the book which the clerk was not quite as well able to do as the master mr troy consulted his railwayguide ordered his cab and caught the next train to south mord en  south morden was then and remains to this day one of those primitive agricultural villages passed over by the march of modern progress which are still to be found in the near neighborhood of london only the slow trains stopped at the station and there was so little to do that the stationmaster and his porter grew flowers on the embankment and trained creepers over the waitingroom window turning your back on the railway and walking along the one street of south morden you found yourself in the old england of two centuries since gabled cottages with fastclosed windows pigs and poultry in quiet possession of the road the venerable church surrounded by its shady burialground the grocers shop which sold everything and the butchers shop which sold nothing the scarce inhabitants who liked a good look at a stranger and the unwashed children who were pictures of dirty health the clash of the ironchained bucket in the public well and the thump of the falling ninepins in the skittleground behind the publichouse the horsepond on the one bit of open ground and the old elmtree with the wooden seat round it on the otherthese were some of the objects that you saw and some of the noises that you heard in south morden as you passed from one end of the village to the other  about half a mile beyond the last of the old cottages modern england met you again under the form of a row of little villas set up by an adventurous london builder who had bought the land a bargain each villa stood in its own little garden and looked across a stony road at the meadow lands and softlyrising wooded hills beyond each villa faced you in the sunshine with the horrid glare of new red brick and forced its nonsensical name on your attention traced in bright paint on the posts of its entrance gate consulting the posts as he advanced mr troy arrived in due course of time at the villa called the lawn which derived its name apparently from a circular patch of grass in front of the house the gate resisting his efforts to open it he rang the bell  admitted by a trim clean shy little maidservant mr troy looked about him in amazement turn which way he might he found himself silently confronted by posted and painted instructions to visitors which forbade him to do this and commanded him to do that at every step of his progress from the gate to the house on the side of the lawn a label informed him that he was not to walk on the grass on the other side a painted hand pointed along a boundarywall to an inscription which warned him to go that way if he had business in the kitchen on the gravel walk at the foot of the housesteps words neatly traced in little white shells reminded him not to forget the scraper on the doorstep he was informed in letters of lead that he was welcome on the mat in the passage bristly black words burst on his attention commanding him to wipe his shoes even the hatstand in the hall was not allowed to speak for itself it had hats and cloaks inscribed on it and it issued its directions imperatively in the matter of your wet umbrellaput it here  giving the trim little servant his card mr troy was introduced to a receptionroom on the lower floor before he had time to look round him the door was opened again from without and isabel stole into the room on tiptoe she looked worn and anxious when she shook hands with the old lawyer the charming smile that he remembered so well was gone  dont say you have seen me she whispered i am not to come into the room till my aunt sends for me tell me two things before i run away again how is lady lydiard and have you discovered the thief  lady lydiard was well when i last saw her and we have not yet succeeded in discovering the thief having answered the questions in those terms mr troy decided on cautioning isabel on the subject of the steward while he had the chance one question on my side he said holding her back from the door by the arm do you expect moody to visit you here  i am sure he will visit me isabel answered warmly he has promised to come here at my request i never knew what a kind heart robert moody had till this misfortune fell on me my aunt who is not easily taken with strangers respects and admires him i cant tell you how good he was to me on the journey hereand how kindly how nobly he spoke to me when we parted she paused and turned her head away the tears were rising in her eyes in my situation she said faintly kindness is very keenly felt dont notice me mr troy  the lawyer waited a moment to let her recover herself  i agree entirely my dear in your opinion of moody he said at the same time i think it right to warn you that his zeal in your service may possibly outrun his discretion he may feel too confidently about penetrating the mystery of the missing money and unless you are on your guard he may raise false hopes in you when you next see him listen to any advice that he may give you by all means but before you decide on being guided by his opinion consult my older experience and hear what i have to say on the subject dont suppose that i am attempting to make you distrust this good friend he added noticing the look of uneasy surprise which isabel fixed on him no such idea is in my mind i only warn you that moodys eagerness to be of service to you may mislead him you understand me  yes sir replied isabel coldly i understand you please let me go now my aunt will be down directly and she must not find me here she curtseyed with distant respect and left the room  so much for trying to put two ideas together into a girls mind thought mr troy when he was alone again the little fool evidently thinks i am jealous of moodys place in her estimation well i have done my dutyand i can do no more  he looked round the room not a chair was out of its place not a speck of dust was to be seen the brightlyperfect polish of the table made your eyes ache the ornaments on it looked as if they had never been touched by mortal hand the piano was an object for distant admiration not an instrument to be played on the carpet made mr troy look nervously at the soles of his shoes and the sofa protected by layers of white crochetwork said as plainly as if in words sit on me if you dare mr troy retreated to a bookcase at the further end of the room the books fitted the shelves to such absolute perfection that he had some difficulty in taking one of them out when he had succeeded he found himself in possession of a volume of the history of england on the flyleaf he encountered another written warningthis book belongs to miss pinks academy for young ladies and is not to be removed from the library the date which was added referred to a period of ten years since miss pink now stood revealed as a retired schoolmistress and mr troy began to understand some of the characteristic peculiarities of that ladys establishment which had puzzled him up to the present time  he had just succeeded in putting the book back again when the door opened once more and isabels aunt entered the room  if miss pink could by any possible conjuncture of circumstances have disappeared mysteriously from her house and her friends the police would have found the greatest difficulty in composing the necessary description of the missing lady the acutest observer could have discovered nothing that was noticeable or characteristic in her personal appearance the pen of the present writer portrays her in despair by a series of negatives she was not young she was not old she was neither tall nor short nor stout nor thin nobody could call her features attractive and nobody could call them ugly there was nothing in her voice her expression her manner or her dress that differed in any appreciable degree from the voice expression manner and dress of five hundred thousand other single ladies of her age and position in the world if you had asked her to describe herself she would have answered i am a gentlewoman and if you had further inquired which of her numerous accomplishments took highest rank in her own esteem she would have replied my powers of conversation for the rest she was miss pink of south morden and when that has been said all has been said  pray be seated sir we have had a beautiful day after the longcontinued wet weather i am told that the season is very unfavorable for wallfruit may i offer you some refreshment after your journey in these terms and in the smoothest of voices miss pink opened the interview  mr troy made a polite reply and added a few strictly conventional remarks on the beauty of the neighborhood not even a lawyer could sit in miss pinks presence and hear miss pinks conversation without feeling himself called upon in the nursery phrase to be on his best behavior  it is extremely kind of you mr troy to favor me with this visit miss pink resumed i am well aware that the time of professional gentlemen is of especial value to them and i will therefore ask you to excuse me if i proceed abruptly to the subject on which i desire to consult your experience  here the lady modestly smoothed out her dress over her knees and the lawyer made a bow miss pinks highlytrained conversation had perhaps one faultit was not strictly speaking conversation at all in its effect on her hearers it rather resembled the contents of a fluently conventional letter read aloud  the circumstances under which my niece isabel has left lady lydiards house miss pink proceeded are so indescribably painfuli will go further i will say so deeply humiliatingthat i have forbidden her to refer to them again in my presence or to mention them in the future to any living creature besides myself you are acquainted with those circumstances mr troy and you will understand my indignation when i first learnt that my sisters child had been suspected of theft i have not the honor of being acquainted with lady lydiard she is not a countess i believe just so her husband was only a baron i am not acquainted with lady lydiard and i will not trust myself to say what i think of her conduct to my niece  pardon me madam mr troy interposed before you say any more about lady lydiard i really must beg leave to observe  pardon me miss pink rejoined i never form a hasty judgment lady lydiards conduct is beyond the reach of any defense no matter how ingenious it may be you may not be aware sir that in receiving my niece under her roof her ladyship was receiving a gentlewoman by birth as well as by education my late lamented sister was the daughter of a clergyman of the church of england i need hardly remind you that as such she was a born lady under favoring circumstances isabels maternal grandfather might have been archbishop of canterbury and have taken precedence of the whole house of peers the princes of the blood royal alone excepted i am not prepared to say that my niece is equally well connected on her fathers side my sister surprisedi will not add shockedus when she married a chemist at the same time a chemist is not a tradesman he is a gentleman at one end of the profession of medicine and a titled physician is a gentleman at the other end that is all in inviting isabel to reside with her lady lydiard i repeat was bound to remember that she was associating herself with a young gentlewoman she has not remembered this which is one insult and she has suspected my niece of theft which is another  miss pink paused to take breath mr troy made a second attempt to get a hearing  will you kindly permit me madam to say a few words  no said miss pink asserting the most immovable obstinacy under the blandest politeness of manner your time mr troy is really too valuable not even your trained intellect can excuse conduct which is manifestly inexcusable on the face of it now you know my opinion of lady lydiard you will not be surprised to hear that i decline to trust her ladyship she may or she may not cause the necessary inquiries to be made for the vindication of my nieces character in a matter so serious as thisi may say in a duty which i owe to the memories of my sister and my parentsi will not leave the responsibility to lady lydiard i will take it on myself let me add that i am able to pay the necessary expenses the earlier years of my life mr troy have been passed in the tuition of young ladies i have been happy in meriting the confidence of parents and i have been strict in observing the golden rules of economy on my retirement i have been able to invest a modest a very modest little fortune in the funds a portion of it is at the service of my niece for the recovery of her good name and i desire to place the necessary investigation confidentially in your hands you are acquainted with the case and the case naturally goes to you i could not prevail on myselfi really could not prevail on myselfto mention it to a stranger that is the business on which i wished to consult you please say nothing more about lady lydiardthe subject is inexpressibly disagreeable to me i will only trespass on your kindness to tell me if i have succeeded in making myself understood  miss pink leaned back in her chair at the exact angle permitted by the laws of propriety rested her left elbow on the palm of her right hand and lightly supported her cheek with her forefinger and thumb in this position she waited mr troys answerthe living picture of human obstinacy in its most respectable form  if mr troy had not been a lawyerin other words if he had not been professionally capable of persisting in his own course in the face of every conceivable difficulty and discouragementmiss pink might have remained in undisturbed possession of her own opinions as it was mr troy had got his hearing at last and no matter how obstinately she might close her eyes to it miss pink was now destined to have the other side of the case presented to her view  i am sincerely obliged to you madam for the expression of your confidence in me mr troy began at the same time i must beg you to excuse me if i decline to accept your proposal  miss pink had not expected to receive such an answer as this the lawyers brief refusal surprised and annoyed her  why do you decline to assist me she asked  because answered mr troy my services are already engaged in miss isabels interest by a client whom i have served for more than twenty years my client is  miss pink anticipated the coming disclosure you need not trouble yourself sir to mention your clients name she said  my client persisted mr troy loves miss isabel dearly  that is a matter of opinion miss pink interposed  and believes in miss isabels innocence proceeded the irrepressible lawyer as firmly as you believe in it yourself  miss pink being human had a temper and mr troy had found his way to it  if lady lydiard believes in my nieces innocence said miss pink suddenly sitting bolt upright in her chair why has my niece been compelled in justice to herself to leave lady lydiards house  you will admit madam mr troy answered cautiously that we are all of us liable in this wicked world to be the victims of appearances your niece is a victiman innocent victim she wisely withdraws from lady lydiards house until appearances are proved to be false and her position is cleared up  miss pink had her reply ready that is simply acknowledging in other words that my niece is suspected i am only a woman mr troybut it is not quite so easy to mislead me as you seem to suppose  mr troys temper was admirably trained but it began to acknowledge that miss pinks powers of irritation could sting to some purpose  no intention of misleading you madam has ever crossed my mind he rejoined warmly as for your niece i can tell you this in all my experience of lady lydiard i never saw her so distressed as she was when miss isabel left the house  indeed said miss pink with an incredulous smile in my rank of life when we feel distressed about a person we do our best to comfort that person by a kind letter or an early visit but then i am not a lady of title  lady lydiard engaged herself to call on miss isabel in my hearing said mr troy lady lydiard is the most generous woman living  lady lydiard is here cried a joyful voice on the other side of the door  at the same moment isabel burst into the room in a state of excitement which actually ignored the formidable presence of miss pink i beg your pardon aunt i was upstairs at the window and i saw the carriage stop at the gate and tommie has come too the darling saw me at the window cried the poor girl her eyes sparkling with delight as a perfect explosion of barking made itself heard over the tramp of horses feet and the crash of carriage wheels outside  miss pink rose slowly with a dignity that looked capable of adequately receivingnot one noble lady only but the whole peerage of england  control yourself dear isabel she said no wellbred young lady permits herself to become unduly excited stand by my sidea little behind me  isabel obeyed mr troy kept his place and privately enjoyed his triumph over miss pink if lady lydiard had been actually in league with him she could not have chosen a more opportune time for her visit a momentary interval passed the carriage drew up at the door the horses trampled on the gravel the bell rung madly the uproar of tommie released from the carriage and clamoring to be let in redoubled its fury never before had such an unruly burst of noises invaded the tranquility of miss pinks villa     chapter xi  the trim little maidservant ran upstairs from her modest little kitchen trembling at the terrible prospect of having to open the door miss pink deafened by the barking had just time to say what a very illbehaved dog when a sound of small objects overthrown in the hall and a scurrying of furious claws across the oilcloth announced that tommie had invaded the house as the servant appeared introducing lady lydiard the dog ran in he made one frantic leap at isabel which would certainly have knocked her down but for the chair that happened to be standing behind her received on her lap the faithful creature half smothered her with his caresses he barked he shrieked in his joy at seeing her again he jumped off her lap and tore round and round the room at the top of his speed and every time he passed miss pink he showed the whole range of his teeth and snarled ferociously at her ankles having at last exhausted his superfluous energy he leaped back again on isabels lap with his tongue quivering in his open mouthhis tail wagging softly and his eye on miss pink inquiring how she liked a dog in her drawingroom  i hope my dog has not disturbed you maam said lady lydiard advancing from the mat at the doorway on which she had patiently waited until the raptures of tommie subsided into repose  miss pink trembling between terror and indignation acknowledged lady lydiards polite inquiry by a ceremonious bow and an answer which administered by implication a dignified reproof your ladyships dog does not appear to be a very welltrained animal the exschoolmistress remarked  well trained lady lydiard repeated as if the expression was perfectly unintelligible to her i dont think you have had much experience of dogs maam she turned to isabel and embraced her tenderly give me a kiss my dearyou dont know how wretched i have been since you left me she looked back again at miss pink you are not perhaps aware maam that my dog is devotedly attached to your niece a dogs love has been considered by many great men whose names at the moment escape me as the most touching and disinterested of all earthly affections she looked the other way and discovered the lawyer how do you do mr troy its a pleasant surprise to find you here the house was so dull without isabel that i really couldnt put off seeing her any longer when you are more used to tommie miss pink you will understand and admire him you understand and admire him isabeldont you my child you are not looking well i shall take you back with me when the horses have had their rest we shall never be happy away from each other  having expressed her sentiments distributed her greetings and defended her dogall as it were in one breathlady lydiard sat down by isabels side and opened a large green fan that hung at her girdle you have no idea miss pink how fat people suffer in hot weather said the old lady using her fan vigorously  miss pinks eyes dropped modestly to the groundfat was such a coarse word to use if a lady must speak of her own superfluous flesh may i offer some refreshment miss pink asked mincingly a cup of tea  lady lydiard shook her head  a glass of water  lady lydiard declined this last hospitable proposal with an exclamation of disgust have you got any beer she inquired  i beg your ladyships pardon said miss pink doubting the evidence of her own ears did you saybeer  lady lydiard gesticulated vehemently with her fan yes to be sure beer beer  miss pink rose with a countenance expressive of genteel disgust and rang the bell i think you have beer downstairs susan she said when the maid appeared at the door  yes miss  a glass of beer for lady lydiard said miss pinkunder protest  bring it in a jug shouted her ladyship as the maid left the room i like to froth it up for myself she continued addressing miss pink isabel sometimes does it for me when she is at homedont you my dear  miss pink had been waiting her opportunity to assert her own claim to the possession of her own niece from the time when lady lydiard had coolly declared her intention of taking isabel back with her the opportunity now presented itself  your ladyship will pardon me she said if i remark that my nieces home is under my humble roof i am properly sensible i hope of your kindness to isabel but while she remains the object of a disgraceful suspicion she remains with me  lady lydiard closed her fan with an angry snap  you are completely mistaken miss pink you may not mean itbut you speak most unjustly if you say that your niece is an object of suspicion to me or to anybody in my house  mr troy quietly listening up to this point now interposed to stop the discussion before it could degenerate into a personal quarrel his keen observation aided by his accurate knowledge of his clients character had plainly revealed to him what was passing in lady lydiards mind she had entered the house feeling perhaps unconsciously a jealousy of miss pink as her predecessor in isabels affections and as the natural protectress of the girl under existing circumstances miss pinks reception of her dog had additionally irritated the old lady she had taken a malicious pleasure in shocking the schoolmistresss sense of proprietyand she was now only too ready to proceed to further extremities on the delicate question of isabels justification for leaving her house for isabels own sake thereforeto say nothing of other reasonsit was urgently desirable to keep the peace between the two ladies with this excellent object in view mr troy seized his opportunity of striking into the conversation for the first time  pardon me lady lydiard he said you are speaking of a subject which has been already sufficiently discussed between miss pink and myself i think we shall do better not to dwell uselessly on past events but to direct our attention to the future we are all equally satisfied of the complete rectitude of miss isabels conduct and we are all equally interested in the vindication of her good name  whether these temperate words would of themselves have exercised the pacifying influence at which mr troy aimed may be doubtful but as he ceased speaking a powerful auxiliary appeared in the shape of the beer lady lydiard seized on the jug and filled the tumbler for herself with an unsteady hand miss pink trembling for the integrity of her carpet and scandalized at seeing a peeress drinking beer like a washerwoman forgot the sharp answer that was just rising to her lips when the lawyer interfered small said lady lydiard setting down the empty tumbler and referring to the quality of the beer but very pleasant and refreshing whats the servants name susan well susan i was dying of thirst and you have saved my life you can leave the jugi dare say i shall empty it before i go  mr troy watching miss pinks face saw that it was time to change the subject again  did you notice the old village lady lydiard on your way here he asked the artists consider it one of the most picturesque places in england  i noticed that it was a very dirty village lady lydiard answered still bent on making herself disagreeable to miss pink the artists may say what they please i see nothing to admire in rotten cottages and bad drainage and ignorant people i suppose the neighborhood has its advantages it looks dull enough to my mind  isabel had hitherto modestly restricted her exertions to keeping tommie quiet on her lap like mr troy she occasionally looked at her auntand she now made a timid attempt to defend the neighborhood as a duty that she owed to miss pink  oh my lady dont say its a dull neighborhood she pleaded there are such pretty walks all round us and when you get to the hills the view is beautiful  lady lydiards answer to this was a little masterpiece of goodhumored contempt she patted isabels cheek and said pooh pooh  your ladyship does not admire the beauties of nature miss pink remarked with a compassionate smile as we get older no doubt our sight begins to fail  and we leave off canting about the beauties of nature added lady lydiard i hate the country give me london and the pleasures of society  come come do the country justice lady lydiard put in peacemaking mr troy there is plenty of society to be found out of londonas good society as the world can show  the sort of society added miss pink which is to be found for example in this neighborhood her ladyship is evidently not aware that persons of distinction surround us whichever way we turn i may instance among others the honorable mr hardyman  lady lydiard in the act of pouring out a second glassful of beer suddenly set down the jug  who is that youre talking of miss pink  i am talking of our neighbor lady lydiardthe honorable mr hardyman  do you mean alfred hardymanthe man who breeds the horses  the distinguished gentleman who owns the famous studfarm said miss pink correcting the bluntlydirect form in which lady lydiard had put her question  is he in the habit of visiting here the old lady inquired with a sudden appearance of anxiety do you know him  i had the honor of being introduced to mr hardyman at our last flower show miss pink replied he has not yet favored me with a visit  lady lydiards anxiety appeared to be to some extent relieved  i knew that hardymans farm was in this county she said but i had no notion that it was in the neighborhood of south morden how far away is heten or a dozen miles eh  not more than three miles answered miss pink we consider him quite a near neighbor of ours  renewed anxiety showed itself in lady lydiard she looked round sharply at isabel the girls head was bent so low over the rough head of the dog that her face was almost entirely concealed from view so far as appearances went she seemed to be entirely absorbed in fondling tommie lady lydiard roused her with a tap of the green fan  take tommie out isabel for a run in the garden she said he wont sit still much longerand he may annoy miss pink mr troy will you kindly help isabel to keep my illtrained dog in order  mr troy got on his feet and not very willingly followed isabel out of the room they will quarrel now to a dead certainty he thought to himself as he closed the door have you any idea of what this means he said to his companion as he joined her in the hall what has mr hardyman done to excite all this interest in him  isabels guilty color rose she knew perfectly well that hardymans unconcealed admiration of her was the guiding motive of lady lydiards inquiries if she had told the truth mr troy would have unquestionably returned to the drawingroom with or without an acceptable excuse for intruding himself but isabel was a woman and her answer it is needless to say was i dont know im sure  in the mean time the interview between the two ladies began in a manner which would have astonished mr troythey were both silent for once in her life lady lydiard was considering what she should say before she said it miss pink on her side naturally waited to hear what object her ladyship had in viewwaited until her small reserve of patience gave way urged by irresistible curiosity she spoke first  have you anything to say to me in private she asked  lady lydiard had not got to the end of her reflections she said yesand she said no more  is it anything relating to my niece persisted miss pink  still immersed in her reflections lady lydiard suddenly rose to the surface and spoke her mind as usual  about your niece maam the other day mr hardyman called at my house and saw isabel  yes said miss pink politely attentive but not in the least interested so far  thats not all maam mr hardyman admires isabel he owned it to me himself in so many words  miss pink listened with a courteous inclination of her head she looked mildly gratified nothing more lady lydiard proceeded  you and i think differently on many matters she said but we are both agreed i am sure in feeling the sincerest interest in isabels welfare i beg to suggest to you miss pink that mr hardyman as a near neighbor of yours is a very undesirable neighbor while isabel remains in your house  saying those words under a strong conviction of the serious importance of the subject lady lydiard insensibly recovered the manner and resumed the language which befitted a lady of her rank miss pink noticing the change set it down to an expression of pride on the part of her visitor which in referring to isabel assailed indirectly the social position of isabels aunt  i fail entirely to understand what your ladyship means she said coldly  lady lydiard on her side looked in undisguised amazement at miss pink  havent i told you already that mr hardyman admires your niece she asked  naturally said miss pink isabel inherits her lamented mothers personal advantages if mr hardyman admires her mr hardyman shows his good taste  lady lydiards eyes opened wider and wider in wonder my good lady she exclaimed is it possible you dont know that when a man admires a women he doesnt stop there he falls in love with her as the saying is next  so i have heard said miss pink  so you have heard repeated lady lydiard if mr hardyman finds his way to isabel i can tell you what you will see catch the two together maamand you will see mr hardyman making love to your niece  under due restrictions lady lydiard and with my permission first obtained of course i see no objection to mr hardyman paying his addresses to isabel  the woman is mad cried lady lydiard do you actually suppose miss pink that alfred hardyman could by any earthly possibility marry your niece  not even miss pinks politeness could submit to such a question as this she rose indignantly from her chair as you aware lady lydiard that the doubt you have just expressed is an insult to my niece and a insult to me  are you aware of who mr hardyman really is retorted her ladyship or do you judge of his position by the vocation in life which he has perversely chosen to adopt i can tell you if you do that alfred hardyman is the younger son of one of the oldest barons in the english peerage and that his mother is related by marriage to the royal family of wurtemberg  miss pink received the full shock of this information without receding from her position by a hairbreadth  an english gentlewoman offers a fit alliance to any man living who seeks her hand in marriage said miss pink isabels mother you may not be aware of it was the daughter of an english clergyman  and isabels father was a chemist in a country town added lady lydiard  isabels father rejoined miss pink was attached in a most responsible capacity to the useful and honorable profession of medicine isabel is in the strictest sense of the word a young gentlewoman if you contradict that for a single instant lady lydiard you will oblige me to leave the room  those last words produced a result which miss pink had not anticipatedthey roused lady lydiard to assert herself as usual in such cases she rose superior to her own eccentricity confronting miss pink she now spoke and looked with the gracious courtesy and the unpresuming selfconfidence of the order to which she belonged  for isabels own sake and for the quieting of my conscience she answered i will say one word more miss pink before i relieve you of my presence considering my age and my opportunities i may claim to know quite as much as you do of the laws and customs which regulate society in our time without contesting your nieces social positionand without the slightest intention of insulting youi repeat that the rank which mr hardyman inherits makes it simply impossible for him even to think of marrying isabel you will do well not to give him any opportunities of meeting with her alone and you will do better still seeing that he is so near a neighbor of yours if you permit isabel to return to my protection for a time at least i will wait to hear from you when you have thought the matter over at your leisure in the mean time if i have inadvertently offended you i ask your pardonand i wish you goodevening  she bowed and walked to the door miss pink as resolute as ever in maintaining her pretensions made an effort to match the great lady on her own ground  before you go lady lydiard i beg to apologize if i have spoken too warmly on my side she said permit me to send for your carriage  thank you miss pink my carriage is only at the village inn i shall enjoy a little walk in the cool evening air mr troy i have no doubt will give me his arm she bowed once more and quietly left the room  reaching the little back garden of the villa through an open door at the further end of the hall lady lydiard found tommie rolling luxuriously on miss pinks flowerbeds and isabel and mr troy in close consultation on the gravel walk  she spoke to the lawyer first  they are baiting the horses at the inn she said i want your arm mr troy as far as the villageand in return i will take you back to london with me i have to ask your advice about one or two little matters and this is a good opportunity  with the greatest pleasure lady lydiard i suppose i must say goodby to miss pink  a word of advice to you mr troy take care how you ruffle miss pinks sense of her own importance another word for your private ear miss pink is a fool  on the lawyers withdrawal lady lydiard put her arm fondly round isabels waist what were you and mr troy so busy in talking about she asked  we were talking my lady about tracing the person who stole the money isabel answered rather sadly it seems a far more difficult matter than i supposed it to be i try not to lose patience and hopebut it is a little hard to feel that appearances are against me and to wait day after day in vain for the discovery that is to set me right  you are a dear good child said lady lydiard and you are more precious to me than ever dont despair isabel with mr troys means of inquiring and with my means of paying the discovery of the thief cannot be much longer delayed if you dont return to me soon i shall come back and see you again your aunt hates the sight of mebut i dont care two straws for that remarked lady lydiard showing the undignified side of her character once more listen to me isabel i have no wish to lower your aunt in your estimation but i feel far more confidence in your good sense than in hers mr hardymans business has taken him to france for the present it is at least possible that you may meet with him on his return if you do keep him at a distance my dearpolitely of course there there you neednt turn red i am not blaming you i am only giving you a little good advice in your position you cannot possibly be too careful here is mr troy you must come to the gate with us isabel or we shall never get tommie away from you i am only his second favorite you have the first place in his affections god bless and prosper you my childi wish to heaven you were going back to london with me well mr troy how have you done with miss pink have you offended that terrible gentlewoman hateful word or has it been all the other way and has she given you a kiss at parting  mr troy smiled mysteriously and changed the subject his brief parting interview with the lady of the house was not of a nature to be rashly related miss pink had not only positively assured him that her visitor was the most illbred woman she had ever met with but had further accused lady lydiard of shaking her confidence in the aristocracy of her native country for the first time in my life said miss pink i feel that something is to be said for the republican point of view and i am not indisposed to admit that the constitution of the united states has its advantages     chapter xii  the conference between lady lydiard and mr troy on the way back to london led to some practical results  hearing from her legal adviser that the inquiry after the missing money was for a moment at a standstill lady lydiard made one of those bold suggestions with which she was accustomed to startle her friends in cases of emergency she had heard favorable reports of the extraordinary ingenuity of the french police and she now proposed sending to paris for assistance after first consulting her nephew mr felix sweetsir felix knows paris as well as he knows london she remarked he is an idle man and it is quite likely that he will relieve us of all trouble by taking the matter into his own hands in any case he is sure to know who are the right people to address in our present necessity what do you say  mr troy in reply expressed his doubts as to the wisdom of employing foreigners in a delicate investigation which required an accurate knowledge of english customs and english character waiving this objection he approved of the idea of consulting her ladyships nephew mr sweetsir is a man of the world he said in putting the case before him we are sure to have it presented to us from a new point of view acting on this favorable expression of opinion lady lydiard wrote to her nephew on the day after the visit to miss pink the proposed council of three was held at lady lydiards house  felix never punctual at keeping an appointment was even later than usual on this occasion he made his apologies with his hand pressed upon his forehead and his voice expressive of the languor and discouragement of a suffering man  the beastly english climate is telling on my nerves said mr sweetsirthe horrid weight of the atmosphere after the exhilarating air of paris the intolerable dirt and dullness of london you know i was in bed my dear aunt when i received your letter you may imagine the completely demoralised state i was in when i tell you of the effect which the news of the robbery produced on me i fell back on my pillow as if i had been shot your ladyship should really be a little more careful in communicating these disagreeable surprises to a sensitivelyorganised man never mindmy valet is a perfect treasure he brought me some drops of ether on a lump of sugar i said alfred his name is alfred put me into my clothes alfred put me in i assure you it reminded me of my young days when i was put into my first pair of trousers has alfred forgotten anything have i got my braces on have i come out in my shirtsleeves well dear auntwell mr troywhat can i say what can i do  lady lydiard entirely without sympathy for nervous suffering nodded to the lawyer you tell him she said  i believe i speak for her ladyship mr troy began when i say that we should like to hear in the first place how the whole case strikes you mr sweetsir  tell it me all over again said felix  patient mr troy told it all over againand waited for the result  well said felix  well said mr troy where does the suspicion of robbery rest in your opinion you look at the theft of the banknote with a fresh eye  you mentioned a clergyman just now said felix the man you know to whom the money was sent what was his name  the reverend samuel bradstock  you want me to name the person whom i suspect  yes if you please said mr troy  i suspect the reverend samuel bradstock said felix  if you have come here to make stupid jokes interposed lady lydiard you had better go back to your bed again we want a serious opinion  you have a serious opinion felix coolly rejoined i never was more in earnest in my life your ladyship is not aware of the first principle to be adopted in cases of suspicion one proceeds on what i will call the exhaustive system of reasoning thus does suspicion point to the honest servants downstairs no to your ladyships adopted daughter appearances are against the poor girl but you know her better than to trust to appearances are you suspicious of moody no of hardymanwho was in the house at the time ridiculous but i was in the house at the time too do you suspect me just so that idea is ridiculous too now let us sum up servants adopted daughter moody hardyman sweetsirall beyond suspicion who is left the reverend samuel bradstock  this ingenious exposition of the exhaustive system of reasoning failed to produce any effect on lady lydiard you are wasting our time she said sharply you know as well as i do that you are talking nonsense  i dont said felix taking the gentlemanly professions all round i know of no men who are so eager to get money and who have so few scruples about how they get it as the parsons where is there a man in any other profession who perpetually worries you for moneywho holds the bag under your nose for moneywho sends his clerk round from door to door to beg a few shillings of you and calls it an easter offering the parson does all this bradstock is a parson i put it logically bowl me over if you can  mr troy attempted to bowl him over nevertheless lady lydiard wisely interposed  when a man persists in talking nonsense she said silence is the best answer anything else only encourages him she turned to felix i have a question to ask you she went on you will either give me a serious reply or wish me goodmorning with this brief preface she made her inquiry as to the wisdom and possibility of engaging the services of the french police  felix took exactly the view of the matter which had been already expressed by mr troy superior in intelligence he said but not superior in courage to the english police capable of performing wonders on their own ground and among their own people but my dear aunt the two most dissimilar nations on the face of the earth are the english and the french the french police may speak our languagebut they are incapable of understanding our national character and our national manners set them to work on a private inquiry in the city of pekinand they would get on in time with the chinese people set them to work in the city of londonand the english people would remain from first to last the same impenetrable mystery to them in my belief the london sunday would be enough of itself to drive them back to paris in despair no balls no concerts no theaters not even a museum or a picturegallery open every shop shut up but the ginshop and nothing moving but the church bells and the men who sell the penny ices hundreds of frenchmen come to see me on their first arrival in england every man of them rushes back to paris on the second saturday of his visit rather than confront the horrors of a second sunday in london however you can try it if you like send me a written abstract of the case and i will forward it to one of the official people in the rue jerusalem who will do anything he can to oblige me of course said felix turning to mr troy some of you have got the number of the lost banknote if the thief has tried to pass it in paris my man may be of some use to you  three of us have got the number of the note answered mr troy miss isabel miller mr moody and myself  very good said felix send me the number with the abstract of the case is there anything else i can do towards recovering the money he asked turning to his aunt there is one lucky circumstance in connection with this lossisnt there it has fallen on a person who is rich enough to take it easy good heavens suppose it had been my loss  it has fallen doubly on me said lady lydiard and i am certainly not rich enough to take it that easy the money was destined to a charitable purpose and i have felt it my duty to pay it again  felix rose and approached his aunts chair with faltering steps as became a suffering man he took lady lydiards hand and kissed it with enthusiastic admiration  you excellent creature he said you may not think it but you reconcile me to human nature how generous how noble i think ill go to bed again mr troy if you really dont want any more of me my head feels giddy and my legs tremble under me it doesnt matter i shall feel easier when alfred has taken me out of my clothes again god bless you my dear aunt i never felt so proud of being related to you as i do today goodmorning mr troy dont forget the abstract of the case and dont trouble yourself to see me to the door i dare say i shant tumble downstairs and if i do theres the porter in the hall to pick me up again enviable porter as fat as butter and as idle as a pig au revoir au revoir he kissed his hand and drifted feebly out of the room sweetsir one might say in a state of eclipse but still the serviceable sweetsir who was never consulted in vain by the fortunate people privileged to call him friend  is he really ill do you think mr troy asked  my nephew has turned fifty lady lydiard answered and he persists in living as if he was a young man every now and then nature says to him felix you are old and felix goes to bed and says its his nerves  i suppose he is to be trusted to keep his word about writing to paris pursued the lawyer  oh yes he may delay doing it but he will do it in spite of his lackadaisical manner he has moments of energy that would surprise you talking of surprises i have something to tell you about moody within the last day or two there has been a marked change in hima change for the worse  you astonish me lady lydiard in what way has moody deteriorated  you shall hear yesterday was friday you took him out with you on business early in the morning  mr troy bowed and said nothing he had not thought it desirable to mention the interview at which old sharon had cheated him of his guinea  in the course of the afternoon pursued lady lydiard i happened to want him and i was informed that moody had gone out again where had he gone nobody knew had he left word when he would be back he had left no message of any sort of course he is not in the position of an ordinary servant i dont expect him to ask permission to go out but i do expect him to leave word downstairs of the time at which he is likely to return when he did come back after an absence of some hours i naturally asked for an explanation would you believe it he simply informed me that he had been away on business of his own expressed no regret and offered no explanationin short spoke as if he was an independent gentleman you may not think it but i kept my temper i merely remarked that i hoped it would not happen again he made me a bow and he said my business is not completed yet my lady i cannot guarantee that it may not call me away again at a moments notice what do you think of that nine people out of ten would have given him warning to leave their service i begin to think i am a wonderful womani only pointed to the door one does hear sometimes of mens brains softening in the most unexpected manner i have my suspicions of moodys brains i can tell you  mr troys suspicions took a different direction they pointed along the line of streets which led to old sharons lodgings discreetly silent as to the turn which his thoughts had taken he merely expressed himself as feeling too much surprised to offer any opinion at all  wait a little said lady lydiard i havent done surprising you yet you have been a boy here in a pages livery i think well he is a good boy and he has gone home for a weeks holiday with his friends the proper person to supply his place with the boots and shoes and other small employments is of course the youngest footman a lad only a few years older than himself what do you think moody does engages a stranger with the house full of idle menservants already to fill the pages place at intervals this morning i heard them wonderfully merry in the servants hallso merry that the noise and laughter found its way upstairs to the breakfastroom i like my servants to be in good spirits but it certainly did strike me that they were getting beyond reasonable limits i questioned my maid and was informed that the noise was all due to the jokes of the strangest old man that ever was seen in other words to the person whom my steward had taken it on himself to engage in the pages absence i spoke to moody on the subject he answered in an odd confused way that he had exercised his discretion to the best of his judgment and that if i wished it he would tell the old man to keep his good spirits under better control i asked him how he came to hear of the man he only answered by accident my ladyand not one more word could i get out of him good or bad moody engages the servants as you know but on every other occasion he has invariably consulted me before an engagement was settled i really dont feel at all sure about this person who has been so strangely introduced into the househe may be a drunkard or a thief i wish you would speak to moody yourself mr troy do you mind ringing the bell  mr troy rose as a matter of course and rang the bell  he was by this time it is needless to say convinced that moody had not only gone back to consult old sharon on his own responsibility but worse still had taken the unwarrantable liberty of introducing him as a spy into the house to communicate this explanation to lady lydiard would in her present humor be simply to produce the dismissal of the steward from her service the only other alternative was to ask leave to interrogate moody privately and after duly reproving him to insist on the departure of old sharon as the one condition on which mr troy would consent to keep lady lydiard in ignorance of the truth  i think i shall manage better with moody if your ladyship will permit me to see him in private the lawyer said shall i go downstairs and speak with him in his own room  why should you trouble yourself to do that said her ladyship see him here and i will go into the boudoir  as she made that reply the footman appeared at the drawingroom door  send moody here said lady lydiard  the footmans answer delivered at that moment assumed an importance which was not expressed in the footmans words my lady he said mr moody has gone out     chapter xiii  while the strange proceedings of the steward were the subject of conversation between lady lydiard and mr troy moody was alone in his room occupied in writing to isabel being unwilling that any eyes but his own should see the address he had himself posted his letter the time that he had chosen for leaving the house proving unfortunately to be also the time proposed by her ladyship for his interview with the lawyer in ten minutes after the footman had reported his absence moody returned it was then too late to present himself in the drawingroom in the interval mr troy had taken his leave and moodys position had dropped a degree lower in lady lydiards estimation  isabel received her letter by the next mornings post if any justification of mr troys suspicions had been needed the terms in which moody wrote would have amply supplied it   dear isabel i hope i may call you isabel without offending you in your present troublei have a proposal to make which whether you accept it or not i beg you will keep a secret from every living creature but ourselves you will understand my request when i add that these lines relate to the matter of tracing the stolen banknote  i have been privately in communication with a person in london who is as i believe the one person competent to help us in gaining our end he has already made many inquiries in private with some of them i am acquainted the rest he has thus far kept to himself the person to whom i allude particularly wishes to have half an hours conversation with you in my presence i am bound to warn you that he is a very strange and very ugly old man and i can only hope that you will look over his personal appearance in consideration of what he is likely to do for your future advantage  can you conveniently meet us at the further end of the row of villas in which your aunt lives the day after tomorrow at four oclock let me have a line to say if you will keep the appointment and if the hour named will suit you and believe me your devoted friend and servant  robert moody   the lawyers warning to her to be careful how she yielded too readily to any proposal of moodys recurred to isabels mind while she read those lines being pledged to secrecy she could not consult mr troyshe was left to decide for herself  no obstacle stood in the way of her free choice of alternatives after their early dinner at three oclock miss pink habitually retired to her own room to meditate as she expressed it her meditations inevitably ended in a sound sleep of some hours and during that interval isabel was at liberty to do as she pleased after considerable hesitation her implicit belief in moodys truth and devotion assisted by a strong feeling of curiosity to see the companion with whom the steward had associated himself decided isabel on consenting to keep the appointment  taking up her position beyond the houses on the day and at the hour mentioned by moody she believed herself to be fully prepared for the most unfavorable impression which the most disagreeable of all possible strangers could produce  but the first appearance of old sharonas dirty as ever clothed in a long frowzy gray overcoat with his pugdog at his heels and his smokeblackened pipe in his mouth with a tan white hat on his head which looked as if it had been picked up in a gutter a hideous leer in his eyes and a jaunty trip in his walktook her so completely by surprise that she could only return moodys friendly greeting by silently pressing his hand as for moodys companion to look at him for a second time was more than she had resolution to do she kept her eyes fixed on the pugdog and with good reason as far as appearances went he was indisputably the nobler animal of the two  under the circumstances the interview threatened to begin in a very embarrassing manner moody disheartened by isabels silence made no attempt to set the conversation going he looked as if he meditated a hasty retreat to the railway station which he had just left fortunately he had at his side the right man for once in the right place old sharons effrontery was equal to any emergency  i am not a nicelooking old man my dear am i he said leering at isabel with cunning halfclosed eyes bless your heart youll soon get used to me you see i am the sort of color as they say at the linendrapers that doesnt wash well its all through love upon my life it is early in the present century i had my young affections blighted and ive neglected myself ever since disappointment takes different forms miss in different men i dont think i have had heart enough to brush my hair for the last fifty years she was a magnificent woman mr moody and she dropped me like a hot potato dreadful dreadful let us pursue this painful subject no further ha heres a pretty country heres a nice blue sky i admire the country miss i see so little of it you know have you any objection to walk along into the fields the fields my dear bring out all the poetry of my nature wheres the dog here puggy puggy hunt about my man and find some doggrass does his inside good you know after a meat diet in london lord how i feel my spirits rising in this fine air does my complexion look any brighter miss will you run a race with me mr moody or will you oblige me with a back at leapfrog im not mad my dear young lady im only merry i live you see in the london stink and the smell of the hedges and the wild flowers is too much for me at first it gets into my head it does im drunk as i live by bread im drunk on fresh air oh what a jolly day oh how young and innocent i do feel here his innocence got the better of him and he began to sing i wish i were a little fly in my loves bosom for to lie hullo here we are on the nice soft grass and oh my gracious theres a bank running down into a hollow i cant stand that you know mr moody hold my hat and take the greatest care of it here goes for a roll down the bank  he handed his horrible hat to the astonished moody laid himself flat on the top of the bank and deliberately rolled down it exactly as he might have done when he was a boy the tails of his long gray coat flew madly in the wind the dog pursued him jumping over him and barking with delight he shouted and screamed in answer to the dog as he rolled over and over faster and faster and when he got up on the level ground and called out cheerfully to his companions standing above him i say you two i feel twenty years younger alreadyhuman gravity could hold out no longer the sad and silent moody smiled and isabel burst into fits of laughter  there he said didnt i tell you you would get used to me miss theres a deal of life left in the old man yetisnt there shy me down my hat mr moody and now well get to business he turned round to the dog still barking at his heels business puggy he called out sharply and puggy instantly shut up his mouth and said no more  well now old sharon resumed when he had joined his friends and had got his breath again lets have a little talk about yourself miss has mr moody told you who i am and what i want with you very good may i offer you my arm no you like to be independent dont you all righti dont object i am an amiable old man i am about this lady lydiard now suppose you tell me how you first got acquainted with her  in some surprise at this question isabel told her little story observing sharons face while she was speaking moody saw that he was not paying the smallest attention to the narrative his sharp shameless black eyes watched the girls face absently his gross lips curled upwards in a sardonic and selfsatisfied smile he was evidently setting a trap for her of some kind without a word of warningwhile isabel was in the middle of a sentencethe trap opened with the opening of old sharons lips  i say he burst out how came you to seal her ladyships lettereh  the question bore no sort of relation direct or indirect to what isabel happened to be saying at the moment in the sudden surprise of hearing it she started and fixed her eyes in astonishment on sharons face the old vagabond chuckled to himself did you see that he whispered to moody i beg your pardon miss he went on i wont interrupt you again lord how interesting it isaint it mr moody please to go on miss  but isabel though she spoke with perfect sweetness and temper declined to go on i had better tell you sir how i came to seal her ladyships letter she said if i may venture on giving my opinion that part of my story seems to be the only part of it which relates to your business with me today  without further preface she described the circumstances which had led to her assuming the perilous responsibility of sealing the letter old sharons wandering attention began to wander again he was evidently occupied in setting another trap for the second time he interrupted isabel in the middle of a sentence suddenly stopping short he pointed to some sheep at the further end of the field through which they happened to be passing at the moment  theres a pretty sight he said there are the innocent sheep afeedingall following each other as usual and theres the sly dog waiting behind the gate till the sheep wants his services reminds me of old sharon and the public he chuckled over the discovery of the remarkable similarity between the sheepdog and himself and the sheep and the publicand then burst upon isabel with a second question i say didnt you look at the letter before you sealed it  certainly not isabel answered  not even at the address  no  thinking of something elseeh  very likely said isabel  was it your new bonnet my dear  isabel laughed women are not always thinking of their new bonnets she answered  old sharon to all appearance dropped the subject there he lifted his lean brown forefinger and pointed againthis time to a house at a short distance from them thats a farmhouse surely he said im thirsty after my roll down the hill do you think miss they would give me a drink of milk  i am sure they would said isabel i know the people shall i go and ask them  thank you my dear one word more before you go about the sealing of that letter what could you have been thinking of while you were doing it he looked hard at her and took her suddenly by the arm was it your sweetheart he asked in a whisper  the question instantly reminded isabel that she had been thinking of hardyman while she sealed the letter she blushed as the remembrance crossed her mind robert noticing the embarrassment spoke sharply to old sharon you have no right to put such a question to a young lady he said be a little more careful for the future  there there dont be hard on me pleaded the old rogue an ugly old man like me may make his innocent little jokeeh miss im sure youre too sweettempered to be angry when i meant no offense show me that you bear no malice go like a forgiving young angel and ask for the milk  nobody appealed to isabels sweetness of temper in vain i will do it with pleasure she saidand hastened away to the farmhouse     chapter xiv  the instant isabel was out of hearing old sharon slapped moody on the shoulder to rouse his attention ive got her out of the way he said now listen to me my business with the young angel is donei may go back to london  moody looked at him with astonishment  lord how little you know of thieves exclaimed old sharon why man alive i have tried her with two plain tests if you wanted a proof of her innocence there it was as plain as the nose in your face did you hear me ask her how she came to seal the letterjust when her mind was running on something else  i heard you said moody  did you see how she started and stared at me  i did  well i can tell you thisif she had stolen the money she would neither have started nor stared she would have had her answer ready beforehand in her own mind in case of accidents theres only one thing in my experience that you can never do with a thief when a thief happens to be a womanyou can never take her by surprise put that remark by in your mind one day you may find a use for remembering it did you see her blush and look quite hurt in her feelings pretty dear when i asked about her sweetheart do you think a thief in her place would have shown such a face as that not she the thief would have been relieved the thief would have said to herself all right the more the old fool talks about sweethearts the further he is from tracing the robbery to me yes yes the grounds cleared now master moody ive reckoned up the servants ive questioned miss isabel ive made my inquiries in all the other quarters that may be useful to usand whats the result the advice i gave when you and the lawyer first came to mei hate that fellowremains as sound and good advice as ever i have got the thief in my mind said old sharon closing his cunning eyes and then opening them again as plain as ive got you in my eye at this minute no more of that now he went on looking round sharply at the path that led to the farmhouse ive something particular to say to youand theres barely time to say it before that nice girl comes back look here do you happen to be acquainted with mrhonorablehardymans valet  moodys eyes rested on old sharon with a searching and doubtful look  mr hardymans valet he repeated i wasnt prepared to hear mr hardymans name  old sharon looked at moody in his turn with a flash of sardonic triumph  oho he said has my good boy learned his lesson do you see the thief through my spectacles already  i began to see him moody answered when you gave us the guinea opinion at your lodgings  will you whisper his name asked old sharon  not yet i distrust my own judgment i wait till time proves that you are right  old sharon knitted his shaggy brows and shook his head if you had only a little more dash and go in you he said you would be a clever fellow as it is he finished the sentence by snapping his fingers with a grin of contempt lets get to business are you going back by the next train along with me or are you going to stop with the young lady  i will follow you by a later train moody answered  then i must give you my instructions at once sharon continued you get better acquainted with hardymans valet lend him money if he wants itstick at nothing to make a bosom friend of him i cant do that part of it my appearance would be against me you are the manyou are respectable from the top of your hat to the tips of your boots nobody would suspect you dont make objections can you fix the valet or cant you  i can try said moody and what then  old sharon put his gross lips disagreeably close to moodys ear  your friend the valet can tell you who his masters bankers are he said and he can supply you with a specimen of his masters handwriting  moody drew back as suddenly as if his vagabond companion had put a knife to his throat you old villain he said are you tempting me to forgery  you infernal fool retorted old sharon will you hold that long tongue of yours and hear what i have to say you go to hardymans bankers with a note in hardymans handwriting exactly imitated by me to this effectmr h presents his compliments to messrs soandso and is not quite certain whether a payment of five hundred pounds has been made within the last week to his account he will be much obliged if messrs soandso will inform him by a line in reply whether there is such an entry to his credit in their books and by whom the payment has been made you wait for the bankers answer and bring it to me its just possible that the name youre afraid to whisper may appear in the letter if it does weve caught our man is that forgery mr muddlehead moody ill tell you whatif i had lived to be your age and knew no more of the world than you do id go and hang myself steady heres our charming friend with the milk remember your instructions and dont lose heart if my notion of the payment to the bankers comes to nothing i know what to do next in that caseand whats more ill take all the risk and trouble on my own shoulders oh lord im afraid i shall be obliged to drink the milk now its come  with this apprehension in his mind he advanced to relieve isabel of the jug that she carried  heres a treat he burst out with an affectation of joy which was completely belied by the expression of his dirty face heres a kind and dear young lady to help an old man to a drink with her own pretty hands he paused and looked at the milk very much as he might have looked at a dose of physic will anyone take a drink first he asked offering the jug piteously to isabel and moody you see im not wed to genuine milk im used to chalk and water i dont know what effect the unadulterated cow might have on my poor old inside he tasted the milk with the greatest caution upon my soul this is too rich for me the unadulterated cow is a deal too strong to be drunk alone if youll allow me ill qualify it with a drop of gin here puggy puggy he set the milk down before the dog and taking a flask out of his pocket emptied it at a draught thats something like he said smacking his lips with an air of infinite relief so sorry miss to have given you all your trouble for nothing its my ignorance thats to blame not me i couldnt know i was unworthy of genuine milk till i triedcould i and do you know he proceeded with his eyes directed slyly on the way back to the station i begin to think im not worthy of the fresh air either a kind of longing seems to come over me for the london stink im homesick already for the soot of my happy childhood and my own dear native mud the air here is too thin for me and the skys too clean andoh lordwhen youre wed to the roar of the trafficthe busses and the cabs and what notthe silence in these parts is downright awful ill wish you good evening miss and get back to london  isabel turned to moody with disappointment plainly expressed in her face and manner  is that all he has to say she asked you told me he could help us you led me to suppose he could find the guilty person  sharon heard her i could name the guilty person he answered as easily miss as i could name you  why dont you do it then isabel inquired not very patiently  because the times not ripe for it yet missthats one reason because if i mentioned the thiefs name as things are now you miss isabel would think me mad and you would tell mr moody i had cheated him out of his moneythats another reason the matters in train if you will only wait a little longer  so you say isabel rejoined if you really could name the thief i believe you would do it now  she turned away with a frown on her pretty face old sharon followed her even his coarse sensibilities appeared to feel the irresistible ascendancy of beauty and youth  i say he began we must part friends you knowor i shall break my heart over it they have got milk at the farmhouse do you think they have got pen ink and paper too  isabel answered without turning to look at him of course they have  and a bit of sealingwax  i daresay  old sharon laid his dirty claws on her shoulder and forced her to face him as the best means of shaking them off  come along he said i am going to pacify you with some information in writing  why should you write it isabel asked suspiciously  because i mean to make my own conditions my dear before i let you into the secret  in ten minutes more they were all three in the farmhouse parlor nobody but the farmers wife was at home the good woman trembled from head to foot at the sight of old sharon in all her harmless life she had never yet seen humanity under the aspect in which it was now presented to her mercy preserve us miss she whispered to isabel how come you to be in such company as that instructed by isabel she produced the necessary materials for writing and sealingand that done she shrank away to the door please to excuse me miss she said with a last horrified look at her venerable visitor i really cant stand the sight of such a blot of dirt as that in my nice clean parlor with those words she disappeared and was seen no more  perfectly indifferent to his reception old sharon wrote inclosed what he had written in an envelope and sealed it in the absence of anything better fitted for his purpose with the mouthpiece of his pipe  now miss he said you give me your word of honorhe stopped and looked round at moody with a grinand you give me yours that you wont either of you break the seal on this envelope till the expiration of one week from the present day there are the conditions miss isabel on which ill give you your information if you stop to dispute with me the candles alight and ill burn it  it was useless to contend with him isabel and moody gave him the promise that he required he handed the sealed envelope to isabel with a low bow when the weeks out he said you will own im a cleverer fellow than you think me now wish you good evening miss come along puggy farewell to the horrid clean country and back again to the nice london stink  he nodded to moodyhe leered at isabelhe chuckled to himselfhe left the farmhouse     chapter xv  isabel looked down at the letter in her handconsidered it in silenceand turned to moody i feel tempted to open it already she said  after giving your promise moody gently remonstrated  isabel met that objection with a womans logic  does a promise matter she asked when one gives it to a dirty disreputable presuming old wretch like mr sharon its a wonder to me that you trust such a creature i wouldnt  i doubted him just as you do moody answered when i first saw him in company with mr troy but there was something in the advice he gave us at that first consultation which altered my opinion of him for the better i dislike his appearance and his manners as much as you doi may even say i felt ashamed of bringing such a person to see you and yet i cant think that i have acted unwisely in employing mr sharon  isabel listened absently she had something more to say and she was considering how she should say it may i ask you a bold question she began  any question you like  have you she hesitated and looked embarrassed have you paid mr sharon much money she resumed suddenly rallying her courage instead of answering moody suggested that it was time to think of returning to miss pinks villa your aunt may be getting anxious about you he said  isabel led the way out of the farmhouse in silence she reverted to mr sharon and the money however as they returned by the path across the fields  i am sure you will not be offended with me she said gently if i own that i am uneasy about the expense i am allowing you to use your purse as if it was mineand i have hardly any savings of my own  moody entreated her not to speak of it how can i put my money to a better use than in serving your interests he asked my one object in life is to relieve you of your present anxieties i shall be the happiest man living if you only owe a moments happiness to my exertions  isabel took his hand and looked at him with grateful tears in her eyes  how good you are to me mr moody she said i wish i could tell you how deeply i feel your kindness  you can do it easily he answered with a smile call me robertdont call me mr moody  she took his arm with a sudden familiarity that charmed him if you had been my brother i should have called you robert she said and no brother could have been more devoted to me than you are  he looked eagerly at her bright face turned up to his may i never hope to be something nearer and dearer to you than a brother he asked timidly  she hung her head and said nothing moodys memory recalled sharons coarse reference to her sweetheart she had blushed when he put the question what had she done when moody put his question her face answered for hershe had turned pale she was looking more serious than usual ignorant as he was of the ways of women his instinct told him that this was a bad sign surely her rising color would have confessed it if time and gratitude together were teaching her to love him he sighed as the inevitable conclusion forced itself on his mind  i hope i have not offended you he said sadly  oh no  i wish i had not spoken pray dont think that i am serving you with any selfish motive  i dont think that robert i never could think it of you  he was not quite satisfied yet even if you were to marry some other man he went on earnestly it would make no difference in what i am trying to do for you no matter what i might suffer i should still go onfor your sake  why do you talk so she burst out passionately no other man has such a claim as you to my gratitude and regard how can you let such thoughts come to you i have done nothing in secret i have no friends who are not known to you be satisfied with that robertand let us drop the subject  never to take it up again he asked with the infatuated pertinacity of a man clinging to his last hope  at other times and under other circumstances isabel might have answered him sharply she spoke with perfect gentleness now  not for the present she said i dont know my own heart give me time  his gratitude caught at those words as the drowning man is said to catch at the proverbial straw he lifted her hand and suddenly and fondly pressed his lips on it she showed no confusion was she sorry for him poor wretchand was that all  they walked on arminarm in silence  crossing the last field they entered again on the high road leading to the row of villas in which miss pink lived the minds of both were preoccupied neither of them noticed a gentleman approaching on horseback followed by a mounted groom he was advancing slowly at the walkingpace of his horse and he only observed the two footpassengers when he was close to them  miss isabel  she started looked up and discoveredalfred hardyman  he was dressed in a perfectlymade travelling suit of light brown with a peaked felt hat of a darker shade of the same color which in a picturesque sense greatly improved his personal appearance his pleasure at discovering isabel gave the animation to his features which they wanted on ordinary occasions he sat his horse a superb hunter easily and gracefully his light ambercolored gloves fitted him perfectly his obedient servant on another magnificent horse waited behind him he looked the impersonation of rank and breedingof wealth and prosperity what a contrast in a womans eyes to the shy pale melancholy man in the illfitting black clothes with the wandering uneasy glances who stood beneath him and felt and showed that he felt his inferior position keenly in spite of herself the treacherous blush flew over isabels face in moodys presence and with moodys eyes distrustfully watching her  this is a piece of good fortune that i hardly hoped for said hardyman his cool quiet dreary way of speaking quickened as usual in isabels presence i only got back from france this morning and i called on lady lydiard in the hope of seeing you she was not at homeand you were in the countryand the servants didnt know the address i could get nothing out of them except that you were on a visit to a relation he looked at moody while he was speaking havent i seen you before he said carelessly yes at lady lydiards youre her steward are you not how dye do moody with h is eyes on the ground answered silently by a bow hardyman perfectly indifferent whether lady lydiards steward spoke or not turned on his saddle and looked admiringly at isabel i begin to think i am a lucky man at last he went on with a smile i was jogging along to my farm and despairing of ever seeing miss isabel againand miss isabel herself meets me at the roadside i wonder whether you are as glad to see me as i am to see you you wont tell meeh may i ask you something else are you staying in our neighborhood  there was no alternative before isabel but to answer this last question hardyman had met her out walking and had no doubt drawn the inevitable inferencealthough he was too polite to say so in plain words  yes sir she answered shyly i am staying in this neighborhood  and who is your relation hardyman proceeded in his easy matterofcourse way lady lydiard told me when i had the pleasure of meeting you at her house that you had an aunt living in the country i have a good memory miss isabel for anything that i hear about you its your aunt isnt it yes i know everybody about hew what is your aunts name  isabel still resting her hand on roberts arm felt it tremble a little as hardyman made this last inquiry if she had been speaking to one of her equals she would have known how to dispose of the question without directly answering it but what could she say to the magnificent gentleman on the stately horse he had only to send his servant into the village to ask who the young lady from london was staying with and the answer in a dozen mouths at least would direct him to her aunt she cast one appealing look at moody and pronounced the distinguished name of miss pink  miss pink hardyman repeated surely i know miss pink he had not the faintest remembrances of her where did i meet her last he ran over in his memory the different local festivals at which strangers had been introduced to him was it at the archery meeting or at the grammarschool when the prizes were given no it must have been at the flower show then surely  it had been at the flower show isabel had heard it from miss pink fifty times at least and was obliged to admit it now  i am quite ashamed of never having called hardyman proceeded the fact is i have so much to do i am a bad one at paying visits are you on your way home let me follow you and make my apologies personally to miss pink  moody looked at isabel it was only a momentary glance but she perfectly understood it  i am afraid sir my aunt cannot have the honor of seeing you today she said  hardyman was all compliance he smiled and patted his horses neck tomorrow then he said my compliments and i will call in the afternoon let me see miss pink lives at he waited as if he expected isabel to assist his treacherous memory once more she hesitated again hardyman looked round at his groom the groom could find out the address even if he did not happen to know it already besides there was the little row of houses visible at the further end of the road isabel pointed to the villas as a necessary concession to good manners before the groom could anticipate her my aunt lives there sir at the house called the lawn  ah to be sure said hardyman i oughtnt to have wanted reminding but i have so many things to think of at the farm and i am afraid i must be getting oldmy memory isnt as good as it was i am so glad to have seen you miss isabel you and your aunt must come and look at my horses do you like horses are you fond of riding i have a quiet roan mare that is used to carrying ladies she would be just the thing for you did i beg you to give my best compliments to your aunt yes how well you are looking our air here agrees with you i hope i havent kept you standing too long i didnt think of it in the pleasure of meeting you goodby miss isabel goodby till tomorrow  he took off his hat to isabel nodded to moody and pursued his way to the farm  isabel looked at her companion his eyes were still on the ground pale silent motionless he waited by her like a dog until she gave the signal of walking on again towards the house  you are not angry with me for speaking to mr hardyman she asked anxiously  he lifted his head it the sound of her voice angry with you my dear why should i be angry  you seem so changed robert since we met mr hardyman i couldnt help speaking to himcould i  certainly not  they moved on towards the villa isabel was still uneasy there was something in moodys silent submission to all that she said and all that she did which pained and humiliated her youre not jealous she said smiling timidly  he tried to speak lightly on his side i have no time to be jealous while i have your affairs to look after he answered  she pressed his arm tenderly never fear robert that new friends will make me forget the best and dearest friend who is now at my side she paused and looked up at him with a compassionate fondness that was very pretty to see i can keep out of the way tomorrow when mr hardyman calls she said it is my aunt he is coming to seenot me  it was generously meant but while her mind was only occupied with the present time moodys mind was looking into the future he was learning the hard lesson of selfsacrifice already do what you think is right he said quietly dont think of me  they reached the gate of the villa he held out his hand to say goodby  wont you come in she asked do come in  not now my dear i must get back to london as soon as i can there is some more work to be done for you and the sooner i do it the better  she heard his excuse without heeding it  you are not like yourself robert she said why is it what are you thinking of  he was thinking of the bright blush that overspread her face when hardyman first spoke to her he was thinking of the invitation to her to see the studfarm and to ride the roan mare he was thinking of the utterly powerless position in which he stood towards isabel and towards the highlyborn gentleman who admired her but he kept his doubts and fears to himself the train wont wait for me he said and held out his hand once more  she was not only perplexed she was really distressed dont take leave of me in that cold way she pleaded her eyes dropped before his and her lips trembled a little give me a kiss robert at parting she said those bold words softly and sadly out of the depth of her pity for him he started his face brightened suddenly his sinking hope rose again in another moment the change came in another moment he understood her as he touched her cheek with his lips he turned pale again dont quite forget me he said in low faltering tonesand left her  miss pink met isabel in the hall refreshed by unbroken repose the exschoolmistress was in the happiest frame of mind for the reception of her nieces news  informed that moody had travelled to south morden to personally report the progress of the inquiries miss pink highly approved of him as a substitute for mr troy mr moody as a bankers son is a gentleman by birth she remarked he has condescended in becoming lady lydiards steward what i saw of him when he came here with you prepossessed me in his favor he has my confidence isabel as well as yourshe is in every respect a superior person to mr troy did you meet any friends my dear when you were out walking  the answer to this question produced a species of transformation in miss pink the rapturous rankworship of her nation feasted so to speak on hardymans message she looked taller and younger than usualshe was all smiles and sweetness at last isabel you have seen birth and breeding under their right aspect she said in the society of lady lydiard you cannot possibly have formed correct ideas of the english aristocracy observe mr hardyman when he does me the honor to call tomorrowand you will see the difference  mr hardyman is your visitor auntnot mine i was going to ask you to let me remain upstairs in my room  miss pink was unaffectedly shocked this is what you learn at lady lydiards she observed no isabel your absence would be a breach of good mannersi cannot possibly permit it you will be present to receive our distinguished friend with me and mind this added miss pink in her most impressive manner if mr hardyman should by any chance ask why you have left lady lydiard not one word about those disgraceful circumstances which connect you with the loss of the banknote i should sink into the earth if the smallest hint of what has really happened should reach mr hardymans ears my child i stand towards you in the place of your lamented mother i have the right to command your silence on this horrible subject and i do imperatively command it  in these words foolish miss pink sowed the seed for the harvest of trouble that was soon to come     chapter xvi  paying his court to the exschoolmistress on the next day hardyman made such excellent use of his opportunities that the visit to the studfarm took place on the day after his own carriage was placed at the disposal of isabel and her aunt and his own sister was present to confer special distinction on the reception of miss pink  in a country like england which annually suspends the sitting of its legislature in honor of a horserace it is only natural and proper that the comfort of the horses should be the first object of consideration at a studfarm ninetenths of the land at hardymans farm was devoted in one way or another to the noble quadruped with the low forehead and the long nose poor humanity was satisfied with secondrate and thirdrate accommodation the ornamental grounds very poorly laid out were also very limited in extentand as for the dwellinghouse it was literally a cottage a parlor and a kitchen a smokingroom a bedroom and a spare chamber for a friend all scantily furnished sufficed for the modest wants of the owner of the property if you wished to feast your eyes on luxury you went to the stables  the studfarm being described the introduction to hardymans sister follows in due course  the honorable lavinia hardyman was as all persons in society know married rather late in life to general drumblade it is saying a great deal but it is not saying too much to describe mrs drumblade as the most mischievous woman of her age in all england scandal was the breath of her life to place people in false positions to divulge secrets and destroy characters to undermine friendships and aggravate enmitiesthese were the sources of enjoyment from which this dangerous woman drew the inexhaustible fund of good spirits that made her a brilliant light in the social sphere she was one of the privileged sinners of modern society the worst mischief that she could work was ascribed to her exuberant vitality she had that ready familiarity of manner which is in her class so rarely discovered to be insolence in disguise her power of easy selfassertion found people ready to accept her on her own terms wherever she went she was one of those big overpowering women with blunt manners voluble tongues and goggle eyes who carry everything before them the highest society modestly considered itself in danger of being dull in the absence of mrs drumblade even hardyman himselfwho saw as little of her as possible whose frankly straightforward nature recoiled by instinct from contact with his sistercould think of no fitter person to make miss pinks reception agreeable to her while he was devoting his own attentions to her niece mrs drumblade accepted the position thus offered with the most amiable readiness in her own private mind she placed an interpretation on her brothers motives which did him the grossest injustice she believed that hardymans designs on isabel contemplated the most profligate result to assist this purpose while the girls nearest relative was supposed to be taking care of her was mrs drumblades idea of fun her worst enemies admitted that the honorable lavia had redeeming qualities and owned that a keen sense of humor was one of her merits  was miss pink a likely person to resist the fascinations of mrs drumblade alas for the exschoolmistress before she had been five minutes at the farm hardymans sister had fished for her caught her landed her poor miss pink  mrs drumblade could assume a grave dignity of manner when the occasion called for it she was grave she was dignified when hardyman performed the ceremonies of introduction she would not say she was charmed to meet miss pinkthe ordinary slang of society was not for miss pinks earsshe would say she felt this introduction as a privilege it was so seldom one met with persons of trained intellect in society mrs drumblade was already informed of miss pinks earlier triumphs in the instruction of youth mrs drumblade had not been blessed with children herself but she had nephews and nieces and she was anxious about their education especially the nieces what a sweet modest girl miss isabel was the fondest wish she could form for her nieces would be that they should resemble miss isabel when they grew up the question was as to the best method of education she would own that she had selfish motives in becoming acquainted with miss pink they were at the farm no doubt to see alfreds horses mrs drumblade did not understand horses her interest was in the question of education she might even confess that she had accepted alfreds invitation in the hope of hearing miss pinks views there would be opportunities she trusted for a little instructive conversation on that subject it was perhaps ridiculous to talk at her age of feeling as if she was miss pinks pupil and yet it exactly expressed the nature of the aspiration which was then in her mind  in these terms feeling her way with the utmost nicety mrs drumblade wound the net of flattery round and round miss pink until her hold on that innocent lady was in every sense of the word secure before half the horses had been passed under review hardyman and isabel were out of sight and mrs drumblade and miss pink were lost in the intricacies of the stables excessively stupid of me we had better go back and establish ourselves comfortably in the parlor when my brother misses us he and your charming niece will return to look for us in the cottage under cover of this arrangement the separation became complete miss pink held forth on education to mrs drumblade in the parlor while hardyman and isabel were on their way to a paddock at the farthest limits of the property  i am afraid you are getting a little tired said hardyman wont you take my arm  isabel was on her guard she had not forgotten what lady lydiard had said to her no thank you mr hardyman i am a better walker than you think  hardyman continued the conversation in his blunt resolute way i wonder whether you will believe me he asked if i tell you that this is one of the happiest days of my life  i should think you were always happy isabel cautiously replied having such a pretty place to live in as this  hardyman met that answer with one of his quietlypositive denials a man is never happy by himself he said he is happy with a companion for instance i am happy with you  isabel stopped and looked back hardymans language was becoming a little too explicit surely we have lost mrs drumblade and my aunt she said i dont see them anywhere  you will see them directly they are only a long way behind with this assurance he returned in his own obstinate way to his one object in view miss isabel i want to ask you a question im not a ladies man i speak my mind plainly to everybodywomen included do you like being here today  isabels gravity was not proof against this very downright question i should be hard to please she said laughing if i didnt enjoy my visit to the farm  hardyman pushed steadily forward through the obstacle of the farm to the question of the farms master you like being here he repeated do you like me  this was serious isabel drew back a little and looked at him he waited with the most impenetrable gravity for her reply  i think you can hardly expect me to answer that question she said  why not  our acquaintance has been a very short one mr hardyman and if you are so good as to forget the difference between us i think i ought to remember it  what difference  the difference in rank  hardyman suddenly stood still and emphasized his next words by digging his stick into the grass  if anything i have said has vexed you he began tell me so plainly miss isabel and ill ask your pardon but dont throw my rank in my face i cut adrift from all that nonsense when i took this farm and got my living out of the horses what has a mans rank to do with a mans feelings he went on with another emphatic dig of his stick i am quite serious in asking if you like mefor this good reason that i like you yes i do you remember that day when i bled the old ladys dogwell i have found out since then that theres a sort of incompleteness in my life which i never suspected before its you who have put that idea into my head you didnt mean it i dare say but you have done it all the same i sat alone here yesterday evening smoking my pipeand i didnt enjoy it i breakfasted alone this morningand i didnt enjoy that i said to myself shes coming to lunch thats one comforti shall enjoy lunch thats what i feel roughly described i dont suppose ive been five minutes together without thinking of you now in one way and now in another since the day when i first saw you when a man comes to my time of life and has had any experience he knows what that means it means in plain english that his heart is set on a woman youre the woman  isabel had thus far made several attempts to interrupt him without success but when hardymans confession attained its culminating point she insisted on being heard  if you will excuse me sir she interposed gravely i think i had better go back to the cottage my aunt is a stranger here and she doesnt know where to look for us  we dont want your aunt hardyman remarked in his most positive manner  we do want her isabel rejoined i wont venture to say its wrong in you mr hardyman to talk to me as you have just done but i am quite sure its very wrong of me to listen  he looked at her with such unaffected surprise and distress that she stopped on the point of leaving him and tried to make herself better understood  i had no intention of offending you sir she said a little confusedly i only wanted to remind you that there are some things which a gentleman in your position she stopped tried to finish the sentence failed and began another if i had been a young lady in your own rank of life she went on i might have thanked you for paying me a compliment and have given you a serious answer as it is i am afraid that i must say that you have surprised and disappointed me i can claim very little for myself i know but i did imagineso long as there was nothing unbecoming in my conductthat i had some right to your respect  listening more and more impatiently hardyman took her by the hand and burst out with another of his abrupt questions  what can you possibly be thinking of he asked  she gave him no answer she only looked at him reproachfully and tried to release herself  hardyman held her hand faster than ever  i believe you think me an infernal scoundrel he said i can stand a good deal miss isabel but i cant stand that how have i failed in respect toward you if you please i have told you youre the woman my heart is set on well isnt it plain what i want of you when i say that isabel miller i want you to be my wife  isabels only reply to this extraordinary proposal of marriage was a faint cry of astonishment followed by a sudden trembling that shook her from head to foot  hardyman put his arm round her with a gentleness which his oldest friend would have been surprised to see in him  take your time to think of it he said dropping back again into his usual quiet tone if you had known me a little better you wouldnt have mistaken me and you wouldnt be looking at me now as if you were afraid to believe your own ears what is there so very wonderful in my wanting to marry you i dont set up for being a saint when i was a younger man i was no better and no worse than other young men im getting on now to middle life i dont want romances and adventuresi want an easy existence with a nice lovable woman who will make me a good wife youre the woman i tell you again i know it by what ive seen of you myself and by what i have heard of you from lady lydiard she said you were prudent and sweettempered and affectionate to which i wish to add that you have just the face and figure that i like and the modest manners and the blessed absence of all slang in your talk which i dont find in the young women i meet with in the present day thats my view of it i think for myself what does it matter to me whether youre the daughter of a duke or the daughter of a dairyman it isnt your father i want to marryits you listen to reason theres a dear we have only one question to settle before we go back to your aunt you wouldnt answer me when i asked it a little while since will you answer now do you like me  isabel looked up at him timidly  in my position sir she asked have i any right to like you what would your relations and friends think if i said yes  hardyman gave her waist a little admonitory squeeze with his arm  what youre at it again a nice way to answer a man to call him sir and to get behind his rank as if it was a place of refuge from him i hate talking of myself but you force me to it here is my position in the worldi have got an elder brother he is married and he has a son to succeed him in the title and the property you understand so far very well years ago i shifted my share of the rank whatever it may be on to my brothers shoulders he is a thorough good fellow and he has carried my dignity for me without once dropping it ever since as for what people may say they have said it already from my father and mother downward in the time when i took to the horses and the farm if theyre the wise people i take them for they wont be at the trouble of saying it all over again no no twist it how you may miss isabel whether im single or whether im married im plain alfred hardyman and everybody who knows me knows that i go on my way and please myself if you dont like me it will be the bitterest disappointment i ever had in my life but say so honestly all the same  where is the woman in isabels place whose capacity for resistance would not have yielded a little to such an appeal as this  i should be an insensible wretch she replied warmly if i didnt feel the honor you have done me and feel it gratefully  does that mean you will have me for a husband asked downright hardyman  she was fairly driven into a corner but being a woman she tried to slip through his fingers at the last moment  will you forgive me she said if i ask you for a little more time i am so bewildered i hardly know what to say or do for the best you see mr hardyman it would be a dreadful thing for me to be the cause of giving offense to your family i am obliged to think of that it would be so distressing for you i will say nothing of myself if your friends closed their doors on me they might say i was a designing girl who had taken advantage of your good opinion to raise herself in the world lady lydiard warned me long since not to be ambitious about myself and not to forget my station in life because she treated me like her adopted daughter indeedindeed i cant tell you how i feel your goodness and the complimentthe very great compliment you pay me my heart is free and if i followed my own inclinations she checked herself conscious that she was on the brink of saying too much will you give me a few days she pleaded to try if i can think composedly of all this i am only a girl and i feel quite dazzled by the prospect that you set before me  hardyman seized on those words as offering all the encouragement that he desired to his suit  have your own way in this thing and in everything he said with an unaccustomed fervor of language and manner i am so glad to hear that your heart is open to me and that all your inclinations take my part  isabel instantly protested against this misrepresentation of what she had really said oh mr hardyman you quite mistake me  he answered her very much as he had answered lady lydiard when she had tried to make him understand his proper relations towards isabel  no no i dont mistake you i agree to every word you say how can i expect you to marry me as you very properly remark unless i give you a day or two to make up your mind its quite enough for me that you like the prospect if lady lydiard treated you as her daughter why shouldnt you be my wife it stands to reason that youre quite right to marry a man who can raise you in the world i like you to be ambitiousthough heaven knows it isnt much i can do for you except to love you with all my heart still its a great encouragement to hear that her ladyships views agree with mine  they dont agree mr hardyman protested poor isabel you are entirely misrepresenting  hardyman cordially concurred in this view of the matter yes yes i cant pretend to represent her ladyships language or yours either i am obliged to take my words as they come to me dont disturb yourself its all righti understand you have made me the happiest man living i shall ride over tomorrow to your aunts house and hear what you have to say to me mind youre at home not a day must pass now without my seeing you i do love you isabeli do indeed he stooped and kissed her heartily only to reward me he explained for giving you time to think  she drew herself away from himresolutely not angrily before she could make a third attempt to place the subject in its right light before him the luncheon bell rang at the cottageand a servant appeared evidently sent to look for them  dont forget tomorrow hardyman whispered confidentially ill call earlyand then go to london and get the ring     chapter xvii  events succeeded each other rapidly after the memorable day to isabel of the luncheon at the farm  on the next day the ninth of the month lady lydiard sent for her steward and requested him to explain his conduct in repeatedly leaving the house without assigning any reason for his absence she did not dispute his claims to a freedom of action which would not be permitted to an ordinary servant her objection to his present course of proceeding related entirely to the mystery in which it was involved and to the uncertainty in which the household was left as to the hour of his return on those grounds she thought herself entitled to an explanation moodys habitual reservestrengthened on this occasion by his dread of ridicule if his efforts to serve isabel ended in failuredisinclined him to take lady lydiard into his confidence while his inquiries were still beset with obstacles and doubts he respectfully entreated her ladyship to grant him a delay of a few weeks before he entered on his explanation lady lydiards quick temper resented his request she told moody plainly that he was guilty of an act of presumption in making his own conditions with his employer he received the reproof with exemplary resignation but he held to his conditions nevertheless from that moment the result of the interview was no longer in doubt moody was directed to send in his accounts the accounts having been examined and found to be scrupulously correct he declined accepting the balance of salary that was offered to him the next day he left lady lydiards service  on the tenth of the month her ladyship received a letter from her nephew  the health of felix had not improved he had made up his mind to go abroad again towards the end of the month in the meantime he had written to his friend in paris and he had the pleasure of forwarding an answer the letter inclosed announced that the lost fivehundredpound note had been made the subject of careful inquiry in paris it had not been traced the french police offered to send to london one of their best men well acquainted with the english language if lady lydiard was desirous of employing him he would be perfectly willing to act with an english officer in conducting the investigation should it be thought necessary mr troy being consulted as to the expediency of accepting this proposal objected to the pecuniary terms demanded as being extravagantly high he suggested waiting a little before any reply was sent to paris and he engaged meanwhile to consult a london solicitor who had great experience in cases of theft and whose advice might enable them to dispense entirely with the services of the french police  being now a free man again moody was able to follow his own inclinations in regard to the instructions which he had received from old sharon  the course that had been recommended to him was repellent to the selfrespect and the sense of delicacy which were among the inbred virtues of moodys character he shrank from forcing himself as a friend on hardymans valet he recoiled from the idea of tempting the man to steal a specimen of his masters handwriting after some consideration he decided on applying to the agent who collected the rents at hardymans london chambers being an old acquaintance of moodys this person would certainly not hesitate to communicate the address of hardymans bankers if he knew it the experiment tried under these favoring circumstances proved perfectly successful moody proceeded to sharons lodgings the same day with the address of the bankers in his pocketbook the old vagabond greatly amused by moodys scruples saw plainly enough that so long as he wrote the supposed letter from hardyman in the third person it mattered little what handwriting was employed seeing that no signature would be necessary the letter was at once composed on the model which sharon had already suggested to moody and a respectable messenger so far as outward appearances went was employed to take it to the bank in half an hour the answer came back it added one more to the difficulties which beset the inquiry after the lost money no such sum as five hundred pounds had been paid within the dates mentioned to the credit of hardymans account  old sharon was not in the least discomposed by this fresh check give my love to the dear young lady he said with his customary impudence and tell her we are one degree nearer to finding the thief  moody looked at him doubting whether he was in jest or in earnest  must i squeeze a little more information into that thick head of yours asked sharon with this question he produced a weekly newspaper and pointed to a paragraph which reported among the items of sporting news hardymans recent visit to a sale of horses at a town in the north of france we know he didnt pay the banknote in to his account sharon remarked what else did he do with it took it to pay for the horses that he bought in france do you see your way a little plainer now very good lets try next if your money holds out somebody must cross the channel in search of the note which of us two is to sit in the steamboat with a white basin on his lap old sharon of course he stopped to count the money still left out of the sum deposited by moody to defray the cost of the inquiry all right he went on ive got enough to pay my expenses there and back dont stir out of london till you hear from me i cant tell how soon i may not want you if theres any difficulty in tracing the note your hand will have to go into your pocket again cant you get the lawyer to join you lord how i should enjoy squandering his money its a downright disgrace to me to have only got one guinea out of him i could tear my flesh off my bones when i think of it  the same night old sharon started for france by way of dover and calais  two days elapsed and brought no news from moodys agent on the third day he received some information relating to sharonnot from the man himself but in a letter from isabel miller  for once dear robert she wrote my judgment has turned out to be sounder than yours that hateful old man has confirmed my worst opinion of him pray have him punished take him before a magistrate and charge him with cheating you out of your money i inclose the sealed letter which he gave me at the farmhouse the weeks time before i was to open it expired yesterday was there ever anything so impudent and so inhuman i am too vexed and angry about the money you have wasted on this old wretch to write more yours gratefully and affectionately isabel  the letter in which old sharon had undertaken by way of pacifying isabel to write the name of the thief contained these lines  you are a charming girl my dear but you still want one thing to make you perfectand that is a lesson in patience i am proud and happy to teach you the name of the thief remains for the present mr  blank  from moodys point of view there was but one thing to be said of this it was just like old sharon isabels letter was of infinitely greater interest to him he feasted his eyes on the words above the signature she signed herself yours gratefully and affectionately did the last words mean that she was really beginning to be fond of him after kissing the word he wrote a comforting letter to her in which he pledged himself to keep a watchful eye on sharon and to trust him with no more money until he had honestly earned it first  a week passed moody longing to see isabel still waited in vain for news from france he had just decided to delay his visit to south morden no longer when the errandboy employed by sharon brought him this message the old uns at home and waitin to see yer     chapter xviii  sharons news was not of an encouraging character he had met with serious difficulties and had spent the last farthing of moodys money in attempting to overcome them  one discovery of importance he had certainly made a horse withdrawn from the sale was the only horse that had met with hardymans approval he had secured the animal at the high reserved price of twelve thousand francsbeing four hundred and eighty pounds in english money and he had paid with an english banknote the seller a french horsedealer resident in brussels had returned to belgium immediately on completing the negotiations sharon had ascertained his address and had written to him at brussels inclosing the number of the lost banknote in two days he had received an answer informing him that the horsedealer had been called to england by the illness of a relative and that he had hitherto failed to send any address to which his letters could be forwarded hearing this and having exhausted his funds sharon had returned to london it now rested with moody to decide whether the course of the inquiry should follow the horsedealer next here was the cash account showing how the money had been spent and there was sharon with his pipe in his mouth and his dog on his lap waiting for orders  moody wisely took time to consider before he committed himself to a decision in the meanwhile he ventured to recommend a new course of proceeding which sharons report had suggested to his mind  it seems to me he said that we have taken the roundabout way of getting to our end in view when the straight road lay before us if mr hardyman has passed the stolen note you know as well as i do that he has passed it innocently instead of wasting time and money in trying to trace a stranger why not tell mr hardyman what has happened and ask him to give us the number of the note you cant think of everything i know but it does seem strange that this idea didnt occur to you before you went to france  mr moody said old sharon i shall have to cut your acquaintance you are a man without faith i dont like you as if i hadnt thought of hardyman weeks since he exclaimed contemptuously are you really soft enough to suppose that a gentleman in his position would talk about his money affairs to me you know mighty little of him if you do a fortnight since i sent one of my men most respectably dressed to hang about his farm and see what information he could pick up my man became painfully acquainted with the toe of a boot it was thick sir and it was hardymans  i will run the risk of the boot moody replied in his quiet way  and put the question to hardyman  yes  very good said sharon if you get your answer from his tongue instead of his boot the case is cleared upunless i have made a complete mess of it look here moody if you want to do me a good turn tell the lawyer that the guineaopinion was the right one let him know that he was the fool not you when he buttoned up his pockets and refused to trust me and i say pursued old sharon relapsing into his customary impudence youre in love you know with that nice girl i like her myself when you marry her invite me to the wedding ill make a sacrifice ill brush my hair and wash my face in honor of the occasion  returning to his lodgings moody found two letters waiting on the table one of them bore the south morden postmark he opened that letter first  it was written by miss pink the first lines contained an urgent entreaty to keep the circumstances connected with the loss of the five hundred pounds the strictest secret from everyone in general and from hardyman in particular the reasons assigned for making the strange request were next expressed in these terms my niece isabel is i am happy to inform you engaged to be married to mr hardyman if the slightest hint reached him of her having been associated no matter how cruelly and unjustly with a suspicion of theft the marriage would be broken off and the result to herself and to everybody connected with her would be disgrace for the rest of our lives  on the blank space at the foot of the page a few words were added in isabels writing whatever changes there may be in my life your place in my heart is one that no other person can fill it is the place of my dearest friend pray write and tell me that you are not distressed and not angry my one anxiety is that you should remember what i have always told you about the state of my own feelings my one wish is that you will still let me love you and value you as i might have loved and valued a brother  the letter dropped from moodys hand not a wordnot even a sighpassed his lips in tearless silence he submitted to the pang that wrung him in tearless silence he contemplated the wreck of his life     chapter xix  the narrative returns to south morden and follows the events which attended isabels marriage engagement  to say that miss pink inflated by the triumph rose morally speaking from the earth and floated among the clouds is to indicate faintly the effect produced on the exschoolmistress when her niece first informed her of what had happened at the farm attacked on one side by her aunt and on the other by hardyman and feebly defended at the best by her own doubts and misgivings isabel ended by surrendering at discretion like thousands of other women in a similar position she was in the last degree uncertain as to the state of her own heart to what extent she was insensibly influenced by hardymans commanding position in believing herself to be sincerely attached to him it was beyond her power of selfexamination to discover he doubly dazzled her by his birth and by his celebrity not in england only but throughout europe he was a recognized authority on his own subject how could shehow could any womanresist the influence of his steady mind his firmness of purpose his manly resolution to owe everything to himself and nothing to his rank set off as these attractive qualities were by the outward and personal advantages which exercise an ascendancy of their own isabel was fascinated and yet isabel was not at ease in her lonely moments she was troubled by regretful thoughts of moody which perplexed and irritated her she had always behaved honestly to him she had never encouraged him to hope that his love for her had the faintest prospect of being returned yet knowing as she did that her conduct was blameless so far there were nevertheless perverse sympathies in her which took his part in the wakeful hours of the night there were whispering voices in her which said think of moody had there been a growing kindness towards this good friend in her heart of which she herself was not aware she tried to detect itto weigh it for what it was really worth but it lay too deep to be discovered and estimated if it did really existif it had any sounder origin than her own morbid fancy in the broad light of day in the little bustling duties of life she forgot it again she could think of what she ought to wear on the wedding day she could even try privately how her new signature isabel hardyman would look when she had the right to use it on the whole it may be said that the time passed smoothlywith some occasional checks and drawbacks which were the more easily endured seeing that they took their rise in isabels own conduct compliant as she was in general there were two instances among others in which her resolution to take her own way was not to be overcome she refused to write either to moody or to lady lydiard informing them of her engagement and she steadily disapproved of miss pinks policy of concealment in the matter of the robbery at lady lydiards house her aunt could only secure her as a passive accomplice by stating family considerations in the strongest possible terms if the disgrace was confined to you my dear i might leave you to decide but i am involved in it as your nearest relative and what is more even the sacred memories of your father and mother might feel the slur cast on them this exaggerated languagelike all exaggerated language a mischievous weapon in the arsenal of weakness and prejudicehad its effect on isabel reluctantly and sadly she consented to be silent  miss pink wrote word of the engagement to moody first reserving to a later day the superior pleasure of informing lady lydiard of the very event which that audacious woman had declared to be impossible to her aunts surprise just as she was about to close the envelope isabel stepped forward and inconsistently requested leave to add a postscript to the very letter which she had refused to write miss pink was not even permitted to see the postscript isabel secured the envelope the moment she laid down her pen and retired to her room with a headache which was heartache in disguise for the rest of the day  while the question of marriage was still in debate an event occurred which exercised a serious influence on hardymans future plans  he received a letter from the continent which claimed his immediate attention one of the sovereigns of europe had decided on making some radical changes in the mounting and equipment of a cavalry regiment and he required the assistance of hardyman in that important part of the contemplated reform which was connected with the choice and purchase of horses setting his own interests out of the question hardyman owed obligations to the kindness of his illustrious correspondent which made it impossible for him to send an excuse in a fortnights time at the latest it would be necessary for him to leave england and a month or more might elapse before it would be possible for him to return  under these circumstances he proposed in his own precipitate way to hasten the date of the marriage the necessary legal delay would permit the ceremony to be performed on that day fortnight isabel might then accompany him on his journey and spend a brilliant honeymoon at the foreign court she at once refused not only to accept his proposal but even to take it into consideration while miss pink dwelt eloquently on the shortness of the notice miss pinks niece based her resolution on far more important grounds hardyman had not yet announced the contemplated marriage to his parents and friends and isabel was determined not to become his wife until she could be first assured of a courteous and tolerant reception by the familyif she could hope for no warmer welcome at their hands  hardyman was not a man who yielded easily even in trifles in the present case his dearest interests were concerned in inducing isabel to reconsider her decision he was still vainly trying to shake her resolution when the afternoon post brought a letter for miss pink which introduced a new element of disturbance into the discussion the letter was nothing less than lady lydiards reply to the written announcement of isabels engagement despatched on the previous day by miss pink  her ladyships answer was a surprisingly short one it only contained these lines  lady lydiard begs to acknowledge the receipt of miss pinks letter requesting that she will say nothing to mr hardyman of the loss of a banknote in her house and assigning as a reason that miss isabel miller is engaged to be married to mr hardyman and might be prejudiced in his estimation if the facts were made known miss pink may make her mind easy lady lydiard had not the slightest intention of taking mr hardyman into her confidence on the subject of her domestic affairs with regard to the proposed marriage lady lydiard casts no doubt on miss pinks perfect sincerity and good faith but at the same time she positively declines to believe that mr hardyman means to make miss isabel miller his wife lady l will yield to the evidence of a properlyattested certificateand to nothing else   a folded piece of paper directed to isabel dropped out of this characteristic letter as miss pink turned from the first page to the second lady lydiard addressed her adopted daughter in these words  i was on the point of leaving home to visit you again when i received your aunts letter my poor deluded child no words can tell how distressed i am about you you are already sacrificed to the folly of the most foolish woman living for gods sake take care you do not fall a victim next to the designs of a profligate man come to me instantly isabel and i promise to take care of you  fortified by these letters and aided by miss pinks indignation hardyman pressed his proposal on isabel with renewed resolution she made no attempt to combat his argumentsshe only held firmly to her decision without some encouragement from hardymans father and mother she still steadily refused to become his wife irritated already by lady lydiards letters he lost the selfcommand which so eminently distinguished him in the ordinary affairs of life and showed the domineering and despotic temper which was an inbred part of his disposition isabels high spirit at once resented the harsh terms in which he spoke to her in the plainest words she released him from his engagement and without waiting for his excuses quitted the room  left together hardyman and miss pink devised an arrangement which paid due respect to isabels scruples and at the same time met lady lydiards insulting assertion of disbelief in hardymans honor by a formal and public announcement of the marriage  it was proposed to give a garden party at the farm in a weeks time for the express purpose of introducing isabel to hardymans family and friends in the character of his betrothed wife if his father and mother accepted the invitation isabels only objection to hastening the union would fall to the ground hardyman might in that case plead with his imperial correspondent for a delay in his departure of a few days more and the marriage might still take place before he left england isabel at miss pinks intercession was induced to accept her lovers excuses and in the event of her favorable reception by hardymans parents at the farm to give her consent not very willingly even yet to hastening the ceremony which was to make her hardymans wife  on the next morning the whole of the invitations were sent out excepting the invitation to hardymans father and mother without mentioning it to isabel hardyman decided on personally appealing to his mother before he ventured on taking the head of the family into his confidence  the result of the interview was partially successfuland no more lord rotherfield declined to see his youngest son and he had engagements which would under any circumstances prevent his being present at the garden party but at the express request of lady rotherfield he was willing to make certain concessions  i have always regarded alfred as a barely sane person said his lordship since he turned his back on his prospects to become a horse dealer if we decline altogether to sanction this new acti wont say of insanity i will say of absurdityon his part it is impossible to predict to what discreditable extremities he may not proceed we must temporise with alfred in the meantime i shall endeavor to obtain some information respecting this young personnamed miller i think you said and now resident at south morden if i am satisfied that she is a woman of reputable character possessing an average education and presentable manners we may as well let alfred take his own way he is out of the pale of society as it is and miss miller has no father and mother to complicate matters which is distinctly a merit on her part and in short if the marriage is not absolutely disgraceful the wisest way as we have no power to prevent it will be to submit you will say nothing to alfred about what i propose to do i tell you plainly i dont trust him you will simply inform him from me that i want time to consider and that unless he hears to the contrary in the interval he may expect to have the sanction of your presence at his breakfast or luncheon or whatever it is i must go to town in a day or two and i shall ascertain what alfreds friends know about this last of his many follies if i meet any of them at the club  returning to south morden in no serene frame of mind hardyman found isabel in a state of depression which perplexed and alarmed him  the news that his mother might be expected to be present at the garden party failed entirely to raise her spirits the only explanation she gave of the change in her was that the dull heavy weather of the last few days made her feel a little languid and nervous naturally dissatisfied with this reply to his inquiries hardyman asked for miss pink he was informed that miss pink could not see him she was constitutionally subject to asthma and having warnings of the return of the malady she was by the doctors advice keeping her room hardyman returned to the farm in a temper which was felt by everybody in his employment from the trainer to the stableboys  while the apology made for miss pink stated no more than the plain truth it must be confessed that hardyman was right in declining to be satisfied with isabels excuse for the melancholy that oppressed her she had that morning received moodys answer to the lines which she had addressed to him at the end of her aunts letter and she had not yet recovered from the effect which it had produced on her spirits  it is impossible for me to say honestly that i am not distressed moody wrote by the news of your marriage engagement the blow has fallen very heavily on me when i look at the future now i see only a dreary blank this is not your faultyou are in no way to blame i remember the time when i should have been too angry to own thiswhen i might have said or done things which i should have bitterly repented afterwards that time is past my temper has been softened since i have befriended you in your troubles that good at least has come out of my foolish hopes and perhaps out of the true sympathy which i have felt for you i can honestly ask you to accept my hearts dearest wishes for your happinessand i can keep the rest to myself  let me say a word now relating to the efforts that i have made to help you since that sad day when you left lady lydiards house  i had hoped for reasons which it is needless to mention here to interest mr hardyman himself in aiding our inquiry but your aunts wishes as expressed in her letter to me close my lips i will only beg you at some convenient time to let me mention the last discoveries that we have made leaving it to your discretion when mr hardyman has become your husband to ask him the questions which under other circumstances i should have put to him myself  it is of course possible that the view i take of mr hardymans capacity to help us may be a mistaken one in this case if you still wish the investigation to be privately carried on i entreat you to let me continue to direct it as the greatest favor you can confer on your devoted old friend  you need be under no apprehension about the expense to which you are likely to put me i have unexpectedly inherited what is to me a handsome fortune  the same post which brought your aunts letter brought a line from a lawyer asking me to see him on the subject of my late fathers affairs i waited a day or two before i could summon heart enough to see him or to see anybody and then i went to his office you have heard that my fathers bank stopped payment at a time of commercial panic his failure was mainly attributable to the treachery of a friend to whom he had lent a large sum of money and who paid him the yearly interest without acknowledging that every farthing of it had been lost in unsuccessful speculations the son of this man has prospered in business and he has honorably devoted a part of his wealth to the payment of his fathers creditors half the sum due to my father has thus passed into my hands as his next of kin and the other half is to follow in course of time if my hopes had been fulfilled how gladly i should have shared my prosperity with you as it is i have far more than enough for my wants as a lonely man and plenty left to spend in your service  god bless and prosper you my dear i shall ask you to accept a little present from me among the other offerings that are made to you before the wedding dayrm   the studiously considerate and delicate tone in which these lines were written had an effect on isabel which was exactly the opposite of the effect intended by the writer she burst into a passionate fit of tears and in the safe solitude of her own room the despairing words escaped her i wish i had died before i met with alfred hardyman  as the days wore on disappointments and difficulties seemed by a kind of fatality to beset the contemplated announcement of the marriage  miss pinks asthma developed by the unfavorable weather set the doctors art at defiance and threatened to keep that unfortunate lady a prisoner in her room on the day of the party hardymans invitations were in some cases refused and in others accepted by husbands with excuses for the absence of their wives his elder brother made an apology for himself as well as for his wife felix sweetsir wrote with pleasure dear alfred if my health permits me to leave the house lady lydiard invited at miss pinks special request sent no reply the one encouraging circumstance was the silence of lady rotherfield so long as her son received no intimation to the contrary it was a sign that lord rotherfield permitted his wife to sanction the marriage by her presence  hardyman wrote to his imperial correspondent engaging to leave england on the earliest possible day and asking to be pardoned if he failed to express himself more definitely in consideration of domestic affairs which it was necessary to settle before he started for the continent i f there should not be time enough to write again he promised to send a telegraphic announcement of his departure long afterwards hardyman remembered the misgivings that had troubled him when he wrote that letter in the rough draught of it he had mentioned as his excuse for not being yet certain of his own movements that he expected to be immediately married in the fair copy the vague foreboding of some accident to come was so painfully present to his mind that he struck out the words which referred to his marriage and substituted the designedly indefinite phrase domestic affairs     chapter xx  the day of the garden party arrived there was no rain but the air was heavy and the sky was overcast by lowering clouds  some hours before the guests were expected isabel arrived alone at the farm bearing the apologies of unfortunate miss pink still kept a prisoner in her bedchamber by the asthma in the confusion produced at the cottage by the preparations for entertaining the company the one room in which hardyman could receive isabel with the certainty of not being interrupted was the smokingroom to this haven of refuge he led herstill reserved and silent still not restored to her customary spirits if any visitors come before the time hardyman said to his servant tell them i am engaged at the stables i must have an hours quiet talk with you he continued turning to isabel or i shall be in too bad a temper to receive my guests with common politeness the worry of giving this party is not to be told in words i almost wish i had been content with presenting you to my mother and had let the rest of my acquaintances go to the devil  a quiet half hour passed and the first visitor a stranger to the servants appeared at the cottagegate he was a middleaged man and he had no wish to disturb mr hardyman i will wait in the grounds he said and trouble nobody the middleaged man who expressed himself in these modest terms was robert moody  five minutes later a carriage drove up to the gate an elderly lady got out of it followed by a fat white scotch terrier who growled at every stranger within his reach it is needless to introduce lady lydiard and tommie  informed that mr hardyman was at the stables lady lydiard gave the servant her card take that to your master and say i wont detain him five minutes with these words her ladyship sauntered into the grounds she looked about her with observant eyes not only noticing the tent which had been set up on the grass to accommodate the expected guests but entering it and looking at the waiters who were engaged in placing the luncheon on the table returning to the outer world she next remarked that mr hardymans lawn was in very bad order barren sundried patches and little holes and crevices opened here and there by the action of the summer heat announced that the lawn like everything else at the farm had been neglected in the exclusive attention paid to the claims of the horses reaching a shrubbery which bounded one side of the grounds next her ladyship became aware of a man slowly approaching her to all appearance absorbed in thought the man drew a little nearer she lifted her glasses to her eyes and recognizedmoody  no embarrassment was produced on either side by this unexpected meeting lady lydiard had not long since sent to ask her former steward to visit her regretting in her warmhearted way the terms on which they had separated and wishing to atone for the harsh language that had escaped her at their parting interview in the friendly talk which followed the reconciliation lady lydiard not only heard the news of moodys pecuniary inheritancebut noticing the change in his appearance for the worse contrived to extract from him the confession of his illstarred passion for isabel to discover him now after all that he had acknowledged walking about the grounds at hardymans farm took her ladyship completely by surprise good heavens she exclaimed in her loudest tones what are you doing here  you mentioned mr hardymans garden party my lady when i had the honor of waiting on you moody answered thinking over it afterward it seemed the fittest occasion i could find for making a little wedding present to miss isabel is there any harm in my asking mr hardyman to let me put the present on her plate so that she may see it when she sits down to luncheon if your ladyship thinks so i will go away directly and send the gift by post  lady lydiard looked at him attentively you dont despise the girl she asked for selling herself for rank and money i doi can tell you  moodys worn white face flushed a little no my lady he answered i cant hear you say that isabel would not have engaged herself to mr hardyman unless she had been fond of himas fond i dare say as i once hoped she might be of me its a hard thing to confess that but i do confess it in justice to hergod bless her  the generosity that spoke in those simple words touched the finest sympathies in lady lydiards nature give me your hand she said with her own generous spirit kindling in her eyes you have a great heart moody isabel miller is a fool for not marrying youand one day she will know it  before a word more could pass between them hardymans voice was audible on the other side of the shrubbery calling irritably to his servant to find lady lydiard  moody retired to the further end of the walk while lady lydiard advanced in the opposite direction so as to meet hardyman at the entrance to the shrubbery he bowed stiffly and begged to know why her ladyship had honored him with a visit  lady lydiard replied without noticing the coldness of her reception  i have not been very well mr hardyman or you would have seen me before this my only object in presenting myself here is to make my excuses personally for having written of you in terms which expressed a doubt of your honor i have done you an injustice and i beg you to forgive me  hardyman acknowledged this frank apology as unreservedly as it had been offered to him say no more lady lydiard and let me hope now you are here that you will honor my little party with your presence  lady lydiard gravely stated her reasons for not accepting the invitation  i disapprove so strongly of unequal marriages she said walking on slowly towards the cottage that i cannot in common consistency become one of your guests i shall always feel interested in isabel millers welfare and i can honestly say i shall be glad if your married life proves that my oldfashioned prejudices are without justification in your case accept my thanks for your invitation and let me hope that my plain speaking has not offended you  she bowed and looked about her for tommie before she advanced to the carriage waiting for her at the gate in the surprise of seeing moody she had forgotten to look back for the dog when she entered the shrubbery she now called to him and blew the whistle at her watchchain not a sign of tommie was to be seen hardyman instantly directed the servants to search in the cottage and out of the cottage for the dog the order was obeyed with all needful activity and intelligence and entirely without success for the time being at any rate tommie was lost  hardyman promised to have the dog looked for in every part of the farm and to send him back in the care of one of his own men with these polite assurances lady lydiard was obliged to be satisfied she drove away in a very despondent frame of mind first isabel and now tommie thought her ladyship i am losing the only companions who made life tolerable to me  returning from the garden gate after taking leave of his visitor hardyman received from his servant a handful of letters which had just arrived for him walking slowly over the lawn as he opened them he found nothing but excuses for the absence of guests who had already accepted their invitations he had just thrust the letters into his pocket when he heard footsteps behind him and looking round found himself confronted by moody  hullo have you come to lunch hardyman asked roughly  i have come here sir with a little gift for miss isabel in honor of her marriage moody answered quietly and i ask your permission to put it on the table so that she may see it when your guests sit down to luncheon  he opened a jewelers case as he spoke containing a plain gold bracelet with an inscription engraved on the inner side to miss isabel miller with the sincere good wishes of robert moody  plain as it was the design of the bracelet was unusually beautiful hardyman had noticed moodys agitation on the day when he had met isabel near her aunts house and had drawn his own conclusions from it his face darkened with a momentary jealousy as he looked at the bracelet all right old fellow he said with contemptuous familiarity dont be modest wait and give it to her with your own hand  no sir said moody i would rather leave it if you please to speak for itself  hardyman understood the delicacy of feeling which dictated those words and without well knowing why resented it he was on the point of speaking under the influence of this unworthy motive when isabels voice reached his ears calling to him from the cottage  moodys face contracted with a sudden expression of pain as he too recognized the voice dont let me detain you sir he said sadly goodmorning  hardyman left him without ceremony moody slowly following entered the tent all the preparations for the luncheon had been completed nobody was there the places to be occupied by the guests were indicated by cards bearing their names moody found isabels card and put his bracelet inside the folded napkin on her plate for a while he stood with his hand on the table thinking the temptation to communicate once more with isabel before he lost her forever was fast getting the better of his powers of resistance  if i could persuade her to write a word to say she liked her bracelet he thought it would be a comfort when i go back to my solitary life he tore a leaf out of his pocket book and wrote on it one line to say you accept my gift and my good wishes put it under the cushion of your chair and i shall find it when the company have left the tent he slipped the paper into the case which held the bracelet and instead of leaving the farm as he had intended turned back to the shelter of the shrubbery     chapter xxi  hardyman went on to the cottage he found isabel in some agitation and there by her side with his tail wagging slowly and his eye on hardyman in expectation of a possible kickthere was the lost tommie  has lady lydiard gone isabel asked eagerly  yes said hardyman where did you find the dog  as events had ordered it the dog had found isabel under these circumstances  the appearance of lady lydiards card in the smokingroom had been an alarming event for lady lydiards adopted daughter she was guiltily conscious of not having answered her ladyships note inclosed in miss pinks letter and of not having taken her ladyships advice in regulating her conduct towards hardyman as he rose to leave the room and receive his visitor in the grounds isabel begged him to say nothing of her presence at the farm unless lady lydiard exhibited a forgiving turn of mind by asking to see her left by herself in the smokingroom she suddenly heard a bark in the passage which had a familiar sound in her ears she opened the doorand in rushed tommie with one of his shrieks of delight curiosity had taken him into the house he had heard the voices in the smokingroom had recognized isabels voice and had waited with his customary cunning and his customary distrust of strangers until hardyman was out of the way isabel kissed and caressed him and then drove him out again to the lawn fearing that lady lydiard might return to look for him going back to the smokingroom she stood at the window watching for hardymans return when the servants came to look for the dog she could only tell them that she had last seen him in the grounds not far from the cottage the useless search being abandoned and the carriage having left the gate who should crawl out from the back of a cupboard in which some empty hampers were placed but tommie himself how he had contrived to get back to the smokingroom unless she had omitted to completely close the door on her return it was impossible to say but there he was determined this time to stay with isabel and keeping in his hiding place until he heard the movement of the carriagewheels which informed him that his lawful mistress had left the cottage isabel had at once called hardyman on the chance that the carriage might yet be stopped it was already out of sight and nobody knew which of two roads it had taken both leading to london in this emergency isabel could only look at hardyman and ask what was to be done  i cant spare a servant till after the party he answered the dog must be tied up in the stables  isabel shook her head tommie was not accustomed to be tied up he would make a disturbance and he would be beaten by the grooms i will take care of him she said he wont leave me  theres something else to think of besides the dog hardyman rejoined irritably look at these letters he pulled them out of his pocket as he spoke here are no less than seven men all calling themselves my friends who accepted my invitation and who write to excuse themselves on the very day of the party do you know why theyre all afraid of my fatheri forgot to tell you hes a cabinet minister as well as a lord cowards and cads they have heard he isnt coming and they think to curry favor with the great man by stopping away come along isabel lets take their names off the luncheon table not a man of them shall ever darken my doors again  i am to blame for what has happened isabel answered sadly i am estranging you from your friends there is still time alfred to alter your mind and let me go  he put his arm round her with rough fondness i would sacrifice every friend i have in the world rather than lose you come along  they left the cottage at the entrance to the tent hardyman noticed the dog at isabels heels and vented his illtemper as usual with male humanity on the nearest unoffending creature that he could find be off you mongrel brute he shouted the tail of tommie relaxed from its customary tight curve over the small of his back and the legs of tommie with his tail between them took him at full gallop to the friendly shelter of the cupboard in the smokingroom it was one of those trifling circumstances which women notice seriously isabel said nothing she only thought to herself i wish he had shown his temper when i first knew him  they entered the tent  ill read the names said hardyman and you find the cards and tear them up stop ill keep the cards youre just the sort of woman my father likes hell be reconciled to me when he sees you after we are married if one of those men ever asks him for a place ill take care if its years hence to put an obstacle in his way here take my pencil and make a mark on the cards to remind me the same mark i set against a horse in my book when i dont like hima cross inclosed in a circle he produced his pocketbook his hands trembled with anger as he gave the pencil to isabel and laid the book on the table he had just read the name of the first false friend and isabel had just found the card when a servant appeared with a message mrs drumblade has arrived sir and wishes to see you on a matter of the greatest importance  hardyman left the tent not very willingly wait here he said to isabel ill be back directly  she was standing near her own place at the table moody had left one end of the jewelers case visible above the napkin to attract her attention in a minute more the bracelet and note were in her hands she dropped on her chair overwhelmed by the conflicting emotions that rose in her at the sight of the bracelet at the reading of the note her head drooped and the tears filled her eyes are all women as blind as i have been to what is good and noble in the men who love them she wondered sadly better as it is she thought with a bitter sigh i am not worthy of him  as she took up the pencil to write her answer to moody on the back of her dinnercard the servant appeared again at the door of the tent  my master wants you at the cottage miss immediately  isabel rose putting the bracelet and the note in the silvermounted leather pocket a present from hardyman which hung at her belt in the hurry of passing round the table to get out she never noticed that her dress touched hardymans pocketbook placed close to the edge and threw it down on the grass below the book fell into one of the heat cracks which lady lydiard had noticed as evidence of the neglected condition of the cottage lawn  you ought to hear the pleasant news my sister has just brought me said hardyman when isabel joined him in the parlor mrs drumblade has been told on the best authority that my mother is not coming to the party  there must be some reason of course dear isabel added mrs drumblade have you any idea of what it can be i havent seen my mother myself and all my inquiries have failed to find it out  she looked searchingly at isabel as she spoke the mask of sympathy on her face was admirably worn nobody who possessed only a superficial acquaintance with mrs drumblades character would have suspected how thoroughly she was enjoying in secret the position of embarrassment in which her news had placed her brother instinctively doubting whether mrs drumblades friendly behavior was quite as sincere as it appeared to be isabel answered that she was a stranger to lady rotherfield and was therefore quite at a loss to explain the cause of her ladyships absence as she spoke the guests began to arrive in quick succession and the subject was dropped as a matter of course  it was not a merry party hardymans approaching marriage had been made the topic of much malicious gossip and isabels character had as usual in such cases become the object of all the false reports that scandal could invent lady rotherfields absence confirmed the general conviction that hardyman was disgracing himself the men were all more or less uneasy the women resented the discovery that isabel waspersonally speaking at leastbeyond the reach of hostile criticism her beauty was viewed as a downright offense her refined and modest manners were set down as perfect acting really disgusting my dear in so young a girl general drumblade a large and mouldy veteran in a state of chronic astonishment after his own matrimonial experience at hardymans folly in marrying at all diffused a wide circle of gloom wherever he went and whatever he did his accomplished wife forcing her high spirits on everybodys attention with a sort of kittenish playfulness intensified the depressing effect of the general dullness by all the force of the strongest contrast after waiting half an hour for his mother and waiting in vain hardyman led the way to the tent in despair the sooner i fill their stomachs and get rid of them he thought savagely the better i shall be pleased  the luncheon was attacked by the company with a certain silent ferocity which the waiters noticed as remarkable even in their large experience the men drank deeply but with wonderfully little effect in raising their spirits the women with the exception of amiable mrs drumblade kept isabel deliberately out of the conversation that went on among them general drumblade sitting next to her in one of the places of honor discoursed to isabel privately on my brotherinlaw hardymans infernal temper a young marquis on her other sidea mere lad chosen to make the necessary speech in acknowledgment of his superior rankrose in a state of nervous trepidation to propose isabels health as the chosen bride of their host pale and trembling conscious of having forgotten the words which he had learnt beforehand this unhappy young nobleman began ladies and gentlemen i havent an idea he stopped put his hand to his head stared wildly and sat down again having contrived to state his own case with masterly brevity and perfect truth in a speech of seven words  while the dismay in some cases and the amusement in others was still at its height hardymans valet made his appearance and approaching his master said in a whisper could i speak to you sit for a moment outside  what the devil do you want hardyman asked irritably is that a letter in your hand give it to me  the valet was a frenchman in other words he had a sense of what was due to himself his master had forgotten this he gave up the letter with a certain dignity of manner and left the tent hardyman opened the letter he turned pale as he read it crumpled it in his hand and threw it down on the table by gd its a lie he exclaimed furiously  the guests rose in confusion mrs drumblade finding the letter within her reach coolly possessed herself of it recognized her mothers handwriting and read these lines  i have only now succeeded in persuading your father to let me write to you for gods sake break off your marriage at any sacrifice your father has heard on unanswerable authority that miss isabel miller left her situation in lady lydiards house on suspicion of theft  while his sister was reading this letter hardyman had made his way to isabels chair i must speak to you directly he whispered come away with me he turned as he took her arm and looked at the table where is my letter he asked mrs drumblade handed it to him dexterously crumpled up again as she had found it no bad news dear alfred i hope she said in her most affectionate manner hardyman snatched the letter from her without answering and led isabel out of the tent  read that he said when they were alone and tell me at once whether its true or false  isabel read the letter for a moment the shock of the discovery held her speechless she recovered herself and returned the letter  it is true she answered  hardyman staggered back as if she had shot him  true that you are guilty he asked  no i am innocent everybody who knows me believes in my innocence it is true the appearances were against me they are against me still having said this she waited quietly and firmly for his next words  he passed his hand over his forehead with a sigh of relief its bad enough as it is he said speaking quietly on his side but the remedy for it is plain enough come back to the tent  she never moved why she asked  do you suppose i dont believe in your innocence too he answered the one way of setting you right with the world now is for me to make you my wife in spite of the appearances that point to you im too fond of you isabel to give you up come back with me and i will announce our marriage to my friends  she took his hand and kissed it it is generous and good of you she said but it must not be  he took a step nearer to her what do you mean he asked  it was against my will she pursued that my aunt concealed the truth from you i did wrong to consent to it i will do wrong no more your mother is right alfred after what has happened i am not fit to be your wife until my innocence is proved it is not proved yet  the angry color began to rise in his face once more take care he said i am not in a humor to be trifled with  i am not trifling with you she answered in low sad tones  you really mean what you say  i mean it  dont be obstinate isabel take time to consider  you are very kind alfred my duty is plain to me i will marry youif you still wish itwhen my good name is restored to me not before  he laid one hand on her arm and pointed with the other to the guests in the distance all leaving the tent on the way to their carriages  you r good name will be restored to you he said on the day when i make you my wife the worst enemy you have cannot associate my name with a suspicion of theft remember that and think a little before you decide you see those people there if you dont change your mind by the time they have got to the cottage its goodby between us and goodby forever i refuse to wait for you i refuse to accept a conditional engagement wait and think theyre walking slowly you have got some minutes more  he still held her arm watching the guests as they gradually receded from view it was not until they had all collected in a group outside the cottage door that he spoke himself or that he permitted isabel to speak again  now he said you have had your time to get cool will you take my arm and join those people with me or will you say goodby forever  forgive me alfred she began gently i cannot consent in justice to you to shelter myself behind your name it is the name of your family and they have a right to expect that you will not degrade it  i want a plain answer he interposed sternly which is it yes or no  she looked at him with sad compassionate eyes her voice was firm as she answered him in one word as he had desired the word was  no  without speaking to her without even looking at her he turned and walked back to the cottage  making his way silently through the group of visitorsevery one of whom had been informed of what had happened by his sisterwith his head down and his lips fast closed he entered the parlor and rang the bell which communicated with his foremans rooms at the stables  you know that i am going abroad on business he said when the man appeared  yes sir  i am going todaygoing by the night train to dover order the horse to be put to instantly in the dogcart is there anything wanted before i am off  the inexorable necessities of business asserted their claims through the obedient medium of the foreman chafing at the delay hardyman was obliged to sit at his desk signing checks and passing accounts with the dogcart waiting in the stable yard  a knock at the door startled him in the middle of his work come in he called out sharply  he looked up expecting to see one of the guests or one of the servants it was moody who entered the room hardyman laid down his pen and fixed his eyes sternly on the man who had dared to interrupt him  what the devil do you want he asked  i have seen miss isabel and spoken with her moody replied mr hardyman i believe it is in your power to set this matter right for the young ladys sake sir you must not leave england without doing it  hardyman turned to his foreman is this fellow mad or drunk he asked  moody proceeded as calmly and as resolutely as if those words had not been spoken i apologize for my intrusion sir i will trouble you with no explanations i will only ask one question have you a memorandum of the number of that fivehundred pound note you paid away in france  hardyman lost all control over himself  you scoundrel he cried have you been prying into my private affairs is it your business to know what i did in france  is it your vengeance on a woman to refuse to tell her the number of a banknote moody rejoined firmly  that answer forced its way through hardymans anger to hardymans sense of honor he rose and advanced to moody for a moment the two men faced each other in silence youre a bold fellow said hardyman with a sudden change from anger to irony ill do the lady justice ill look at my pocketbook  he put his hand into the breastpocket of his coat he searched his other pockets he turned over the objects on his writingtable the book was gone  moody watched him with a feeling of despair oh mr hardyman dont say you have lost your pocketbook  he sat down again at his desk with sullen submission to the new disaster all i can say is youre at liberty to look for it he replied i must have dropped it somewhere he turned impatiently to the foreman now then what is the next check wanted i shall go mad if i wait in this damned place much longer  moody left him and found his way to the servants offices mr hardyman has lost his pocketbook he said look for it indoors and outon the lawn and in the tent ten pounds reward for the man who finds it  servants and waiters instantly dispersed eager for the promised reward the men who pursued the search outside the cottage divided their forces some of them examined the lawn and the flowerbeds others went straight to the empty tent these last were too completely absorbed in pursuing the object in view to notice that they disturbed a dog eating a stolen lunch of his own from the morsels left on the plates the dog slunk away under the canvas when the men came in waited in hiding until they had gone then returned to the tent and went on with his luncheon  moody hastened back to the part of the grounds close to the shrubbery in which isabel was waiting his return  she looked at him while he was telling her of his interview with hardyman with an expression in her eyes which he had never seen in them beforean expression which set his heart beating wildly and made him break off in his narrative before he had reached the end  i understand she said quietly as he stopped in confusion you have made one more sacrifice to my welfare robert i believe you are the noblest man that ever breathed the breath of life  his eyes sank before hers he blushed like a boy i have done nothing for you yet he said dont despair of the future if the pocketbook should not be found i know who the man is who received the bank note and i have only to find him to decide the question whether it is the stolen note or not  she smiled sadly as his enthusiasm are you going back to mr sharon to help you she asked that trick he played me has destroyed my belief in him he no more knows than i do who the thief really is  you are mistaken isabel he knowsand i know he stopped there and made a sign to her to be silent one of the servants was approaching them  is the pocketbook found moody asked  no sir  has mr hardyman left the cottage  he has just gone sir have you any further instructions to give us  no there is my address in london if the pocketbook should be found  the man took the card that was handed to him and retired moody offered his arm to isabel i am at your service he said when you wish to return to your aunt  they had advanced nearly as far as the tent on their way out of the grounds when they were met by a gentleman walking towards them from the cottage he was a stranger to isabel moody immediately recognized him as mr felix sweetsir  ha our good moody cried felix enviable man you look younger than ever he took off his hat to isabel his bright restless eyes suddenly became quiet as they rested on her have i the honor of addressing the future mrs hardyman may i offer my best congratulations what has become of our friend alfred  moody answered for isabel if you will make inquiries at the cottage sir he said you will find that you are mistaken to say the least of it in addressing your questions to this young lady  felix took off his hat againwith the most becoming appearance of surprise and distress  something wrong i fear he said addressing isabel i am indeed ashamed if i have ignorantly given you a moments pain pray accept my most sincere apologies i have only this instant arrived my health would not allow me to be present at the luncheon permit me to express the earnest hope that matters may be set right to the satisfaction of all parties goodafternoon  he bowed with elaborate courtesy and turned back to the cottage  who is that isabel asked  lady lydiards nephew mr felix sweetsir moody answered with a sudden sternness of tone and a sudden coldness of manner which surprised isabel  you dont like him she said  as she spoke fe lix stopped to give audience to one of the grooms who had apparently been sent with a message to him he turned so that his face was once more visible to isabel moody pressed her hand significantly as it rested on his arm  look well at that man he whispered its time to warn you mr felix sweetsir is the worst enemy you have  isabel heard him in speechless astonishment he went on in tones that trembled with suppressed emotion  you doubt if sharon knows the thief you doubt if i know the thief isabel as certainly as the heaven is above us there stands the wretch who stole the banknote  she drew her hand out of his arm with a cry of terror she looked at him as if she doubted whether he was in his right mind  he took her hand and waited a moment trying to compose himself  listen to me he said at the first consultation i had with sharon he gave this advice to mr troy and to me he said suspect the very last person on whom suspicion could possibly fall those words taken with the questions he had asked before he pronounced his opinion struck through me as if he had struck me with a knife i instantly suspected lady lydiards nephew wait from that time to this i have said nothing of my suspicion to any living soul i knew in my own heart that it took its rise in the inveterate dislike that i have always felt for mr sweetsir and i distrusted it accordingly but i went back to sharon for all that and put the case into his hands his investigations informed me that mr sweetsir owed debts of honor as gentlemen call them incurred through lost bets to a large number of persons and among them a bet of five hundred pounds lost to mr hardyman further inquiries showed that mr hardyman had taken the lead in declaring that he would post mr sweetsir as a defaulter and have him turned out of his clubs and turned out of the bettingring ruin stared him in the face if he failed to pay his debt to mr hardyman on the last day left to himthe day after the note was lost on that very morning lady lydiard speaking to me of her nephews visit to her said if i had given him an opportunity of speaking felix would have borrowed money of me i saw it in his face one moment more isabel i am not only certain that mr sweetsir took the fivehundred pound note out of the open letter i am firmly persuaded that he is the man who told lord rotherfield of the circumstances under which you left lady lydiards house your marriage to mr hardyman might have put you in a position to detect the theft you not i might in that case have discovered from your husband that the stolen note was the note with which mr sweetsir paid his debt he came here you may depend on it to make sure that he had succeeded in destroying your prospects a more depraved villain at heart than that man never swung from a gallows  he checked himself at those words the shock of the disclosure the passion and vehemence with which he spoke overwhelmed isabel she trembled like a frightened child  while he was still trying to soothe and reassure her a low whining made itself heard at her feet they looked down and saw tommie finding himself noticed at last he expressed his sense of relief by a bark something dropped out of his mouth as moody stooped to pick it up the dog ran to isabel and pushed his head against her feet as his way was when he expected to have the handkerchief thrown over him preparatory to one of those games at hideandseek which have been already mentioned isabel put out her hand to caress him when she was stopped by a cry from moody it was his turn to tremble now his voice faltered as he said the words the dog has found the pocketbook  he opened the book with shaking hands a bettingbook was bound up in it with the customary calendar he turned to the date of the day after the robbery  there was the entry felix sweetsir paid 500 pounds note numbered n 8 70564 dated 15th may 1875  moody took from his waistcoat pocket his own memorandum of the number of the lost banknote read it isabel he said i wont trust my memory  she read it the number and date of the note entered in the pocketbook exactly corresponded with the number and date of the note that lady lydiard had placed in her letter  moody handed the pocketbook to isabel there is the proof of your innocence he said thanks to the dog will you write and tell mr hardyman what has happened he asked with his head down and his eyes on the ground  she answered him with the bright color suddenly flowing over her face  you shall write to him she said when the time comes  what time he asked  she threw her arms round his neck and hid her face on his bosom  the time she whispered when i am your wife  a low growl from tommie reminded them that he too had some claim to be noticed  isabel dropped on her knees and saluted her old playfellow with the heartiest kisses she had ever given him since the day when their acquaintance began you darling she said as she put him down again what can i do to reward you  tommie rolled over on his backmore slowly than usual in consequence of his luncheon in the tent he elevated his four paws in the air and looked lazily at isabel out of his bright brown eyes if ever a dogs look spoke yet tommies look said i have eaten too much rub my stomach     postscript  persons of a speculative turn of mind are informed that the following document is for sale and are requested to mention what sum they will give for it  iou lady lydiard five hundred pounds l500 felix sweetsir  her ladyship became possessed of this pecuniary remittance under circumstances which surround it with a halo of romantic interest it was the last communication she was destined to receive from her accomplished nephew there was a note attached to it which cannot fail to enhance its value in the estimation of all rightminded persons who assist the circulation of paper money  the lines that follow are strictly confidential  noteour excellent moody informs me my dear aunt that you have decided against his advice on refusing to prosecute i have not the slightest idea of what he means but i am very much obliged to him nevertheless for reminding me of a circumstance which is of some interest to yourself personally  i am on the point of retiring to the continent in search of health one generally forgets something important when one starts on a journey before moody called i had entirely forgotten to mention that i had the pleasure of borrowing five hundred pounds of you some little time since  on the occasion to which i refer your language and manner suggested that you would not lend me the money if i asked for it obviously the only course left was to take it without asking i took it while moody was gone to get some curacoa and i returned to the picturegallery in time to receive that delicious liqueur from the footmans hands  you will naturally ask why i found it necessary to supply myself if i may borrow an expression from the language of state finance with this forced loan i was actuated by motives which i think do me honor my position at the time was critical in the extreme my credit with the moneylenders was at an end my friends had all turned their backs on me i must either take the money or disgrace my family if there is a man living who is sincerely attached to his family i am that man i took the money  conceive your position as my aunt i say nothing of myself if i had adopted the other alternative turned out of the jockey club turned out of tattersalls turned out of the bettingring in short posted publicly as a defaulter before the noblest institution in england the turfand all for want of five hundred pounds to stop the mouth of the greatest brute i know of alfred hardyman let me not harrow your feelings and mine by dwelling on it dear and admirable woman to you belongs the honor of saving the credit of the family i can claim nothing but the inferior merit of having offered you the opportunity  my iou it is needless to say accompanies these lines can i do anything for you abroadf s   to this it is only necessary to add first that moody was perfectly right in believing f s to be the person who informed hardymans father of isabels position when she left lady lydiards house and secondly that felix did really forward mr troys narrative of the theft to the french police altering nothing in it but the number of the lost banknote   what is there left to write about nothing is leftbut to say goodby very sorrowfully on the writers part to the persons of the story  goodby to miss pinkwho will regret to her dying day that isabels answer to hardyman was no  goodby to lady lydiardwho differs with miss pink and would have regretted it to her dying day if the answer had been yes  goodby to moody and isabelwhose history has closed with the closing of the clergymans book on their weddingday  goodby to hardymanwho has sold his farm and his horses and has begun a new life among the famous fast trotters of america  goodby to old sharonwho a martyr to his promise brushed his hair and washed his face in honor of moodys marriage and catching a severe cold as the necessary consequence declared in the intervals of sneezing that he would never do it again  and last not least goodby to tommie no the writer gave tommie his dinner not half an hour since and is too fond of him to say goodby
