64981100	the burning spear  by john galsworthy    being the experiences of mr john lavender in the time of war  recorded by a r pm john galsworthy   note john galsworthy said of this work the burning spear was revenge of the nerves it was bad enough to have to bear the dreads and strains and griefs of war several years after its first publication he admitted authorship and it was included in the collected edition of his works dw         with a heart of furious fancies      whereof i am commander      with a burning spear and a horse of air      in the wilderness i wander      with a night of ghosts and shadows      i summoned am to tourney      ten leagues beyond the wide worlds end      for me it is no journey               tom obedlam     the burning spear     i  the hero  in the year  there dwelt on hampstead heath a small thin gentleman of fiftyeight gentle disposition and independent means whose wits had become somewhat addled from reading the writings and speeches of public men the castle which like every englishman he inhabited was embedded in lilac bushes and laburnums and was attached to another castle embedded in deference to our national dislike of uniformity in acacias and laurustinus our gentleman whose name was john lavender had until the days of the great war passed one of those curious existences are sometimes to be met with in doing harm to nobody he had been brought up to the bar but like most barristers had never practised and had spent his time among animals and the wisdom of the past at the period in which this record opens he owned a young female sheepdog called blink with beautiful eyes obscured by hair and was attended to by a thin and energetic housekeeper in his estimation above all weakness whose name was marian petty and by her husband his chauffeur whose name was joe  it was the ambition of our hero to be like all public men without fear and without reproach he drank not abstained from fleshly intercourse and habitually spoke the truth his face was thin high cheekboned and not unpleasing with one loose eyebrow over which he had no control his eyes bright and of hazel hue looked his fellows in the face without seeing what was in it though his moustache was still dark his thick waving hair was permanently white for his study was lined from floor to ceiling with books pamphlets journals and the recorded utterances of great mouths he was of a frugal habit ate what was put before him without question and if asked what he would have invariably answered what is there without listening to the reply for at mealtimes it was his custom to read the writings of great men  joe he would say to his chauffeur who had a slight limp a green wandering eye and a red face with a rather curved and rather redder nose you must read this  and joe would answer  which one is that sir  hummingtop a great man i think joe  a brainy chap right enough sir  he has done wonders for the country listen to this and mr lavender would read as follows if i had fifty sons i would give them all if i had forty daughters they should nurse and scrub and weed and fill shells if i had thirty countryhouses they should all be hospitals if i had twenty pens i would use them all day long if had ten voices they should never cease to inspire and aid my country  if e had nine lives interrupted joe with a certain suddenness ed save the lot  mr lavender lowered the paper  i cannot bear cynicism joe there is no quality so unbecoming to a gentleman  me and im dont put in for that sir  joe mr lavender would say you are incorrigible  our gentleman in common with all worthy of the name had a bankbook which in hopes that it would disclose an unsuspected balance he would have made up every time he read an utterance exhorting people to invest and save their country  one morning at the end of may finding there was none he called in his housekeeper and said  mrs petty we are spending too much we have again been exhorted to save listen every penny diverted from prosecution of the war is one more spent in the interests of the enemies of mankind no patriotic person i am confident will spend upon him or herself a stiver which could be devoted to the noble ends so near to all our hearts let us make every spare copper into bullets to strengthen the sinews of war a great speech what can we do without  the newspapers sir  dont be foolish mrs petty from what else could we draw our inspiration and comfort in these terrible days  mrs petty sniffed well you cant eat less than you do she said but you might stop feedin blink out of your rationsthat i do think  i have not found that forbidden as yet in any public utterance returned mr lavender but when the earl of betternot tells us to stop i shall follow his example you may depend on that the country comes before everything mrs petty tossed her head and murmured darkly  do you suppose hes got an example sir  mrs petty replied mr lavender that is quite unworthy of you but tell me what can we do without  i could do without joe responded mrs petty now that youre not using him as chauffeur  please be serious joe is an institution besides i am thinking of offering myself to the government as a speaker now that we may use gas  ah said mrs petty  i am going down about it tomorrow  indeed sir  i feel my energies are not fully employed  no sir  by the way there was a wonderful leader on potatoes yesterday we must dig up the garden do you know what the subsoil is  brickbats and dead cats i expect sir  ah we shall soon improve that every inch of land reclaimed is a nail in the coffin of our common enemies  and going over to a bookcase mr lavender took out the third from the top of a pile of newspapers listen he said the problem before us is the extraction of every potential ounce of food no half measures must content us potatoes potatoes no matter how where when the prime national necessity is now the growth of potatoes all britons should join in raising a plant which may be our very salvation  fudge murmured mrs petty  mr lavender read on and his eyes glowed  ah he thought i too can do my bit to save england it needs but the spark to burn away the dross of this terrible horsesense which keeps the country back  mrs petty but mrs petty was already not                                the grass never grew under the feet of mr lavender no sooner had he formed his sudden resolve than he wrote to what he conceived to be the proper quarter and receiving no reply went down to the centre of the official world it was at time of change and no small national excitement brooms were sweeping clean and new offices had arisen everywhere mr lavender passed bewildered among large stone buildings and small wooden buildings not knowing where to go he had bought no clothes since the beginning of the war except the various volunteer uniforms which the exigencies of a shifting situation had forced the authorities to withdraw from time to time and his small shrunken figure struck somewhat vividly on the eye with elbows and knees shining in the summer sunlight stopping at last before the only object which seemed unchanged he said  can you tell me where the ministry is  the officer looked down at him  what for  for speaking about the country  ministry of propagation first on the right second door on the left  thank you the police are wonderful  none of that said the officer coldly  i only said you were wonderful  i eard you  but you are i dont know what the country would do without you your solid qualities your imperturbable bonhomie your truly british tenderness towards  pass away said the officer  i am only repeating what we all say of you rejoined mr lavender reproachfully  did you ear me say move on said the officer or must i make you an example  you are the example said mr lavender warmly  any more names returned the officer and i take you to the station and he moved out into the traffic puzzled by his unfriendliness mr lavender resumed his search and arriving at the door indicated went in a dark dusty deserted corridor led him nowhere till he came on a little girl in a brown frock with her hair down her back  can you tell me little one he said laying his hand on her head  chuck it said the little girl  no no responded mr lavender deeply hurt can you tell me where i can find the minister  ave you an appointment  no but i wrote to him he should expect me  wot nyme  john lavender here is my card  ill tyke it in wyte ere  wonderful mused mr lavender the patriotic impulse already stirring in these little hearts what was the stanza of that patriotic poet       lives not a babe who shall not feel the pulse      of britains need beat wild in britains wrist      and sacrificial in the worlds convulse      put up its lips to be by britain kissed  so young to bring their lives to the service of the country  come on said the little girl reappearing suddenly ell see you  mr lavender entered a room which had a considerable resemblance to the office of a lawyer save for the absence of tomes it seemed furnished almost exclusively by the minister who sat with knees crossed in a pair of large round tortoiseshell spectacles which did not however veil the keenness of his eyes he was a man with close cropped grey hair a broad yellow cleanshaven face and thrusting grey eyes  mr lavender he said in a raw forcible voice sit down will you  i wrote to you began our hero expressing the wish to offer myself as a speaker  ah said the minister lets seelavender lavender heres your letter and extracting a letter from a file he read it avoiding with difficulty his tortoiseshell spectacles you want to stump the country ma barrister and fellow of the zoological are you a good speaker  if zeal began mr lavender  thats it spark were out to win this war sir  quite so began mr lavender if devotion  youll have to use gas said the minister and we dont pay  pay cried mr lavender with horror no indeed  the minister bent on him a shrewd glance  whats your line anything particular or just general patriotism i recommend that but youll have to put some punch into it you know  i have studied all the great orators of the war sir said mr lavender and am familiar with all the great writers on it i should form myself on them and if enthusiasm  quite said the minister if you want any atrocities we can give you them no facts and no figures just general pat  i shall endeavour began mr lavender  well goodbye said the minister rising when do you start  mr lavender rose too tomorrow he said if i can get inflated  the minister rang a bell  youre on your own mind he said no facts what they want is ginger yes mr japes  and seeing that the minister was looking over his tortoiseshell spectacles at somebody behind him mr lavender turned and went out in the corridor he thought what terseness how different from the days when dickens wrote his circumlocution office punch and opening the wrong door he found himself in the presence of six little girls in brown frocks sitting against the walls with their thumbs in their mouths  oh he said im afraid ive lost my way  the eldest of the little girls withdrew a thumb  what dyer want  the door said mr lavender  second on the right  goodbye said mr lavender  the little girls did not answer and he went out thinking these children are really wonderful what devotion one sees and yet the country is not yet fully roused     ii  the valet  joe petty stood contemplating the car which purchased some fifteen years before had not been used since the war began birds had nested in its hair it smelled of mould inside it creaked from rust the guvnor must be cracked he thought to think we can get anywhere in this old geyser well well its summer if we break down it wont break my eart government jobbetter than diggin or drillin good old guv so musing he lit his pipe and examined the recesses beneath the drivers seat a bottle or three he thought in case our patriotism should get us stuck a bit off the beaten a loaf or two some oney in a pot and a good old am  a life on the rollin road ow they can give im the job i cant think his soliloquy was here interrupted by the approach of his wife bearing a valise  dont you wish you was comin old girl he remarked to her lightly  i do not im glad to be shut of you keep his feet dry what have you got under there  joe petty winked  what a lumbering great thing it looks said mrs petty gazing upwards  ah returned her husband thoughtfully well ave the population round us without advertisement and taking the heads of two small boys who had come up he knocked them together in an absentminded fashion  well said mrs petty i cant waste time heres his extra set of teeth dont lose them have you got your own toothbrush use it and behave yourself let me have a line and dont let him get excited she tapped her forehead  go away you boys shoo  the boys now six in number raised a slight cheer for at that moment mr lavender in a broadbrimmed grey felt hat and a holland dustcoat came out through his gardengate carrying a pile of newspapers and pamphlets so large that his feet legs and hat alone were visible  open the door joe he said and stumbled into the body of the vehicle a shrill cheer rose from the eight boys who could see him through the further window taking this for an augury of success mr lavender removed his hat and putting his head through the window thus addressed the ten boys  i thank you the occasion is one which i shall ever remember the government has charged me with the great task of rousing our country in days which demand of each of us the utmost exertions i am proud to feel that i have here on the very threshold of my task an audience of bright young spirits each one of whom in this democratic country has in him perhaps the makings of a general or even of a prime minister let it be your earnest endeavour boys  at this moment a piece of indiarubber rebounded from mr lavenders forehead and he recoiled into the body of the car  are you right sir said joe looking in and without waiting for reply he started the engine the car moved out amid a volley of stones balls cheers and other missiles from the fifteen boys who pursued it with frenzy swaying slightly from side to side with billowing bag it gathered speed and turning a corner took road for the country mr lavender somewhat dazed for the indiarubber had been hard sat gazing through the little back window at the great city he was leaving his lips moved expressing unconsciously the sentiments of innumerable lord mayors greatest city in the world queen of commerce whose full heart i can still hear beating behind me in mingled pride and regret i leave you with the most sacred gratitude i lay down my office i go to other work whosejoe  sir  do you see that  i see your ead thats all sir  we seem to be followed by a little column of dust which keeps ever at the same distance in the middle of the road do you think it can be an augury  no i should think its a dog  in that case hold hard said mr lavender who had a weakness for dogs joe slackened the cars pace and leaned his head round the corner the column of dust approached rapidly  it is a dog said mr lavender its blink  the female sheepdog almost flat with the ground from speed emerged from the dust wild with hair and anxiety white on the cheeks and chest and top of the head and grey in the body and the very little tail and passed them like a streak of lightning  get on cried mr lavender excited follow her shes trying to catch us up  joe urged on the car which responded gallantly swaying from side to side while the gasbag bellied and shook but the faster it went the faster the sheepdog flew in front of it  this is dreadful said mr lavender in anguish leaning far out blink blink  his cries were drowned in the roar of the car  damn the brute muttered joe at this rate shell be over the edge in alf a mo wherever does she think we are  blink blink wailed mr lavender get on joe get on shes gaining on us  well i never see anything like this said joe chasin wots chasing you hi hi  urged on by their shouts and the noise of the pursuing car the poor dog redoubled her efforts to rejoin her master and mr lavender joe and the car which had begun to emit the most lamentable creaks and odours redoubled theirs  i shall bust her up said joe  i care not cried mr lavender i must recover the dog  they flashed through the outskirts of the garden city stop her stop her called mr lavender to such of the astonished inhabitants as they had already left behind this is a nightmare joe  its a blinkin daydream returned joe forcing the car to an expiring spurt  if she gets to that ill before we ketch er were done the old geyser cant alf crawl up ills  were gaining shrieked mr lavender i can see her tongue  as though it heard his voice the car leaped forward and stopped with a sudden and most formidable jerk the door burst open and mr lavender fell out upon his sheepdog  fortunately they were in the only bed of nettles in that part of the world and its softness and that of blink assuaged the severity of his fall yet it was some minutes before he regained the full measure of his faculties he came to himself sitting on a milestone with his dog on her hind legs between his knees licking his face clean and panting down his throat  joe he said where are you  the voice of joe replied from underneath the car here sir shes popped  do you mean that our journey is arrested  ah were in irons you may as well walk ome sir it aint two miles  no no said mr lavender we passed the garden city a little way back i could go and hold a meeting how long will you be  a day or two said joe  mr lavender sighed and at this manifestation of his grief his sheepdog redoubled her efforts to comfort him nothing becomes one more than the practice of philosophy he thought i always admired those great public men who in moments of national peril can still dine with a good appetite we will sit in the car a little for i have rather a pain and think over a speech so musing he mounted the car followed by his dog and sat down in considerable discomfort  what subject can i choose for a garden city he thought and remembering that he had with him the speech of a bishop on the subject of babies he dived into his bundle of literature and extracting a pamphlet began to con its periods a sharp blow from a hammer on the bottom of the car just below where blink was sitting caused him to pause and the dog to rise and examine her tiny tail  curious thought mr lavender dreamily how joe always does the right thing in the wrong place he is very english the hammering continued and the dog who traced it to the omnipotence of her master got up on the seat where she could lick his face mr lavender was compelled to stop  joe he said leaning out and down must you  the face of joe very red leaned out and up whats the matter now sir  i am preparing a speech must you hammer  no returned joe i neednt  i dont wish you to waste your time said mr lavender  dont worry about that sir replied joe theres plenty to do  in that case i shall be glad to finish my speech  mr lavender resumed his seat and blink her position on the floor with her head on his feet the sound of his voice soon rose again in the car like the buzzing of large flies if we are to win this war we must have an everincreasing population in town and countryside in the palace and the slum above all in the garden city we must have babies  here blink who had been regarding him with lustrous eyes leaped on to his knees and licked his mouth again mr lavender was compelled to stop  down blink down i am not speaking to you the future of our country depends on the little citizens born now i especially appeal to women it is to them we must look  will you ave a glass sir  mr lavender saw before him a tumbler containing a yellow fluid  joe he said sadly you know my rule  eres the exception sir  mr lavender sighed no no i must practise what i preach i shall soon be rousing the people on the liquor question too  well eres luck said joe draining the glass will you ave a slice of am  that would not be amiss said mr lavender taking joes knife with the slice of ham upon its point it is to them that we must look he resumed to rejuvenate the empire and make good the losses in the firingline and he raised the knife to his mouth no result followed while blink wriggled on her base and licked her lips  blink said mr lavender reproachfully joe  sir  when youve finished your lunch and repaired the car you will find me in the town hall or marketplace take care of blink ill tie her up have you some string  having secured his dog to the handle of the door and disregarded the intensity of her gaze mr lavender walked back towards the garden city with a pamphlet in one hand and a crutchhandled stick in the other restoring the ham to its nest behind his feet joe finished the bottle of bass this is a bit of all right he thought dreamily lie down you bitch quiet how can i get my nap while you make that row lie down thats better  blink was silent gnawing at her string the smile deepened on joes face his head fell a little one side his mouth fell open a fly flew into it  ah he thought spitting it out dogs quiet now he slept     iii  mr lavender addresses a crowd of huns  give them ginger thought mr lavender approaching the first houses my first task however will be to collect them  can you tell me he said to a dustman where the marketplace is  aint none  the town hall then  likewise  what place is there then said mr lavender where people congregate  they dont  do they never hold public meetings here  ah said the dustman mysteriously  i wish to address them on the subject of babies  bill gent abaht babies whered he better go  the man addressed however who carried a bag of tools did not stop  youear said the dustman and urging his horse passed on  how rude thought mr lavender something cold and wet was pressed against his hand he felt a turmoil and saw blink moving round and round him curved like a horseshoe with a bit of string dangling from her white neck at that moment of discouragement the sight of one who believed in him gave mr lavender nothing but pleasure how wonderful dogs are he murmured the sheepdog responded by bounds and earsplitting barks so that two boys and a little girl wheeling a perambulator stopped to look and listen  she is like mercury thought mr lavender and taking advantage of her interest in his hat which she had knocked off in her effusions he placed his hand on her head and crumpled her ear the dog passed into an hypnotic trance broken by soft grumblings of pleasure the most beautiful eyes in the world thought mr lavender replacing his hat the innocence and goodness of her face are entrancing  in his long holland coat with his widebrimmed felt hat all dusty and the crutchhandled stick in his hand he had already arrested the attention of five boys the little girl with the perambulator a postman a maidservant and three old ladies  what a beautiful dog yours is said one of the old ladies dear creature are you a shepherd  mr lavender removed his hat  no madam he said a public speaker  how foolish of me replied the old lady  not at all madam the folly is mine and mr lavender bowed i have come here to give an address on babies  the old lady looked at him shrewdly and saying something in a low voice to her companions passed on to halt again a little way off  in the meantime the rumour that there was a horse down in the clemenceau road had spread rapidly and more boys several little girls and three soldiers in blue with red ties had joined the group round mr lavender to whom there seemed something more than providential in this rapid assemblage looking round him for a platform from which to address them he saw nothing but the low wall of the little villa garden outside which he was standing mounting on this therefore and firmly grasping the branch of a young acacia tree to steady himself he stood upright while blink on her hind legs scratched at the wall whining and sniffing his feet  encouraged by the low murmur of astonishment which swelled idly into a shrill cheer mr lavender removed his hat and spoke as follows  fellow britons at this crisis in the history of our country i make no apology for addressing myself to the gathering i see around me here in the cradle of patriotism and the very heart of movements i may safely assume that you are aware of the importance of manpower at a moment when every man of a certain age and over is wanted at the front and every woman of marriageable years is needed in hospitals in factories on the land or where not we see as never before the paramount necessity of mobilizing the forces racial progress and increasing the numbers of our population not a man not a woman can be spared from the great task in which they are now engaged of defeating the common enemy side by side with our american cousins with la belle france and the queen of the adriatic we are fighting to avert the greatest menace which ever threatened civilization our cruel enemies are strong and ruthless while i have any say in this matter no man or woman shall be withdrawn from the sacred cause of victory better they should die to the last unit than that we should take our hands from the plough but ladies and gentlemen we must never forget that in the place of every one who dies we must put two do not be content with ordinary measures these are no piping times of peace never was there in the history of this country such a crying need forfor twins if i may put it picturesquely in each family in each home where there are no families let there be two babies where there was one for thus only can we triumph over the devastation of this war at this moment the now considerable audience which had hitherto been silent broke into a shrill ear ear and mr lavender taking his hand from the acacia branch to silence them fell off the wall into the garden seeing her master thus vanish blink who had never ceased to whine and sniff his toes leaped over and landed on his chest rising with difficulty mr lavender found himself in front of an elderly man with a commercial cast of countenance who said youre trespassing  i am aware of it returned mr lavender and i beg your pardon it was quite inadvertent however  rubbish said the man  i fell off the wall  whose wall do you think it is said the man  how should i know said mr lavender i am a stranger  out you go said the man applying his boot to blink  mr lavenders eyes blazed you may insult me he said but you must not kick my dog or i shall do you an injury  try said the man  i will responded mr lavender taking off his holland coat  to what extremities he would have proceeded cannot be told for at this moment the old lady who had taken him for a shepherd appeared on the path tapping her forehead with finger  all right said the owner of the garden take him away  the old lady laced her hand within mr lavenders arm come with me sir she said and your nice doggie  mr lavender whose politeness to ladies was invariable bowed and resuming his coat accompanied her through the garden gate he kicked my dog he said no action could be more despicable  yes yes said the old lady soothingly poor doggie  the crowd who had hoped for better things here gave vent to a prolonged jeer  stop said mr lavender i am going to take a collection  there there said the old lady poor man  i dont know what you mean by that madam said mr lavender whose spirit was roused i shall certainly take a collection in the interests of our population so saying he removed his hat and disengaging his arm from the old ladys hand moved out into the throng extending the hat a boy took it from him at once and placing it on his head ran off pursued by blink who by barking and jumping up increased the boys speed to one of which he could never have thought himself capable mr lavender followed calling out blink at the top of his voice the crowd followed mr lavender and the old lady followed crowd thus they proceeded until the boy arriving at a small piece of communal water flung the hat into the middle of it and scaling the wall made a strategic detour and became a disinterested spectator among the crowd the hat after skimming the surface of the pond settled like a waterlily crown downwards while blink perceiving in all this the hand of her master stood barking at it wildly mr lavender arrived at the edge of the pond slightly in advance of the crowd  good blink he said fetch it good blink  blink looked up into his face and with the acumen for which her breed is noted perceiving he desired her to enter the water backed away from it  she is not a water dog explained mr lavender to the three soldiers in blue clothes  good dog fetch it blink backed into the soldiers who bending down took her by head tail threw her into the pond and encouraged her on with small stones pitched at the hat having taken the plunge the intelligent animal waded boldly to the hat and endeavoured by barking and making little rushes at it with her nose to induce it to return to shore  she thinks its a sheep said mr lavender a striking instance of hereditary instinct  blink unable to persuade the hat mounted it with her forepaws and trod it under  ooray shouted the crowd  give us a shilling guvnor an ill get it for yer  thank you my boy said mr lavender producing a shilling  the boythe same boy who had thrown it instepped into the water and waded towards the hat but as he approached blink interposed between him and the hat growling and showing her teeth  does she bite yelled the boy  only strangers cried mr lavender  excited by her masters appeal blink seized the jacket of the boy who made for the shore while the hat rested in the centre of the pond the cynosure of the stones with which the soldiers were endeavouring to drive it towards the bank by this time the old lady had rejoined mr lavender  your nice hat she murmured  i thank you for your sympathy madam lavender running his hand through his hair in moments like these one realizes the deep humanity of the british people i really believe that in no other race could you find such universal interest and anxiety to recover a hat say what you will we are a great nation who only need rousing to show our best qualities do you remember the words of the editor in the spavined and spatchcocked ruin to which our inhuman enemies have reduced civilization we of the island shine with undimmed effulgence in all those qualities which mark man out from the ravening beast  but how are you going to get your hat asked the old lady  i know not returned mr lavender still under the influence of the sentiment he had quoted but if i had fifteen hats i would take them all off to the virtues which have been ascribed to the british people by all those great men who have written and spoken since the war began  yes said the old lady soothingly but i think you had better come under my sunshade the sun is very strong  madam said mr lavender you are very good but your sunshade is too small to deprive you of even an inch of its shade would be unworthy of anyone in public life so saying he recoiled from the proffered sunshade into the pond which he had forgotten was behind him  oh dear said the old lady now youve got your feet wet  it is nothing responded mr lavender gallantly and seeing that he was already wet he rolled up his trousers and holding up the tails of his holland coat turned round and proceeded towards his hat to the frantic delight of the crowd  the war is a lesson to us to make little of little things he thought securing the hat and wringing it out my feet are wet buthow much wetter they would be in the trenches if feet can be wetter than wet through he mused with some exactitude down blink down for blink was plastering him with the watermarks of joy and anxiety nothing is quite so beautiful as the devotion of ones own dog thought mr lavender resuming the hat and returning towards the shore the bynowconsiderable throng were watching him with every mark of acute enjoyment and the moment appeared to mr lavender auspicious for addressing them without therefore emerging from the pond which he took for his platform he spoke as follows  circumstances over which i have no control have given me the advantage of your presence in numbers which do credit to the heart of the nation to which we all belong in the midst of the greatest war which ever threatened the principle of liberty i rejoice to see so many people able to follow the free and spontaneous impulses of their inmost beings for while we must remember that our every hour is at the disposal of our country we must not forget the maxim of our fathers britons never will be slaves only by preserving the freedom of individual conscience and at the same time surrendering it wholeheartedly to every which the state makes on us can we hope defeat the machinations of the arch enemies of mankind  at this moment a little stone hit him sharply on the hand  who threw that stone said mr lavender let him stand out  the culprit no other indeed than he who had thrown the hat in and not fetched it out for a shilling thus menaced with discovery made use of a masterly device and called out loudly  progerman  such was the instinctive patriotism of the crowd that the cry was taken up in several quarters and for the moment mr lavender remained speechless from astonishment the cries of progerman increased in volume and a stone hitting her on the nose caused blink to utter a yelp mr lavenders eyes blazed  huns he cried huns i am coming out  with this prodigious threat he emerged from the pond at the very moment that a car scattered the throng and a wellknown voice said  well sir you ave been goin it  joe said mr lavender dont speak to me  get in  never  progermans yelled the crowd  get in repeated joe  and seizing mr lavender as if collaring him at football he knocked off his hat propelled him into the car banged the door mounted and started at full speed with blink leaping and barking in front of them  debouching from piave parade into bottomley lane he drove up it till the crowd was but a memory before he stopped to examine the condition his master mr lavender was hanging out of window looking back and shivering violently  well sir said joe i dont think  joe said mr lavender that crowd ought not to be at large they were manifestly huns  the speakins been a bit too much for you sir said joe but youve got it off your chest anyway  mr lavender regarded him for a moment in silence then putting his hand to his throat said hoarsely  no on my chest i think joe all public speakers do it is inseparable from that great calling  alf a mo grunted joe diving into the recesses beneath the drivingseat ere swig that off sir  mr lavender raised the tumbler of fluid to his mouth and drank it off only from the dregs left on his moustache did he perceive that it smelled of rum and honey  joe he said reproachfully you have made me break my pledge  joe smiled well what are they for sir youll sleep at ome tonight  never said mr lavender i shall sleep at high barnet i must address them there tomorrow on abstinence during the war  as you please sir but try and ave a nap while we go along and lifting blink into the car where she lay drenched and exhausted by excitement with the petal of a purple flower clinging to her black nose he mounted to his seat and drove off mr lavender for years unaccustomed to spirituous liquor of which he had swallowed nearly half a pint neat passed rapidly into a state of coma nor did he fully regain consciousness till he awoke in bed the next morning     iv  into the dangers of a public life  at what time is my meeting thought mr lavender vaguely gazing at the light filtering through the venetian blind blink  his dog who was lying beside his bed gnawing a bone which with some presence of mind she had brought in raised herself and regarded him with the innocence of her species she has an air of divine madness thought mr lavender which is very pleasing to me i have a terrible headache and seeing a bellrope near his hand he pulled it  a voice said yes sir  i wish to see my servant joe petty said lavender i shall not require any breakfast thank you what is the population of high barnet  im sure i dont know what youre talking about sir answered the voice which seemed to be that of his housekeeper but you cant see joe hes gone out with a flea in his ear the idea of his letting you get your feet wet like that  how is this said mr lavender i thought you were the chambermaid of the inn at high barnet  no indeed said mrs petty soothingly placing a thermometer in his mouth smoke that a minute sir oh look at what this dogs brought in fie and taking the bone between thumb and finger she cast it out of the window while blink aware that she was considered in the wrong and convinced that she was in the right spread out her left paw laid her head on her right paw and pressed her chin hard against it mrs petty returning from the window stood above her master who lay gazing up with the thermometer jutting out through the middle of his moustache  i thought so she said removing it a hundred and one no getting up for you sir that joe  mrs petty said mr lavender rather feebly for his head pained him excessively bring me the morning papers  no sir the thermometer bursts at an an ten ill bring you the doctor  mr lavender was about to utter a protest when he reflected that all public men had doctors  about the bulletin he said faintly  what ejaculated mrs petty whose face seemed to mr lavender to have become all cheekbones eyes and shadows joe never said a about a bullet where and however did you get it in  i did not say bullet in murmured mr lavender closing his eyes i said bulletin they have it  at this mysterious sentence mrs petty lifted her hands and muttering the word ravin hastened from the room no sooner had she gone however than blink whose memory was perfect rose and going to the window placed her forepaws on the sill seeing her bone shining on the lawn below with that disregard of worldly consequence which she shared with all fine characters she leaped through the rattle of the venetian blind disturbed mr lavender from the lethargy to which he had reverted mr john lavender passed a good night he thought but his condition is still critical and in his disordered imagination he seemed to see people outside tube stations standing stockstill in the middle of the traffic reading that bulletin in the evening papers let me see he mused how will they run tomorrow i shall be better but not yet able to leave my bed the day after tomorrow i shall have a slight relapse and my condition will still give cause for anxiety on the day followingwhat is that noise for a sound like the whiffling of a wind through dry sticks combined with the creaking of a saw had impinged on his senses it was succeeded by scratching blink said mr lavender a heartrending whine came from outside the door mr lavender rose and opened it his dog came in carrying her bone and putting it down by the bed divided her attention between it and her masters legs revealed by the nightshirt which in deference to the great disraeli he had never abandoned in favour of pyjamas having achieved so erect a posture mr lavender whose heated imagination had now carried him to the convalescent stage of his indisposition felt that a change of air would do him good and going to the window leaned out above a lilactree  mr john lavender he murmured has gone to his seat to recuperate before resuming his public duties  while he stood there his attention was distracted by a tall young lady of fine build and joyous colour who was watering some sweetpeas in the garden of the adjoining castle naturally delicate mr lavender at once sought a jacket and having put it on resumed his position at the window he had not watched her more than two minutes before he saw that she was cultivating soil and filled with admiration he leaned still further out and said  my dear young madam you are doing a great work  thus addressed the young lady who had those roving grey eyes which see everything and betoken a large nature not devoid of merry genius looked up and smiled  believe me continued mr lavender no task in these days is so important as the cultivation of the soil now that we are fighting to the last man and the last dollar every woman and child in the islands should put their hands to the plough and at that word his vision became feverishly enlarged so that he seemed to see not merely the young lady but quantities of young ladies filling the whole garden  this he went on raising his voice is the psychological moment the turningpoint in the history of these islands the defeat of our common enemies imposes on us the sacred duty of feeding ourselves once more there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on tooh for in his desire to stir his audience mr lavender had reached out too far and losing foothold on his polished bedroom floor was slipping down into the lilacbush he was arrested by a jerk from behind where blink moved by this sudden elopement of her master had seized him by the nightshirt tails and was staying his descent  is anything up said the young lady  i have lost my balance thickly answered mr lavender whose blood was running to his head which was now lower than his feet fortunately my dog seems to be holding me from behind but if someone could assist her it would be an advantage for i fear that i am slipping  hold on cried the young lady and breaking through the low privet hedge which separated the domains she vanished beneath him with a low gurgling sound  mr lavender who dared not speak again for fear that blink hearing his voice might let go to answer remained suspended torn with anxiety about his costume if she comes in he thought i shall die from shame and if she doesnt i shall die from a broken neck what a dreadful alternative and he firmly grasped the most substantial lilacboughs within his reach listening with the ears of a hare for any sound within the room in which he no longer was to any appreciable extent then the thought of what a public man should feel in his position came to his rescue we die but once he mused rather than shock that charming lady let me seek oblivion and the words of his obituary notice at once began to dance before his eyes this great public servant honoured his country no less in his death than in his life then striking out vigorously with his feet he launched his body forward the words my goodness resounded above him as all restraining influence was suddenly relaxed mr lavender slid into the lilacbush turned heels over head and fell bump on the ground he lay there at full length conscious of everything and especially of the faces of blink and the young lady looking down on him from the window  are you hurt she called  no said mr lavender that iseryes he added ever scrupulously exact  im coming down said the young lady  dont move  with a great effort mr lavender arranged his costume and closed his eyes how many lie like this staring at the blue heavens he thought  where has it got you said a voice and he saw the young lady bending over him  in the dorsal region i think said mr lavender but i suffer more from the thought that ithat you  thats all right said the young lady im a vad it was a bump lets see if you can and taking his hands she raised him to a sitting posture does it work  yes said mr lavender rather faintly  try and stand said the young lady pulling  mr lavender tried and stood but no sooner was he on his feet than she turned her face away great tears rolled down her cheeks and she writhed and shook all over  dont cried mr lavender much concerned i beg you not to cry its nothing i assure younothing the young lady with an effort controlled her emotion and turned her large grey eyes on him  the angelic devotion of nurses murmured mr lavender leaning against the wall of the house with his hand to his back nothing like it has been seen since the world began  i shall never forget the sight said the young lady choking  mr lavender who took the noises she made for sobbing was unutterably disturbed  i cant bear to see you distressed on my account he said i am quite well i assure you looki can walk and he started forth up the garden in his nightshirt and norfolk jacket when he turned round she was no longer there sounds of uncontrollable emotion were audible from the adjoining garden going to the privet hedge he looked aver she was lying gracefully on the grass with her face smothered in her hands and her whole body shaking poor thing thought mr lavender no doubt she is one of those whose nerves have been destroyed by the terrible sights she has seen but at that moment the young lady rose and ran as if demented into her castle mr lavender stayed transfixed who would not be ill for the pleasure of drinking from a cup held by her hand he thought i am fortunate to have received injuries in trying to save her from confusion down blink down  for his dog who had once more leaped from the window was frantically endeavouring to lick his face soothing her and feeling his anatomy mr lavender became conscious that he was not alone an old lady was standing on the gardenpath which led to the front gate holding in her hand a hat mr lavender sat down at once and gathering his nightshirt under him spoke as follows  there are circumstances madam which even the greatest public servants cannot foresee and i who am the humblest of them ask you to forgive me for receiving you in this costume  i have brought your hat back said the old lady with a kindling eye they told me you lived here and i was anxious to know that you and your dear dog were none the worse  madam replied mr lavender i am infinitely obliged to you would you very kindly hang my hat up on theerweeping willow tree  at this moment a little white dog who accompanied the old lady began sniffing round mr lavender and blink wounded in her proprietary instincts placed her paws at once on her masters shoulders so that he fell prone when he recovered a sitting posture neither the old lady nor the little dog were in sight but his hat was hanging on a laurel bush there seems to be something fateful about this morning he mused i had better go in before the rest of the female population and recovering his feet with difficulty he took his hat and was about to enter the house when he saw the young lady watching him from an upper window of the adjoining castle thinking to relieve her anxiety he said at once  my dear young lady i earnestly beg you to believe that such a thing never happens to me as a rule  her face was instantly withdrawn and sighing deeply mr lavender entered the house and made his way upstairs ah he thought painfully recumbent in his bed once more though my bones ache and my head burns i have performed an action not unworthy of the traditions of public life there is nothing more uplifting than to serve youth and beauty at the peril of ones existence humanity and chivalry have ever been the leading characteristics of the british race and really halfdelirious now he cried aloud this incident will for ever inspire those who have any sense of beauty to the fulfilment of our common task believe me we shall never sheathe the sword until the cause of humanity and chivalry is safe once more  blink ever uneasy about sounds which seemed to her to have no meaning stood up on her hind legs and endeavoured to stay them by licking his face and mr lavender who had become so stiff that he could not stir without great pain had to content himself by moving his head feebly from side to side until his dog having taken her fill resumed the examination of her bone perceiving presently that whenever he began totalk she began to lick his face he remained silent with his mouth open and his eyes shut in an almost unconscious condition from which he was roused by a voice saying  he is suffering from alcoholic poisoning  the monstrous injustice of these words restored his faculties and seeing before him what he took to be a large concourse of peoplecomposed in reality of joe petty mrs petty and the doctorhe thus addressed them in a faint feverish voice  the pressure of these times ladies and gentlemen brings to the fore the most pushing and obstreperous blackguards we have amongst us persons who under the thin disguise of patriotism do not scruple to bring hideous charges against public men such but serve the bloodstained cause of our common enemies conscious of the purity of our private lives we do not care what is said of us so long as we can fulfil our duty to our country abstinence from every form of spirituous liquor has been the watchword of all public men since this land was first threatened by the most stupendous cataclysm which ever hung over the heads of a great democracy we have never ceased to preach the need for it and those who say the contrary are largely germans or persons lost to a sense of decency so saying he threw off all the bedclothes and fell back with a groan  easy easy my dear sir said the voice  have you a pain in your back  i shall not submit returned our hero to the ministrations of a hun sooner will i breathe my last  turn him over said the voice and mr lavender found himself on his face  do you feel that said the voice  mr lavender answered faintly into his pillow  it is useless for you to torture me no german hand shall wring from me a groan  is there mania in his family asked the voice at this cruel insult mr lavender who was nearly smothered made a great effort and clearing his mouth of the pillow said  since we have no god nowadays i call the god of my fathers to witness that there is no saner public man than i  it was however his last effort for the wriggle he had given to his spine brought on a kind of vertigo and he relapsed into unconsciousness     v  is convicted of a new disease  those who were assembled round the bed of mr lavender remained for a moment staring at him with their mouths open while blink growled faintly from underneath  put your hand here said the doctor at last  there is a considerable swelling an appearance of inflammation and the legs are a curious colour you gave him threequarters of a tumbler of rumhow much honey  thus addressed joe petty leaning his head a little to one side answered  not alf a pot sir  um there are all the signs here of something quite new hes not had a fall has he  has he said mrs petty severely to her husband  no replied joe  singular said the doctor turn him back again i want to feel his head swollen it may account for his curious way of talking well shove in quinine and keep him quiet with hot bottles to his feet i think we have come on a new war disease ill send you the quinine good morning  wot oh said joe to his wife when they were left alone with the unconscious body of their master poor old guv watch and pray  however could you have given him such a thing  wet outside wet your inside muttered joe sulkily as always been my motto sorry i give im the honey whod ha thought the product of an armless insect could a done im in like this  fiddle said mrs petty in my belief its come on through reading those newspapers if i had my way id bum the lot can i trust you to watch him while i go and get the bottles filled  joe drooped his lids over his greenish eyes and with a whisk of her head his wife left the room  gawd elp us thought joe gazing at his unconscious master and fingering his pipe ow funny women are if i was to smoke in ere shed have a fit ill just ave a whiff in the window though and leaning out he drew the curtains to behind him and lighted his pipe  the sound of blink gnawing her bone beneath the bed alone broke the silence  i could do with a pint o bitter thought joe and noticing the form of the weekly gardener down below he said softly  ello bob  ello replied the gardener ows yours  nicely  goin to ave some rain  ah  whats the matter with that  good for the crops  missis well  so so  wish mine was  wots the matter with her  busy replied joe sinking his voice never ave a woman permanent thats my experience  the gardener did not reply but stood staring at the lilacbush below joe pettys face he was a thin man rather like an old horse  do you think we can win this war resumed joe  dunno replied the gardener apathetically  we seem to be goin back nicely all the time  joe wagged his head youve it it he said and jerking his head back towards the room behind him guvnors got it now  what  the new disease  what new disease  wy the runabahtantellemowtodoit  ah  es copped it fair in bed  you dont say  not alf joe sank his voice still lower wotll you bet me i dont ketch it soon  the gardener uttered a low gurgle  the cats ave been in that laylock he replied twisting off a broken branch ill knock off now for a bit o lunch  but at that moment the sound of a voice speaking as it might be from a cavern caused him and joe petty to stare at each other as if petrified  wot is it whispered joe at last  the gardener jerked his head towards a window on the ground floor  someone in pain he said  sounds like the guvnors voice  ah said the gardener  alf a mo and drawing in his head joe peered through the curtains the bed was empty and the door open  watch it es loose he called to the gardener and descended the stairs at a run  in fact mr lavender had come out of his coma at the words dyou think we can win this war and at once conscious that he had not read the morning papers had got out of bed sallying forth just as he was he had made his way downstairs followed by blink seeing the journals lying on the chest in the hall he took all five to where he usually went at this time of the morning and sat down to read once there the pain he was in added to the disorder occasioned in his brain by the five leaders caused him to give forth a summary of their contents while blink pressed his knees with her chin whenever the rising of his voice betokened too great absorption as was her wont when she wanted him to feed her joe petty joined the gardener in considerable embarrassment  shant i not alf cop it from the missis he murmured the doors locked  the voice of mr lavender maintained its steady flow rising and falling with the tides of his pain and his feelings what then is our duty is it not plain and simple we require every man in the army for that is the sine qua non of victory we must greatly reinforce the ranks of labour in our shipyardsships ships ships always more ships for without them we shall infallibly be defeated we cannot too often repeat that we must see the great drama that is being played before our eyes steadily and we must see it whole not a man must be taken from the cultivation of our soil for on that depends our very existence as a nation without abundant labour of the right sort on the land we cannot hope to cope with the menace of the pirate submarine we must have the long vision and not be scuppered by the fears of those who would deplete our most vital industry in munition works wailed mr lavenders voice as he reached the fourth leader we still require the maximum of effort and a considerable reinforcement of manpower will in that direction be necessary to enable us to establish the overwhelming superiority in the air and in guns which alone can ensure the defeat of our enemies he reached the fifth in what was almost a scream every man up to sixty must be mobilized but here we would utter the most emphatic caveat in the end this war will be won by the country whose financial position stands the strain best the last copper bullet will be the deciding factor our economic strength must on no account be diminished we cannot at this time of day afford to deplete the ranks of trade and let out the very lifeblood in our veins we must see groaned mr lavender the problem steadily and see it whole  poor old geyser said the gardener e do seem bad  old me said joe  ill get on the sill and see what i can do through the top o the window  he got up and held by the gardener put his arm through there was the sound of considerable disturbance and through the barking of blink mr lavenders voice was heard again stanch in the middle of the cataclysm unruffled by the waters of heaven and hell let us be captains of our souls down blink down  hes out said joe rejoining the gardener now for it before my missis comes and he ran into the house  mr lavender was walking dazedly in the hall with the journals held out before him  joe he said catching sight of his servant get the car ready i must be in five places at once for only thus can we defeat the greatest danger which ever threatened the future of civilization  righto sir replied joe and waiting till his master turned round he seized him round the legs and lifting that thin little body ascended the stairs while mr lavender with the journals waving fanlike in his hands his white hair on end and his legs kicking endeavoured to turn his head to see what agency was moving him  at the top of the stairs they came on mrs petty who having scotch blood in her veins stood against the wall to let them pass with a hot bottle in either hand having placed mr lavender in his bed and drawn the clothes up to his eyes joe petty passed the back of his hand across his brow and wrung it out  phew he gasped hes artful  his wife who had followed them in was already fastening her eyes on the carpet  whats that she said sniffing  that repeated joe picking up his pipe why i had to run to ketch im and it fell out o me pocket  and lighted itself said mrs petty darting at the floor and taking up a glowing quid which had burned a little round hole in the carpet youre a pretty one  you cant foresee those sort o things said joe  you cant foresee anything replied his wife you might be a government here hold the clothes while i get the bottles to his feet well i never if he hasnt got and from various parts of mr lavenders body she recovered the five journals for putting things in the wrong place joe petty ive never seen your like  theyll keep im warm said joe  mr lavender who on finding himself in bed had once more fallen into a comatose condition stirred and some words fell from his lips five in one and one in five  what does he say said mrs petty tucking him up  its the odds against candelabra for the derby  only faith cried mr lavender can multiply exceedingly  here take them away muttered mrs petty and dealing the journals a smart slap she handed them to joe  faith repeated mr lavender and fell into a doze  about this new disease said joe dyou think its ketchin i feel rather funny meself  stuff returned his wife clear away those papers and that bone and go and take blink out and sit on a seat its all youre fit for of all the happygoluckys youre the worst  well i never could worry said joe from the doorway tisnt in me so long  and dragging blink by the collar he withdrew  alone with her patient mrs petty an enthusiast for cleanliness and fresh air went on her knees and having plucked out the charred ring of the little hole in the carpet opened the window wider to rid the room of the smell of burning if it wasnt for me she thought leaning out into the air i dont know whatd become of them  a voice from a few feet away said  i hope hes none the worse what does the doctor say  looking round in astonishment mrs petty saw a young lady leaning out of a window on her right  we cant tell at present she said with a certain reserve he is going on satisfactory  its not hydrophobia is it asked the young lady you know he fell out of the window  what ejaculated mrs petty  where the lilacs broken if i can give you a hand i shall be very glad im a vad  thank you im sure said mrs petty stiffly for the passion of jealousy to which she was somewhat prone was rising in her there is no call and she thought va indeed i know them  poor dear said the young lady he did come a bump it was awfully funny is heer and she touched her forehead where tendrils of fair hair were blowing in the breeze  inexpressibly outraged by such a question concerning one for whom she had a proprietary reverence mrs petty answered acidly  oh dear no he is much wiser than some people  it was only that he mentioned the last man and the last dollar you know said the young lady as if to herself but of course thats no real sign and she uttered a sudden silvery laugh  mrs petty became aware of something tickling her left ear and turning round found her master leaning out beside her in his dressinggown  leave me mrs petty he said with such dignity that she instinctively recoiled it may seem to you continued mr lavender addressing the young lady indelicate on my part to resume my justification but as a public man i suffer knowing that i have committed a breach of decorum  dont you think you ought to keep quiet in bed mrs petty heard the young lady ask  my dear young lady mr lavender replied the thought of bed is abhorrent to me at a time like this what more ignoble fate than to die in ones bed  im only asking you to live in it said the young lady while mrs petty grasped her master by the skirts of his gown  down blink down said mr lavender leaning still further out  for pitys sake wailed the young lady dont fall out again or i shall burst  ah believe me said mr lavender in a receding voice i would not pain you further for the world  mrs petty exerting all her strength had hauled him in  arent you ashamed of yourself sir she said severely talking to a young lady like that in your dressinggown  mrs petty said mr lavender mysteriously it might have been worse i should like some tea with a little lemon in it  taking this for a sign of returning reason mrs petty drew him gently towards the bed and having seen him get in tucked him up and said  now sir you never break your word do you  no public man began mr lavender  oh bother now promise me to stay quiet in bed while i get you that tea  i certainly shall replied our hero for i feel rather faint  thats right said mrs petty i trust you and bolting the window she whisked out of the room and locked the door behind her  mr lavender lay with his eyes fixed on the ceiling clucking his parched tongue god he thought for one must use that word when the country is in dangergod be thanked for beauty but i must not allow it to unsteel my soul only when the cause of humanity has triumphed and with the avenging sword and shell we have exterminated that criminal nation only then shall i be entitled to let its gentle influence creep about my being and drinking off the tumbler of tea which mrs petty was holding to his lips he sank almost immediately into a deep slumber     vi  makes a mistake and meets a mooncat  the old lady whose name was sinkin and whose interest in mr lavender had become so deep lived in a castle in frognal and with her lived her young nephew a boy of fortyfive indissolubly connected with the board of guardians it was entirely due to her representations that he presented himself at mr lavenders on the following day and sending in his card was admitted to our heros presence  mr lavender pale and stiff was sitting in his study with blink on his feet reading a speech  excuse my getting up sir he said and pray be seated  the nephew who had a sleepy hairless face and little chinese eyes bowed and sitting down stared at mr lavender with a certain embarrassment  i have come he said at last to ask you a few questions on behalf of  by all means said mr lavender perceiving at once that he was being interviewed i shall be most happy to give you my views please take a cigarette for i believe that is usual i myself do not smoke if it is the human touch you want you may like to know that i gave it up when that appeal in your contemporary flooded the trenches with cigarettes and undermined the nerves of our heroes by setting an example of abstinence and at the same time releasing more tobacco for our men i felt that i was but doing my duty please dont mention that though and while we are on the personal note which i sincerely deprecate you might like to stroll round the room and look at the portrait of my father behind the door and of my mother over the fireplace forgive my not accompanying you the fact isthis is an interesting touchi have always been rather subject to lumbago and seeing the nephew sinkin who had risen to his suggestion standing somewhat irresolutely in front of him he added perhaps you would like to look a little more closely at my eyes every now and then they flash with an almost uncanny insight for by now he had quite forgotten his modesty in the identification he felt with the journal which was interviewing him i am fiftyeight he added quickly but i do not look my years though my hair still thick and full of vigour is prematurely whiteso often the case with men whose brains are continually on the stretch the little home far from grandiose which forms the background to this most interesting personality is embowered in trees cats have made their mark on its lawns and its owners love of animals was sharply illustrated by the sheepdog which lay on his feet clad in turkish slippers get up blink  blink disturbed by the motion of her masters feet rose and gazed long into his face  look said mr lavender she has the most beautiful eyes in the world  at this remark which appeared to him no saner than the others he had heardso utterly did he misjudge mr lavenders characterthe nephew put down the notebook he had taken out of his pocket and said  has there ever been anythingerremarkable about your family  indeed yes said mr lavender born of poor but lofty parentage in the city of rochester my father made his living as a publisher my mother was a true daughter of the bards the scion of a stock tracing its decent from the druids her name was originally jones  ah said the nephew sinkin writing  she has often told me at her knee continued mr lavender that there was a strong vein of patriotism in her family  she did not dieinin  no indeed interrupted mr lavender she is still living there  ah said the nephew and your brothers and sisters  one of my brothers replied mr lavender with pardonable pride is the editor of cud bits the other is a clergyman  eccentric murmured the nephew absently tell me mr lavender do you find your work a great strain does it and he touched the top of his head covered with moist black hair  mr lavender sighed at a time like this he said we must all be prepared to sacrifice our health no public man as you know can call his head his own for a moment i should count myself singularly lacking if i stopped to considerersuch a consideration  considerersuch a consideration repeated the nephew jotting it down  he carries on murmured mr lavender once more identifying himself with the journal grappling with the intricacies of this enormous problem happy in the thought that nothingnot even reason itselfis too precious to sacrifice on the altar of his duty to his country the public may rest confident in the knowledge that he will so carry on till they carry him out on his shield and aware subconsciously that the interview could go no further than that phrase mr lavender was silent gazing up with rather startled eyes  i see said the nephew i am very much obliged to you is your dog safe for blink had begun to growl in a low and uneasy manner  the gentlest creature in the world replied lavender and the most sociable i sometimes think he went on in a changed voice that we have all gone mad and that animals alone retain the sweet reasonableness which used to be esteemed a virtue in human society dont take that down he added quickly we are all subject to moments of weakness it was just an obiter dictum  make your mind easy said the nephew rising it does not serve my purpose just one thing mr lavender  at this moment blink whose instinct had long been aware of some sinister purpose in this tall and heavy man whose trousers did not smell of dogs seeing him approach too near bit him gently in the calf  the nephew started back shes bitten me he said in a hushed voice  my god ejaculated mr lavender and falling back again so stiff was he is it possible there must be some good reason blink  blink wagged her little tail thrust her nose into his hand removed it and growled again  she is quite well i assure you mr lavender added hastily her nose is icy  shes bitten me repeated the nephew pulling up his trouser leg theres no mark but she distinctly bit me  treasure said mr lavender endeavouring to interest him in the dog do you notice how dark the rims of her eyes are and how clear the whites extraordinarily well bred blink  aware that she was being talked of blink continued to be torn between the desire to wag her tail and to growl unable to make up her mind she sighed heavily and fell on her side against her side against her masters legs  wonderful with sheep too said mr lavender at least she would be if they would let her you should see her with them on the heath they simply cant bear her  you will hear from me again said the nephew sourly  thank you said mr lavender i shall be glad of a proof it is always safer i believe  good morning said the nephew  blink who alone perceived the dark meaning in these words seeing him move towards the door began to bark and run from side to side behind him for all the world as if he had been a flock of sheep  keep her off said the nephew anxiously keep her off i refuse to be bitten again  blink called mr lavender in some agony blink whose obedience was excessive came back to him at once and stood growling from under her masters hand laid on the white hair which flowed back from her collar till the nephews footsteps had died away i cannot imagine thought mr lavender why she should have taken exception to that excellent journalist perhaps he did not smell quite right one never knows  and with her moustachioed muzzle pressed to his chin mr lavender sought for explanation in the innocent and living darkness of his dogs eyes  on leaving mr lavenders the nephew forthwith returned to the castle in frognal and sought his aunt  mad as a march hare aunt rosie and his dog bit me  that dear doggie  theyre dangerous  you were always funny about dogs dear said his aunt soothingly why even sealey doesnt really like you and calling to the little low white dog she quite failed to attract his attention did you notice his dress the first time i took him for a shepherd and the second time what do you think ought to be done  hell have to be watched said the nephew we cant have lunatics at large in hampstead  but wilfred said the old lady will our manpower stand it couldnt they watch each other or if it would be any help i could watch him myself i took such a fancy to his dear dog  i shall take steps said the nephew  no dont do that ill go and call on the people next door their name is scarlet theyll know about him no doubt we mustnt do anything inconsiderate  the nephew muttering and feeling his calf withdrew to his study and the old lady having put on her bonnet set forth placidly unaccompanied by her little white dog  on arriving at the castle embedded in acacias and laurustinus she asked of the maid who opened  can i see mrs scarlet  no replied the girl dispassionately shes dead  mr scarlet then  no replied the girl hes a major  oh dear said the old lady  miss isabels at home said the girl who appeared like so many people in time of war to be of a simple plainspoken nature youll find her in the garden and she let the old lady out through a french window  at the far end under an acacia mrs sinkin could see the form of a young lady in a blue dress lying in a hammock with a cigarette between her lips and a yellow book in her hands she approached her thinking dear me how comfortable in these days and putting her head a little on one side she said with a smile my name is sinkin i hope im not disturbing you  the young lady rose with a vigorous gesture  oh no not a bit  i do admire some people said the old lady they seem to find time for everything  the young lady stretched herself joyously  im taking it out before going to my new hospital try it she said touching the hammock its not bad will you have a cigarette  im afraid im too old for both said the old lady though ive often thought they must be delightfully soothing i wanted to speak to you about your neighbour  the young lady rolled her large grey eyes ah she said hes perfectly sweet  i know said the old lady and has such a dear dog my nephews very interested in them you may have heard of himwilfred sinkina very clever man on so many committees  not really said the young lady  oh yes he has one of those heads which nothing can disturb so valuable in these days  and what sort of a heart asked the young lady emitting a ring of smoke  just as serene i oughtnt to say so but i think hes rather a wonderful machine  so long as hes not a doctor you cant think how they get on your nerves when theyre like that ive bumped up against so many of them they fired me at last  really where i thought they only did that to the dear horses oh what a pretty laugh you have its so pleasant to hear anyone laugh in these days  i thought no one did anything else i mean what else can you do except die dont you know  i think thats rather a gloomy view said the old lady placidly but about your neighbour what is his name  lavender but i call him don pickwixote  dear me do you indeed have you noticed anything very eccentric about him  that depends on what you call eccentric wearing a nightshirt for instance i dont know what your standard is you see  the old lady was about to reply when a voice from the adjoining garden was heard saying  blink dont touch that charming mooncat  hush murmured the young lady and seizing her visitors arm she drew her vigorously beneath the acacia tree sheltered from observation by those thick and delicate branches they stooped and applying their eyes to holes in the privet hedge could see a very little cat silveryfawn in colour and far advanced in kittens holding up its paw exactly like a dog and gazing with sherrycoloured eyes at mr lavender who stood in the middle of his lawn with blink behind him  if you see me going to laugh whispered the young lady pinch me hard  mooncat repeated mr lavender where have you come from and what do you want holding up your paw like that what curious little noises you make duckie the cat indeed was uttering sounds rather like a duck it came closer to mr lavender circled his legs drubbed itself against blinks chest while its tapered tail barred with silver brushed her mouth  this is extraordinary they heard mr lavender say i would stroke it if i wasnt so stiff how nice of you little mooncat to be friendly to my playgirl for what is there in all the world so pleasant to see as friendliness between a dog and cat  at those words the old lady who was a great lover of animals was so affected that she pinched the young lady by mistake  not yet whispered the latter in some agony listen  mooncat mr lavender was saying arcadia is in your golden eyes you have come no doubt to show us how far we have strayed away from it and too stiff to reach the cat by bending mr lavender let himself slowly down till he could sit pan is dead he said as he arrived on the grass and crossed his feet and christ is not alive mooncat  the little cat had put its head into his hand while blink was thrusting her nose into his mouth  im going to sneeze whispered the old lady strangely affected  pull your upper lip down hard like the german empress and count nine murmured the young  while the old lady was doing this mr lavender had again begun to speak  life is now nothing but explosions gentleness has vanished and beauty is a dream when you have your kittens mooncat bring them up in amity to love milk dogs and the sun  the mooncat who had now reached his shoulder brushed the tip of her tail across his loose right eyebrow while blinks jealous tongue avidly licked his high left cheekbone with one hand mr lavender was cuddling the cats head with the other twiddling blinks forelock and the watchers could see his eyes shining and his white hair standing up all ruffled  isnt it sweet murmured the old lady  ah mooncat went on mr lavender come and live with us you shall have your kittens in the bathroom and forget this age of blood and iron  both the old lady and the young were removing moisture from their eyes when the voice of mr lavender very changed recalled them to their vigil his face had become strained and troubled  never he was saying will we admit that doctrine of our common enemies might is not right gentlemen those who take the sword shall perish by the sword with blood and iron we will ourselves stamp out this noxious breed no stone shall be left standing and no babe sleeping in that abandoned country we will restore the tide of humanity if we have to wade through rivers of blood across mountains of iron  whom is he calling gentlemen whispered the old lady  but blink by anxiously licking mr lavenders lips had produced a silence in which the younglady did not dare reply the sound of the little cats purring broke the hush  down blink down said mr lavender  watch this little mooncat and her perfect manners we may all learn from her how not to be crude see the light shining through her pretty ears  the little cat who had seen a bird had left mr lavenders shoulder and was now crouching and moving the tip of its tail from side to side  she would like a bird inside her but let us rather go and find her some milk instead said mr lavender and he began to rise  do you know i think hes quite sane whispered the old lady except perhaps at intervals what do you  glorious print cried mr lavender suddenly for a journal had fallen from his pocket and the sight of it lying there out of his reach excited him glorious print i can read you even from here when the enemy of mankind uses the word god he commits blasphemy how different from us and raising his eyes from the journal mr lavender fastened them as it seemed to his anxious listeners on the tree which sheltered them yes those unseen presences who search out the workings of our heart know that even the most jingo among us can say i am not as they are come mooncat  so murmuring he turned and moved towards the house clucking with his tongue and followed by blink  did he mean us said the old lady nervously  no that was one of his intervals hes not mad hes just crazy  is there any difference my dear  why were all crazy about something you know its only a question of what  but what is his what  hes got a message theyre in the air you know  i havent come across them said the old lady i fear i live a very quiet lifeexcept for picking over sphagnum moss  oh well theres no hurry  well i shall tell my nephew what ive seen said the old lady goodbye  goodbye responded the young and picking up her yellow book she got back into the hammock and relighted her cigarette     vii  sees and editor and finds a farmer  not for some days after his fall from the window did mr lavender begin to regain the elasticity of body necessary to the resumption of public life he spent the hours profitably however in digesting the newspapers and storing ardour on tuesday morning remembering that no proof of his interview had yet been sent him and feeling that he ought not to neglect so important a matter he set forth to the office of the great journal from which in the occult fashion of the faithful he was convinced the reporter had come while he was asking for the editor in the stony entrance a young man who was passing looked at him attentively and said ah sir here you are hes waiting for you come up will you  mr lavender followed up some stairs greatly gratified at the thought that he was expected the young man led him through one or two swing doors into an outer office where a young woman was typing  mr lavender shook his head and sat down on the edge of a green leather chair the editor resuming his seat crossed his legs deferentially and sinking his chin again on his chest began  about your article my only trouble of course is that im running that stunt on british prisonersgreat success youve seen it i suppose  yes indeed said mr lavender i read you every day  the editor made a little movement which showed that he was flattered and sinking his chin still further into his chest resumed  it might run another week or it might fall down tomorrowyou never can tell but im getting lots of letters tremendous public interest  yes yes assented mr lavender its most important  of course we might run yours with it said the editor but i dont know i think itd kill the other still  i shouldnt like began mr lavender  i dont believe in giving them more than they want you know resumed the editor i think ill have my news editor in and he blew into a tube send me mr crackamup this thing of yours is very important sir suppose we began to run it on thursday yes i should think theyll be tired of british prisoners by then  dont let me began mr lavender  the editors eye became unveiled for the moment youll be wanting to take it somewhere else if wequite well i think we could run them together see here mr crackamupmr lavender saw a small man like beethoven frowning from behind spectaclescould we run this german prisoner stunt alongside the british or dyou think it would kill it  mr lavender almost rose from his chair in surprise are you he said is it  the small man hiccoughed and said in a raw voice  the letters are falling off  ah murmured the editor i thought we should be through by thursday well start this new stunt thursday give it all prominence crackamup itll focus fury all to the goodall to the good opinions ripe then for a moment he seemed to hesitate and his chin sank back on his chest i dont know he murmured of course it may  please began mr lavender rising while the small man hiccoughed again the two motions seemed to determine the editor  thats all right sir he said rising also thats quite all right well say thursday and risk it thursday crackamup and he held out his hand to mr lavender good morning sir good morning delighted to have seen you you wouldnt put your name to it well well it doesnt matter only you could have written it the turn of phraseimmense theyll tumble all right and mr lavender found himself with mr crackamup in the lobby its bewildering he thought how quickly he settled that and yet he had such repose but is there some mistake he was about to ask his companion but with a distant hiccough the small man had vanished thus deserted mr lavender was in two minds whether to ask to be readmitted when the four gentlemen with notebooks repassed him in single file into the editors room  my name is lavender he said resolutely to the young woman is that all right  quite she answered without looking up  mr lavender went out slowly thinking i may perhaps have said more in that interview than i remember next time i really will insist on having a proof or have they taken me for some other public man this notion was so disagreeable however that he dismissed it and passed into the street  on thursday the day fixed for his fresh tour of public speaking he opened the great journal eagerly above the third column was the headline our vital duty by a great public man that must be it he thought the article which occupied just a column of precious space began with an appeal so moving that before he had read twenty lines mr lavender had identified himself completely with the writer and if anyone had told him that he had not uttered these sentiments he would have given him the lie direct working from heat to heat the article finished in a glorious outburst with a passionate appeal to the country to starve all german prisoners  mr lavender put it down in a glow of exultation i shall translate words into action he thought i shall at once visit a rural district where german prisoners are working on the land and see that the farmers do their duty and forgetting in his excitement to eat his breakfast he put the journal in his pocket wrapped himself in his dustcoat and broadbrimmed hat and went out to his car which was drawn up with blink who had not forgotten her last experience inside  we will go to a rural district joe he said getting in  very good sir answered joe and unnoticed by the population they glided into the hazy heat of the june morning  well what abaht it sir said joe after they had proceeded for some three hours here we are  mr lavender who had been lost in the beauty of the scenes through which he was passing awoke from reverie and said  i am looking for german prisoners joe if you see a farmer you might stop  any sort of farmer asked joe  is there more than one sort returned mr lavender smiling  joe cocked his eye aint you never lived in the country sir  not for more than a few weeks at a time joe unless rochester counts of course i know eastbourne very well  i know eastbourne from the inside said joe discursively i was a waiter there once  an interesting life a waiters joe i should think  ah everything comes to im who waits they say but abaht farmersyouve got a lot to learn sir  i am always conscious of that joe the ramifications of public life are innumerable  i could give you some rummikins abaht farmers i once travelled in breeches  you seem to have done a great many things joe  thats right sir ive been a sailor a traveller a waiter a sceneshifter and a shover and i dont know which was the cushiest job but talking of farmers theres the old english type that wears bedfordsdont you go near im e bites theres the modern scientific farmer but itll take us a week to find im and theres the smallolder wearin trahsers likely as not i dont think ed be any use to you  what am i to do then asked mr lavender  ah said joe ave lunch  mr lavender sighed his hunger quarelling with his sense of duty i should like to have found a farmer first he said  well sir ill drive up to that clump obeeches and you can have a look round for one while i get lunch ready  that will do admirably  theres just one thing sir said joe when his master was about to start dont you take any house you come across for a farm theyre mostly cottages o gentility nowadays inabited by lunatics  i shall be very careful said mr lavender  this glorious land he thought walking away from the beech clump with blink at his heels how wonderful to see it being restored to its former fertility under pressure of the war the farmer must be a happy man indeed working so nobly for his country without thought of his own prosperity how flowery those beans look already he mused glancing at a field of potatoes now that i am here i shall be able to combine my work on german prisoners with an effort to stimulate food production blink for blink was lingering in a gateway moving back to her mr lavender saw that the sagacious animal was staring through the gate at a farmer who was standing in a field perfectly still with his back turned about thirty yards away  have you mr lavender began eagerly is itare you employing any german prisoners sir  the farmer did not seem to hear he must thought mr lavender be of the old stolid english variety  the farmer who was indeed attired in a bowler hat and bedford cords continued to gaze over his land unconscious of mr lavenders presence  i am asking you a question sir resumed the latter in a louder voice and however patriotically absorbed you may be in cultivating your soil there is no necessity for rudeness  the farmer did not move a muscle  sir began mr lavender again very patiently though i have always heard that the british farmer is of all men least amenable to influence and new ideas i have never believed it and i am persuaded that if you will but listen i shall be able to alter your whole outlook about the agricultural future of this country for it had suddenly occurred to him that it might be a long time before he had again such an opportunity of addressing a rural audience on the growth of food and he was loth to throw away the chance the farmer however continued to stand with his hack to the speaker paying no more heed to his voice than to the buzzing of a fly  you shall hear me cried mr lavender unconsciously miming a voice from the past and catching as he thought the sound of a titter he flung his hand out and exclaimed  grass gentlemen grass is the hub of the matter we have put our hand to the ploughand his imagination taking flight at those words he went on in a voice calculated to reach the great assembly of farmers which he now saw before him with their backs turnedand never shall we take it away till we have reduced every acre in the country to an arable condition in the future not only must we feed ourselves but our dogs our horses and our children and restore the land to its pristine glory in the front rank of the worlds premier industry but me no buts he went on with a winning smile remembering that geniality is essential in addressing a country audience and butter me no butter for in future we shall require to grow our margarine as well let us in a word put behind us all prejudice and pusillanimity till we see this country of ours once more blooming like one great cornfield covered with cows sirs i am no iconoclast let us do all this without departing in any way from those great principles of free trade industrialism and individual liberty which have made our towns the largest most crowded and wealthiest under that sun which never sets over the british empire we do but need to see this great problem steadily and to see it whole and we shall achieve this revolution in our national life without the sacrifice of a single principle or a single penny believe me gentlemen we shall yet eat our cake and have it  mr lavender paused for breath the headlines of his great speech in tomorrows paper dancing before his eyes the climactericeats cake and has ita great conclusion the wind which had risen somewhat during mr lavenders speech fluttered the farmers garments at this moment so that they emitted a sound like the stir which runs through an audience at a moment of strong emotion  ah cried mr lavender i see that i move you gentlemen those have traduced you who call you unimpressionable after all are you not the backbone of this country up which runs the marrow which feeds the brain and shall you not respond to an appeal at once so simple and so fundamental i assure you gentlemen it needs no thought indeed the less you think about it the better for to do so will but weaken your purpose and distract your attention your duty is to go forward with stout hearts firm steps and kindling eyes in this way alone shall we defeat our common enemies and at those words which he had uttered at the top of his voice mr lavender stood like a clock which has run down rubbing his eyes for blink roaming the field during the speech and encountering quadruped called rabbit which she had never seen before had backed away from it in dismay brushed against the farmers legs and caused his breeches to fall down revealing the sticks on which they had been draped when mr lavender saw this he called out in a loud voice sir you have deceived me i took you for a human being i now perceive that you are but a selfish automaton rooted to your own business without a particle of patriotic sense farewell     viii  starves some germans  after parting with the scarecrow mr lavender who felt uncommonly hungry was about to despair of finding any german prisoners when he saw before him a gravelpit and three men working therein clad in dungaree and very dusty they had a cast of countenance so unmistakably teutonic that mr lavender stood still they paid little or no attention to him however but went on sadly and silently with their work which was that of sifting gravel mr lavender sat down on a milestone opposite and his heart contracted within him they look very thin and sad he thought i should not like to be a prisoner myself far from my country in the midst of a hostile population without a woman or a dog to throw me a wag of the tail poor men for though it is necessary to hate the germans it seems impossible to forget that we are all human beings this is weakness he added to himself which no editor would tolerate for a moment i must fight against it if i am to fulfil my duty of rousing the population to the task of starving them how hungry they look alreadytheir checks are hollow i must be firm perhaps they have wives and families at home thinking of them at this moment but after all they are huns what did the great writer say vermincreatures no more worthy of pity than the tiger or the rat how true and yetblink for his dog seated on her haunches was looking at him with that peculiarly steady gaze which betokened in her the desire for food yes mused mr lavender pity is the mark of the weak man it is a vice which was at one time rampant in this country the war has made one beneficial change at leastwe are moving more and more towards the manly and unforgiving vigour of the tiger and the rat to be brutal this is the one lesson that the germans can teach us for we had almost forgotten the art what danger we were in thank god we have past masters again among us now a frown became fixed between his brows yes indeed past masters how i venerate those good journalists and all the great crowd of witnesses who have dominated the mortal weakness pity the hun must and shall be destroyedroot and branchhip and thighbag and baggage man woman and babethis is the sole duty of the great and humane british people roll up ladies and gentlemen roll up great thoughtgreat language and yet  here mr lavender broke into a gentle sweat while the germans went on sifting gravel in front of him and blink continued to look up into his face with her fixed lustrous eyes what an awful thing he thought to be a man if only i were just a public man and could as they do leave out the human and individual side of everything how simple it would be it is the being a man as well which is so troublesome a man has feelings it is wrongwrong there should be no connection whatever between public duty and the feelings of a man one ought to be able to starve ones enemy without a quiver to watch him drown without a wink in fact one ought to be a german we ought all to be germans blink we ought all to be germans dear i must steel myself and mr lavender wiped his forehead for though a great idea had come to him he still lacked the heroic savagery to put it into execution it is my duty he thought to cause those hungry sadlooking men to follow me and watch me eat my lunch it is my duty god give me strength for unless i make this sacrifice of my gentler nature i shall be unworthy to call myself a public man or to be reported in the newspapers en avant de bracy so musing he rose and blink with him crossing the road he clenched his fists and said in a voice which anguish made somewhat shrill  are you hungry my friends  the germans stopped sifting gravel looked up at him and one of them nodded  and thirsty  this time they all three nodded  come on then said mr lavender  and he led the way back along the road followed by blink and the three germans arriving at the beech clump whose great trees were already throwing shadows denoting that it was long past noon mr lavender saw that joe had spread food on the smooth ground and was indeed just finishing his own repast  what is there to eat thought mr lavender with a soft of horror for i feel as if i were about to devour a meal of human flesh and he looked round at the three germans slouching up shamefacedly behind him  sit down please he said the three men sat down  joe said mr lavender to his surprised chauffeur serve my lunch give me a large helping and a glass of ale and paler than his holland dustcoat he sat resolutely down on the bole of a beech with blink on her haunches beside him while joe was filling a plate with pigeonpie and pouring out a glass of foaming bass mr lavender stared at the three germans and suffered the tortures of the damned i will not flinch he thought god helping me i certainly will not flinch nothing shall prevent my going through with it and his eyes more prominent than a hunted rabbits watched the approach of joe with the plate and glass the three men also followed the movements of the chauffeur and it seemed to mr lavender that their eyes were watering courage he murmured to himself transfixing a succulent morsel with his fork and conveying it to his lips for fully a minute he revolved the tasty mouthful which he could not swallow while the three mens eyes watched him with a sort of lugubrious surprise if he thought with anguish if i were a prisoner in germany come come one effort its only the first mouthful and with a superhuman effort he swallowed look at me he cried to the three germans look at me iiim going to be sick and putting down his plate he rose and staggered forward joe he said in a dying voice feed these poor men feed them make them drink feed them and rushing headlong to the edge of the grove he returned what he had swallowedto the great interest of brink then waving away the approach of joe and consumed with shame and remorse at his lack of heroism he ran and hid himself in a clump of hazel bushes trying to slink into the earth no he thought no i am not for public life i have failed at the first test was ever so squeamish an exhibition i have betrayed my country and the honour of public life these germans are now full of beer and pigeonpie what am i but a poltroon unworthy to lace the shoes of the great leaders of my land the sun has witnessed my disgrace  how long he stayed there lying on his face he did not know before he heard the voice of joe saying wot oh sir  joe replied mr lavender faintly my body is here but my spirit has departed  ah said joe a rum upsetthat there swig this down sir and he held out to his master a flaskcup filled with brandy mr lavender swallowed it  have they gone he said gasping  they ave sir replied joe and not alf full neither where did you pick em up  in a gravelpit said mr lavender i can never forgive myself for this betrayal of my king and country i have fed three germans leave me for i am not fit to mingle with my fellows  well i dont think said joe germans  gazing up into his face mr lavender read the unmistakable signs of uncontrolled surprise  why do you look at me like that he said  germans repeated joe what germans three blighters workin on the road as english as you or me wot are you talkin about sir  what cried mr lavender do you tell me they were not germans  well their names was tompkins obson and brown and they adnt an aitch in their eads  god be praised said mr lavender i am then still an english gentleman joe i am very hungry is there nothing left  nothin whatever sir replied joe  then take me home said mr lavender i care not for my spirit has come back to me  so saying he rose and supported by joe made his way towards the car praising god in his heart that he had not disgraced his country     ix  converses with a conscientious objector  yes said mr lavender when they had proceeded some twenty miles along the road for home my hunger is excessive if we come across an hotel joe pull up  righto sir returned joe otels aint what they were but well find something ive got your coupons  mr lavender who was seated beside his chauffeur on the drivingseat while blink occupied in solitude the body of the car was silent for a minute revolving a philosophic thought  do you find he said suddenly that compulsory sacrifice is doing you good joe  its good for my thirst sir replied joe never was so powerful thirsty in me life as ive been since they watered beer theres just enough in it to tickle you that bottle o bass you would ave ad at lunch is the last of the old stock at ome sir an the sight of it fair gave me the wind up to think those blighters ad it wish id known they was germansi wouldnt ave weakened on it  do not i beg said mr lavender remind me of that episode i sometimes think he went on as dreamily as his hunger would permit that being forced to deprive oneself awakens ones worst passions that is of course speaking rather as a man than a public man what do you think will happen joe when we are no longer obliged to sacrifice ourselves  do wot weve been doin all alongsacrifice someone else said joe lightly  be serious joe said mr lavender  well returned joe i dont know whatll appen to you sir but i shall go on the bust permanent  mr lavender sighed i do so wonder whether i shall too he said  joe looked round at him and a gleam of compassion twinkled in his greenish eyes dont you worry sir he said its a question of constitootion a weekd sew you up  a week said mr lavender with watering lips i trust i may not forget myself so long as that public men do not go on the bust joe as you put it  be careful sir i cant drive with one eye  how can they indeed went on mr lavender they are like athletes ever in training for their unending conflict with the national life  well answered joe indulgently they as their own kind of intoxication toothats true and the fumes is permanent theyre gassed all the time and chloroformed the rest  i dont know to what you allude joe said mr lavender severely  avent you never noticed sir that theres two worldsthe world as it is and the world as it seems to the public man  that may be said mr lavender with some excitement but which is the greater which is the nobler joe and what does the other matter surely that which flourishes in great minds and by their utterances is made plain is it not better to live in a world where nobody shrinks from being starved or killed so long as they can die for their kings and countries rather than in a world where people merely wish to live  ah said joe were all ready to die for our countries if weve got to but we dont look on it like the public speakers as a picnic theyre a bit too lightearted  joe said mr lavender covering his ears and instantly uncovering them again this is the most horrible blasphemy i have ever listened to  i can do better than that sir answered joe shall i get on with it  yes said mr lavender clenching his hands a public man shrinks from nothingnot even from the gibes of his enemies  well wot abaht it sir look at the things they say and at what really is mind you im not speakin particular of the public men in this countryor any other country im speakin of the lot of em in every country theyre a sort of secret society brought up on gas and every now and then someone sets a match to it and we get it in the neck look ere sir dahn squats one on his backside an writes something in igh words up pops another and says something in igher an so they go on poppin up an squattin dahn till you get an atmosphere where you cant breathe and all the time all we want is to be let alone and uman kindness do the rest all these fellers ave got two weaknessesones ideas and the others their own importance theyve got to be conspicuous and without ideas they cant so its a vicious circle when i see a man bein conspicuous i says to meself gawd elp us we shall want it and sooner or later we always do ill tell you whats the curse of the world sir its the gift of expressin what aint your real feeling andlord what a lot of us ave got it  joe said mr lavender whose eyes were almost starting from his head your words are the knell of poetry philosophy and proseespecially of prose they are the grave of history which as you know is made up of the wars and intrigues which have originated in the brains of public men if your sordid views were true how do you suppose for one minute that in this great epic struggle we could be consoled by the thought that we are making history has there been a single utterance of any note which has not poured the balm of those words into our ears think how they have sustained the widow and the orphan and the wounded lying out in agony under the stars to make history to act out the great dramathat thought ever kept before us has been our comfort and their stay and you would take it from us shameshame repeated mr lavender you would destroy all glamour and be the death of every principle  give me facts said joe stubbornly an you may ave my principles as to the other thing i dont know what it is but you may ave it too and eres another thing sir havent you never noticed that when a public man blows off and says something it does im in no matter what appens afterwards hes got to stick to it or look a fool  i certainly have not said mr lavender i have never or very seldom noticed that narrowness in public men nor have i ever seen them looking fools as you rudely put it  where are your eyes sir answered joe where are your eyes i give you my word its one or the other though i admit theyve brought camouflage to an igh art but speaking soberly sir if thats possible public men are a good thing and you can ave too much of it but you began it sir he added soothingly and eres your hotel youll feel better with something inside you  so saying he brought the car to a standstill before a sign which bore the words royal goat  mr lavender deep sunk in the whirlpool of feeling which had been stirred in him by his chauffeurs cynicism gazed at the square redbrick building with bewildered eyes  its quite o k said joe i used to call here regular when i was travellin in breeches where the commercials are gathered together the tap is good he added laying a finger against the side of his nose and theyve a fine brand of pickles heres your coupon  thus encouraged mr lavender descended from the car and accompanied by blink entered the hotel and sought the coffeeroom  a maid of robust and comely appearance with a fine free eye divested him of his overcoat and the coupon and pointed to a table and a pale and intellectuallooking young man in spectacles who was eating  have you any more beef said the latter without looking up  no sir replied the maid  then bring me the ham and eggs he added  heres another couponand anything else youve got  mr lavender whose pangs had leaped in him at the word beef gazed at the bare bone of the beefjoint and sighed  i too will have some ham and a couple of poached eggs he said  you can have ham sir replied the maid but there are only eggs enough for one  and i am the one said the young man looking up for the first time  mr lavender at once conceived an aversion from him his appearance was unhealthy and his eyes ravened from behind the spectacles beneath his high forehead  i have no wish to deprive you of your eggs sir he said though i have had nothing to eat all day  i have had nothing to eat to speak of for six months replied the young man and in a fortnights time i shall have nothing to eat again for two years  mr lavender who habitually spoke the truth looked at him with a sort of horror but the young man had again concentrated his attention on his plate how deceptive are appearances thought mr lavender one would say an intellectual not to say a spiritual type and yet he eats like a savage and lies like a trooper and the pinchings of his hunger again attacking him he said rather acidly  may i ask you sir whether you consider it amusing to tell such untruths to a stranger  the young man who had finished what was on his plate paused and with a faint smile said  i spoke figuratively you sir i expect have never been in prison  at the word prison mr lavenders natural kindliness reasserted itself at once forgive me he said gently please eat all the ham i can easily do with bread and cheese i am extremely sorry you have had that misfortune and would on no account do anything which might encourage you to incur it again if it is a question of money or anything of that sort he went on timidly please command me i abhor prisons i consider them inhuman people should only be confined upon their honours  the young mans eyes kindled behind his spectacles  i have been confined he said not upon my honour but because of my honour to break it in  how is that cried mr lavender aghast to break it in  yes said the young man cutting a large slice of bread theres no other way of putting it with truth they want me to go back on my word to go back on my faith and i wont in a fortnights time theyll gaol me again so i must eatexcuse me i shall want all my strength and he filled his mouth too full to go on speaking  mr lavender stared at him greatly perturbed  how unjustly i judged him he thought and seeing that the maid had placed the end of a ham before him he began carving off what little there was left on it and filling a plate placed it before the young man the latter thanked him and without looking up ate rapidly on mr lavender watched him with beaming eyes its lovely to see him he thought poor fellow  where are the eggs said the young man suddenly  mr lavender got up and rang the bell  please bring those eggs for him he said  yes sir said the maid and what are you going to have theres nothing in the house now  oh said mr lavender startled a cup of coffee and a slice of bread thank you i can always eat at any time  the maid went away muttering to herself and bringing the eggs plumped them down before the young man who ate them more hastily than words could tell  i mean he said to do all i can in this fortnight to build up my strength i shall eat almost continuously they shall never break me and reaching out he took the remainder of the loaf  mr lavender watched it disappear with a certain irritation which he subdued at once how selfish of me he thought even to think of eating while this young hero is still hungry  are you then he said the victim of some religious or political plot  both replied the young man leaning back with a sigh of repletion and wiping his mouth i was released today and as i said i shall be courtmartialled again today fortnight itll be two years this time but they cant break me  mr lavender gasped for at the word courtmartialled a dreadful doubt had assailed him  are you he stammeredyou are notyou cannot be a conscientious objector  i can said the young man  mr lavender half rose in horror  i dont approve he ejaculated i do not approve of you  of course not said the young man with a little smile at once proud and sad who does if you did i shouldnt have to eat like this nor should i have the consciousness of spiritual loneliness to sustain me you look on me as a moral outcast as a leper that is my comfort and my strength for though i have a genuine abhorrence of war i know full well that i could not stick this if it were not for the feeling that i must not and will not lower myself to the level of mere opportunists like you and sink myself in the herd of men in the street  at hearing himself thus described mr lavender flushed  i yield to no one he said in my admiration of principle it is because of my principles that i regard you as a  shirker put in the young man calmly go on dont mince words were used to them  yes said mr lavender kindling a shirker excuse me a renegade from the camp of liberty a deserter from the ranks of humanity if you will pardon me  say a christian and have done with it said the young man  no said mr lavender who had risen to his feet i will not go so far as that you are not a christian you are a pharisee i abhor you  and i abhor you said the young man suddenly i am a christian socialist but i refuse to consider you my brother and i can tell you this some day when through our struggle the triumph of christian socialism and of peace is assured we shall see that you firebrands and jingoes get no chance to put up your noxious heads and disturb the brotherhood of the world we shall stamp you out we shall do you in we who believe in love will take jolly good care that you apostles of hate get all weve had and moreif you provoke us enough that is  he stopped for mr lavenders figure had rigidified on the other side of the table into the semblance of one who is about to address the house of lords  i can find here he cried no analogy with religious persecution this is a simple matter the burden of defending his country falls equally on every citizen i know not and i care not what promises were made to you or in what spirit the laws of compulsory service were passed you will either serve or go to prison till you do i am a plain englishman expressing the view of my plain countrymen  the young man tilting back in his chair rapped on the table with the handle of his dinnerknife  hear hear he murmured  and let me tell you this continued mr lavender you have no right to put a mouthful of food between your lips so long as you are not prepared to die for it and if the huns came here tomorrow i would not lift a finger to save you from the fate you would undoubtedly receive  during this colloquy their voices had grown so loud that the maid entering in dismay had gone into the bar and informed the company that a conscientious objector had eaten all the food and was carrying on outrageous in the coffeeroom on hearing this report those who were assembledbeing four commercial travellers far gone in liquortaking up the weapons which came nearest to handto wit four syphonsformed themselves two deep and marched into the coffeeroom aware at once from mr lavenders white hair and words that he was not the objector in question they advanced upon the young man who was still seated and taking up the four points of the compass began squirting him unmercifully with sodawater blinded and dripping the unfortunate young fellow tried desperately to elude the cordon of his persecutors only to receive a fresh stream in his face at each attempt seeing him thus tormented amid the coarse laughter of these halfdrunken travellers mr lavender suffered a moment of the most poignant struggle between his principles and his chivalry then almost unconsciously grasping the hambone he advanced and called out loudly  stop do not persecute that young man you are four and he is one drop it i tell youhuns that you are  the commercial fellows however laughed and this infuriating mr lavender he dealt one of them a blow with the hambone which lighting on the funny point of his elbow caused him to howl and spin round the room one of the others promptly avenged him with a squirt of syphon in mr lavenders left eye whereon he incontinently attacked them all whirling the hambone round his head like a shillelagh and had it not been that blink and the maid seized his coattails he would have done them severe injury it was at this moment that joe petty attracted by the hullabaloo arrived in the doorway and running up to his master lifted him from behind and carried him from the room still brandishing the hambone and kicking out with his legs dumping him into the car joe mounted hastily and drove off mr lavender sat for two or three minutes coming to his senses before full realization of what he had done dawned on him then flinging the hambone from him he sank back among the cushions with his chin buried on his chest what have i done he thought over and over again what have i done taken up the bone for a conscientious objectordefended a renegade against great odds my god i am indeed less than a public man  and in this state of utter dejection inanition and collapse with blink asleep on his feet he was driven back to hampstead     x  dreams a dream and sees a vision  though habitually abstemious mr lavender was so very hungry that evening when he sat down to supper that he was unable to leave the lobster which mrs petty had provided until it was reduced to mere integument since his principles prevented his lightening it with anything but gingerbeer he went to bed in some discomfort and tired out with the emotions of the day soon fell into a heavy slumber which at dawn became troubled by a dream of an extremely vivid character he fancied himself indeed dressed in khaki with a breastplate composed of newspapers containing reports of speeches which he had been charged to deliver to soldiers at the front he was passing in a winged tank along those scenes of desolation of which he had so often read in his daily papers and which his swollen fancy now coloured even more vividly than had those striking phrases of the past when presently the tank turned a somersault and shot him out into a morass lighted up by countless starshells whizzing round and above in this morass were hundreds and thousands of figures sunk like himself up to the waist and waving their arms above their heads these thought mr lavender must be the soldiers i have come to speak to and he tore a sheet off his breastplate but before he could speak from its columns it became thin air in his hand and he went on tearing off sheet after sheet hoping to find a speech which would stay solid long enough for him to deliver it at last a little corner stayed substantial in his hand and he called out in a loud voice heroes  but at the word the figures vanished with a wail sinking into the mud which was left covered with bubbles iridescent in the light of the starshells at this moment one of these bursting over his head turned into a large bright moon and mr lavender saw to his amazement that the bubbles were really butterflies perched on the liquid moonlit mud fluttering their crimson wings and peering up at him with tiny human faces who are you he cried oh who are you the butterflies closed their wings and on each of their little faces came a look so sad and questioning that mr lavenders tears rolled down into his breastplate of speeches a whisper rose from them we are the dead and they flew up suddenly in swarms and beat his face with their wings  mr lavender woke up sitting in the middle of the floor with light shining in on him through a hole in the curtain and blink licking off the tears which were streaming down his face  blink he said i have had a horrible dream and still conscious of that weight on his chest as of many undelivered speeches he was afraid to go back to bed so putting on some clothes he went carefully downstairs and out of doors into the morning he walked with his dog towards the risen sun alone in the silvery light of hampstead meditating deeply on his dream i have evidently he thought not yet acquired that felicitous insensibility which is needful for successful public speaking this is undoubtedly the secret of my dream for the subconscious knowledge of my deficiency explains the weight on my chest and the futile tearing of sheet after sheet which vanished as i tore them away i lack the selfcomplacency necessary to the orator in any surroundings and that golden certainty which has enchanted me in the outpourings of great men whether in ink or speech this is however a matter which i can rectify with practice and coming to a little maytree in full blossom he thus addressed it  little tree be my audience for i see in you tipped with the sunlight a vision of the tranquil and beautiful world which according to every authority will emerge out of this carnival of blood and iron  and the little tree lifted up its voice and answered him with the song of a blackbird  mr lavenders heart deeply responsive to the voice of nature melted within him  what are the realms of this earth the dreams of statesmen and all plots and policies he said compared with the beauty of this little tree sheor is it a hebreathes in her wild and simple dress just to be lovely and loved he harbours the blackbird and shakes fragrance into the morning and with her blossom catches the rain and the sun drops of heaven i see in him the witchery of god and of her prettiness would i make a song of redemption  so saying he knelt down before the little tree while blink on her haunches very quiet beside him looked wiser than many dogs  a familiar gurgling sound roused him from his devotions and turning his head he saw his young neighbour in the garb of a nurse standing on the path behind him she has dropped from heaven he thought for all nurses are angels  and taking off his hat he said  you surprised me at a moment of which i am not ashamed i was communing with beauty and behold aurora is with me  say rather borealis said the young lady i was so fedup with hospital that i had to have a scamper before turning in if youre going home we might go together  it would indeed be a joy said mr lavender the garb of mercy becomes you  do you think so replied the young lady in whose cheeks a lovely flush had not deepened i call it hideous do you always come out and pray to that tree  i am ashamed to say returned mr lavender that i do not but i intend to do so in future since it has brought me such a vision  and he looked with such deferential and shining eyes at his companion that she placed the back of her hand before her mouth and her breast rose  im most fearfully sleepy she said have you had any adventures latelyyou and samjoe  samjoe repeated mr lavender  your chauffeuri call him that hes very like sam weller and sancho panza dont you think don pickwixote  ah said mr lavender bewildered joe you mean a good fellow he has in him the sort of heroism which i admire more than any other  which is that asked the young lady  that imperturbable humour in the face of adverse circumstances for which our soldiers are renowned  you are a great believer in heroics don pickwixote said the young lady  what would life be without them returned mr lavender the war could not go on for a minute  youre right there said the young lady bitterly  you surely said mr lavender aghast cannot wish it to stop until we have destroyed our common enemies  well said the young lady im not a pacifist but when you see as many people without arms and legs as i do heroics get a bit off dont you know and she increased her pace until mr lavender who was not within four inches of her stature was almost compelled to trot if i were a tommy she added i should want to shoot every man who uttered a phrase really at this time of day they are the limit  aurora said mr lavender if you will permit me who am old enoughalasto be your father to call you that you must surely be aware that phrases are the very munitions of war and certainly not less important than mere material explosives take the word liberty for instance would you deprive us of it  the young lady fixed on him those large grey eyes which had in them the roll of genius dear don pickwixote she said i would merely take it from the mouths of those who dont know what it means and how much do you think would be left not enough to butter the parsnips of a borough council or fill one leader in a month of sundays have you not discovered don pickwixote that liberty means the special form of tyranny which one happens to serve under and that our form of tyranny is gas  high heaven cried mr lavender that i should hear such words from so red lips  ive not been a pacifist so far continued the young lady stifling a yawn because i hate cruelty i hate it enough to want to be cruel to it i want the huns to lap their own sauce i dont want to be revengeful but i just cant help it  my dear young lady said mr lavender soothingly you are notyou cannot be revengeful for every great writer and speaker tells us that revengefulness is an emotion alien to the allies who are merely just  rats  at this familiar word blink who had been following their conversation quietly threw up her nose and licked the young ladys hand so unexpectedly that she started and added  darling  mr lavender who took the expression as meant for himself coloured furiously  aurora he said in a faint voice the rapture in my heart prevents my taking advantage of your sweet words forgive me and let us go quietly in with the vision i have seen for i know my place  the young ladys composure seemed to tremble in the balance and her lips twitched then holding out her hand she took mr lavenders and gave it a good squeeze  you really are a dear she said i think you ought to be in bed my names isabel you know  not to me said mr lavender you are the dawn nothing shall persuade me to the contrary and from henceforth i swear to rise with you every morning  oh no cried the young lady please dont imagine that i sniff the matutinal as a rule i just happened to be in a night shift  no matter said mr lavender i shall see you with the eye of faith in your night shifts and draw from the vision strength to continue my public work beckoned by the fingers of the roseate future  well murmured the young lady so long for now and do go back to bed its only about five and waving the tips of those fingers she ran lightly up the gardenpath and disappeared into her house  mr lavender remained for a moment as if transfigured then entering his garden he stood gazing up at her window until the thought that she might appear there was too much for him and he went in     xi  breaks up a peace meeting  while seated at breakfast on the morning after he had seen this vision mr lavender who read his papers as though they had been holy writ came on an announcement that a meeting would be held that evening at a chapel in holloway under the auspices of the free speakers league an association which his journals had often branded with a reputation for desiring peace on reading the names of the speakers mr lavender felt at once that it would be his duty to attend there will he thought very likely be no one there to register a protest for in this country we have pushed the doctrine of free speech to a limit which threatens the noble virtue of patriotism this is no doubt a recrudescence of that terrible horsesense in the british people which used to permit everybody to have his say no matter what he said yet i would rather stay at home he mused for they will do me violence i expect cowardice however would not become me and i must go  he was in a state of flurry all day thinking of his unpleasant duty towards those violent persons and garbishing up his memory by reading such past leaders in his five journals as bore on the subject he spoke no word of his intentions convinced that he ran a considerable risk at the hands of the pacifists but too sensible of his honour to assist anyone to put that spoke in his wheel which he could not help longing for  at six oclock he locked blink into his study and arming himself with three leaders set forth on his perilous adventure seven oclock saw him hurrying along the dismal road to the chapel at whose door he met with an unexpected check  where is your ticket said a large man  i have none replied mr lavender disconcerted for this is a meeting of the free speakers league and it is for that reason that i have come  the large man looked at him attentively no admittance without ticket he said  i protest said mr lavender how can you call yourselves by that name and not let me in  the large man smiled  well he said you havent the strength ofof a rabbitin you go  mr lavender found himself inside and some indignation  the meeting had begun and a tall man at the pulpit end with the face of a sorrowful bull was addressing an audience composed almost entirely of women and old men while his confederates sat behind him trying to look as if they were not present at the end of a row about halfway up the chapel mr lavender composed himself to listen thinking however eager i may be to fulfil my duty and break up this meeting it behoves me as a fairminded man to ascertain first what manner of meeting it is that i am breaking up but as the speaker progressed in periods punctuated by applause from what by his experience at the door mr lavender knew to be a packed audience he grew more and more uneasy it cannot be said that he took in what the speaker was saying obsessed as he was by the necessity of formulating a reply and of revolving to the exclusion of all else the flowers and phrases of the leaders which during the day he had almost learned by heart but by nature polite he waited till the orator was sitting down before he rose and with the three leaders firmly grasped in his hand walked deliberately up to the seated speakers turning his back on them he said in a voice to which nervousness and emotion lent shrillness  ladies and gentlemen it is now your turn in accordance with the tradition of your society to listen to me let us not mince matters with mealy mouths there are in our midst certain viperous persons like that notorious gentleman who had the sulphurous impudence to have a french fatherfrench gentlemen not german ladiesmark the cunning and audacity of the fellow like that renegade labour leader who has never led anything yet if he had his will would lead us all into the pit of destruction like those other highbrow emasculates who mistake their pettifogging pedantry for pearls of price and plaster the plain issue before us with perfidious and pacifistic platitudes we say at once and let them note it we will have none of them we will have here his words were drowned by an interruption greater even than that which was fast gathering among the row of speakers behind him and the surprised audience in front and he could see the large man being forced from the door and up the aisle by a posse of noisy youths till he stood with arms pinioned struggling to turn round just in front of mr lavender seeing his speech thus endangered the latter cried out at the top of his voice free speech gentlemen free speech i have come here expressly to see that we have nothing of the sort at this the young men who now filled the aisle raised a mighty booing  gentlemen shouted mr lavender waving his leaders gentlemen but at this moment the large man was hurled into contact with what served mr lavender for stomach and the two fell in confusion an uproar ensued of which mr lavender was more than vaguely conscious for many feet went over him he managed however to creep into a corner and getting up surveyed the scene the young men who had invaded the meeting much superior in numbers and strength to the speakers to the large man and the three or four other ablebodied persons who had rallied to them from among the audience were taking every advantage of their superiority and it went to mr lavenders heart to see how they thumped and maltreated their opponents the sight of their brutality indeed rendered him so furious that forgetting all his principles and his purpose in coming to the meeting he climbed on to a form and folding his arms tightly on his breast called out at the top of his voice  cads do not thus take advantage of your numbers cads having thus defended what in his calmer moments he would have known to be the wrong he awaited his own fate calmly but in the hubbub his words had passed unnoticed it is in moments like these he thought that the great speaker asserts his supremacy quells the storm and secures himself a hearing and he began to rack his brains to remember how they did it it must require the voice of an ox he thought and the skin of an alligator alas how deficient i am in public qualities but his selfdepreciation was here cut off with the electric light at this sheer intervention of providence mr lavender listening to the disentangling sounds which rose in the black room became aware that he had a chance such as he had not yet had of being heard  stay my friends he said here in darkness we can see better the true proportions of this great question of free speech there are some who contend that in a democracy every opinion should be heard that just because the good sense of the majority will ever lead the country into the right paths the minority should be accorded full and fair expression for they cannot deflect the countrys course and because such expression acts as a healthful safetyvalve moreover they say there is no way of preventing the minority from speaking save that of force which is unworthy of a majority and the negation of what we are fighting for in this war but i say following the great leaderwriters that in a time of national danger nobody ought to say anything except what is in accord with the opinions of the majority for only in this way can we present a front which will seem to be united to our common enemies i say and since i am the majority i must be in the right that no one who disagrees with me must say anything if we are to save the cause of freedom and humanity i deprecate violence but i am thoroughly determined to stand no nonsense and shall not hesitate to suppress by every means in the power of the majorityincluding if need be prussian measuresany whisper from those misguided and unpatriotic persons whose socalled principles induce them to assert their right to have opinions of their own this has ever been a free country and they shall not imperil its freedom by their volubility and selfconceit here mr lavender paused for breath and in the darkness a faint noise as of a mouse scrattling at a wainscot attracted his attention wonderful he thought elated by the silence that i should so have succeeded in riveting their attention as to be able to hear a mouse gnawing i must have made a considerable impression and fearing to spoil it by further speech he set to work to grope his way round the chapel wall in the hope of coming to the door he had gone but a little way when his outstretched hand came into contact with something warm which shrank away with a squeal  oh cried mr lavender while a shiver went down his spine what is that  me said a stifled voice who are you  a public speaker madam answered mr lavender unutterably relieved dont be alarmed  ouch whispered the voice that madman  i assure you madam replied mr lavender striving to regain contact i wouldnt harm you for the world can you tell me in what portion of the hall we are and crouching down he stretched out his arms and felt about him no answer came but he could tell that he was between two rows of chairs and holding to the top of one he began to sidle along crouching so as not to lose touch with the chairs behind him he had not proceeded the length of six chairs in the pitchy darkness when the light was suddenly turned up and he found himself glaring over the backs of the chairs in front into the eyes of a young woman who was crouching and glaring back over the same chairs  dear me said mr lavender as with a certain dignity they both rose to their full height i had no conception  without a word the young woman put her hand up to her back hair sidled swiftly down the row of chairs ran down the aisle and vanished there was no one else in the chapel mr lavender after surveying the considerable wreckage made his way to the door and passed out into the night like a dream he thought but i have done my duty for no meeting was ever more completely broken up with a clear conscience and a good appetite i can how go home     xii  speeds up transport and sees a doctor  greatly cheered by his success at the peace meeting mr lavender searched his papers next morning to find a new field for his activities nor had he to read far before he came on this paragraph     everything is dependent on transport and we cannot sufficiently    urge that this should be speeded up by    every means in our power  how true he thought and finishing his breakfast hastily he went out with blink to think over what he could do to help i can exhort he mused anyone engaged in transport who is not exerting himself to the utmost it will not be pleasant to do so for it will certainly provoke much illfeeling i must not however be deterred by that for it is the daily concomitant of public life and hard words break no bones as they say but rather serve to thicken the skins and sharpen the tongues of us public men so that we are able to meet our opponents with their own weapons i perceive before me indeed a liberal education in just those public qualities wherein i am conscious of being as yet deficient and his heart sank within him thinking of the carts on the hills of hampstead and the boys who drove them what is lacking to them he mused is the power of seeing this problem steadily and seeing it whole let me endeavour to impart this habit to all who have any connection with transport  he had just completed this reflection when turning a corner he came on a large van standing stockstill at the top of an incline the driver was leaning idly against the hind wheel filling a pipe mr lavender glanced at the near horse and seeing that he was not distressed he thus addressed the man  do you not know my friend that every minute is of importance in this national crisis if i could get you to see the question of transport steadily and to see it whole i feel convinced that you would not be standing there lighting your pipe when perhaps this halfhours delay in the delivery of your goods may mean the death of one of your comrades at the front  the man who was wizened weathered and old with but few teeth looked up at him from above the curved hands with which he was coaxing the flame of a match into the bowl of his pipe his brow was wrinkled and moisture stood at the comers of his eyes  i assure you went on mr lavender that we have none of us the right in these days to delay for a single minute the delivery of anythingnot even of speeches when i am tempted to do so i think of our sons and brothers in the trenches and how every shell and every word saves their lives and i deliver  the old man who had finished lighting his pipe took a long pull at it and said hoarsely  go on  i will said mr lavender for i perceive that i can effect a revolution in your outlook so that instead of wasting the countrys time by leaning against that wheel you will drive on zealously and help to win the war  the old man looked at him and one side of his face became drawn up in a smile which seemed to mr lavender so horrible that he said why do you look at me like that  cawnt elp it said the man  what makes you continued mr lavender pause here with your job half finished it is not the hill which keeps you back for you are at the top and your horses seem rested  yes said the old man with another contortion of his face theyre restedleastways one of em  then what delays youif not that british sluggishness which we in public life find such a terrible handicap to our efforts in conducting the war  ah said the old man but out of one you dont make two guvnor git on the offside and youll see it a bit steadier and a bit oler than you ave itherto  struck by his words which were accompanied by a painful puckering of the checks mr lavender moved round the van looking for some defect in its machinery and suddenly became aware that the off horse was lying on the ground with the traces cut it lay on its side and did not move  oh cried mr lavender oh and going up to the horses head he knelt down the animals eye was glazing  oh he cried again poor horse dont die and tears dropped out of his eyes on to the horses cheek the eye seemed to give him a look and became quite glazed  dead said mr lavender in an awed whisper this is horrible what a thin horsenothing but bones and his gaze haunted the ridge and furrow of the horses carcase while the living horse looked round and down at its dead fellow from whose hollow face a ragged forelock drooped in the dust  i must go and apologize to that old man said mr lavender aloud for no doubt he is even more distressed than i am  not e guvnor said a voice and looking beside him he saw the aged driver standing beside him not e for of all the crool jobs i ever addrivin that orse these last three months as been the croolest there e lies and es aht of it and thats where theyd all like to be speed done im in savin is countrys time an is countrys oats that done im in a good old orse a willin old orse as broke is eart tryin to do is bit on alf rations there e lies and im glad e does and with the back of his hand the old fellow removed some brown moisture which was trembling on his jaw mr lavender rose from his knees  dreadfulmonstrous he cried poor horse who is responsible for this  why said the old driver the gents as sees it steady and sees it ole from one side o the van same as you  so smitten to the heart was mr lavender by those words that he covered his ears with his hands and almost ran from the scene nor did he stop till he had reached the shelter of his study and was sitting in his armchair with blink upon his feet i will buy a gocart he thought blink and i will pull our weight and save the poor horses we can at least deliver our own milk and vegetables  he had not been sitting there for halfanhour revolving the painful complexities of national life before the voice of mrs petty recalled him from that sad reverie  dr gobang to see you sir  at sight of the doctor who had attended him for alcoholic poisoning mr lavender experienced one or those vaguely disagreeable sensations which follow on halfrealized insults  goodmorning sir said the doctor thought id just look in and make my mind easy about you that was a nasty attack do you still feel your back  no said mr lavender rather coldly while blink growled  nor your head  i have never felt my head replied mr lavender still more coldly  i seem to remember began the doctor  doctor said mr lavender with dignity surely you know that public mendo not feeltheir headsit would not do they sometimes suffer from their throats but otherwise they have perfect health fortunately  the doctor smiled  well what do you think of the war he asked chattily  be quiet blink said mr lavender then in a faraway voice he added whatever the clouds which have gathered above our heads for the moment and whatever the blows which fate may have in store for us we shall not relax our efforts till we have attained our aims and hurled our enemies back nor shall we stop there he went on warming at his own words it is but a weakkneed patriotism which would be content with securing the objects for which we began to fight we shall not hesitate to sacrifice the last of our men the last of our money in the sacred task of achieving the complete ruin of the fiendish power which has brought this great calamity on the world even if our enemies surrender we will fight on till we have dictated terms on the doorsteps of potsdam  the doctor who since mr lavender began to speak had been looking at him with strange intensity dropped his eyes  quite so he said heartily quite so well goodmorning i only just ran in and leaving mr lavender to the exultation he was evidently feeling this singular visitor went out and closed the door outside the gardengate he rejoined the nephew sinkin  well asked the latter  sane as you or me said the doctor a little pedantic in his way of expressing himself but quite all there really  did his dog bite you muttered the nephew no said the doctor absently i wish to heaven everyone held his views so long i must be getting on and they parted  but mr lavender after pacing the room six times had sat down again in his chair with a cold feeling in the pit of his stomach such as other men feel on mornings after a debauch     xiii  addresses some soldiers on their future  on pleasant afternoons mr lavender would often take his seat on one of the benches which adorned the spaniards road to enjoy the beams of the sun and the towers of the city confused in smoky distance and strolling forth with blink on the afternoon of the day on which the doctor had come to see him he sat down to read a periodical which enjoined on everyone the necessity of taking the utmost interest in soldiers disabled by the war yes he thought it is indeed our duty to force them no matter what their disablements to continue and surpass the heroism they displayed out there and become superior to what they once were and it seemed to him a distinct dispensation of providence when the rest of his bench was suddenly occupied by three soldiers in the blue garments and red ties of hospital life they had been sitting there for some minutes divided by the iron bars necessary to the morals of the neighbourhood while mr lavender cudgelled his brains for an easy and natural method of approach before blink supplied the necessary avenue by taking her stand before a soldier and looking up into his eye  lord said the one thus accosted what a fyce look at her moustache well cocky oo are you starin at  my dog said mr lavender perceiving his chance has an eye for the strange and beautiful  wow said the soldier whose face was bandaged shell get it ere wont she  encouraged by the smiles of the soldier and his comrades mr lavender went on in the most natural voice he could assume  im sure you appreciate my friends the enormous importance of your own futures  the three soldiers whose faces were all bandaged looked as surprised as they could between them and did not answer mr lavender went on dropping unconsciously into the diction of the article he had been reading we are now at the turningpoint of the ways and not a moment is to be lost in impressing on the disabled man the paramount necessity of becoming again the captain of his soul he who was a hero in the field must again lead us in those qualities of enterprise and endurance which have made him the admiration of the world  the three soldiers had turned what was visible of their faces towards mr lavender and seeing that he had riveted their attention he proceeded the apathy which hospital produces together with the present scarcity of labour is largely responsible for the dangerous position in which the disabled man now finds himself only we who have not to face his future can appreciate what that future is likely to be if he does not make the most strenuous efforts to overcome it boys he added earnestly remembering suddenly that this was the word which those who had the personal touch ever employed are you making those efforts are you equipping your minds are you taking advantage of your enforced leisure to place yourselves upon some path of life in which you can largely hold your own against all comers  he paused for a reply  the soldiers silent for a moment in what seemed to mr lavender to be sheer astonishment began to fidget then the one next him turned to his neighbour and said  are we alf are we doin what the gentleman says  i can answer that for you returned mr lavender brightly for i can tell by your hospitalized faces that you are living in the present a habit which according to our best writers is peculiar to the british i assure you he went on with a winning look there is no future in that if you do not at once begin to carve fresh niches for yourselves in the temple of industrialism you will be engulfed by the returning flood and left high and dry upon the beach of fortune  during these last few words the half of an irritated look on the faces of the soldiers changed to fragments of an indulgent and protective expression  right you are guvnor said the one in the middle dont you worry well see you home all right  it is you said mr lavender that i must see home for that is largely the duty of us who have not had the great privilege of fighting for our country  these words which completed the soldiers conviction that mr lavender was not quite all there caused them to rise  come on then said one well see each other home weve got to be in by five you dont have a string to your dog i see  oh no said mr lavender puzzled i am not blind  balmy said the soldier soothingly come on sir an we can talk abaht it on the way  mr lavender delighted at the impression he had made rose and walked beside them taking insensibly the direction for home  what do you advise us to do then guvnor said one of the soldiers  throw away all thought of the present returned mr lavender with intense earnestness forget the past entirely wrap yourselves wholly in the future do nothing which will give you immediate satisfaction do not consider your families or any of those transient considerations such as pleasure your homes your condition of health or your economic position but place yourselves unreservedly in the hands of those who by hard thinking on this subject are alone in the condition to appreciate the individual circumstances of each of you for only by becoming a flock of sheep can you be conducted into those new pastures where the grass of your future will be sweet and plentiful above all continue to be the heroes which you were under the spur of your countrys call for you must remember that your country is still calling you  thats right said the soldier on mr lavenders left puss puss does your dog swot cats  at so irrelevant a remark mr lavender looked suspiciously from left to right but what there was of the soldiers faces told him nothing  which is your hospital he asked  down the ill on the right returned the soldier which is yours  alas it is not in a hospital that i  i know said the soldier delicately dont give it a name no need were all friends ere do you get out much  i always take an afternoon stroll said mr lavender when my public life permits if you think your comrades would like me to come and lecture to them on their future i should be only too happy  dyou ear alf said the soldier dyou think they would  the soldier addressed put a finger to the sound side of his mouth and uttered a catcall  i might effect a radical change in their views continued mr lavender a little puzzled let me leave you this periodical read it and you will see how extremely vital all that i have been saying is and then perhaps if you would send me a round robin such as is usual in a democratic country i could pop over almost any day after five i sometimes feeland here mr lavender stopped in the middle of the road overcome by sudden emotionthat i have really no right to be alive when i see what you have suffered for me  thats all right old bean said the soldier on his left youd a done the same for us but for your disabilities we dont grudge it you  boys said mr lavender you are men i cannot tell you how much i admire and love you  well give it a rest then taint good for yer and look ere any time they dont treat you fair in there tip us the wink and well come over and do in your ousekeeper  mr lavender smiled  my poor housekeeper he said i thank you all the same for your charming goodwill this is where i live he added stopping at the gate of the little house smothered in lilac and laburnum can i offer you some tea  the three soldiers looked at each other and mr lavender noticing their surprise attributed it to the word tea  i regret exceedingly that i am a total abstainer he said  the remark completing the soldiers judgment of his case increased their surprise at the nature of his residence it remained unanswered save by a shuffling of the feet  mr lavender took off his hat  i consider it a great privilege he said to have been allowed to converse with you goodbye and god bless you  so saying he opened the gate and entered his little garden carrying his hat in his hand and followed by blink  the soldiers watched him disappear within then continued on their way down the hill in silence  blimy said one suddenly some of these old civilians ave come it balmy on the crumpet since the war began give me the trenches     xiv  endeavours to intern a german  aglow with satisfaction at what he had been able to do for the wounded soldiers mr lavender sat down in his study to drink the tea which he found there there is nothing in life he thought which gives one such satisfaction as friendliness and being able to do something for others mooncat  the mooncat who since mr lavender had given her milk abode in his castle awaiting her confinement purred loudly regarding him with burning eyes as was her fashion when she wanted milk mr lavender put down the saucer and continued his meditations everything is vain the world is full of ghosts and shadows but in friendliness and the purring of a little cat there is solidity  a lady has called sir  looking up mr lavender became aware of mrs petty  how very agreeable  i dont know sir returned his housekeeper in her decisive voice but she wants to see you name of pullbody  pullbody repeated mr lavender dreamily i dont seemask her in mrs petty ask her in  its on your head sir said mrs petty and went out  mr lavender was immediately conscious of a presence in dark green silk with a long upper lip a loose lower lip and a fixed and faintly raddled air moving stealthily towards him  sit down madam i beg will you have some tea  the lady sat down thank you i have had tea it was on the recommendation of your nextdoor neighbour miss isabel scarlet  indeed replied mr lavender whose heart began to beat command me for i am entirely at her service  i have come to see you began the lady with a peculiar sinuous smile as a public man and a patriot  mr lavender bowed and the lady went on i am in very great trouble the fact is my sisters husbands sister is married to a german  is it possible madam murmured mr lavender crossing his knees and joining the tips of his fingers  yes resumed the lady and whats more he is still at large  mr lavender into whose mind there had instantly rushed a flood of public utterances stood gazing at her haggard face in silent sympathy  you may imagine my distress sir and the condition of my conscience pursued the lady when i tell you that my sisters husbands sister is a very old friend of mineand indeed so was this german the two are a very attached young couple and being childless are quite wrapped up in each other i have come to you feeling it my duty to secure his internment  mr lavender moved by the human element in her words was about to say but why madam when the lady continued  i have not myself precisely heard him speak well of his country but the sister of a friend of mine who was having tea in their house distinctly heard him say that there were two sides to every question and that he could not believe all that was said in the english papers  dear me said mr lavender troubled that is serious  yes went on the lady and on another occasion my sisters husband himself heard him remark that a man could not help loving his country and hoping that it would win  but that is natural began mr lavender  what said the lady nearly rising when that country is germany  the word revived mr lavenders sense of proportion  true he said true i was forgetting for the moment it is extraordinary how irresponsible ones thoughts are sometimes have you reason to suppose that he is dangerous  i should have thought that what i have said might have convinced you replied the lady reproachfully but i dont wish you to act without satisfying yourself it is not as if you knew him of course i have easily been able to get up an agitation among his friends but i should not expect an outsiderso i thought if i gave you his address you could form your own opinion  yes murmured mr lavender yes it is in the last degree undesirable that any man of german origin should remain free to work possible harm to our country there is no question in this of hatred or of mere rabid patriotism he went on in a voice growing more and more faraway it is largely the a b c of common prudence  i ought to say interrupted his visitor that we all thought him of course an honourable man until this war or we should not have been his friends he is a dentist she added and i suppose may be said to be doing useful work which makes it difficult i suggest that you go to him to have a tooth out  mr lavender quivered and insensibly felt his teeth  thank you he said i will see if i can find one it is certainly a matter which cannot be left to chance we public men madam often have to do very hard and even inhumane things for no apparent reason our consciences alone support us an impression i am told sometimes gets abroad that we yield to clamour those alone who know us realize how unfounded that aspersion is  this is his address said the lady rising and handing him an envelope i shall not feel at rest until he is safely interned you will not mention my name of course it is tragic to be obliged to work against ones friends in the dark your young neighbour spoke in enthusiastic terms of your zeal and i am sure that in choosing you for my public man she was not pullingerwas not making a mistake  mr lavender bowed  i hope not madam he said humbly i try to do my duty  the lady smiled her sinuous smile and moved towards the door leaving on the air a faint odour of vinegar and sandalwood  when she was gone mr lavender sat down on the edge of his chair before the teatray and extracted his teeth while blink taking them for a bone gazed at them lustrously and the mooncat between his feet purred from repletion there is reason in all things he thought running his finger over what was left in his mouth but not in patriotism for that would prevent us from consummating the destruction of our common enemies it behoves us public men ever to set an extreme example which one can i spare i wonder and he fixed upon a large rambling tooth on the left wing of his lower jaw it will hurt horribly im afraid and if i have an anaesthetic there will be someone else present and not improbably i shall feel ill afterwards and be unable to form a clear judgment i must steel myself blink  for blink was making tremulous advances to the teeth how pleasant to be a dog thought mr lavender and know nothing of germans and teeth i shall be very unhappy till this is out but aurora recommended me and i must not complain but rather consider myself the most fortunate of public men and ruffling his hair till it stood up all over his head while his loose eyebrow worked up and down he gazed at the mooncat  mooncat he said suddenly we are but creatures of chance unable to tell from one day to another what fate has in store for us my tooth is beginning to ache already that is perhaps as it should be for i shall not forget which one it is so musing he resumed his teeth and going to his bookcase sought fortitude and inspiration in the records of a parliamentary debate on enemy aliens  it was not without considerable trepidation however on the following afternoon that he made his way up welkin street and rang at the number on the envelope in his hand  yes sir doctor is at home said the maid  mr lavenders heart was about to fail him when conjuring up the vision of aurora he said in a faint voice i wish to see him professionally and while the maid departed up the stairs he waited in the narrow hall alternately taking his hat off and putting it on again so great was his spiritual confusion  doctor will see you at once sir  putting his hat on hastily mr lavender followed her upstairs feeling at his tooth to make quite sure that he remembered which it was his courage mounted as he came nearer to his fate and he marched into the room behind the maid holding his hat on firmly with one hand and his tooth in firmly with the other there beside a red velvet dentists chair he saw a youngish man dressed in a white coat with round eyes and a domestic face who said in good english  what can i do for you my dear sir i fear you are in bain  in great pain replied mr lavender faintly in great pain and indeed he was for the nervous crisis from which he was suffering had settled in the tooth on which he still pressed a finger through his cheek  sit down sir sit down said the young man and perhaps it would be better if you should remove your hat we shall not hurd youno no we shall not hurd you  at those words which seemed to cast doubt on his courage mr lavender recovered all his presence of mind he took off his hat advanced resolutely to the chair sat down in it and looking up said  do to me what you will i shall not flinch nor depart in any way from the behaviour of those whose duty it is to set an example to others  so saying he removed his teeth and placing them in a bowl on the little swinging table which he perceived on his left hand he closed his eyes put his finger in his mouth and articulated  ith one  excuse me sir said the young german but do you wish a dooth oud  at ish my deshire said mr lavender keeping his finger on his tooth and his eyes closed at one  i cannot give you gas without my anaesthedist  i dow said mr lavender be wick  and feeling the little cold spyglass begin to touch his gums he clenched his hands and thought this is the moment to prove that i too can die for a good cause if i am not man enough to bear for my country so small a woe i can never again look aurora in the face  the voice of the young dentist dragged him rudely from the depth of his resignation  excuse me but which dooth did you say  mr lavender again inserted his finger and opened his eyes  the dentist shook his head imbossible he said that dooth is perfectly sound the other two are rotten but they do not ache  mr lavender shook his head and repeated  at one  you are my first client this week sir said the young german calmly but i cannot that dooth dake out  at those words mr lavender experienced a sensation as if his soul were creeping back up his legs he spoke as it reached his stomach  noc he said  no replied the young german it is nod the dooth which causes you the bain  mr lavender suddenly conscious that he had no pain took his finger out  sir he said i perceive that you are an honourable man there is something sublime in your abnegation if indeed you have had no other client this week  no fear said the young german haf i cicely  mr lavender became conscious for the first time of a young woman leaning up against the wall with a pair of tweezers in her hand  take it out otto she said in a low voice if he wants it  no no said mr lavender sharply resuming his teeth i would not for the world burden your conscience  my clients are all batriots said the young dentist and my bractice is kaput we are in a bad way sir he added with a smile but we try to do the correct ting  mr lavender saw the young woman move the tweezers in a manner which caused his blood to run a little cold  we must live he heard her say  young madam he said i honour the impulse which makes you desire to extend your husbands practice indeed i perceive you both to be so honourable that i cannot but make you a confession my tooth is indeed sound though since i have been pretending that it isnt it has caused me much discomfort i came here largely to form an opinion of your husbands character with a view to securing his internment  at that word the two young people shrank together till they were standing side by side staring at mr lavender with eyes full of anxiety and wonder their hands which still held the implements of dentistry insensibly sought each other  be under no apprehension cried mr lavender much moved i can see that you are greatly attached and even though your husband is a german he is still a man and i could never bring myself to separate him from you  who are you said the young woman in a frightened voice putting her arm round her husbands waist  just a public man answered mr lavender  i came here from a sense of duty nothing more assure you  who put you up to it  that said mr lavender bowing as best he could from the angle he was in i am not at liberty to disclose but believe me you have nothing to fear from this visit i shall never do anything to distress a woman and please charge me as if the tooth had been extracted  the young german smiled and shook his head  sir he said i am grateful to you for coming for it shows us what danger we are in the hardest ting to bear has been the uncertainty of our bosition and the feeling that our friends were working behind our backs now we know that this is so we shall vordify our souls to bear the worst but tell me he went on when you came here surely you must have subbosed that to tear me away from my wife would be very bainful to her and to myself you say now you never could do that how was it then you came  ah sir cried mr lavender running his hands through his hair and staring at the ceiling i feared this might seem inconsistent to your logical german mind but there are many things we public men would never do if we could see them being done fortunately as a rule we cannot believe me when i leave you i shall do my best to save you from a fate which i perceive to be unnecessary  so saying he rose from the chair and picking up his hat backed towards the door  i will not offer you my hand he said for i am acutely conscious that my position is neither dignified nor decent i owe you a tooth that i shall not readily forget goodbye     xv  and backing through the doorway he made his way down the stairs and out into the street still emotionalized by the picture of the two young people holding each other by the waist he had not however gone far before reason resumed its sway and he began to see that the red velvet chair in which he had been sitting was in reality a wireless apparatus reaching to berlin or at least concealed a charge of dynamite to blow up some king or prime minister and that the lookingglasses of which he had noticed two at least were surely used for signalling to gothas or zeppelins this plunged him into a confusion so poignant that rather by accident than design he found himself again at hampstead instead of at scotland yard in the society of aurora alone he thought can i free myself from the goadings of conscience for it was she who sent me on that errand and instead of going in he took up a position on his lawn whence he could attract her attention by waving his arms he had been doing this for some time to the delight of blink who thought it a new game before he saw her in her nurses dress coming out of a frenchwindow with her yellow book in her hand redoubling his efforts till he had arrested her attention he went up to the privet hedge and said in a deep and melancholy voice  aurora i have failed in my duty and the errand on which you sent me is unfulfilled mrs pullbodys sisters husbands sisters husband is still largely speaking at large  i knew he would be replied the young lady with her joyous smile thats why i put her on to youthe cat  at a loss to understand her meaning mr lavender who had bent forward above the hedge in his eagerness to explain lost his balance and endeavouring to save the hedge fell over into some geranium pots  dear don pickwixote cried the young lady assisting him to rise have you hurt your nose  it is not that said mr lavender removing some mould from his hair and stifling the attentions of blink but rather my honour for i have allowed my duty to my country to be overridden by the common emotion of pity  hurrah cried the young lady itll do you ever so much good  aurora cried mr lavender aghast walking at her side but the young lady only uttered her enchanting laugh  come and lie down in the hammock she said youre looking like a ghost ill cover you up with a rug and smoke a cigarette to keep the midges off you tuck up your legs thats right  no said mr lavender from the recesses of the hammock feeling his nose let the bidges bide me i deserve they should devour me alive  all right said the young lady but have a nap anyway and sitting down in a low chair she opened her book and lit a cigarette  mr lavender remained silent watching her with the eyes of an acolyte and wondering whether he was in his senses to have alighted on so rare a fortune nor was it long before he fell into a hypnotic doze  how long mr lavender had been asleep he could not of course tell before he dreamed that he was caught in a net the meshes of which were formed of the cries of newspaper boys announcing atrocities by land and sea he awoke looking into the eyes of aurora who to still his struggles had taken hold of his ankles  my goodness you are thin were the first words he heard no wonder youre lightheaded  mr lavender whose returning chivalry struggled with unconscious delight murmured with difficulty  let me go let me go it is too heavenly  well have you finished kicking asked the young lady  yes returned mr lavender in a fainting voicealas  the young lady let go of his ankles and aiding him to rise from the hammock said i know whats the matter with you nowyoure starving yourself you ought to be kept on your back for three months at least and fed on butter  mr lavender soothing the feelings of blink who at his struggles had begun to pant deeply answered with watering lips  everyone in these days must do twice as much as he ought and i eat half for only in this way can we compass the defeat of our common enemies the young ladys answer which sounded like bosh was lost in mr lavenders admiration of her magnificent proportions as she bent to pick up her yellow book  aurora he said i know not what secret you share with the goddesses suffer me to go in and give thanks for this hour spent in your company  and he was about to recross the privet hedge when she caught him by the coattag saying  no don pickwixote you must dine with us i want you to meet my father come along and linking her arm in his she led him towards her castle mr lavender who had indeed no option but to obey such was the vigour of her arm went with a sense of joy not unmingled with consternation lest the personage she spoke of should have viewed him in the recent extravagance of his dreaming moments  i dont believe said the young lady gazing down at him that you weigh an ounce more than seven stone its appalling  not returned mr lavender by physical weight and force shall we win this war for it is at bottom a question of morale right is ever victorious in the end and though we have infinitely greater material resources than our foes we should still triumph were we reduced to the last ounce because of the inherent nobility of our cause  youll be reduced to the last ounce if we dont feed you up somehow said the young lady  would you like to wash your hands  mr lavender having signified his assent she left him alone in a place covered with linoleum when at length followed by blink he emerged from dreamy ablutions mr lavender saw that she had changed her dress to a flowing blue garment of diaphanous character which made her appear like an emanation of the sky he was about to say so when he noticed a gentleman in khaki scrutinizing him with lively eyes slightly injected with blood  don pickwixote said the young lady my father major scarlet  mr lavenders hand was grasped by one which seemed to him made of iron  i am honoured sir he said painfully to meet the father of my charming young neighbour  the major answered in a voice as clipped as his grey bottlebrush moustache delighted dinners ready come along  mr lavender saw that he had a mouth which seemed to have a bitt in it several hairs on a finely rounded head and an air of efficient and truculent bonhomie tanned and wrinkled by the weather  the table at which they became seated seemed to one accustomed to frugality to groan with flowers and china and glass and mr lavender had hardly supped his rich and steaming soup before his fancy took fire nor did he notice that he was drinking from a green glass in which was a yellow fluid  i get army rations said the major holding a morsel of fillet of beef towards blink nice dog mr lavender  yes replied mr lavender ever delighted that his favourite should receive attention she is an angel  too light said the major and a bit too narrow in front but a nice dog whats your view of the war  before mr lavender could reply he felt auroras foot pressing his and heard her say  don pickwixotes views are after your own heart dad hes for the complete destruction of the hun  indeed yes cried mr lavender with shining eyes right and justice demand it we seek to gain nothing  but well take all we can get said the major  theyll never get their colonies back well stick to them fast enough  mr lavender stared at him for a moment then remembering what he had so often read he murmured  aggrandizement is not our object but we can never forget that so long as any territory remains in the hands of our treacherous foe the arteries of our farflung empire are menaced at the roots  righto said the major weve got the chance of our lives and were going to take it  mr lavender sat forward a little on his chair i shall never admit he said that we are going to take anything for that would be contrary to the principles which we are pledged to support and to our avowed intention of seeking only the benefit of the human race but our inhuman foes have compelled us to deprive them of the power to injure others  yes said the major we must just go on killing germans and collaring every bit of their property we can  mr lavender sat a little further forward on his chair and the trouble in his eyes grew  after alls said and done continued the major its a simple warus or them and in the long run its bound to be us weve got the cards mr lavender started and said in a weak and wavering voice  we shall never sheathe the sword until  the whole bag of tricks is in our hands might isnt right but rights might mr lavender ha ha  mr lavenders eyes lighted on his glass and he emptied it in his confusion when he looked up again he could not see the major very well but could distinctly hear the truculent bonhomie of his voice  every german ought to be interned all their property ought to be confiscated all their submarines and zeppelins crews ought to be hung all german prisoners ought to be treated as they treat our men we ought to give em no quarter we ought to bomb their towns out of existence i draw the line at their women short of that theres nothing too bad for them id treat em like rabbits vermin they were and vermin they remain  during this speech the most astounding experience befell mr lavender so that his eyes nearly started from his head it seemed to him indeed that he was seated at dinner with a prussian and the majors voice had no sooner ceased its genial rasping than with a bound forward on his chair he ejaculated  behold the manthe prussian in his jackboot and utterly oblivious of the fact that he was addressing auroras father he went on with almost terrible incoherence although you have conquered this country sir never shall you subdue in my breast the sentiments of liberty and generosity which make me an englishman i abhor youinvader of the worldtrampler underfoot of the humanitiesenemy of mankindapostle of force you have blown out the sparks of love and kindliness and have for ever robbed the universe prussian  the emphasis with which he spoke that word caused his chair on the edge of which he was sitting to tilt up under him so that he slid under the table losing the vision of that figure in helmet and fieldgrey which he had been apostrophizing  hold up said a voice while blink joined him nervously beneath the board  never cried mr lavender imprison maltreat me do what you will you have subdued her body but never will i admit that you have conquered the honour of britain and trodden her gentle culture into the mud  and convinced that he would now be dragged away to be confined in some dungeon on bread and water he clasped the leg of the diningtable with all his might while blink sagaciously aware that something peculiar was occurring to her master licked the back of his neck he had been sitting there perhaps half a minute with his ears stretched to catch the halfwhispered sounds above when he saw a shining object appear under the table the head indeed of the prussian squatting there to look at him  go up thou baldhead he called out at once i will make no terms with the destroyer of justice and humanity  all right my dear sir replied the head  will you let my daughter speak to you  prussian blasphemer responded mr lavender shifting his position so as to be further away and clasping instead of the table leg some soft silken objects which he was too excited to associate with aurora you have no daughter for no woman would own one whose hated presence poisons this country  well well said the major how shall we get him out  hearing these words and believing them addressed to a prussian guard mr lavender clung closer to the objects but finding them wriggle in his clasp let go and bolting forward like a rabbit on his hands and knees came into contact with the majors head the sound of the concussion the majors oaths mr lavenders moans blinks barking and the peals of laughter from aurora made up a noise which might have been heard in portugal the situation was not eased until mr lavender crawled out and taking up a dinnerknife rolled his napkin round his arm and prepared to defend himself against the german army  well im damned said the major when he saw these preparations i am damned  aurora who had been leaning against the wall from laughter here came forward gasping  go away dad and leave him to me  to you cried the major hes not safe  oh yes he is its only you that are exciting him come along  and taking her father by the arm she conducted him from the room closing the door behind him and putting her back against it she said gently  dear don pickwixote all danger is past the enemy has been repulsed and we are alone in safety ha ha ha  her voice recalled mr lavender from his strange hallucination what he said weakly  why who where when  you have been dreaming again let me take you home and tuck you into bed and taking from him the knife and napkin she opened the frenchwindow and passed out on to the lawn  lavender who now that his reason had come back would have followed her to the death passed out also accompanied by blink and watched by the major who had put his head in again at the door unfortunately the spirit moved mr lavender to turn round at this moment and seeing the head he cried out in a loud voice  he is there he is there arch enemy of mankind let me go and die under his jackboot for never over my living body shall he rule this land and the infatuated gentleman would certainly have rushed at his host had not aurora stayed him by the slack of his nether garments the major withdrawing his head mr lavenders excitement again passed from him and he suffered himself to be led dazedly away and committed to the charge of mrs petty and joe who did not leave him till he was in bed with a strong bromide to keep him company     xvi  fights the fight of faith  the strenuous experiences through which mr lavender had passed resulted in what joe petty called a fair knockout and he was forced to spend three days in the seclusion of his bed deprived of his newspapers he instructed mrs petty however on no account to destroy or mislay any journal but to keep them in a pile in his study this she did for though her first impulse was to light the kitchen fire with the five of them every morning deliberate reflection convinced her that twenty journals read at one sitting would produce on him a more soporific effect than if he came down to a mere five  mr lavender passed his three days therefore in perfect repose feeding blink staring at the ceiling and conversing with joe an uneasy sense that he had been lacking in restraint caused his mind to dwell on life as seen by the monthly rather than the daily papers and to hold with his chauffeur discussions of a somewhat philosophical character  as regards the government of this country joe he said on the last evening of his retirement who do you consider really rules for it is largely on this that our future must depend  cant say sir answered joe unless its botty  i do not know whom or what you signify by that word replied mr lavender i am wondering if it is the people who rule  the people replied joe the peoples like a gent in a lunatic asylum allowed to ave instinks but not to express em one day itll get aht and we shall all step lively  it is perhaps public opinion continued mr lavender to himself as expressed in the press  not it said joe the nearest opinion the press gets to expressin is that of mayors ave you never noticed sir that when the press is ard up for support of an opinion that the public dont old they go to the mayors and get em in two columns  mayors are most valuable public men said mr lavender  ive nothin against em replied joe very average lot in their walk of life but they aint the people  mr lavender sighed what then is the people joe  i am replied joe ive got no opinions on anything except that i want to live a quiet lifejust enough beer and baccy short hours and no worry  if you compare that with the aspirations of mayors you will see how sordid such a standard is said mr lavender gravely  sordid it may be sir replied joe but theres a thing abaht it you avent noticed i dont want to sacrifice nobody to satisfy my aspirations why because ive got none thats priceless take the press take parlyment take mayorsall mad on aspirations now its free trade now its imperialism now its liberty in europe now its slavery in ireland now its sacrifice of the last man an the last dollar you never can tell what aspirationll get em next and the ole point of an aspiration is the sacrifice of someone else dont you make a mistake sir i defy you to make a public speech which asnt got that at the bottom of it  we are wandering from the point joe returned mr lavender who is it that governs the country  a unseen power replied joe promptly  how  well sir were a democratic country aint we parlyments elected by the people and goverments elected by parlyment all right so far but what appens goverment says im going to do this so long as it meets with the approval of the unseen power well an good but what if it dont the up gets busy in an undred papers there begins to appear what the up calls public opinion thats to say the opinion of the people that agree with the up there you ave it sir only themand it appears strong attacks on the goverment policy nasty things said abaht members of it thats indiscreet enough to speak aht what they thinkgerman fathers and other secret vices an whats more than all not a peep at any opinion that supports the goverment well that goes on day after day playin on the mind of parlyment if theyve got any and gittin on the goverments nerves which theyve got weak till they says look ere its no go public opinion wont stand it we shall be outed and thatll never do because theres no other set of fellows that can save this country then they ave a meetin and change their policy and what theyve never seen is that theyve never seen public opinion at all all theyve seen is what the up let em now if i was the goverment id ave it out once for all with the u p  ah cried mr lavender whose eyes were starting from his head so profoundly was he agitated by what was to him a new thought  yes continued joe if i was the goverment next time it appened id say all right old cock do your damnedest i aint responsible to you attack suppress and all the rest of it were goin to do what we say all the same and then id do it and whatd come of it either the up would go beyond the limits of the lawand then id jump on it suppress its papers and clap it into quodor itd take it lyin down whichever appened itd be all up with the u p id a broke its chain off my neck for good but i aint the goverment an goverments got tender feet i ask you sir wots the good of havin a constitooshion and a the bother of electing these fellows if they cant act according to their judgment for the short term of their natural lives the up may be patriotic and estimable and ave the best intentions and all that but its outside the constitooshion and whats more im not goin to spend my last blood an my last money in a democratic country to suit the tastes of any single man or triumpherate or wotever it may be made of if the governments uncertain wot the country wants they can always ask it in the proper way but they never ought to take it on earsay from the papers thats wot i think  while he was speaking mr lavender had become excited to the point of fever for without intending it joe had laid bare to him a yawning chasm between his worship of public men and his devotion to the press and no sooner had his chauffeur finished than he cried leave me joe for i must think this out  right sir answered joe with his smile and taking the teatray from off his master he set it where it must infallibly be knocked over and went out  can it be possible thought mr lavender when he was alone that i am serving god and mammon and which is god and which is mammon he added letting his thoughts play over the countless speeches and leading articles which had formed his spiritual diet since the war began or indeed are they not both god or both mammon if what joe says is true and nothing is recorded save what seems good to this unseen power have i not been listening to ghosts and shadows and am i indeed myself anything but the unsubstantial image of a public man for it is true that i have no knowledge of anything save what is recorded in the papers and perceiving that the very basis of his faith was endangered he threw off the bedclothes and began to pace the room are we then all he thought being bounded like indiarubber balls by an unseen hand and is there no one of us strong enough to bounce into the eye of our bounder and overthrow him my god i am unhappy for it is a terrible thing not to know which my god is and whether i am a public man or an indiarubber ball and the more he thought the more dreadful it seemed to him now that he perceived that all those journals pamphlets and reports with which his study walls were lined might not be the truth but merely authorized versions of it  this he said aloud is a nightmare from which i must awaken or lose all my power of action and my ability to help my country in its peril  and sudden sweat broke out on his brow for he perceived that he had now no means of telling even whether there was a peril so strangely had joes words affected his powers of credulity  but surely he thought steadying himself by gripping his washstand there was at least a peril once and yet how do i know even that for i have only been told so and the tellers themselves were only told so by this unseen power and suppose it has made a mistake or has some private ends to serve oh it is terrible and there is no end to it and he shook the crockery in the spasms which followed the first awakenings of these religious doubts where then am i to go he cried for knowledge of the truth for even books would seem dependent on the good opinion of this unseen power and would not reach my eyes unless they were well spoken of by it  and the more he thought the more it seemed to him that nothing could help him but to look into the eyes of this unseen power so that he might see for himself whether it was the angel of truth or some demon jumping on the earth no sooner had this conviction entered his brain than he perceived how in carrying out such an enterprise he would not only be setting his own mind at rest and reestablishing or abolishing his faith but would be doing the greatest service which he could render to his country and to all public men thus he thought shall i cannonize my tourney and serve aurora who is the dawn of truth and beauty in the world i am not yet worthy however of this adventure which will indeed be far more arduous and distressing to accomplish than any which i have yet undertaken what can i do to brighten and equip my mind and divest it of all those prejudices in which it may unconsciously have become steeped if i could leave the earth a short space and commune with the clouds it might be best i will go to hendon and see if someone will take me up for a consideration for on earth i can no longer be sure of anything  and having rounded off his purpose with this lofty design he went back to bed with his head lighter than a puffball     xvii  addresses the clouds  on the morning following his resurrection mr lavender set out very early for the celebrated flying ground without speaking of his intention to anyone at the bottom of the hill he found to his annoyance that blink had divined his purpose and was following this which compelled him to walk greatly delayed his arrival but chance now favoured him for he found he was expected and at once conducted to a machine which was about to rise a taciturn young man with a long jaw and wings on his breast was standing there gazing at it with an introspective eye  ready sir he said  yes replied mr lavender enveloped to the eyes in a garment of fur and leather will you kindly hold my dog he added stroking blink with the feeling that he was parting for ever with all that was most dear to him  an attendant having taken hold of her by the collar mr lavender was heaved into the machine where the young airman was already seated in front of him  shall i feel sick asked mr lavender  probably said the young airman  that will not deter me for the less material i become the better it will be  the young airman turned his head and mr lavender caught the surprised yellow of his eye  hold on said the airman im going to touch her off  mr lavender held on and the machine moved but at this moment blink uttering a dismal howl leapt forward and breaking from the attendants grasp landed in the machine against mr lavenders chest  stop stop he cried my dog  stuff her down said the unmoved airman between your legs shes not the first to go up and wont be the last to come down  mr lavender stuffed her down as best he could if we are to be killed he thought it will be together blink the faithful creature who bitterly regretted her position now that the motion had begun looked up with a darkened eye at mr lavender who was stopping his ears against the horrible noises which had now begun he too had become aware of the pit of his stomach but this sensation soon passed away in the excitement he felt at getting away from the earth for they were already at the height of a house and rising rapidly  it is not at all like a little bird he thought but rather resembles a slow train on the surface of the sea or a horse on a switchback merrygoround i feel however that my spirit will soon be free for the earth is becoming like a board whereon a game is played by an unseen hand and i am leaving it and craning his head out a little too far he felt his chin knock against his spine drawing it in with difficulty he concentrated his attention upon that purification of his spirit which was the object of his journey  i am now he thought in the transcendent ether it should give me an amazing power of expression such as only the greatest writers and orators attain and divorced as i am rapidly becoming from all sordid reality truth will appear to me like one of those stars towards which i am undoubtedly flying though i cannot as yet see it  blink who between his legs had hitherto been unconscious of their departure from the earth now squirmed irresistibly up till her forepaws were on her masters chest and gazed lugubriously at the fearful prospect mr lavender clasped her convulsively they were by now rapidly nearing a flock of heavenly sheep which as they approached became ever more gigantic till they were transformed into monstrous snowfleeces intersected by wide drifts of blue  can it be that we are to adventure above them thought mr lavender i hope not for they seem to me fearful his alarm was soon appeased for the machine began to take a level course a thousand feet perhaps below the clouds whence little wraiths wandering out now and again dimmed mr lavenders vision and moistened his brow  blink having retired again between her masters legs a sense of security and exaltation was succeeding to the natural trepidation of mr lavenders mood i am now he thought lifted above all petty plots and passions on the wings of the morning soon will great thoughts begin to jostle in my head and i shall see the truth of all things made clear at last  but the thoughts did not jostle a curious lethargy began stealing over him instead so that his head fell back and his mouth fell open this might have endured until he returned to earth had not the airman stopped the engines so that they drifted ruminantly in space below the clouds with the cessation of the noise mr lavenders brain regained its activity and he was enchanted to hear the voice of his pilot saying  how are you getting on sir  as regards the sensation mr lavender replied it is marvellous for after the first minute or two during which the unwonted motion causes a certain inconvenience one grasps at once the exhilaration and joy of this great adventure to be in motion towards the spheres and see the earth laid out like a chessboard below you to feel the lithe creature beneath your body responding so freely to every call of its gallant young pilot to be filled with the scream of the engines as of an eagle at sport to know that at the least aberration of the intrepid airman we should be dashed into a million pieces all this is largely to experience an experience so unforgettable that one will neverererforget it  gosh said the young airman  yes pursued mr lavender who was now unconsciously reading himself in his mornings paper one can only compare the emotion to that which the disembodied spirit might feel passing straight from earth to heaven we saw at a great depth below us on a narrow white riband of road two crawling black specks and knew that they were human beings the same and no more than we had been before we left that great common place called earth  gum said the young airman as lavender paused youre getting it fine sir where will it appear  those great fleecy beings the clouds went on mr lavender without taking on the interruption seemed to await our coming in the morning glory of their piledup snows and we with the rarefied air in our lungs felt that we must shout to them and so carried away was mr lavender by his own style that he really did begin to address the clouds ghosts of the sky who creep cold about this wide blue air we small adventuring mortals greathearted salute you humbly proud of our daring have we come to sport with you and the winds of ouranos and in the rapturous corridors between you play hideand seek avoiding your glorious moisture with the dips and curves and skimming of our swallow flightswe the little unconquerable spirits of the squirth  the surprise which mr lavender felt at having uttered so peculiar a word in the middle of such a flow of poetry reduced him to sudden silence  golly said the airman with sudden alarm in his voice hold tight and they began to shoot towards earth faster than they had risen they came down by what seemed a miracle to mr lavender who was still contemplative precisely where they had gone up a little group was collected there and as they stepped out a voice said i beg your pardon in a tone so dry that it pierced even the fogged condition in which mr lavender alighted the gentleman who spoke had a dark moustache and thick white hair and except that he wore a monocle and was perhaps three inches taller bore a striking resemblance to himself  thank you he replied certainly  no said the gentleman not at allon the contrary who the hell are you  a public man said mr lavender surprised at least he added conscientiously i am not quite certain  well said the gentleman youve jolly well stolen my stunt  who then are you asked mr lavender  i replied the gentleman evidently intensely surprised that he was not known imy name  but at this moment mr lavenders attention was diverted by the sight of blink making for the horizon and crying out in a loud voice my dog he dropped the coat in which he was still enveloped and set off running after her at full speed without having taken in the identity of the gentleman or disclosed his own blink indeed scenting another flight in the air had made straight for the entrance of the enclosure and finding a motor cab there with the door open had bolted into it taking it for her masters car mr lavender sprang in after her at the shake which this imparted to the cab the driver who had been dozing turned his head  want to go back sir he said  yes replied mr lavender breathless london     xviii  sees truth face to face  i fear thought mr lavender as they sped towards town that i have inadvertently taken a joyride which belonged to that distinguished person with the eyeglass no matter my spirit is now bright for the adventure i have in hand if only i knew where i could find the unseen powerbut possibly its movements may be recorded in these journals and taking from his pocket his morning papers which he had not yet had time to peruse he buried himself in their contents he was still deeply absorbed when the cab stopped and the driver knocked on the window mr lavender got out followed by blink and was feeling in his pocket for the fare when an exclamation broke from the driver  gorblimy ive brought the wrong baby  and before mr lavender had recovered from his surprise he had whipped the car round and was speeding back towards the flying ground  how awkward thought mr lavender who was extremely nice in money matters what shall i do now and he looked around him there as it were by a miracle was the office of a great journal whence obviously his distinguished colleague had set forth to the flying grounds and to which he had been returned in error by the faithful driver  perceiving in all this the finger of providence mr lavender walked in those who have followed his experiences so far will readily understand how no one could look on mr lavender without perceiving him to be a man of extreme mark and no surprise need be felt when he was informed that the personage he sought was on the point of visiting brighton to open a hospital and might yet be overtaken at victoria station  with a beating heart he took up the trail in another taxicab and arriving at victoria purchased tickets for himself and blink and inquired for the brighton train  hurry up replied the official mr lavender ran searching the carriage windows for any indication of his objective the whistle had been blown and he was in despair when his eye caught the label reserved on a firstclass window and looking in he saw a single person evidently of the highest consequence smoking a cigar surrounded by papers without a moments hesitation he opened the door and preceded by blink leaped in this carriage is reserved sir said the personage as the train moved out  i know said mr lavender who had fallen on to the edge of the seat opposite and only the urgency of my business would have caused me to violate the sanctity of your retreat for believe me i have the instincts if not the habits of a gentleman  the personage who had made a move of his hand as if to bring the train to a standstill abandoning his design replaced his cigar and contemplated mr lavender from above it  the latter remained silent returning that remarkable stare while blink withdrew beneath the seat and pressed her chin to the ground savouring the sensation of a new motion  yes he thought those eyes have an almost superhuman force and cunning they are the eyes of a spider in the centre of a great web they seem to draw me  you are undoubtedly the unseen power sir he said suddenly and i have reached the heart of the mystery from your own lips i shall soon know whether i am a puppet or a public man  the personage who by his movements was clearly under the impression that he had to do with a lunatic sat forward with his hands on his knees ready to rise at a moments notice he kept his cigar in his mouth however and an enforced smile on the folds of his face  what can i do for you sir he said  will you have a cigar  no thank you replied mr lavender i must keep the eyes of my spirit clear and come to the point do you rule this country or do you not for it is largely on the answer to this that my future depends in telling others what to do am i speaking as my conscience or as your conscience dictates and further if indeed i am speaking as your conscience dictates have you a conscience  the personage who had evidently made up his mind to humour the intruder flipped the ash off his cigar  well sir he said i dont know who the devil you may be but my conscience is certainly as good as yours  that returned mr lavender with a sigh is a great relief for whether you rule the country or not you are undoubtedly the source from which i together with the majority of my countrymen derive our inspirations you are the fountainhead at which we draw and drink and to know that your waters are pure unstained by taint of personal prejudice and the love of power will fortify us considerably am i to assume then that above all passion and pettiness you are an impersonal force whose innumerable daily editions reflect nothing but abstract truth and are in no way the servants of a preconceived and personal view of the situation  you want to know too much dont you think said the personage with a smile  how can that be sir asked mr lavender if you are indeed the invisible king swaying the currents of national life and turning its tides at will it is essential that we should believe in you and before we can believe in you must we not know all about you  by jove sir replied the personage that strikes me as being contrary to all the rules of religion i thought faith was the ticket  by this answer mr lavender was so impressed that he sat for a moment in silence with his eyebrow working up and down  sir he said at last you have given me a new thought if you are right to disbelieve in you and the acts which you perform or rather the editions which you issue is blasphemy  i should think so said the personage emitting a long whiff of smoke hadnt that ever occurred to you before  no replied mr lavender naively for i have never yet disbelieved anything in those journals  the personage coughed heartily  i have always regarded them went on mr lavender as i myself should wish to be regarded without fear and without reproach for that is as i understand it the principle on which a gentleman must live ever believing of others what he would wish believed of himself with the exception of germans he added hastily  naturally returned the personage and ill defy you to find anything in them which disagrees with that formula everything they print refers to germans if not directly then obliquely germans are the idee fixe and without an idee fixe as you know theres no such thing as religion do you get me  yes indeed cried mr lavender enthused for the whole matter now seemed to him to fall into coherence and what was more to coincide with his preconceptions so that he had no longer any doubts you sirthe unseen powerare but the crystallized embodiment of the national sentiment in time of war in serving you and fulfilling the ideas which you concrete in your journals we public men are servants of the general animus which in its turn serves the blind and burning instinct of justice this is eminently satisfactory to me who would wish no better fate than to be a humble lackey in that house he had no sooner however spoken those words than joe pettys remarks about public opinion came back to him and he added but are you really the general animus or are you only the animus of mayors that is the question  the personage seemed to follow this thought with difficulty whats that he said  mr lavender ran his hands through his hair  and turns he said on what is the unit of national feeling and intelligence is it or is it not a mayor  the personage smiled well what do you think he said havent you ever heard them after dinner theres no question about it make your mind easy if thats your only trouble  mr lavender greatly cheered by the genial certainty in this answer said i thank you sir i shall go back and refute that common scoffer that caster of doubts i have seen the truth face to face and am greatly encouraged to further public effort with many apologies i can now get out he added as the train stopped at south croydon blink and followed by his dog he stepped from the train  the personage who was indeed no other than the private secretary of the private secretary of it whom mr lavender had designated as the truth watched him from the window  well that was a treat dear papa he murmured to himself emitting a sigh of smoke after his retreating interlocutor     xix  is in peril of the street  on the sunday following this interview with the truth mr lavender who ever found the day of rest irksome to his strenuous spirit left his house after an early supper it had been raining all day but the sinking sun had now emerged and struck its level light into the tree tops from a still cloudy distance followed by blink he threaded the puddled waste which lies to the west of the spaniards road nor was it long before the wild beauty of the scene infected his spirit and he stood still to admire the world spread out the smoke rack of misted rain was still drifting above the sunset radiance in an applegreen sky and behind mr lavender as he gazed at those clouds symbolical of the worlds unrest a group of tall dark pinetrees wild and witchlike had collected as if in audience of his cosmic mood he formed a striking group for a painter with the west wind flinging back his white hair and fluttering his dark moustache along his cheeks while blink a little in front of him pointed at the prospect and emitted barks whose vigour tossed her charming head now to this side now to that  how beautiful is this earth thought mr lavender and how simple to be good and happy thereon yet must we journey ten leagues beyond the wide worlds end to find justice and liberty there are dark powers like lions ever in the path yes he continued turning round to the pinetrees who were creaking slightly in the wind hate and oppression greed lust and ambition there you stand malevolently regarding me out upon you dark witches of evil if i had but an axe i would lay you lower than the dust but the poor pinetrees paid no attention save to creak a little louder and so incensed was mr lavender by this insensibility on the part of those which his own words had made him perceive were the powers of darkness that he would very likely have barked his knuckles on them if blink by her impatience had not induced him to resume his walk and mount on to the noble rampart of the spaniards road  along this he wandered and down the hill with the countless ghosts and shadows of his brain liberating the world in fancy from all the hindrances which beset the paths of public men till dark fell and he was compelled to turn towards home closely attended by the now sobered blink he had reached the tube station when he perceived in the inky wartime dusk that a woman was following him dimly aware that she was tall and graceful he hurried to avoid her but before long could but note that she was walking parallel and turning her face towards him her gloved hand seemed to make a beckoning movement and perceiving at once that he was the object of that predatory instinct which he knew from the many letters and protests in his journals to be one of the most distressing features of the war he would have broken into a run if he had not been travelling uphill being deprived of this means of escape his public nature prevailed and he saw that it was his duty to confront the woman and strike a blow at the national evil stalking beside him but he was in a difficulty for his natural delicacy towards women seemed to preclude him from treating her as if she were what she evidently was while his sense of dutyurged him with equal force to do so  a whiff of delicious scent determined him madam he said without looking in her face which indeed was not visibleso great was the darkness it is useless to pursue one who not only has the greatest veneration for women but regards you as a public danger at a time when all the energies of the country should be devoted to the defeat of our common enemies  the woman uttering a sound like a laugh edged towards him and mr lavender edged away so that they proceeded up the street crabwise with blink adhering jealously to her masters heels  do you know said mr lavender with all the delicacy in his power how terribly subversive of the national effort it is to employ your beauty and your grace to snare and slacken the sinews of our glorious youth the mystery of a womans glance in times like these should be used solely to beckon our heroes on to death in the field but you madam than whom no one indeed has a more mysterious glance have turned it to ends which in the words of a great public man profane the temple of ourour  mr lavender stopped for his delicacy would not allow him even in so vital a cause to call bodies bodies the woman here edged so close that he bolted across her in affright and began to slant back towards the opposite side of the street  madam he said you must have perceived by now that i am alas not privileged by age to be one of the defenders of my country and though i am prepared to yield to you if by so doing i can save some young hero from his fate i wish you to clearly understand that only my sense of duty as a public man would induce me to do any such thing at this he turned his eyes dreadfully upon her graceful form still sidling towards him and conscious again of that delightful scent felt a swooning sensation which made him lean against a lamppost spare me madam he said in a faint voice for my countrys sake i am ready to do anything but i must tell you that i worship another of your sex from afar and if you are a woman you will not seek to make me besmirch that adoration or imperil my chivalry  so saying he threw his arms round the lamppost and closed his eyes expecting every moment to be drawn away against his will into a life of vice  a wellknown voice strangled to the pitch almost of inaudibility said in his ear  oh don pickwixote don pickwixote you will be the death of me  electrified mr lavender opened his eyes and in the dull orange rays of the heavily shaded lamp he saw beside him no other than the writhing choking figure of aurora herself shocked beyond measure by the mistake he had made mr lavender threw up his hands and bolted past her through the gateway of his garden nor did he cease running till he had reached his bedroom and got under the bed so terribly was he upset there in the company of blink he spent perhaps the most shamestricken hours of his existence cursing the memory of all those bishops and novelists who had caused him to believe that every woman in a dark street was a danger to the state nor could the persuasion of mrs petty or joe induce him to come out so that in despair they were compelled to leave him to pass the night in this penitential position which he did without even taking out his teeth     xx  receives a revelation  fully a week elapsed before mr lavender recovered from the effects of the night which he had spent under his bed and again took his normal interest in the course of national affairs that which at length tore him from his torpid condition and refixed his imagination was an article in one of his journals on the league of nations which caused him suddenly to perceive that this was the most important subject of the day carefully extracting the address of the society who had the matter in hand he determined to go down forthwith and learn from their own lips how he could best induce everybody to join them in their noble undertaking shutting every window therefore and locking blink carefully into his study he set forth and took the tube to charing cross  arriving at the premises indicated he made his way in lifts and corridors till he came to the name of this great world undertaking upon the door of room 443 and paused for a moment to recover from the astonishment he felt that the whole building at least was not occupied by the energies of such a prodigious association  appearances however are deceptive he thought and from a single grain of mustardseed whole fields will flower he knocked on the door therefore and receiving the reply cub id in a female voice he entered a room where two young ladies with bad colds were feebly tapping typewriters  can i see the president asked mr lavender  dot at the bobent said one of the young ladies will the secretary do  yes replied mr lavender for i seek information  the young ladies indulged in secret confabulation from which the perpetual word he alone escaped to mr lavenders ears  then one of them slipped into an inner room leaving behind her a powerful trail of eucalyptus she came back almost directly saying go id  the room which mr lavender entered contained two persons one seated at a bureau and the other pacing up and down and talking in a powerful bass voice he paused looked at mr lavender from under bushy brows and at once went on walking and talking with a sort of added zest  this must be he thought mr lavender sitting down to listen for there was something about the gentleman which impressed him at once he had very large red ears and hardly a hair on his head while his full bearded face and prominent eyes were full of force and genius  it wont do a little bit titmarsh he was saying to allow the politicians to meddle in this racket we want men of genius whose imaginations carry them beyond the facts of the moment this is too big a thing for those blasted politicians they havent shown a sign so far of paying attention to what ive been telling them all this time we must keep them out titmarsh machinery without mechanism and a change of heart in the world its very simple a single man of genius from each country no pettifogging opposition no petty prejudices  the other gentleman whom mr lavender took for the secretary and who was leaning his head rather wearily on his hand interjected quite so and whom would you choose besides yourself in france for instance  he who was walking stopped a moment again looked at mr lavender intently and again began to speak as if he were not there  france he said there isnt anybodyanatoles too oldthere isnt anybody  america then hazarded the secretary  america replied the other they havent got even half a man theres that fellow in germany that i used to influence but i dont knowno i dont think hed be any good  dannunzio surely began the secretary  dannunzio my god dannunzio no theres nobody in italy or hollandshes as bankrupt as spain and theres not a cat in austria russia might perhaps give us someone but i cant at the moment think of him no titmarsh its difficult  mr lavender had been growing more and more excited at each word he overheard for a scheme of really stupendous proportions was shaping itself within him he suddenly rose and said i have an idea  the secretary sat up as if he had received a faradic shock and he who was walking up and down stood still the deuce you have sir he said  yes cried mr lavender and in concentration and marvellous simplicity it has i am sure never been surpassed it is clear to me sir that you and you alone must be this league of nations for if it is entirely in your hands there will be no delay the plan will spring full fledged from the head of jove and this great and beneficial change in the lot of mankind will at once become an accomplished fact there will be no need for keeping in touch with human nature no call for patience and all that laborious upbuilding stone by stone which is so apt to discourage mankind and imperil the fruition of great reforms no sir youyou must be this league and we will all work to the end that tomorrow at latest there may be perfected this crowning achievement of the human species  the gentleman who had commenced to walk again looked furtively from mr lavender to the secretary and said  by jingo some idea  yes cried mr lavender entranced that his grand notion should be at once accepted for it is only men like you who can both soaringly conceive and immediately concrete in action and what is more there will be no fear of your tiring of this job and taking up another for you will be it and one cannot change oneself  the gentleman looked at mr lavender very suddenly at the words tiring of this job and transferred his gaze to the secretary who had bent his face down to his papers and was smothering a snigger with his hand  who are you sir he said sharply  merely one returned mr lavender who wishes to do all in his power to forward a project so fraught with beneficence to all mankind i count myself fortunate beyond measure to have come here this morning and found the very heart of the matter the grain of mustardseed  the gentleman who had begun to walk again here muttered words which would have sounded like damned impudence if mr lavender had not been too utterly carried away by his idea to hear them  i shall go forth at once he said and make known the good tidings that the fields are sown the league formed henceforth there are no barriers between nations and the reign of perpetual peace is assured it is colossal  the gentleman abruptly raised his boot but seeming to think better of it lowered it again and turned away to the window  mr lavender having bowed to his back went out and urged on by his enthusiasm directed his steps at once towards trafalgar square  arriving at this hub of the universe he saw that chance was on his side for a meeting was already in progress and a crowd of some forty persons assembled round one of the lions owing to his appearance mr lavender was able without opposition to climb up on the plinth and join the speaker a woman of uncertain years he stood there awaiting his turn and preparing his oration while she continued her discourse which seemed to be a protest against any interference with british control of the freedom of the seas a union jack happened to be leaning against the monument and when she had at last finished mr lavender seized it and came forward to the edge  great tidings he said at once waving the flag and without more ado plunged into an oration which so far as it went must certainly be ranked among his masterpieces great tidings friends i have planted the grain of mustard seed or in common parlance have just come from the meeting which has incepted the league of nations and it will be my task this morning briefly to make known to you the principles which in future must dominate the policy of the world since it is for the closer brotherhood of man and the reign of perpetual peace that we are struggling we must first secure the annihilation of our common enemies those members of the human race whose infamies have largely placed them beyond the pale must be eliminated once for all  loud cheers greeted this utterance and stimulated by the sound mr lavender proceeded what however must the civilized nations do when at last they have clean sheets in the first place all petty prejudices and provincial aspirations must be set aside and though the world must be firmly founded upon the principle of nationality it must also act as one great people this my fellowcountrymen is no mere contradiction in terms for though in their new solidarities each nation will be prouder of itself and more jealous of its good name and independence than ever that will not prevent its sacrificing its inalienable rights for the good of the whole human nation of which it is a member friends let me give you a simple illustration which in a nutshell will make the whole thing clear we here in britain are justly proud and tenacious of our sea powerin the words of the poet we hold all the gates of the water now it is abundantly and convincingly plain that this reinforced principle of nationality bids us to retain and increase them while internationalism bids us givethem up  his audiencewhich had hitherto listened with open mouths here closed them and a strident voice exclaimed  give it a name govnor dyou say we ought to give up gib  this word pierced mr lavender standing where he was to the very marrow and he fell into such confusion of spirit that his words became inaudible  my god he thought appalled is it possible that i have not got to the bottom of this question and turning his back on the audience he gazed in a sort of agony at the figure of nelson towering into the sky above him he was about to cry out piteously countrymen i know not what i think oh i am unhappy when he inadvertently stepped back over the edge of the plinth and still entangled in the flag was picked up by two policemen and placed in a dazed condition and a deserted spot opposite the national gallery  it was while he was standing there encircled by pigeons and forgotten by his fellow man that there came to him a spiritual revelation strange he thought i notice a certain inconsistency in myself and even in my utterances i am two men one of whom is me and one not me and the one which is not me is the one which causes me to fall into the arms of policemen and other troubles the one which is me loves these pigeons and desires to live quietly with my dog not considering public affairs which indeed seem to be suited to persons of another sort whence then comes the one which is not me can it be that it is derived from the sayings and writings of others and is but a spurious spirit only meet to be outcast do i to speak in the vernacular care any buttons whether we stick to gibraltar or not so long as men do but live in kindness and if that is so have i the right to say i do ought i not rather to be true to my private self and leave the course of public affairs to those who have louder voices and no private selves the thought was extremely painful for it seemed to disclose to him grave inconsistency in the recent management of his life and thoroughly mortified he turned round with a view of entering the national gallery and soothing his spirit with art when he was arrested by the placard which covered it announcing which town had taken which sum of bonds this lighted up such a new vista of public utility that his brain would certainly have caught fire again if one of the policemen who had conducted him across the square had not touched him on the arm and said  how are you now sir  i am pretty well thank you policeman replied mr lavender and sorry that i occasioned so much disturbance  dont mention it sir answered the policeman you came a nasty crump  tell me said mr lavender suddenly looking up into his face do you consider that a man is justified in living a private life for as regards my future it is largely on your opinion that i shall act  the policeman whose solid face showed traces of astonishment answered slowly as a general thing a mans private life dont bear lookin into as you know sir  i have not lived one for some time said mr lavender  well remarked the policeman if you take my advice you wont try it again i should say you adnt the constitution  i fear you do not catch my meaning returned mr lavender whose whole body was aching from his fall it is my public life which tries me  well then i should chuck it said the policeman  really murmured mr lavender eagerly would you  why not said the policeman  so excited was mr lavender by this independent confirmation of his sudden longing that he took out half a crown  you will oblige me greatly he said by accepting this as a token of my gratitude  well sir ill humour you answered the policeman though it was no trouble im sure youre as light as a feather goin anywhere in particular he added  yes said mr lavender rather faintly the tube station  come along with me then  mr lavender went along not sorry to have the protection of that stalwart form for his nerve was shaken not so much by physical suffering as by the revelation he had received  if youll take my tip sir said the policeman parting from him you wont try no private life again you dont look strong  thank you policeman said mr lavender musingly it is kind of you to take an interest in me goodbye  safely seated in the tube for hampstead he continued the painful struggle of his meditations if indeed he thought as a public man i do more harm than good i am prepared to sacrifice all for my countrys sake and retire into private life but the policeman said that would be dangerous for me what then is left to live neither a public nor a private life  this thought at once painful and heroic began to take such hold of him that he arrived at his house in a high fever of the brain     xxi  and ascends to paradise  now when mr lavender once slept over an idea it became so strong that no power on earth could prevent his putting it into execution and all night long he kept blink awake by tramping up and down his bedroom and planning the details of such a retirement as would meet his unfortunate case for at once he perceived that to retire from both his lives without making the whole world know of it would be tantamount to not retiring only by a public act he thought of so striking a character that nobody can miss it can i bring the moral home to all public and private men and a hundred schemes swarmed like ants in his brain nor was it till the cock crew that one adequate to this final occasion occurred to him  it will want very careful handling he thought for otherwise i shall be prevented and perhaps even arrested in the middle which will be both painful and ridiculous so sublime however was his idea that he shed many tears over it and often paused in his tramping to regard the unconscious blink with streaming eyes all the next day he went about the house and heath taking a last look at objects which had been dear and at mealtimes ate and drank even less than usual absorbed by the pathos of his coming renunciation he determined to make his preparations for the final act during the night when mrs petty would be prevented by joes snoring from hearing the necessary sounds and at supper he undertook the delicate and harrowing task of saying goodbye to his devoted housekeeper without letting her know that he was doing it  mrspetty he said trifling with a morsel of cheese it is useless to disguise from you that i may be going a journey and i feel that i shall not be able to part from all the care you have bestowed on me without recording in words my heartfelt appreciation of your devotion i shall miss it i shall miss it terribly if that is i am permitted to miss anything  mrs petty whose mind instantly ran to his bed socks answered dont you worry sir i wont forget them but wherever are you going now  ah said mr lavender subtly it is all in the air at present but now that the limetrees are beginning to smell a certain restlessness is upon me and you may see some change in my proceedings whatever happens to me however i commit my dear blink to your care feed her as if she were myself and love her as if she were joe for it is largely on food and affection that dogs depend for happiness  why good gracious sir said mrs petty you talk as if you were going for a month of sundays are you thinking of eastbourne  mr lavender sighed deeply at that word for the memory of a town where he had spent many happy days added to the gentle melancholy of his feelings on this last evening  as regards that i shall not inform you at present for indeed i am by no means certain what my destination will be largely speaking no pubpublic man he stammered doubtful whether he was any longer that knows where he will be going tomorrow sufficient unto the day are the intentions in his head  well sir said mrs petty frankly you cant go anywhere without joe or me thats flat  mr lavender smiled  dear mrs petty he murmured there are sacrifices one cannot demand even of the most faithful friends but he went on with calculated playfulness we need not consider that point until the day after tomorrow at least for i have much to do in the meantime  reassured by those words and the knowledge that mr lavenders plans seldom remained the same for more than two days mrs petty tossed her head slightly and went to the door well it is a mystery im sure she said  i should like to see joe said mr lavender with a lingering look at his devoted housekeeper  the beauty muttered mrs petty ill send him and withdrew  giving the morsel of cheese to blink who indeed had eaten practically the whole of this last meal mr lavender took the mooncat on his shoulder and abandoned himself for a moment to the caresses of his two favourites  blink he said in a voice which trembled slightly be good to this mooncat while i am away and if i am longer than you expect darling do not be unhappy perhaps some day you will rejoin me and even if we are not destined to meet again i would not in the fashion of cruel men wish to hinder your second marriage or to stand in the way of your happy forgetfulness of me be as lighthearted as you can my dear and wear no mourning for your master  so saying he flung his arms round her and embraced her warmly inhaling with the most poignant emotion her sheeplike odour he was still engaged with her when the door was opened and joe came in  joe said mr lavender resolutely sit down and light your pipe you will find a bottle of prewar port in the sideboard open it and drink my health indeed i myself will drink it too for it may give me courage we have been good friends joe he went on while joe was drawing the cork and have participated in pleasant and sharp adventures i have called you in at this moment which may some day seem to you rather solemn partly to shake your hand and partly to resume the discussion on public men which we held some days ago if you remember  ah said joe with his habitual insouciance when i told you that they give me the ump  yes what abaht it sir ave they been sayin anything particular vicious his face flying up just then with the cork which he was extracting encountered the expression on mr lavenders visage and he added dont take wot i say to eart sir try as you like youll never be a public man  those words which seemed to mr lavender to seal his doom caused a faint pink flush to invade his cheeks  no continued joe pouring out the wine you avent got the brass in times like these i dare say youve noticed sir that the times is favourable for bringing out the spots on the body politic eres ealth  joe said mr lavender raising the glass to his lips with solemnity i wish you a most happy and prosperous life let us drink to all those qualities which make you par excellence one of that great race the best hearted in the world which never thinks of tomorrow never knows when it is beaten and seldom loses its sense of humour  ah returned joe enigmatically halfclosing one of his greenish eyes and laying the glass to one side of his reddish nose then with a quick movement he swallowed its contents and refilled it before mr lavender had succeeded in absorbing more than a drop  i dont say he continued but what theres a class o public man thats got its uses like the little un that keeps us all alive or the perfect english gentleman what did his job and told nobody nothin abaht it you can ave confidence in a man like thatthats why es gone an retired es civilized you see the finished article but all this raw material this geton or getout lot thats come from oo knows where well i wish theyd stayed there with their tellyouhowtodoit and their ymns of ate  joe said mr lavender are you certain that therein does not speak the snob inherent in the national bosom are you not unconsciously paying deference to the word gentleman  why not sir replied joe tossing off his second glass itd be a fine thing for the country if we was all gentlemenstraight an a little bit stupid and ad alf a thought for others and he refilled his masters glass i dont measure a gentleman by is money or is title not even by is clothesi measure im by whether he can stand avin power in is ands without gettin unscrupled or swollen eaded an whether e can do what he thinks right without payin attention to clamour but mind you es got to ave right thoughts too and a feelin eart eres luck sir  mr lavender who absorbed in his chauffeurs sentiments had now drunk two glasses rose from his chair and clutching his hair said i will not conceal from you joe that i have always assumed every public man came up to that standard at least  crikey said joe ave you really sir my gawd got any use for the rest of this bottle  no joe no i shall never have use for a bottle again  in that case i might as well said joe pouring what remained into a tumbler and drinking it off is there any other topic youd like to mention if i can ave any influence on you i shall be very glad  thank you joe returned mr lavender what i have most need of at this moment is solitude and your good wishes and will you kindly take blink away and when she has had her run place her in my bedroom with the window closed goodnight joe call me late tomorrow morning  certainly sir goodnight sir  goodnight joe shake hands  when joe was gone accompanied by the unwilling blink turning her beautiful dark eyes back to the last mr lavender sat down at his bureau and drawing a sheet of paper to him wrote at the top of it     my last will and testament  it was a long time before he got further and then entirely omitted to leave anything in it completely preoccupied by the preamble which gradually ran as follows     i john lavender make known to all men by these presents that the    act which i contemplate is symbolical and must in no sense be taken    as implying either weariness of life or that surrender to misfortune    which is unbecoming to an english public gentleman over this    description of himself mr lavender was obliged to pause some time    hovering between the two designations and finally combining them as    the only way out of his difficulty long and painful experience    has convinced me that only by retiring from the former can i retain    the latter character and only by retiring from both can i point the    moral ever demanded by my countrymen conscious indeed that a    mere act of private resignation would have no significance to the    body politic nor any deflecting influence on the national life i    have chosen rather to disappear in blue flame so that every    englishman may take to heart my lesson and learn from my strange    fate how to be himself uninfluenced by the verbiage of others at    the same time with the utmost generosity i wish to acknowledge in    full my debt towards all those great writers and speakers on the war    who have exercised so intoxicating an influence on my mind here    followed an alphabetical list of names beginning with b and ending    with s     i wish to be dissociated firmly from the views of my chauffeur joe    petty and to go to my last account with an emphatic assertion that    my failure to become a perfect public gentleman is due to private    idiosyncrasies rather than to any conviction that it is impossible    or to anything but admiration of the great men i have mentioned if    anybody should wish to paint me after i am dead i desire that i may    be represented with my face turned towards the dawn for it is at    that moment so symptomatic of a deep adorationwhich i would scorn    to make the common property of gossiping tonguesthat i intend to    depart if there should be anything left of mewhich is less than    probable considering the inflammatory character of the material i    design for my pyrei would be obliged if without giving anybody    any trouble it could be buried in my garden with the usual    hampstead tablet                 john lavender            the public man who died for his              countrys good lived here     in conclusion i would say a word to that land i have loved and    served be not extreme distrust the words of others to    yourself be true as you are strong be gentle as you are brave be    modest beloved country farewell  having written that final sentence he struggled long with himself before he could lay down the pen but by this time the port he had drunk had begun to have its usual effect and he fell into a doze from which he was awakened five hours later by the beams of a full moon striking in on him  the hour has come he thought and opening the frenchwindow he went out on to the lawn where the dew lay white the freshness in the air the glamour of the moonlight and the fumes of the port combined to make him feel strangely rhumantic and if he had possessed a musical instrument he would very likely have begun to play on it he spent some moments tracking to and fro in the dew before he settled on the centre of the lawn as the most suitable spot for the act which he contemplated for thence he would be able to turn his last looks towards auroras bedroomwindow without interference from foliage having drawn a twelvefoot circle in the dew with his toe he proceeded in the bright moonlight to the necessary accumulation of his funeral pile conveying from his study book by book journal by journal pamphlet by pamphlet the hoarded treasures of the last four years and as he carefully placed each one building up at once a firm and cunning structure he gave a little groan thinking of the intoxications of the past and all the glorious thoughts embodied in that literature underneath in the heart of the pile he reserved a space for the most inflammable material which he selected from a special file of a special journal and round the circumference of the lofty and tapering mound he carefully deposited the two hundred and four war numbers of a certain weekly so that a ring of flame might lick well up the sides and permeate the more solid matter on which he would be sitting for two hours he worked in the waning moonlight till he had completed this weird and heroic erection and just before the dawn sat down by the light of the candle with which he meant to apply the finishing touch to compose that interview with himself whereby he intended to convey to the world the message of his act  i found him he began in the words of the interviewer sitting upon a journalistic pile of lovely leaves of thought which in the dawning of a new day glowed with a certain restrained flamboyance as though the passion stored within those exotic pages gave itself willingly to the eclaircissement of the situation and of his lineaments on which suffering had already set their stamp  i should like you i said approaching as near as i could for the sparks like little fireflies on a riviera evening were playing profoundly round my trousers i should like to hear from your own lips the reasons which have caused you to resign  certainly he replied with the courtesy which i have always found characteristic of him in moments which would try the suavity of more ordinary men and with the utmost calm and clarity he began to tell me the inner workings of his mind while the growing dawnlight irradiated his wasted and expressive features and the flames slowly roasted his left boot  yes he said quietly and his eyes turned inwards i have at last seen the problem clearly and seen it whole it is largely because of this that i have elected to seek the seclusion of another world what that world contains for me i know not though so many public men have tried to tell me but it has never been my way to recoil from the unknown and i am ready for my journey beyond the wide worlds end  i was greatly struck by the largehearted way in which he spoke those words and i interrupted him to ask whether he did not think that there was something fundamental in the british character which would leap as one man at such an act of daring sacrifice and great adventure  as regards that he replied fearlessly while in the light of the everbrightening dawn i could see the suspender on his right leg gradually charring so that he must already have been in great pain as regards that it is largely the proneness of the modern british to leap to verbal extremity which is inducing me to afford them this objectlesson in restraint and commonsense ouch  this momentary ejaculation seemed to escape him in spite of all his iron control and the smell of burning flesh brought home to me as nothing else perhaps could have done the tortures he must have been suffering  i feel he went on very gravely that extravagance of word and conduct is fatal to my country and having so profoundly experienced its effects upon myself i am now endeavouring by a shining example to supply a remedy for a disease which is corroding the vitals and impairing the sanity of my countrymen and making them a race of secondhand spiritual drunkards ouch  i confess that at this moment the tears started to my eyes for a more sublime show than the spectacle of this devoted man slowly roasting himself to death before my eyes for the good of his country i had seldom seen it had a strange an appalling interest and for nothing on earth could i have torn my gaze away i now realized to the full for the first time the willpower and heroism of the human species and i rejoiced with a glorious new feeling that i was of the same breed as this man made of such stern stuff that not even a tear rolled down his cheeks to quench the flames that leaped around him ever higher and higher and the dawn came up in the eastern sky and i knew that a great day was preparing for mankind and with my eyes fixed upon him as he turned blacker and blacker i let my heart loose in a great thanksgiving that i had lived to see this moment it was then that he cried out in a loud voice  i call aurora to witness that i have died without a falter grasping a burning spear to tilt at the malpractice which has sent me mad and i saw that he held in his fastconsuming hand a long roll of journals sharpened to a point of burning flame  aurora he cried again and with that enigmatic word on his lips was incinerated in the vast and towering belch of the devouring element  it was among the most inspiring sights i have ever witnessed  when mr lavender had completed that record whose actuality and wealth of moving detail had greatly affected him and marked it for the pressimmediate he felt very cold it was in fact that hour of dawn when a shiver goes through the world and almost with pleasurable anticipation he took up his lighted candle and stole shivering out to his pile rising ghostly to the height of some five feet in the middle of the dim lawn whereon a faint green tinge was coming with the return of daylight having reached it he walked round it twice and readjusted four volumes of the history of the war as steppingstones to the top then lowering the candle whose flame burned steadily in the stillness he knelt down in the grey dew and set fire to an article in a sunday paper then sighing deeply he returned to his little ladder and with some difficulty preserving his balance mounted to the top and sat down with his legs towards the house and his eyes fixed on auroras bedroomwindow he had been there perhaps ten minutes before he realized that nothing was happening below him and climbing down again proceeded to the aperture where he had inserted the burning print there by the now considerable daylight he saw that the flame had gone out at the words the stage is now set for the last act of this colossal world drama and convinced that providence had intended that heartening sentence to revive his somewhat drooping courage he thought i too shall be making history this morning and relighting the journal went on his hands and knees and began manfully to blow the flames  now the young lady in the adjoining castle who had got out of bed happened as she sometimes did to go to the window for a look at the sun rising over parliament hill attracted by the smell of burning paper she saw mr lavender in this act of blowing up the flames  what on earth is the poor dear doing now she thought this is really the limit and slipping on her slippers and blue dressinggown she ensconced herself behind the curtain to await developments  mr lavender had now backed away from the flames at which he had been blowing and remained on his hands and knees apparently assuring himself that they had really obtained hold he then rose and to her intense surprise began climbing up on to the pile she watched him at first with an amused astonishment so ludicrous was his light little figure crowned by stiveredup white hair and the expression of eager melancholy on his thin highcheekboned face upturned towards her window then to her dismay she saw that the flame had really caught and suddenly persuaded that he had some crazy intention of injuring himself with the view perhaps of attracting her attention she ran out of her room and down the stairs and emerging from the back door just as she was circled her garden so that she might enter mr lavenders garden from behind him ready for any eventuality she arrived within arms reach of him without his having heard her for blink whose anxious face as she watched her master wasting could be discerned at the bedroomwindow was whining and mr lavender himself had now broken into a strange and lamentable chantey which in combination with the creeping flutter of the flames in the weekly journals encircling the base of the funeral pyre wellnigh made her blood curdle  aurora sang mr lavender in that most dolorous voice       aurora my heart i bring      for i know well it will not burn      oh when the leaves puff out in spring      and when the leaves in autumn turn         think think of me      aurora i pass away      upon my horse of air i ride      here let my grizzled ashes stay      but take ah take my heart inside         aurora aurora  at this moment just as a fit of the most uncontrollable laughter was about to seize her she saw a flame which had just consumed the word horatio reach mr lavenders right calf  oh he cried out in desperate tones stretching up his arms to the sky now is my hour come sweetsky open and let me see her face behold behold her with the eyes of faith it is enough courage brother let me now consume in silence so saying he folded his arm tightly across his breast and closed his lips the flame rising to the bottom of the weekly which had indeed been upside down here nipped him vigorously so that with a wholly unconscious movement he threw up his little legs and losing his balance fell backwards into the arms of aurora watchfully outstretched to receive him uplifted there close to that soft blue bosom away from the reek of the flame he conceived that he was consumed and had passed already from his night of ghosts and shadows into the arms of the morning and through his swooning lips came forth the words  i am in paradise
