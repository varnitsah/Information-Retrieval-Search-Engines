frontispiece  several times she circled around high over the smiling pool  some folks call him alligator and some just gator  just tuck that fact away in that empty head of yours and never say cant  yes said he in a low voice i am mr quack  those were happy days indeed for mr and mrs quack in the pond of paddy the beaver    i  peter rabbit becomes acquainted with mrs quack   make a new acquaintance every time you can   youll find it interesting and a very helpful plan  it means more knowledge you cannot meet any one without learning something from him if you keep your ears open and your eyes open every one is at least a little different from every one else and the more people you know the more you may learn peter rabbit knows this and that is one reason he always is so eager to find out about other people he had left jimmy skunk and bobby coon in the green forest and had headed for the smiling pool to see if grandfather frog was awake yet he had no idea of meeting a stranger there and so you can imagine just how surprised he was when he got in sight of the smiling pool to see some one whom he never had seen before swimming about there he knew right away who it was he knew that it was mrs quack the duck because he had often heard about her and then too it was very clear from her looks that she was a cousin of the ducks he had seen in farmer browns dooryard the difference was that while they were big and white and stupidlooking mrs quack was smaller brown very trim and looked anything but stupid  peter was so surprised to see her in the smiling pool that he almost forgot to be polite i am afraid he stared in a very impolite way as he hurried to the edge of the bank i suppose said peter that you are mrs quack but i never expected to see you unless i should go over to the big river and that is a place i never have visited and hardly expect to because it is too far from the dear old briarpatch you are mrs quack arent you  yes replied mrs quack and you must be peter rabbit ive heard of you very often all the time mrs quack was swimming back and forth and in little circles in the most uneasy way  i hope youve heard nothing but good of me replied peter  mrs quack stopped her uneasy swimming for a minute and almost smiled as she looked at peter the worst i have heard is that you are very curious about other peoples affairs said she  peter looked a wee wee bit foolish and then he laughed right out i guess that is true enough said he i like to learn all i can and how can i learn without being curious im curious right now im wondering what brings you to the smiling pool when you never have been here before it is the last place in the world i ever expected to find you  thats why im here replied mrs quack i hope others feel the same way i came here because i just had to find some place where people wouldnt expect to find me and so wouldnt come looking for me little joe otter saw me yesterday on the big river and told me of this place and so because i just had to go somewhere i came here  peters eyes opened very wide with surprise why he exclaimed i should think you would be perfectly safe on the big river i dont see how any harm can possibly come to you out there  the words were no sooner out of peters mouth than a faint bang sounded from way off towards the big river mrs quack gave a great start and half lifted her wings as if to fly but she thought better of it and then peter saw that she was trembling all over  did you hear that she asked in a faint voice  peter nodded that was a gun a terrible gun but it was a long way from here said he  it was over on the big river said mrs quack thats why it isnt safe for me over there thats why i just had to find some other place oh dear the very sound of a gun sets me to shaking and makes my heart feel as if it would stop beating are you sure i am perfectly safe here  perfectly spoke up jerry muskrat who had been listening from the top of the big rock where he was lunching on a clam unless you are not smart enough to keep out of the clutches of reddy fox or old man coyote or hooty the owl or redtail the hawk  im not afraid of them declared mrs quack its those twolegged creatures with terrible guns im afraid of and she began to swim about more uneasily than ever     ii  mrs quack is distrustful   jerry muskrat thinks there is no place in the world like the smiling pool so for the matter of that does grandfather frog and also spotty the turtle you see they have spent their lives there and know little about the rest of the great world when mrs quack explained that all she feared was that a twolegged creature with a terrible gun might find her there jerry muskrat hastened to tell her that she had nothing to worry about on that account  no one hunts here now that farmer browns boy has put away his terrible gun explained jerry there was a time when he used to hunt here and set traps which are worse than terrible guns but that was long ago before he knew any better  who is farmer browns boy demanded mrs quack looking more anxious than ever is he one of those twolegged creatures  yes said peter rabbit who had been listening with all his ears but he is the best friend we quaddies have got he is such a good friend that he ought to be a quaddy himself why this last winter he fed some of us when food was scarce and he saved mrs grouse when she was caught in a snare which you know is a kind of trap he wont let any harm come to you here mrs quack  i wouldnt trust him not for one single little minute declared mrs quack  i wouldnt trust one of those twolegged creatures not one you say he fed some of you last winter but that doesnt mean anything good do you know what ive known these twolegged creatures to do  what demanded peter and jerry together  ive known them to scatter food where we ducks would be sure to find it and to take the greatest care that nothing should frighten us while we were eating and then after we had got in the habit of feeding in that particular place and had grown to feel perfectly safe there they have hidden close by until a lot of us were feeding together and then fired their terrible guns and killed a lot of my friends and dreadfully hurt a lot more i wouldnt trust one of them not one oh how dreadful cried peter looking quite as shocked as he felt then he added eagerly but our farmer browns boy wouldnt do anything like that you havent the least thing to fear from him  perhaps not said mrs quack shaking her head doubtfully but i wouldnt trust him i wouldnt trust him as far off as i could see him the smiling pool is a very nice place although it is dreadfully small but if farmer browns boy is likely to come over here i guess i better look for some other place though goodness knows where i will find one where i will feel perfectly safe  you are safe right here if you have sense enough to stay here declared jerry muskrat rather testily dont you suppose peter and i know what we are talking about  i wish i could believe so returned mrs quack sadly but if you had been through what ive been through and suffered what ive suffered you wouldnt believe any place safe and you certainly wouldnt trust one of those twolegged creatures why for weeks they havent given me a chance to get a square meal andandi dont know what has become of mr quack and im all alone there was a little sob in her voice and tears in her eyes  tell us all about it begged peter perhaps we can help you     iii  mrs quack tells about her home   its a long story said mrs quack shaking the tears from her eyes and i hardly know where to begin  begin at the beginning said jerry muskrat your home is somewhere way up in the northland where honker the goose lives isnt it  mrs quack nodded i wish i were there this very minute she replied the tears coming again but sometimes i doubt if ever ill get there again you folks who dont have to leave your homes every year dont know how well off you are or how much you have to be thankful for  i never could understand what people want to leave their homes for anyway declared peter  we dont leave because we want to but because we have to replied mrs quack and we go back just as soon as we can what would you do if you couldnt find a single thing to eat  i guess id starve replied peter simply  i guess you would and that is just what we would do if we didnt take the long journey south when jack frost freezes everything tight up there where my home is returned mrs quack he comes earlier up there and stays twice as long as he does here and makes ten times as much ice and snow we get most of our food in the water or in the mud under the water as of course you know and when the water is frozen there isnt a scrap of anything we can get to eat we just have to come south it isnt because we want to but because we must there is nothing else for us to do  then i dont see what you want to make your home in such a place for said practical peter i should think you would make it where you can live all the year around  i was born up there and i love it just as you love the dear old briarpatch replied mrs quack simply it is home and there is no place like home  besides it is a very beautiful and a very wonderful place in summer there is everything that ducks and geese love we have all we want of the food we love best everywhere is shallow water with tall grass growing in it  huh interrupted peter i wouldnt think much of a place like that thats because you dont know what is good snapped jerry muskrat it would suit me he added with shining eyes  there are the dearest little islands just made for safe nestingplaces continued mrs quack without heeding the interruptions and the days are long and it is easy to hide and there is nothing to fear for twolegged creatures with terrible guns never come there  if there is nothing to fear why do you care about places to hide demanded peter  well of course we have enemies just as you do here but they are natural enemiesfoxes and minks and hawks and owls explained mrs quack of course we have to watch out for them and have places where we can hide from them but it is our wits against their wits and it is our own fault if we get caught  that is perfectly fair so we dont mind that it is only men who are not fair  they dont know what fairness is  peter nodded that he understood and mrs quack went on last summer mr quack and i had our nest on the dearest little island and no one found it first we had twelve eggs and then twelve of the dearest babies you ever saw maybe said peter doubtfully thinking of his own babies  they grew so fast that by the time the cold weather came they were as big as their father and mother continued mrs quack and they were smart too they had learned how to take care of themselves just as well as i could i certainly was proud of that family but now i dont know where one of them is  mrs quack suddenly choked up with grief and peter rabbit politely turned his head away     iv  mrs quack continues her story   when mrs quack told of her twelve children and how she didnt know where one of them was peter rabbit and jerry muskrat knew just how badly she was feeling and they turned their heads away and pretended that they didnt see her tears  in a few minutes she bravely went on with her story  when jack frost came and we knew it was time to begin the long journey mr  quack and myself and our twelve children joined with some other duck families and with mr quack in the lead we started for our winter home which really isnt a home but just a place to stay for a while we had nothing much to fear  we would fly by day and at night rest in some quiet lake or pond or on some river with the great woods all about us or sometimes great marshes perhaps you dont know what marshes are if the green meadows here had little streams of water running every which way through them and the ground was all soft and muddy and full of water and the grass grew tall they would be marshes  jerry muskrats eyes sparkled i would like a place like that he exclaimed  you certainly would replied mrs quack we always find lots of your relatives in such places  marshes must be something like swamps ventured peter rabbit who had been thinking the matter over  very much the same only with grass and rushes in place of trees and bushes replied mrs quack there is plenty to eat and the loveliest hidingplaces in some of these we stayed days at a time in fact we stayed until jack frost came to drive us out then as we flew we began to see the homes of these terrible twolegged creatures called men and from that time on we never knew a minute of peace excepting when we were flying high in the air or far out over the water  if we could have just kept flying all the time or never had to go near the shore we would have been all right but we had to eat  of course said peter everybody has to eat  and we had to rest said mrs quack  certainly said peter everybody has to do that  and to eat we had to go in close to shore where the water was not at all deep because it is only in such places that we can get food continued mrs quack  it takes a lot of strength to fly as we fly and strength requires plenty of food mr quack knew all the best feedingplaces for he had made the long journey several times so every day he would lead the way to one of these he always chose the wildest and most lonely looking places he could find as far as possible from the homes of men but even then he was never careless he would lead us around back and forth over the place he had chosen and we would all look with all our might for signs of danger if we saw none we would drop down a little nearer and a little nearer but with all our watchfulness we never could be sure absolutely sure that all was safe sometimes those terrible twolegged creatures would be hiding in the very middle of the wildest most lonely looking marshes they would be covered with grass so that we couldnt see them  then as we flew over them would come the bang bang bang bang of terrible guns and always some of our flock would drop we would have to leave them behind for we knew if we wanted to live we must get beyond the reach of those terrible guns so we would fly our hardest it was awful just simply awful  mrs quack paused and shuddered and peter rabbit and jerry muskrat shuddered in sympathy  sometimes we would have to try three or four feedingplaces before we found one where there were no terrible guns and when we did find one we would be so tired and frightened that we couldnt enjoy our food and we didnt dare to sleep without some one on watch all the time it was like that every day the farther we got the worse it became our flock grew smaller and smaller those who escaped the terrible guns would be so frightened that they would forget to follow their leader and would fly in different directions and later perhaps join other flocks so it was that when at last we reached the place in the sunny southland for which we had started mr quack and i were alone what became of our twelve children i dont know i am afraid the terrible guns killed some i hope some joined other flocks and escaped but i dont know  i hope they did too said peter     v  peter learns more of mrs quacks troubles   it often happens when we know      the troubles that our friends pass through      our own seem very small indeed      youll always find that this is true  my you must have felt glad when you reached your winter home exclaimed peter rabbit when mrs quack finished the account of her long terrible journey from her summer home in the far northland to her winter home in the far southland  i did replied mrs quack but all the time i couldnt forget those to whom terrible things had happened on the way down and then too i kept dreading the long journey back  i dont see why you didnt stay right there i would have said peter nodding his head with an air of great wisdom  not if you were i replied mrs quack in the first place it isnt a proper place in which to bring up young ducks and make them strong and healthy in the second place there are more dangers down there for young ducks than up in the far northland in the third place there isnt room for all the ducks to nest properly and lastly there is a great longing for our real home which old mother nature has put in our hearts and which just makes us go we couldnt be happy if we didnt  is the journey back as bad as the journey down asked peter  worse very much worse replied mrs quack sadly you can see for yourself just how bad it is for here i am all alone tears filled mrs quacks eyes  it is almost too terrible to talk about she continued after a minute you see for one thing food isnt as plentiful as it is in the fall and we just have to go wherever it is to be found those twolegged creatures know where those feedinggrounds are just as well as we do and they hide there with their terrible guns just as they did when we were coming south but it is much worse now very much worse you see when we were going the other way if we found them at one place we could go on to another but when we are going north we cannot always do that we cannot go any faster than jack frost does sometimes we are driven out of a place by the bang bang of the terrible guns and go on only to find that we have caught up with jack frost and that the ponds and the rivers are still covered with ice then there is nothing to do but to turn back to where those terrible guns are waiting for us we just have to do it  mrs quack stopped and shivered it seems to me i have heard nothing but the noise of those terrible guns ever since we started said she i havent had a good square meal for days and days nor a good rest that is what makes me so dreadfully nervous sometimes when we had been driven from place to place until we had caught up with jack frost there would be nothing but ice excepting in small places in a river where the water runs too swiftly to freeze we would just have to drop into one of these to rest a little because we had flown so far that our wings ached as if they would drop off then just as we would think we were safe for a little while there would come the bang of a terrible gun  then we would have to fly again as long as we could and finally come back to the same place because there was no other place where we could go then we would have to do it all over again until night came sometimes i think that those men with terrible guns must hate us and want to kill every one of us if they didnt they would have a little bit of pity they simply havent any hearts at all  it does seem so agreed peter but wait until you know farmer browns boy  hes got a heart he added brightly  i dont want to know him retorted mrs quack if he comes near here youll see me leave in a hurry i wouldnt trust one of them not one minute you dont think he will come do you  peter sat up and looked across the green meadows and his heart sank hes coming now but im sure he wont hurt you mrs quack said he  but mrs quack wouldnt wait to see with a hasty promise to come back when the way was clear she jumped into the air and on swift wings disappeared towards the big river     vi  farmer browns boy visits the smiling pool   farmer browns boy had heard welcome robin singing in the old orchard quite as soon as peter rabbit had and that song of cheer up cheer up cheer up  cheer had awakened quite as much gladness in his heart as it had in peters heart it meant that mistress spring really had arrived and that over in the green forest and down on the green meadows there would soon be shy blue and just as shy white violets to look for and other flowers almost if not quite as sweet and lovely it meant that his feathered friends would soon be busy househunting and building it meant that his little friends in fur would also be doing something very similar if they had not already done so it meant that soon there would be a million lovely things to see and a million joyous sounds to hear  so the sound of welcome robins voice made the heart of farmer browns boy even more happy than it was before and as welcome robin just had to sing so farmer browns boy just had to whistle when his work was finished it seemed to farmer browns boy that something was calling him calling him to get out on the green meadows or over in the green forest and share in the happiness of all the little people there so presently he decided that he would go down to the smiling pool to find out how jerry muskrat was and if grandfather frog was awake yet and if the sweet singers of the smiling pool had begun their wonderful spring chorus  down the crooked little path cross the green meadows he tramped and as he drew near the smiling pool he stopped whistling lest the sound should frighten some of the little people there he was still some distance from the smiling pool when out of it sprang a big bird and on swift whistling wings flew away in the direction of the big river farmer browns boy stopped and watched until the bird had disappeared and on his face was a look of great surprise  as i live that was a duck he exclaimed that is the first time ive ever known a wild duck to be in the smiling pool i wonder what under the sun could have brought her over here  just then there was a distant bang in the direction of the big river farmer browns boy scowled and it made his face very angrylooking thats it he muttered hunters are shooting the ducks on their way north and have driven the poor things to look for any little mudhole where they can get a little rest  probably that duck has been shot at so many times on the big river that she felt safer over here in the smiling pool little as it is  farmer browns boy had guessed exactly right as you and i know and as peter rabbit and jerry muskrat knew its a shame a downright shame that any one should want to shoot birds on their way to their nestinggrounds and that the law should let them if they do want to some people havent any hearts theyre all stomachs i hope that fellow who shot just now over there on the big river didnt hit anything and i wish that gun of his might have kicked a little sense of what is right and fair into his head but of course it didnt  he grinned at the idea and then he continued his way towards the smiling pool  he hoped he might find another duck there and he approached the smiling pool very very carefully  but when he reached a point where he could see all over the smiling pool there was no one to be seen save jerry muskrat sitting on the big rock and peter rabbit on the bank on the other side farmer browns boy smiled when he saw them hello jerry muskrat said he i wonder how a bite of carrot would taste to you he felt in his pocket and brought out a couple of carrots one he put on a little tussock in the water where he knew jerry would find it the other he tossed across the smiling pool where he felt sure peter would find it  presently he noticed two or three feathers on the water close to the edge of the bank mrs quack had left them there i believe that was a mallard duck said he as he studied them i know what ill do ill go straight back home and get some wheat and corn and put it here on the edge of the smiling pool perhaps she will come back and find it  and this is just what farmer browns boy did     vii  mrs quack returns   peter rabbit just couldnt go back to the dear old briarpatch he just had to know if mrs quack would come back to the smiling pool he had seen farmer browns boy come there a second time and scatter wheat and corn among the brown stalks of last summers rushes and he had guessed why farmer browns boy had done this he had guessed that they had been put there especially for mrs quack and if she should come back as she had promised to do he wanted to be on hand when she found those good things to eat and hear what she would say  so peter stayed over near the smiling pool and hoped with all his might that reddy fox or old man coyote would not take it into his head to come hunting over there as luck would have it neither of them did and peter had a very pleasant time gossiping with jerry muskrat listening to the sweet voices of unseen singers in the smiling poolthe hylas which some people call peepersand eating the carrot which farmer browns boy had left for him  jolly round red mr sun was just getting ready to go to bed behind the purple hills when mrs quack returned the first peter knew of her coming was the whistle of her wings as she passed over him several times she circled around high over the smiling pool and peter simply stared in openmouthed admiration at the speed with which she flew it didnt seem possible that one so big could move through the air so fast twice she set her wings and seemed to just slide down almost to the surface of the smiling pool only to start her stout wings in motion once more and circle around again it was very clear that she was terribly nervous and suspicious the third time she landed in the water with a splash and sat perfectly still with her head stretched up looking and listening with all her might  its all right theres nothing to be afraid of said jerry muskrat  are you sure asked mrs quack anxiously ive been fooled too often by men with their terrible guns to ever feel absolutely sure that one isnt hiding and waiting to shoot me as she spoke she swam about nervously peter rabbit and i have been here ever since you left and i guess we ought to know replied jerry muskrat rather shortly there hasnt been anybody near here excepting farmer browns boy and we told you he wouldnt hurt you  he brought us each a carrot peter rabbit broke in eagerly  just the same i wouldnt trust him replied mrs quack where is he now  he left ever so long ago and he wont be back tonight declared peter confidently  i hope not said mrs quack with a sigh did you hear the bang of that terrible gun just after i left here  yes replied jerry muskrat was it fired at you  mrs quack nodded and held up one wing peter and jerry could see that one of the long feathers was missing i thought i was flying high enough to be safe said she but when i reached the big river there was a bang from the bushes on the bank and something cut that feather out of my wing and i felt a sharp pain in my side it made me feel quite ill for a while and the place is very sore now but i guess im lucky that it was no worse it is very hard work to know just how far those terrible guns can throw things at you next time i will fly higher  where have you been since you left us asked peter  eight in the middle of the big river replied mrs quack it was the only safe place i didnt dare go near either shore and im nearly starved i havent had a mouthful to eat today  peter opened his mouth to tell her of the wheat and corn left by farmer browns boy and then closed it again he would let her find it for herself if he told her about it she might suspect a trick and refuse to go near the place he never had seen any one so suspicious not even old man coyote but he couldnt blame her after all she had been through so he kept still and waited he was learning was peter rabbit he was learning a great deal about mrs quack     viii  mrs quack has a good meal and a rest   theres nothing like a stomach full      to make the heart feel light      to chase away the clouds of care      and make the world seem bright  thats a fact a full stomach makes the whole world seem different brighter better and more worth living in it is the hardest kind of hard work to be cheerful and see only the bright side of things when your stomach is empty but once fill that empty stomach and everything is changed it was just that way with mrs quack for days at a time she hadnt had a full stomach because of the hunters with their terrible guns and when just before dark that night she returned to the smiling pool her stomach was quite empty  i dont suppose ill find much to eat here but a little in peace and safety is better than a feast with worry and danger said she swimming over to the brown brokendown bulrushes on one side of the smiling pool and appearing to stand on her head as she plunged it under water and searched in the mud on the bottom for food peter rabbit looked over at jerry muskrat sitting on the big rock and jerry winked in a minute up bobbed the head of mrs quack and there was both a pleased and a worried look on her face she had found some of the corn left there by farmer browns boy at once she swam out to the middle of the smiling pool looking suspiciously this way and that way  there is corn over there said she do you know how it came there  i saw farmer browns boy throwing something over there replied peter didnt we tell you that he would be good to you  quack quack quack ive seen that kind of kindness too often to be fooled by it snapped mrs quack he probably saw me leave in a hurry and put this corn here hoping that i would come back and find it and make up my mind to stay here a while he thinks that if i do hell have a chance to hide near enough to shoot me i didnt believe this could be a safe place for me and now i know it  ill stay here tonight but tomorrow ill try to find some other place oh dear its dreadful not to have any place at all to feel safe in there were tears in her eyes  peter thought of the dear old briarpatch and how safe he always felt there and he felt a great pity for poor mrs quack who couldnt feel safe anywhere and then right away he grew indignant that she should be so distrustful of farmer browns boy though if he had stopped to think he would have remembered that once he was just as distrustful  i should think said peter with a great deal of dignity that you might at least believe what jerry muskrat and i who live here all the time tell you we ought to know farmer browns boy if any one does and we tell you that he wont harm a feather of you  he wont get the chance snapped mrs quack  jerry muskrat sniffed in disgust i dont doubt you have suffered a lot from men with terrible guns said he but you dont suppose peter and i have lived as long as we have without learning a little do you i wouldnt trust many of those twolegged creatures myself but farmer browns boy is different if all of them were like him we wouldnt have a thing to fear from them he has a heart yes indeed he has a heart now you take my advice and eat whatever he has put there for you be thankful and stop worrying peter and i will keep watch and warn you if there is any danger  i dont know as even this would have overcome mrs quacks fears if it hadnt been for the taste of that good corn in her mouth and her empty stomach she couldnt she just couldnt resist these and presently she was back among the rushes hunting out the corn and wheat as fast as ever she could when at last she could eat no more she felt so comfortable that somehow the smiling pool didnt seem such a dangerous place after all and she quite forgot farmer browns boy she found a snug hidingplace among the rushes too far out from the bank for reddy fox to surprise her and then with a sleepy good night to jerry and peter she tucked her head under her wing and soon was fast asleep  peter rabbit tiptoed away and then he hurried lippertylippertylip to the dear old briarpatch to tell mrs peter all about mrs quack     ix  peter rabbit makes an early call   peter rabbit was so full of interest in mrs quack and her troubles that he was back at the smiling pool before mr sun had kicked off his rosy blankets and begun his daily climb up in the blue blue sky you see he felt that he had heard only a part of mrs quacks story and he was dreadfully afraid that she would get away before he could hear the rest with the first bit of daylight mrs quack swam out from her hidingplace among the brown rushes it looked to peter as if she sat up on the end of her tail as she stretched her neck and wings just as far as she could and he wanted to laugh right out then she quickly ducked her head under water two or three times so that the water rolled down over her back and again peter wanted to laugh but he didnt he kept perfectly still mrs quack shook herself and then began to carefully dress her feathers that is she carefully put back in place every feather that had been rumpled up she took a great deal of time for this for mrs quack is very neat and tidy and takes the greatest pride in looking as fine as she can  of course it was very impolite of peter to watch her make her toilet but he didnt think of that he didnt mean to be impolite and then it was so interesting huh said he to himself i dont see what any one wants to waste so much time on their clothes for  you know peter doesnt waste any time on his clothes in fact he doesnt seem to care a bit how he looks he hasnt learned yet that it always pays to be as neat and clean as possible and that you must think well of yourself if you want others to think well of you  when at last mrs quack had taken a final shower bath and appeared satisfied that she was looking her best peter opened his mouth to ask her the questions he was so full of but closed it again as he remembered people are usually better natured when their stomachs are full and mrs quack had not yet breakfasted so he waited as patiently as he could which wasnt patiently at all at last mrs quack finished her breakfast and then she had to make her toilet all over again finally peter hopped to the edge of the bank where she would see him  good morning mrs quack said he very politely i hope you had a good rest and are feeling very well this morning  thank you replied mrs quack im feeling as well as could be expected in fact im feeling better than i have felt for some time in spite of the sore place made by that terrible gun yesterday you see i have had a good rest and two square meals and these are things i havent had since goodness knows when  this is a very nice place let me see what is it you call it  the smiling pool said peter  thats a good name for it returned mrs quack if only i could be sure that none of those hunters would find me here and if only mr quack were here i would be content to stay a while at the mention of mr quack the eyes of mrs  quack suddenly filled with tears peter felt tears of sympathy in his own eyes  where is mr quack he asked  i dont know sobbed mrs quack i wish i did i havent seen him since one of those terrible guns was fired at us over on the big river yesterday morning a little while before little joe otter told me about the smiling pool ever since we started for our home in the far north i have been fearing that something of this kind might happen i ought to be on my way there now but what is the use without mr quack without him i would be all alone up there and wouldnt have any home  wont you tell me all that has happened since you started on your long journey asked peter perhaps some of us can help you  im afraid you cant replied mrs quack sadly but ill tell you all about it so that you may know just how thankful you ought to feel that you do not have to suffer what some of us do     x  how mr and mrs quack started north   peter rabbit was eager to help mrs quack in her trouble though he hadnt the least idea how he could help and neither had she how any one who dislikes water as peter does could help one who lives on the water all the time was more than either one of them could see and yet without knowing it peter was helping mrs  quack he was giving her his sympathy and sympathy often helps others a great deal more than we even guess it sometimes is a very good plan to tell your troubles to some one who will listen with sympathy it was so with mrs quack  she had kept her troubles locked in her own heart so long that it did her good to pour them all out to peter  mr quack and i spent a very comfortable winter way down in the sunny southland said she with a faraway look it was very warm and nice down there and there were a great many other ducks spending the winter with us the place where we were was far from the homes of men and it was only once in a long while that we had to watch out for terrible guns of course we had to have our wits with us all the time because there are hawks and owls and minks down there just as there are up here but any duck who cant keep out of their way deserves to furnish one of them a dinner  then there was another fellow we had to watch out for a queer fellow whom we never see anywhere but down there it was never safe to swim too near an old log floating in the water or lying on the bank because it might suddenly open a great mouth and swallow one of us whole  whats that peter rabbit leaned forward and stared at mrs quack with his eyes popping right out whats that he repeated how can an old log have a mouth  mrs quack just had to smile peter was so in earnest and looked so astonished  of course said she no really truly log has a mouth or is alive but this queer fellow i was speaking of looks so much like an old log floating in the water unless you look at him very sharply that many a heedless young duck has discovered the difference when it was too late then too he will swim under water and come up underneath and seize you without any warning he has the biggest mouth ive ever seen with terriblelooking teeth and could swallow me whole  illustration with caption some folks call him alligator and some just gator  by this time peters eyes looked as if they would fall out of his head what is his name whispered peter  its old ally the gator replied mrs quack some folks call him alligator and some just gator but we call him old ally hes a very interesting old fellow some time perhaps ill tell you more about him mr quack and i kept out of his reach you may be sure we lived quietly and tried to get in as good condition as possible for the long journey back to our home in the north when it was time to start a lot of us got together just as we did when we came down from the north only this time the young ducks felt themselves quite grown up  in fact before we started there was a great deal of lovemaking and each one chose a mate that was a very happy time a very happy time indeed but it was a sad time too for us older ducks because we knew what dreadful things were likely to happen on the long journey it is hard enough to lose father or mother or brother or sister but it is worse to lose a dear mate  mrs quacks eyes suddenly filled with tears again oh dear she sobbed i wish i knew what became of mr quack  peter said nothing but looked the sympathy he felt presently mrs quack went on with her story we had a splendid big flock when we started made up wholly of pairs each pair dreaming of the home they would build when they reached the far north mr quack was the leader as usual and i flew right behind him we hadnt gone far before we began to hear the terrible guns and the farther we went the worse they got mr quack led us to the safest feeding and resting grounds he knew of and for a time our flock escaped the terrible guns but the farther we went the more guns there were mrs quack paused and peter waited     xi  the terrible terrible guns   bang bang bang not a feather spare       kill kill kill wound and rip and tear  that is what the terrible guns roar from morning to night at mrs quack and her friends as they fly on their long journey to their home in the far north i dont wonder that she was terribly uneasy and nervous as she sat in the smiling pool talking to peter rabbit do you  yes said she continuing her story of her long journey from the sunny southland where she had spent the winter the farther we got the more there were of those terrible guns it grew so bad that as well as mr quack knew the places where we could find food and no duck that ever flew knew them better he couldnt find one where we could feel perfectly sure that we were safe the very safestlooking places sometimes were the most dangerous if you saw a lot of rabbits playing together on the green meadows you would feel perfectly safe in joining them wouldnt you  peter nodded i certainly would said he if it was safe for them it certainly would be safe for me  well that is just the way we felt when we saw a lot of ducks swimming about on the edge of one of those feedingplaces we were tired for we had flown a long distance and we were hungry it was still and peaceful there and not a thing to be seen that looked the least bit like danger so we went straight in to join those ducks and then just as we set our wings to drop down on the water among them there was a terrible bang bang bang bang my heart almost stopped beating then how we did fly when we were far out over the water where we could see that nothing was near us we stopped to rest and there we found only half as many in our flock as there had been  where were the others asked peter although he guessed  killed or hurt by those terrible guns replied mrs quack sadly and that wasnt the worst of it i told you that when we started each of us had a mate  now we found that of those who had escaped four had lost their mates they were heartbroken when it came time for us to move on they wouldnt go they said that if they did reach the nestingplace in the far north they couldnt have nests or eggs or young because they had no mates so what was the use besides they hoped that if they waited around they might find their mates they thought they might not have been killed but just hurt and might be able to get away from those hunters so they left us and swam back towards that terrible place calling for their lost mates and it was the saddest sound i know now just how they felt for i have lost mr quack and thats why im here mrs quack drew a wing across her eyes to wipe away the tears  but what happened to those ducks that were swimming about there and made you think it was safe asked peter with a puzzled look on his face  nothing replied mrs quack they had been fastened out there in the water by the hunters so as to make us think it safe and the terrible guns were fired at us and not at them the hunters were hidden under grass and that is why we didnt see them  peter blinked his eyes rapidly as if he were having hard work to believe what he had been told why said be at last i never heard of anything so dreadfully unfair in all my life do you mean to tell me that those hunters actually made other ducks lead you into danger  thats just what i mean returned mrs quack those twolegged creatures dont know what fairness is why some of them have learned our language and actually call us in where they can shoot us just think of that they tell us in our own language that there is plenty to eat and all is safe so that we will think that other ducks are hidden and feeding there and then when we go to join them we are shot at you ought to be mighty thankful peter rabbit that you are not a duck  i am replied peter he knew that not one of the meadow and forest people who were always trying to catch him would do a thing like that  its all true said mrs quack and those hunters do other things just as unfair sometimes awful storms will come up and we just have to find places where we can rest those hunters will hide near those places and shoot at us when we are so tired that we can hardly move a wing it wouldnt be so bad if a hunter would be satisfied to kill just one duck just as reddy fox is but he seems to want to kill every duck foxes and hawks and owls catch a good many young ducks just as they do young rabbits but you know how we feel about that  they only hunt when they are hungry and they hunt fairly when they have got enough to make a dinner they stop they keep our wits sharp if we do not keep out of their way it is our own fault it is a kind of gamethe game of life i guess it is old mother natures way of keeping us wideawake and sharpening our wits and so making us better fitted to live  with these twolegged creatures with terrible guns it is all different we dont have any chance at all if they hunted us as reddy fox does tried to catch us themselves it would be different but their terrible guns kill when we are a long way off and there isnt any way for us to know of the danger and then when one of them does kill a duck he isnt satisfied but keeps on killing and killing and killing im sure one would make him a dinner if that is what he wants  and they often simply break the wings or otherwise terribly hurt the ones they shoot at and then leave them to suffer unable to take care of themselves oh dear im afraid that is what has happened to mr quack  once more poor mrs quack was quite overcome with her troubles and sorrows  peter wished with all his heart that he could do something to comfort her but of course he couldnt so he just sat still and waited until she could tell him just what did happen to mr quack     xii  what did happen to mr quack   when did you last see mr quack asked jerry muskrat who had been listening while mrs quack told peter rabbit about her terrible journey  early yesterday morning replied mrs quack the tears once more filling her eyes we had reached the big river over there just six of us out of the big flock that had started from the sunny southland how we got as far as that i dont know but we did and neither mr quack nor i had lost a feather from those terrible guns that had banged at us all the way up and that had killed so many of our friends  we were flying up the big river and everything seemed perfectly safe we were in a hurry and when we came to a bend in the big river we flew quite close to shore so as not to have to go way out and around that was where mr quack made a mistake even the smartest people will make mistakes sometimes you know  peter rabbit nodded i know said he ive made them myself and then he wondered why jerry muskrat laughed right out  yes continued mrs quack that is where mr quack made a mistake a great mistake i suppose that because not a single gun had been fired at us that morning he thought perhaps there were no hunters on the big river so to save time he led us close to shore and then it happened there was a bang bang of a terrible gun and down fell mr quack just as we had seen so many fall before  it was awful there was mr quack flying in front of me on swift strong wings and there never was a swifter stronger flier or a handsomer duck than mr  quack and then all in the wink of an eye he was tumbling helplessly down down to the water below and i was flying on alone for the other ducks turned off and i dont know what became of them i couldnt stop to see what became of mr  quack because if i had that terrible gun would have killed me so i kept on a little way and then turned and went back only i kept out in the middle of the big river i dropped down on the water and swam about calling and calling but i didnt get any answer and so i dont know what has become of mr quack i am afraid he was killed and if he was i wish i had been killed myself  here mrs quack choked up so that she couldnt say another word peters own eyes were full of tears as he tried to comfort her perhaps said he mr  quack wasnt killed and is hiding somewhere along the big river i dont know why i feel so but i feel sure that he wasnt killed and that you will find him yet  thats why ive waited instead of going on replied mrs quack between sobs though it wouldnt have been of any use to go on without my dear mate im going back to the big river now to look for him the trouble is i dont dare go near the shore and if he is alive he probably is hiding somewhere among the rushes along the banks i think ill be going along now but ill be back tonight if nothing happens to me you folks who can always stay at home have a great deal to be thankful for  its lucky for me that mrs peter wasnt here to hear her say that said peter as he and jerry muskrat watched mrs quack fly swiftly towards the big river mrs peter is forever worrying and scolding because i dont stay in the dear old briarpatch if she had heard mrs quack say that i never would have heard the last of it i wish there was something we could do for mrs quack im going back to the dear old briarpatch to think it over and i guess the sooner i start the better for that looks to me like reddy fox over there and hes headed this way  so off for home started peter lippertylippertylip as fast as he could go and all the way there he was turning over in his mind what mrs quack had told him and trying to think of some way to help her     xiii  peter tells about mrs quack   to get things done if youll but try      youll always find there is a way       what you yourself cant do alone      the chances are another may  when peter rabbit was once more safely back in the dear old briarpatch he told mrs peter all about poor mrs quack and her troubles then for a long long time he sat in a brown study a brown study you know is sitting perfectly still and thinking very hard that was what peter did he sat so still that if you had happened along you probably would have thought him asleep but he wasnt asleep no indeed he was just thinking and thinking he was trying to think of some way to help mrs quack at last he gave a little sigh of disappointment  illustration with caption just tuck that fact away in that empty head of yours and never say cant  it cant be done said he there isnt any way  what cant be done demanded a voice right over his head  peter looked up there sat sammy jay peter had been thinking so hard that he hadnt seen sammy arrive  what cant be done repeated sammy there isnt anything that cant be done  there are plenty of things that you cant do but what you cant do some one else can just tuck that fact away in that empty head of yours and never say cant you know sammy dearly loves to tease peter  peter made a goodnatured face at sammy which means i suppose that what i cant do you can you always did have a pretty good opinion of yourself sammy said he  nothing of the kind retorted sammy i simply mean that nobody can do everything and that very often two heads are better than one it struck me that you had something on your mind and i thought i might be able to help you get rid of it but of course if you dont want my help supposing i could and would give it to you that is an end of the matter and i guess ill be on my way the old briarpatch is rather a dull place anyway  peter started to make a sharp retort but thought better of it instead he replied mildly i was just trying to think of some way to help poor mrs  quack  help mrs quack exclaimed sammy in surprise where under the sun did you get acquainted with mrs quack whats the matter with her she always has looked to me quite able to help herself  well she isnt that is she needs others to help her just now replied peter and ive been most thinking my head off trying to find a way to help her then he told sammy how he had met mrs quack at the smiling pool and how terrible her long journey up from the sunny southland had been and how mr  quack had been shot by a hunter with a terrible gun and how poor mrs quack was quite heartbroken and how she had gone over to the big river to look for him but didnt dare go near the places where he might be hiding if he were still alive and hurt so that he couldnt fly and how cruel and terribly unfair were the men with terrible guns and all the other things he had learned from mrs  quack  sammy listened with his head cocked on one side and for once he didnt interrupt peter or try to tease him or make fun of him in fact as peter looked up at him he could see that sammy was very serious and thoughtful and that the more he heard of mrs quacks story the more thoughtful he looked when peter finished sammy flew down a little nearer to peter  i beg your pardon for saying your head is empty peter said he your heart is right anyway of course there isnt anything you can do to help mrs quack but as i told you in the beginning what you cant do others can now i dont say that i can help mrs quack but i can try i believe ill do a little thinking myself  so sammy jay in his turn went into a brown study and peter watched him anxiously and a little hopefully     xiv  sammy jays plan to help mrs quack   sammy jay sat on the lowest branch of a little tree in the dear old briarpatch just over peter rabbits head thinking as hard as ever he could peter watched him and wondered if sammy would be able to think of any plan for helping poor mrs quack he hoped so he himself had thought and thought until he felt as if his brains were all mixed up and he couldnt think any more so he watched sammy and waited and hoped  presently sammy flirted his wings in a way which peter knew meant that he had made up his mind did i understand you to say that mrs quack said that if mr  quack is alive he probably is hiding among the rushes along the banks of the big river he asked  peter nodded  and that she said that she doesnt dare go near the banks because of fear of the terrible guns  again peter nodded  well if thats the case what is the matter with some of us who are not afraid of the terrible guns looking for mr quack said sammy i will for one and im quite sure that my cousin blacky the crow will for another he surely will if he thinks it will spoil the plans of any hunters blacky would go a long distance to do that he hates terrible guns and the men who use them and he knows all about them he has very sharp eyes has blacky and he knows when a man has got a gun and when he hasnt more than that he can tell better than any one i know of just how near he can safely go to one of those terrible guns  he is smart my cousin blacky is and if he will help me look for mr quack well find him if he is alive  that will be splendid cried peter clapping his hands but arent you afraid of those terrible guns sammy  not when the hunters are trying for ducks replied sammy if there is a duck anywhere in sight they wont shoot at poor little me or even at blacky though they would shoot at him any other time you see they know that shooting at us would frighten the ducks blacky knows all about the big river in the winter he often gets considerable of his food along its banks ive been over there a number of times but i dont know so much about it as he does now here is my plan ill go find blacky and tell him all about what we want to do for mrs  quack then when mrs quack comes back to the smiling pool if she hasnt found mr quack well tell her what we are going to do and what she must do she must swim right up the big river keeping out in the middle where she will be safe if there are any hunters hiding along the bank they will see her and then they wont shoot at blacky or me because they will keep hoping that mrs quack will swim in near enough for them to shoot her blacky will fly along over one bank of the big river and i will do the same over the other bank keeping as nearly opposite mrs quack as we can being up in the air that way and looking down we will be able to see the hunters and also mr quack if he is hiding among the rushes are you quite sure that mrs quack will come back to the smiling pool tonight  she said she would replied peter last night she came just a little while before dark and i think she will do the same thing tonight to see if any more corn has been left for her you know farmer browns boy put some there yesterday and it tasted so good to her that i dont believe she will be able to stay away even if she wants to i think your plan is perfectly splendid sammy jay i do hope blacky the crow will help  he will dont worry about that replied sammy hello there goes farmer browns boy over to the smiling pool now  then there will be some more corn for mrs quack i just know it cried peter  he is going to see if mrs quack is there and i just know he has his pockets full of corn  i wouldnt mind a little of it myself said sammy well i must go along to hunt up blacky goodby peter goodby and good luck replied peter ive always said you are not half such a bad fellow as you try to make folks think you are sammy jay  thanks said sammy and started for the green forest to look for his cousin blacky the crow     xv  the hunt for mr quack   in spite of her hopelessness in regard to mr quack there is no doubt that mrs  quack felt better that night after she had eaten the corn left among the rushes of the smiling pool by farmer browns boy now she had that very comfortable feeling that goes with a full stomach she could think better as the black shadows crept across the smiling pool she turned over in her mind sammy jays plan for helping her the next day the more she thought about it the better it seemed and she began to feel a little ashamed that she had not appeared more grateful to sammy when he told her at the time she had been tired and hungry and discouraged now she was beginning to feel rested and she was no longer hungry these things made all the difference in the world as she thought over sammys plan she began to feel a little hope and when at last she put her head under her wing to go to sleep she had made up her mind that the plan was worth trying and that she would do her part  bright and early the next morning sammy jay and blacky the crow were in the big hickorytree near the smiling pool ready to start for the big river to hunt for mr quack peter rabbit had been so afraid that he would miss something that he had stayed near the smiling pool all night so he was on hand to see the start  it had been agreed that mrs quack was to go to a certain place on the big river and then swim up as far as she thought it would be of any use she was to stay in the middle of the river where she would be quite safe from hunters with terrible guns and where also these same hunters would be sure to see her and so not be tempted to shoot at blacky the crow if he happened to fly over them you see they would hope that mrs quack would swim in near enough to be shot and so would not risk frightening her by shooting at blacky  when mrs quack had finished her breakfast she started for the big river and her stout wings moved so swiftly that they made a whistling sound sammy jay and blacky the crow followed her but though they flew as fast as they could mrs  quack had reached the big river before they had gone half the way when they did get there they saw mrs quack out in the middle swimming about and watching for them blacky flew across the river and pretended to be hunting for food along the farther bank just as every hunter knows he often does sammy jay did the same thing on the other bank  mrs quack swam slowly up the big river keeping in the middle and blacky and sammy followed along up the two banks all the time using their sharp eyes for all they were worth to find mr quack hiding among the brokendown rushes or under the bushes in the water for the big river had overflowed its banks and in some places bushes and trees were in the water  now sammy jay dearly loves to hunt for things whenever he knows that one of his neighbors in the green forest has hidden something he likes to hunt for it it isnt so much that he wants what has been hidden as it is that he wants to feel he is smart enough to find it when he does find it he usually steals it im sorry to say but it is the fun of hunting that sammy enjoys most so now sammy thoroughly enjoyed hunting for mr quack he peered into every likely hidingplace and became so interested that he quite forgot about the hunters who might be waiting along the bank  so it happened that he didnt see a boat drawn in among the bushes until he was right over it sitting in it was a man with a terrible gun very intently watching mrs quack out in the middle of the big river sammy was so startled that before he thought he opened his mouth and screamed thief thief thief at the top of his lungs and flew away with all his might mrs quack heard his scream and understood just what it meant  a little later blacky the crow discovered another hunter hiding behind the bushes on his side caw caw caw shouted blacky flying out over the water far enough to be safe from that terrible gun he could see  quack quack replied mrs quack which meant that she understood and so the hunt went on without a sign of poor mr quack     xvi  sammy jay sees something green   for all their peeking and peering among the brokendown rushes and under the bushes along the banks of the big river and no sharper eyes ever peeked and peered sammy jay and blacky the crow had found no sign of the missing mr  quack  i guess mrs quack was right and that mr quack was killed when he was shot muttered sammy to himself probably one of those hunters had him for dinner long ago hello theres another hunter up where the laughing brook joins the big river i guess i wont take any chances id like to find mr quack but sammy jay is a lot more important to me than mr quack and that fellow just might happen to take it into his head to shoot at me  so sammy silently flew around back of the hunter and stopped in a tree where he could watch all that the man did for some time sammy sat there watching the hunter was sitting behind a sort of fence of bushes which quite hid him from any one who might happen to be out on the big river but of course sammy could see him perfectly because he was behind him out in front of that little fence which was on the very edge of the water were a number of what sammy at first took to be some of mrs quacks relatives why doesnt he shoot them thought sammy he puzzled over this as he watched them until suddenly it came into his head that he hadnt seen one of them move since he began watching them the man changed his position and still those ducks didnt move although some of them were so near that they simply couldnt have helped knowing when the hunter moved unless they were more stupid than any one of sammys acquaintance  this was very curious very curious indeed sammy flew a little nearer and then a little nearer taking the greatest care not to make a sound pretty soon he was so near that he could see those ducks very plainly and he stared with all his might he couldnt see any feathers no sir he couldnt see any feathers  then he understood  huh said he to himself those are not ducks at all they are just pieces of wood made to look like ducks now i wonder what they are for  in a few minutes he found out he saw the hunter crouch down a little lower and look down the big river sammy looked too he saw a flock of real ducks flying swiftly just above the middle of the big river suddenly the leader turned straight towards the place where the hunter was hiding and the others followed him he could hear mrs quack calling excitedly out in the middle of the big river but the strangers did not heed her they had their eyes on those wooden ducks and were coming straight in to join them  they think they are real ducks and so this place is perfectly safe thought sammy he saw the hunter make ready to shoot with his terrible gun and then without stopping to think what might happen to him he opened his mouth and screamed at the top of his voice he saw the ducks suddenly swing out towards the middle of the big river and knew that they had heard his warning he saw the hunter suddenly rise and point his gun at the flying ducks he heard the bang bang of the terrible gun but not one of the flock was hit the distance was too great sammy chuckled happily then he remembered that he himself was within easy reach of that terrible gun and probably the hunter was very angry in great fright sammy turned and flew dodging behind trees and every second expecting to hear again the roar of that terrible gun  but he didnt and so when he thought he was safe he stopped now in flying away from the hunter he had followed the laughing brook where it winds through a sort of swamp before it joins the big river because there was more water than could be kept between the banks of the big river it had crept over the banks and all the trees of the swamp were standing in water just beyond where sammy was sitting was a pile of brush in the water a jolly little sunbeam dancing down through the tree tops touched something under the edge of the brush and sammys sharp eyes caught a flash of green idly he watched it and presently it moved instantly sammy was all curiosity he flew over where he could see better  now what can that be thought sammy as he peered down at the pile of brush and tried to see under it     xvii  mr quack is found at last   sammy jays eyes sparkled as he watched that spot of green under the pile of brush in the swamp through which the laughing brook finds its way to join the big river all around was water for you know it was spring and the melting snows on the hills way up where the big river has its beginning were pouring more water into the big river than its banks would hold as it hurried down to the great ocean it just couldnt hurry fast enough to take all that water down as fast as it ran into the big river and so the water had crept over the banks in places it had done this right here in the little swamp where sammy was  sammy sat perfectly still for he learned long ago that only by keeping perfectly still may one see all that is to be seen that green spot had moved  he was sure of that and if it moved it must be something alive if it were alive it must be somebody and sammy wanted to know who it was try as he would he couldnt remember any one who wore such glossy green as that so he sat perfectly still for he knew that if whoever was hiding under that brush should even guess that he was being watched he would not come out  so his eyes sparkling with excitement sammy watched he was impatiently patient did you know that it is possible to be impatiently patient well it is sammy was just boiling with impatience inside but he didnt let that impatience spoil the patience of his waiting he sat there just as still as still with his eyes fixed on that green spot and you would never have guessed that he was fairly bursting with impatience to know who it was he was watching  that is what is called selfcontrol it means the power to make yourself do a certain thing no matter how much you may want to do something else it is a splendid thing to have is selfcontrol  after what seemed to sammy a very long time the green spot moved again little by little something reached out from under the pile of brush it was a head a very beautiful green head and it was exactly like mrs quacks head only hers was a sober brown instead of green sammy choked back a little gasp of surprise as a sudden thought popped into his head could this be the lost mr quack he had forgotten that probably mr quack dressed differently from mrs quack and so of course he had been looking for some one all in brown there was the bang of a gun somewhere over on the big river and the green head was hastily withdrawn under the bush but not before sammy had seen a look of terrible fear in his eyes i believe it is mr quack thought sammy if it is ill have the best news ever to tell mrs quack just trust sammy jay to find anything he goes looking for  this was just plain boasting and sammy knew it but sammy always does have a good opinion of himself it is one of his faults he quite lost sight of the fact that it was entirely by accident that he had come over to this swamp now that he had guessed who this might be he was less impatient he waited as still as you please and at last the green head was slowly stretched out again and sammy could see that the neck was green too and that around the neck was a white collar sammy could keep still no longer  illustration with caption yes said he in a low voice i am mr quack  are you mr quack he asked eagerly  the beautiful head disappeared like a flash sammy waited a minute or two before he repeated his question adding you neednt be afraid there isnt anybody here but me and im your friend i just want to know if you are mr  quack because ive been looking for you for mrs quack are you  slowly looking this way and that way with fear and suspicion in his eyes a handsome duck came out from under the pile of brush yes said he in a low voice i am mr quack where is mrs quack  safe and sound over on the big river replied sammy joyfully oh im so glad ive found you     xviii  sammy jay sends mrs quack to the swamp   when sammy jay left mr quack in the swamp over by the bank of the big river he flew straight back to the smiling pool at first he thought of flying out over the big river and screaming the news to mrs quack who you know was swimming about out there but he knew that if he did she would very likely fly right over where mr quack was and that wouldnt do at all no indeed that wouldnt do at all one of the hunters would be sure to see her so sammy wisely flew back to the smiling pool to wait until mrs quack should come back there for the night  of course he told peter rabbit all about mr quack and peter was so delighted at the thought that mr quack was alive that he capered about in quite the craziest way does mrs quack know yet asked peter  sammy shook his head im going to tell her when she comes back here tonight he explained i was afraid if i told her before then she would fly straight to him and perhaps get them both in trouble  quite right sammy quite right peter exclaimed i wouldnt have thought of that my wont she be happy when you do tell her i wonder what shell say and what shell do im going to stay right here so as to see her when she hears the good news here comes your cousin blacky the crow does he know yet  no replied sammy but im going to tell him as soon as he gets here they watched blacky draw nearer and nearer and as soon as he was within hearing sammy shouted the news caw caw caw replied blacky hurrying a little faster  as soon as he reached the big hickorytree sammy told the whole story over again and blacky was quite as glad as the others while they waited for mrs  quack he told how he had hunted and hunted along the farther bank of the big river and how he had seen the hunters with their terrible guns hiding and had warned mrs quack just where each one was  jolly round red mr sun was getting ready to go to bed behind the purple hills and the black shadows were beginning to creep out over the green meadows before mrs quack came in fact sammy jay and blacky were getting very uneasy it was almost bedtime for them for neither of them dared stay out after dark they had almost made up their minds to leave peter to tell the news when they saw mrs quack coming swiftly from the direction of the big river she looked so sad and discouraged that even blacky the crow was sorry for her and you know blacky isnt much given to such feelings  whats the news mrs quack asked peter his eyes dancing  there isnt any replied mrs quack  oh yes there is cried sammy jay who couldnt possibly keep still any longer  what is it demanded mrs quack eagerly and it seemed to peter that there was a wee bit of hope in her voice  did you happen to notice that just before the laughing brook joins the big river it flows through a little swamp asked sammy  mrs quack nodded her head rapidly what of it she demanded  nothing much only if i were you i would go down there after dark replied sammy  mrs quack looked up at sammy sharply why should i go down there she asked  if i tell you will you wait until i get quite through asked sammy in his turn  mrs quack promised that she would  well then replied sammy this afternoon i found a stranger hiding in there a stranger with a beautiful green head and neck and a white collar  mr quack oh it was mr quack cried mrs quack joyfully and lifted her wings as if she would start for the swamp at once  stop cried sammy sharply you said you would wait until i am through it wont do for you to go there until after dark because there is a hunter hiding very near mr quacks hidingplace wait until it is dark and he has gone home  then take my advice and when you have found mr quack bring him right up here to the smiling pool he cant fly but he can swim up the laughing brook and this is the safest place for both of you now good night and good luck     xix  jerry muskrats great idea   a friendly friend is a friend indeed      when he proves a friend in the time of need  mr and mrs quack had been so much taken up with each other and with their troubles that they had quite forgotten they were not alone in the smiling pool which they had reached by swimming up the laughing brook so it happened that when mrs quack suggested that if mr quacks wing got strong they might be able to find a lonesome pond not too far away where they could make their home for the summer they were a little startled to hear a voice say i know where there is one and you will not have to fly at all to get to it both jumped a little  you see their nerves had been very much upset for a long time and the least unexpected thing made them jump then both laughed  hello jerry muskrat wed forgotten all about you said mrs quack what was that you said  jerry goodnaturedly repeated what he had said mrs quacks face brightened  do you really mean it she asked eagerly do you really mean that you know of a pond where we could live and not be likely to be seen by these twolegged creatures called men  thats what i said replied jerry briefly  oh jerry youre not joking are you tell me youre not joking begged mrs  quack  of course im not joking returned jerry just a little bit indignantly i am not the kind of a fellow to joke people who are in such trouble as you and mr  quack seem to be in the idea came to me while you were talking i couldnt help overhearing what you were saying and the minute you mentioned a lonesome pond the idea came to me and i think its a perfectly splendid idea i know of just the lonesomest kind of a lonesome pond and you wont have to fly a stroke to get to it if you are smart enough not to be caught by reddy fox or hooty the owl or billy mink or any of those people who hunt for a living there isnt any reason i know of why you shouldnt spend the summer there in peace and comfort  mrs quacks eyes fairly shone with hope and eagerness oh jerry tell us where it is and well start for it right away she cried  jerrys eyes twinkled of course the owner of that pond might not like to have neighbors i hadnt thought of that said he perhaps he ought to be asked first  mrs quacks face fell who is the owner she asked  my cousin paddy the beaver he made it replied jerry proudly  mrs quacks face lighted up again at once im sure he wont object said she we know a great many of the beaver family in fact they are very good neighbors of ours in our home in the far northland i didnt suppose there was a beaver pond anywhere around here tell me where it is jerry and ill go right up there and call on your cousin  all youve got to do is to follow the laughing brook way back into the green forest and youll come to paddys pond said he he made that pond himself two years ago he came down from the great woods and built a dam across the laughing brook way back there in the green forest and gave us a great scare here in the smiling pool by cutting off the water for a few days he has got a very nice pond there now honker the goose and his flock spent a night in it on their way south last fall  mrs quack waited to hear no more she shot up into the air and disappeared over the tops of the trees in the green forest  what do you think of my idea asked jerry as he and mr quack watched her out of sight  i think it is great just simply great replied mr quack     xx  happy days for mr and mrs quack   whose heart is true and brave and strong      who neer gives up to grim despair      will find some day that skies are blue      and all the world is bright and fair  if you dont believe it just ask mr and mrs quack they know certainly the world never looked darker for any one than it did for them when the terrible gun of a hunter broke mr quacks wing on the big river and ended all their dreams of a home in the far northland then through the help of jerry muskrat they found the lonely pond of paddy the beaver deep in the green forest and there because their secret had been well kept presently they found peace and hope and then happiness you see the heart of mrs quack was true and brave and strong  she was the kind to make the best of things and she at once decided that if they couldnt have their home where they wanted it they would have it where they could have it she was determined that they should have a home anyway and paddy the beavers little pond was not such a bad place after all  so she wasted no time she examined every inch of the shore of that little pond  at last a little back from the water she found a place to suit her a place so well hidden by bushes that only the sharpest eyes ever would find it and a little later it would be still harder to find as she well knew for all about clumps of tall ferns were springing up and when they had fully unfolded not even the keen eyes of sammy jay looking down from a nearby tree would be able to discover her secret there she made a nest on the ground a nest of dried grass and leaves and lined it with the softest and most beautiful of linings down plucked from her own breast in it she laid ten eggs then came long weeks of patient sitting on them watching the wonder of growing things about her the bursting into bloom of shy wood flowers the unfolding of leaves on bush and tree the springing up in a night of queer mushrooms which people call toadstools and all the time dreaming beautiful duck dreams of the babies which would one day hatch from those precious eggs she never left them save to get a little food and just enough exercise to keep her well and strong and when she did leave them she always carefully pulled soft down over them to keep them warm while she was away  mr quack knew all about that nest though he had taken no part in building it and had no share in the care of those eggs he was very willing that she should do all the work and thought it quite sufficient that he should be on guard to give warning if danger should appear so he spent the long beautiful days lazily swimming about in the little pond gossiping with paddy the beaver and taking the best of care of himself the broken wing healed and grew strong again for it had not been so badly broken after all if he missed the company of others of his kind which he would have had during these long days of waiting had they been able to reach their usual nestingplace in the far northland he never mentioned it  unknown to them farmer browns boy discovered where they were later he came often to the pond and was content to sit quietly on the shore and watch mr  quack so that mr quack grew quite used to him and did not fear him at all in fact after the first few times he made no attempt to hide you see he discovered that farmer browns boy was a friend always after he had left there was something good to eat near where he had been sitting for farmer browns boy brought corn and oats and sometimes a handful of wheat  he knew and mr quack knew that he knew that somewhere near was a nest but he did not try to find it much as he longed to for he knew that would frighten and worry mrs quack so the dear precious secret of mr and mrs quack was kept for not even paddy the beaver knew just where that nest was and in due time early one morning mrs quack proudly led forth for their first swim ten downy funny ducklings  illustration with caption those were happy days indeed for mr and mrs quack in the pond of paddy the beaver  oh those were happy days indeed for mr and mrs quack in the pond of paddy the beaver and in their joy they quite forgot for a time the terrible journey which had brought them there but finally the ducklings grew up and when jack frost came in the fall the whole family started on the long journey to the sunny southland i hope they got there safely dont you  among those whom mr and mrs quack came to know very well while they lived in the pond of paddy the beaver was that funny fellow who wears rings on his tailbobby coon in the next book i will tell you of some of bobbys adventures  the end
