66024494	the valley of fear  by sir arthur conan doyle     part 1the tragedy of birlstone     chapter 1the warning    i am inclined to think said i  i should do so sherlock holmes remarked impatiently  i believe that i am one of the most longsuffering of mortals but ill admit that i was annoyed at the sardonic interruption really holmes said i severely you are a little trying at times  he was too much absorbed with his own thoughts to give any immediate answer to my remonstrance he leaned upon his hand with his untasted breakfast before him and he stared at the slip of paper which he had just drawn from its envelope then he took the envelope itself held it up to the light and very carefully studied both the exterior and the flap  it is porlocks writing said he thoughtfully i can hardly doubt that it is porlocks writing though i have seen it only twice before the greek e with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive but if it is porlock then it must be something of the very first importance  he was speaking to himself rather than to me but my vexation disappeared in the interest which the words awakened  who then is porlock i asked  porlock watson is a nomdeplume a mere identification mark but behind it lies a shifty and evasive personality in a former letter he frankly informed me that the name was not his own and defied me ever to trace him among the teeming millions of this great city porlock is important not for himself but for the great man with whom he is in touch picture to yourself the pilot fish with the shark the jackal with the lionanything that is insignificant in companionship with what is formidable not only formidable watson but sinisterin the highest degree sinister that is where he comes within my purview you have heard me speak of professor moriarty  the famous scientific criminal as famous among crooks as  my blushes watson holmes murmured in a deprecating voice  i was about to say as he is unknown to the public  a touch a distinct touch cried holmes you are developing a certain unexpected vein of pawky humour watson against which i must learn to guard myself but in calling moriarty a criminal you are uttering libel in the eyes of the lawand there lie the glory and the wonder of it the greatest schemer of all time the organizer of every deviltry the controlling brain of the underworld a brain which might have made or marred the destiny of nationsthats the man but so aloof is he from general suspicion so immune from criticism so admirable in his management and selfeffacement that for those very words that you have uttered he could hale you to a court and emerge with your years pension as a solatium for his wounded character is he not the celebrated author of the dynamics of an asteroid a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing it is this a man to traduce foulmouthed doctor and slandered professorsuch would be your respective roles thats genius watson but if i am spared by lesser men our day will surely come  may i be there to see i exclaimed devoutly but you were speaking of this man porlock  ah yesthe socalled porlock is a link in the chain some little way from its great attachment porlock is not quite a sound linkbetween ourselves he is the only flaw in that chain so far as i have been able to test it  but no chain is stronger than its weakest link  exactly my dear watson hence the extreme importance of porlock led on by some rudimentary aspirations towards right and encouraged by the judicious stimulation of an occasional tenpound note sent to him by devious methods he has once or twice given me advance information which has been of valuethat highest value which anticipates and prevents rather than avenges crime i cannot doubt that if we had the cipher we should find that this communication is of the nature that i indicate  again holmes flattened out the paper upon his unused plate i rose and leaning over him stared down at the curious inscription which ran as follows  534 c2 13 127 36 31 4 17 21 41 douglas 109 293 5 37 birlstone 26 birlstone 9 47 171  what do you make of it holmes  it is obviously an attempt to convey secret information  but what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher  in this instance none at all  why do you say in this instance  because there are many ciphers which i would read as easily as i do the apocrypha of the agony column such crude devices amuse the intelligence without fatiguing it but this is different it is clearly a reference to the words in a page of some book until i am told which page and which book i am powerless  but why douglas and birlstone  clearly because those are words which were not contained in the page in question  then why has he not indicated the book  your native shrewdness my dear watson that innate cunning which is the delight of your friends would surely prevent you from inclosing cipher and message in the same envelope should it miscarry you are undone as it is both have to go wrong before any harm comes from it our second post is now overdue and i shall be surprised if it does not bring us either a further letter of explanation or as is more probable the very volume to which these figures refer  holmess calculation was fulfilled within a very few minutes by the appearance of billy the page with the very letter which we were expecting  the same writing remarked holmes as he opened the envelope and actually signed he added in an exultant voice as he unfolded the epistle come we are getting on watson his brow clouded however as he glanced over the contents  dear me this is very disappointing i fear watson that all our expectations come to nothing i trust that the man porlock will come to no harm  dear mr holmes he says  i will go no further in this matter it is too dangeroushe suspects me i can see that he suspects me he came to me quite unexpectedly after i had actually addressed this envelope with the intention of sending you the key to the cipher i was able to cover it up if he had seen it it would have gone hard with me but i read suspicion in his eyes please burn the cipher message which can now be of no use to you  fred porlock  holmes sat for some little time twisting this letter between his fingers and frowning as he stared into the fire  after all he said at last there may be nothing in it it may be only his guilty conscience knowing himself to be a traitor he may have read the accusation in the others eyes  the other being i presume professor moriarty  no less when any of that party talk about he you know whom they mean there is one predominant he for all of them  but what can he do  hum thats a large question when you have one of the first brains of europe up against you and all the powers of darkness at his back there are infinite possibilities anyhow friend porlock is evidently scared out of his senseskindly compare the writing in the note to that upon its envelope which was done he tells us before this illomened visit the one is clear and firm the other hardly legible  why did he write at all why did he not simply drop it  because he feared i would make some inquiry after him in that case and possibly bring trouble on him  no doubt said i of course i had picked up the original cipher message and was bending my brows over it its pretty maddening to think that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper and that it is beyond human power to penetrate it  sherlock holmes had pushed away his untasted breakfast and lit the unsavoury pipe which was the companion of his deepest meditations i wonder said he leaning back and staring at the ceiling perhaps there are points which have escaped your machiavellian intellect let us consider the problem in the light of pure reason this mans reference is to a book that is our point of departure  a somewhat vague one  let us see then if we can narrow it down as i focus my mind upon it it seems rather less impenetrable what indications have we as to this book  none  well well it is surely not quite so bad as that the cipher message begins with a large 534 does it not we may take it as a working hypothesis that 534 is the particular page to which the cipher refers so our book has already become a large book which is surely something gained what other indications have we as to the nature of this large book the next sign is c2 what do you make of that watson  chapter the second no doubt  hardly that watson you will i am sure agree with me that if the page be given the number of the chapter is immaterial also that if page 534 finds us only in the second chapter the length of the first one must have been really intolerable  column i cried  brilliant watson you are scintillating this morning if it is not column then i am very much deceived so now you see we begin to visualize a large book printed in double columns which are each of a considerable length since one of the words is numbered in the document as the two hundred and ninetythird have we reached the limits of what reason can supply  i fear that we have  surely you do yourself an injustice one more coruscation my dear watsonyet another brainwave had the volume been an unusual one he would have sent it to me instead of that he had intended before his plans were nipped to send me the clue in this envelope he says so in his note this would seem to indicate that the book is one which he thought i would have no difficulty in finding for myself he had itand he imagined that i would have it too in short watson it is a very common book  what you say certainly sounds plausible  so we have contracted our field of search to a large book printed in double columns and in common use  the bible i cried triumphantly  good watson good but not if i may say so quite good enough even if i accepted the compliment for myself i could hardly name any volume which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of moriartys associates besides the editions of holy writ are so numerous that he could hardly suppose that two copies would have the same pagination this is clearly a book which is standardized he knows for certain that his page 534 will exactly agree with my page 534  but very few books would correspond with that  exactly therein lies our salvation our search is narrowed down to standardized books which anyone may be supposed to possess  bradshaw  there are difficulties watson the vocabulary of bradshaw is nervous and terse but limited the selection of words would hardly lend itself to the sending of general messages we will eliminate bradshaw the dictionary is i fear inadmissible for the same reason what then is left  an almanac  excellent watson i am very much mistaken if you have not touched the spot an almanac let us consider the claims of whitakers almanac it is in common use it has the requisite number of pages it is in double column though reserved in its earlier vocabulary it becomes if i remember right quite garrulous towards the end he picked the volume from his desk here is page 534 column two a substantial block of print dealing i perceive with the trade and resources of british india jot down the words watson number thirteen is mahratta not i fear a very auspicious beginning number one hundred and twentyseven is government which at least makes sense though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and professor moriarty now let us try again what does the mahratta government do alas the next word is pigsbristles we are undone my good watson it is finished  he had spoken in jesting vein but the twitching of his bushy eyebrows bespoke his disappointment and irritation i sat helpless and unhappy staring into the fire a long silence was broken by a sudden exclamation from holmes who dashed at a cupboard from which he emerged with a second yellowcovered volume in his hand  we pay the price watson for being too uptodate he cried we are before our time and suffer the usual penalties being the seventh of january we have very properly laid in the new almanac it is more than likely that porlock took his message from the old one no doubt he would have told us so had his letter of explanation been written now let us see what page 534 has in store for us number thirteen is there which is much more promising number one hundred and twentyseven is isthere is holmess eyes were gleaming with excitement and his thin nervous fingers twitched as he counted the wordsdanger ha ha capital put that down watson there is dangermaycomevery soonone then we have the name douglasrichcountrynowat birlstonehousebirlstoneconfidenceispressing there watson what do you think of pure reason and its fruit if the greengrocer had such a thing as a laurel wreath i should send billy round for it  i was staring at the strange message which i had scrawled as he deciphered it upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee  what a queer scrambling way of expressing his meaning said i  on the contrary he has done quite remarkably well said holmes when you search a single column for words with which to express your meaning you can hardly expect to get everything you want you are bound to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent the purport is perfectly clear some deviltry is intended against one douglas whoever he may be residing as stated a rich country gentleman he is sureconfidence was as near as he could get to confidentthat it is pressing there is our resultand a very workmanlike little bit of analysis it was  holmes had the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work even as he mourned darkly when it fell below the high level to which he aspired he was still chuckling over his success when billy swung open the door and inspector macdonald of scotland yard was ushered into the room  those were the early days at the end of the 80s when alec macdonald was far from having attained the national fame which he has now achieved he was a young but trusted member of the detective force who had distinguished himself in several cases which had been intrusted to him his tall bony figure gave promise of exceptional physical strength while his great cranium and deepset lustrous eyes spoke no less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkled out from behind his bushy eyebrows he was a silent precise man with a dour nature and a hard aberdonian accent  twice already in his career had holmes helped him to attain success his own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem for this reason the affection and respect of the scotchman for his amateur colleague were profound and he showed them by the frankness with which he consulted holmes in every difficulty mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself but talent instantly recognizes genius and macdonald had talent enough for his profession to enable him to perceive that there was no humiliation in seeking the assistance of one who already stood alone in europe both in his gifts and in his experience holmes was not prone to friendship but he was tolerant of the big scotchman and smiled at the sight of him  you are an early bird mr mac said he i wish you luck with your worm i fear this means that there is some mischief afoot  if you said hope instead of fear it would be nearer the truth im thinking mr holmes the inspector answered with a knowing grin well maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill no i wont smoke i thank you ill have to be pushing on my way for the early hours of a case are the precious ones as no man knows better than your own self butbut  the inspector had stopped suddenly and was staring with a look of absolute amazement at a paper upon the table it was the sheet upon which i had scrawled the enigmatic message  douglas he stammered birlstone whats this mr holmes man its witchcraft where in the name of all that is wonderful did you get those names  it is a cipher that dr watson and i have had occasion to solve but whywhats amiss with the names  the inspector looked from one to the other of us in dazed astonishment just this said he that mr douglas of birlstone manor house was horribly murdered last night     chapter 2sherlock holmes discourses    it was one of those dramatic moments for which my friend existed it would be an overstatement to say that he was shocked or even excited by the amazing announcement without having a tinge of cruelty in his singular composition he was undoubtedly callous from long overstimulation yet if his emotions were dulled his intellectual perceptions were exceedingly active there was no trace then of the horror which i had myself felt at this curt declaration but his face showed rather the quiet and interested composure of the chemist who sees the crystals falling into position from his oversaturated solution  remarkable said he remarkable  you dont seem surprised  interested mr mac but hardly surprised why should i be surprised i receive an anonymous communication from a quarter which i know to be important warning me that danger threatens a certain person within an hour i learn that this danger has actually materialized and that the person is dead i am interested but as you observe i am not surprised  in a few short sentences he explained to the inspector the facts about the letter and the cipher macdonald sat with his chin on his hands and his great sandy eyebrows bunched into a yellow tangle  i was going down to birlstone this morning said he i had come to ask you if you cared to come with meyou and your friend here but from what you say we might perhaps be doing better work in london  i rather think not said holmes  hang it all mr holmes cried the inspector the papers will be full of the birlstone mystery in a day or two but wheres the mystery if there is a man in london who prophesied the crime before ever it occurred we have only to lay our hands on that man and the rest will follow  no doubt mr mac but how do you propose to lay your hands on the socalled porlock  macdonald turned over the letter which holmes had handed him posted in camberwellthat doesnt help us much name you say is assumed not much to go on certainly didnt you say that you have sent him money  twice  and how  in notes to camberwell post office  did you ever trouble to see who called for them  no  the inspector looked surprised and a little shocked why not  because i always keep faith i had promised when he first wrote that i would not try to trace him  you think there is someone behind him  i know there is  this professor that ive heard you mention  exactly  inspector macdonald smiled and his eyelid quivered as he glanced towards me i wont conceal from you mr holmes that we think in the cid that you have a wee bit of a bee in your bonnet over this professor i made some inquiries myself about the matter he seems to be a very respectable learned and talented sort of man  im glad youve got so far as to recognize the talent  man you cant but recognize it after i heard your view i made it my business to see him i had a chat with him on eclipses how the talk got that way i canna think but he had out a reflector lantern and a globe and made it all clear in a minute he lent me a book but i dont mind saying that it was a bit above my head though i had a good aberdeen upbringing hed have made a grand meenister with his thin face and gray hair and solemnlike way of talking when he put his hand on my shoulder as we were parting it was like a fathers blessing before you go out into the cold cruel world  holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands great he said great tell me friend macdonald this pleasing and touching interview was i suppose in the professors study  thats so  a fine room is it not  very finevery handsome indeed mr holmes  you sat in front of his writing desk  just so  sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow  well it was evening but i mind that the lamp was turned on my face  it would be did you happen to observe a picture over the professors head  i dont miss much mr holmes maybe i learned that from you yes i saw the picturea young woman with her head on her hands peeping at you sideways  that painting was by jean baptiste greuze  the inspector endeavoured to look interested  jean baptiste greuze holmes continued joining his finger tips and leaning well back in his chair was a french artist who flourished between the years 1750 and 1800 i allude of course to his working career modern criticism has more than indorsed the high opinion formed of him by his contemporaries  the inspectors eyes grew abstracted hadnt we better he said  we are doing so holmes interrupted all that i am saying has a very direct and vital bearing upon what you have called the birlstone mystery in fact it may in a sense be called the very centre of it  macdonald smiled feebly and looked appealingly to me your thoughts move a bit too quick for me mr holmes you leave out a link or two and i cant get over the gap what in the whole wide world can be the connection between this dead painting man and the affair at birlstone  all knowledge comes useful to the detective remarked holmes even the trivial fact that in the year 1865 a picture by greuze entitled la jeune fille a lagneau fetched one million two hundred thousand francsmore than forty thousand poundsat the portalis sale may start a train of reflection in your mind  it was clear that it did the inspector looked honestly interested  i may remind you holmes continued that the professors salary can be ascertained in several trustworthy books of reference it is seven hundred a year  then how could he buy  quite so how could he  ay thats remarkable said the inspector thoughtfully talk away mr holmes im just loving it its fine  holmes smiled he was always warmed by genuine admirationthe characteristic of the real artist what about birlstone he asked  weve time yet said the inspector glancing at his watch ive a cab at the door and it wont take us twenty minutes to victoria but about this picture i thought you told me once mr holmes that you had never met professor moriarty  no i never have  then how do you know about his rooms  ah thats another matter i have been three times in his rooms twice waiting for him under different pretexts and leaving before he came oncewell i can hardly tell about the once to an official detective it was on the last occasion that i took the liberty of running over his paperswith the most unexpected results  you found something compromising  absolutely nothing that was what amazed me however you have now seen the point of the picture it shows him to be a very wealthy man how did he acquire wealth he is unmarried his younger brother is a station master in the west of england his chair is worth seven hundred a year and he owns a greuze  well  surely the inference is plain  you mean that he has a great income and that he must earn it in an illegal fashion  exactly of course i have other reasons for thinking sodozens of exiguous threads which lead vaguely up towards the centre of the web where the poisonous motionless creature is lurking i only mention the greuze because it brings the matter within the range of your own observation  well mr holmes i admit that what you say is interesting its more than interestingits just wonderful but let us have it a little clearer if you can is it forgery coining burglarywhere does the money come from  have you ever read of jonathan wild  well the name has a familiar sound someone in a novel was he not i dont take much stock of detectives in novelschaps that do things and never let you see how they do them thats just inspiration not business  jonathan wild wasnt a detective and he wasnt in a novel he was a master criminal and he lived last century1750 or thereabouts  then hes no use to me im a practical man  mr mac the most practical thing that you ever did in your life would be to shut yourself up for three months and read twelve hours a day at the annals of crime everything comes in circleseven professor moriarty jonathan wild was the hidden force of the london criminals to whom he sold his brains and his organization on a fifteen per cent commission the old wheel turns and the same spoke comes up its all been done before and will be again ill tell you one or two things about moriarty which may interest you  youll interest me right enough  i happen to know who is the first link in his chaina chain with this napoleongonewrong at one end and a hundred broken fighting men pickpockets blackmailers and card sharpers at the other with every sort of crime in between his chief of staff is colonel sebastian moran as aloof and guarded and inaccessible to the law as himself what do you think he pays him  id like to hear  six thousand a year thats paying for brains you seethe american business principle i learned that detail quite by chance its more than the prime minister gets that gives you an idea of moriartys gains and of the scale on which he works another point i made it my business to hunt down some of moriartys checks latelyjust common innocent checks that he pays his household bills with they were drawn on six different banks does that make any impression on your mind  queer certainly but what do you gather from it  that he wanted no gossip about his wealth no single man should know what he had i have no doubt that he has twenty banking accounts the bulk of his fortune abroad in the deutsche bank or the credit lyonnais as likely as not sometime when you have a year or two to spare i commend to you the study of professor moriarty  inspector macdonald had grown steadily more impressed as the conversation proceeded he had lost himself in his interest now his practical scotch intelligence brought him back with a snap to the matter in hand  he can keep anyhow said he youve got us sidetracked with your interesting anecdotes mr holmes what really counts is your remark that there is some connection between the professor and the crime that you get from the warning received through the man porlock can we for our present practical needs get any further than that  we may form some conception as to the motives of the crime it is as i gather from your original remarks an inexplicable or at least an unexplained murder now presuming that the source of the crime is as we suspect it to be there might be two different motives in the first place i may tell you that moriarty rules with a rod of iron over his people his discipline is tremendous there is only one punishment in his code it is death now we might suppose that this murdered manthis douglas whose approaching fate was known by one of the archcriminals subordinateshad in some way betrayed the chief his punishment followed and would be known to allif only to put the fear of death into them  well that is one suggestion mr holmes  the other is that it has been engineered by moriarty in the ordinary course of business was there any robbery  i have not heard  if so it would of course be against the first hypothesis and in favour of the second moriarty may have been engaged to engineer it on a promise of part spoils or he may have been paid so much down to manage it either is possible but whichever it may be or if it is some third combination it is down at birlstone that we must seek the solution i know our man too well to suppose that he has left anything up here which may lead us to him  then to birlstone we must go cried macdonald jumping from his chair my word its later than i thought i can give you gentlemen five minutes for preparation and that is all  and ample for us both said holmes as he sprang up and hastened to change from his dressing gown to his coat while we are on our way mr mac i will ask you to be good enough to tell me all about it  all about it proved to be disappointingly little and yet there was enough to assure us that the case before us might well be worthy of the experts closest attention he brightened and rubbed his thin hands together as he listened to the meagre but remarkable details a long series of sterile weeks lay behind us and here at last there was a fitting object for those remarkable powers which like all special gifts become irksome to their owner when they are not in use that razor brain blunted and rusted with inaction  sherlock holmess eyes glistened his pale cheeks took a warmer hue and his whole eager face shone with an inward light when the call for work reached him leaning forward in the cab he listened intently to macdonalds short sketch of the problem which awaited us in sussex the inspector was himself dependent as he explained to us upon a scribbled account forwarded to him by the milk train in the early hours of the morning white mason the local officer was a personal friend and hence macdonald had been notified much more promptly than is usual at scotland yard when provincials need their assistance it is a very cold scent upon which the metropolitan expert is generally asked to run  dear inspector macdonald said the letter which he read to us  official requisition for your services is in separate envelope this is for your private eye wire me what train in the morning you can get for birlstone and i will meet itor have it met if i am too occupied this case is a snorter dont waste a moment in getting started if you can bring mr holmes please do so for he will find something after his own heart we would think the whole had been fixed up for theatrical effect if there wasnt a dead man in the middle of it my word it is a snorter  your friend seems to be no fool remarked holmes  no sir white mason is a very live man if i am any judge  well have you anything more  only that he will give us every detail when we meet  then how did you get at mr douglas and the fact that he had been horribly murdered  that was in the inclosed official report it didnt say horrible thats not a recognized official term it gave the name john douglas it mentioned that his injuries had been in the head from the discharge of a shotgun it also mentioned the hour of the alarm which was close on to midnight last night it added that the case was undoubtedly one of murder but that no arrest had been made and that the case was one which presented some very perplexing and extraordinary features thats absolutely all we have at present mr holmes  then with your permission we will leave it at that mr mac the temptation to form premature theories upon insufficient data is the bane of our profession i can see only two things for certain at presenta great brain in london and a dead man in sussex its the chain between that we are going to trace     chapter 3the tragedy of birlstone    now for a moment i will ask leave to remove my own insignificant personality and to describe events which occurred before we arrived upon the scene by the light of knowledge which came to us afterwards only in this way can i make the reader appreciate the people concerned and the strange setting in which their fate was cast  the village of birlstone is a small and very ancient cluster of halftimbered cottages on the northern border of the county of sussex for centuries it had remained unchanged but within the last few years its picturesque appearance and situation have attracted a number of welltodo residents whose villas peep out from the woods around these woods are locally supposed to be the extreme fringe of the great weald forest which thins away until it reaches the northern chalk downs a number of small shops have come into being to meet the wants of the increased population so there seems some prospect that birlstone may soon grow from an ancient village into a modern town it is the centre for a considerable area of country since tunbridge wells the nearest place of importance is ten or twelve miles to the eastward over the borders of kent  about half a mile from the town standing in an old park famous for its huge beech trees is the ancient manor house of birlstone part of this venerable building dates back to the time of the first crusade when hugo de capus built a fortalice in the centre of the estate which had been granted to him by the red king this was destroyed by fire in 1543 and some of its smokeblackened corner stones were used when in jacobean times a brick country house rose upon the ruins of the feudal castle  the manor house with its many gables and its small diamondpaned windows was still much as the builder had left it in the early seventeenth century of the double moats which had guarded its more warlike predecessor the outer had been allowed to dry up and served the humble function of a kitchen garden the inner one was still there and lay forty feet in breadth though now only a few feet in depth round the whole house a small stream fed it and continued beyond it so that the sheet of water though turbid was never ditchlike or unhealthy the ground floor windows were within a foot of the surface of the water  the only approach to the house was over a drawbridge the chains and windlass of which had long been rusted and broken the latest tenants of the manor house had however with characteristic energy set this right and the drawbridge was not only capable of being raised but actually was raised every evening and lowered every morning by thus renewing the custom of the old feudal days the manor house was converted into an island during the nighta fact which had a very direct bearing upon the mystery which was soon to engage the attention of all england  the house had been untenanted for some years and was threatening to moulder into a picturesque decay when the douglases took possession of it this family consisted of only two individualsjohn douglas and his wife douglas was a remarkable man both in character and in person in age he may have been about fifty with a strongjawed rugged face a grizzling moustache peculiarly keen gray eyes and a wiry vigorous figure which had lost nothing of the strength and activity of youth he was cheery and genial to all but somewhat offhand in his manners giving the impression that he had seen life in social strata on some far lower horizon than the county society of sussex  yet though looked at with some curiosity and reserve by his more cultivated neighbours he soon acquired a great popularity among the villagers subscribing handsomely to all local objects and attending their smoking concerts and other functions where having a remarkably rich tenor voice he was always ready to oblige with an excellent song he appeared to have plenty of money which was said to have been gained in the california gold fields and it was clear from his own talk and that of his wife that he had spent a part of his life in america  the good impression which had been produced by his generosity and by his democratic manners was increased by a reputation gained for utter indifference to danger though a wretched rider he turned out at every meet and took the most amazing falls in his determination to hold his own with the best when the vicarage caught fire he distinguished himself also by the fearlessness with which he reentered the building to save property after the local fire brigade had given it up as impossible thus it came about that john douglas of the manor house had within five years won himself quite a reputation in birlstone  his wife too was popular with those who had made her acquaintance though after the english fashion the callers upon a stranger who settled in the county without introductions were few and far between this mattered the less to her as she was retiring by disposition and very much absorbed to all appearance in her husband and her domestic duties it was known that she was an english lady who had met mr douglas in london he being at that time a widower she was a beautiful woman tall dark and slender some twenty years younger than her husband a disparity which seemed in no wise to mar the contentment of their family life  it was remarked sometimes however by those who knew them best that the confidence between the two did not appear to be complete since the wife was either very reticent about her husbands past life or else as seemed more likely was imperfectly informed about it it had also been noted and commented upon by a few observant people that there were signs sometimes of some nervestrain upon the part of mrs douglas and that she would display acute uneasiness if her absent husband should ever be particularly late in his return on a quiet countryside where all gossip is welcome this weakness of the lady of the manor house did not pass without remark and it bulked larger upon peoples memory when the events arose which gave it a very special significance  there was yet another individual whose residence under that roof was it is true only an intermittent one but whose presence at the time of the strange happenings which will now be narrated brought his name prominently before the public this was cecil james barker of hales lodge hampstead  cecil barkers tall loosejointed figure was a familiar one in the main street of birlstone village for he was a frequent and welcome visitor at the manor house he was the more noticed as being the only friend of the past unknown life of mr douglas who was ever seen in his new english surroundings barker was himself an undoubted englishman but by his remarks it was clear that he had first known douglas in america and had there lived on intimate terms with him he appeared to be a man of considerable wealth and was reputed to be a bachelor  in age he was rather younger than douglasfortyfive at the mosta tall straight broadchested fellow with a cleanshaved prizefighter face thick strong black eyebrows and a pair of masterful black eyes which might even without the aid of his very capable hands clear a way for him through a hostile crowd he neither rode nor shot but spent his days in wandering round the old village with his pipe in his mouth or in driving with his host or in his absence with his hostess over the beautiful countryside an easygoing freehanded gentleman said ames the butler but my word i had rather not be the man that crossed him he was cordial and intimate with douglas and he was no less friendly with his wifea friendship which more than once seemed to cause some irritation to the husband so that even the servants were able to perceive his annoyance such was the third person who was one of the family when the catastrophe occurred  as to the other denizens of the old building it will suffice out of a large household to mention the prim respectable and capable ames and mrs allen a buxom and cheerful person who relieved the lady of some of her household cares the other six servants in the house bear no relation to the events of the night of january 6th  it was at eleven fortyfive that the first alarm reached the small local police station in charge of sergeant wilson of the sussex constabulary cecil barker much excited had rushed up to the door and pealed furiously upon the bell a terrible tragedy had occurred at the manor house and john douglas had been murdered that was the breathless burden of his message he had hurried back to the house followed within a few minutes by the police sergeant who arrived at the scene of the crime a little after twelve oclock after taking prompt steps to warn the county authorities that something serious was afoot  on reaching the manor house the sergeant had found the drawbridge down the windows lighted up and the whole household in a state of wild confusion and alarm the whitefaced servants were huddling together in the hall with the frightened butler wringing his hands in the doorway only cecil barker seemed to be master of himself and his emotions he had opened the door which was nearest to the entrance and he had beckoned to the sergeant to follow him at that moment there arrived dr wood a brisk and capable general practitioner from the village the three men entered the fatal room together while the horrorstricken butler followed at their heels closing the door behind him to shut out the terrible scene from the maid servants  the dead man lay on his back sprawling with outstretched limbs in the centre of the room he was clad only in a pink dressing gown which covered his night clothes there were carpet slippers on his bare feet the doctor knelt beside him and held down the hand lamp which had stood on the table one glance at the victim was enough to show the healer that his presence could be dispensed with the man had been horribly injured lying across his chest was a curious weapon a shotgun with the barrel sawed off a foot in front of the triggers it was clear that this had been fired at close range and that he had received the whole charge in the face blowing his head almost to pieces the triggers had been wired together so as to make the simultaneous discharge more destructive  the country policeman was unnerved and troubled by the tremendous responsibility which had come so suddenly upon him we will touch nothing until my superiors arrive he said in a hushed voice staring in horror at the dreadful head  nothing has been touched up to now said cecil barker ill answer for that you see it all exactly as i found it  when was that the sergeant had drawn out his notebook  it was just halfpast eleven i had not begun to undress and i was sitting by the fire in my bedroom when i heard the report it was not very loudit seemed to be muffled i rushed downi dont suppose it was thirty seconds before i was in the room  was the door open  yes it was open poor douglas was lying as you see him his bedroom candle was burning on the table it was i who lit the lamp some minutes afterward  did you see no one  no i heard mrs douglas coming down the stair behind me and i rushed out to prevent her from seeing this dreadful sight mrs allen the housekeeper came and took her away ames had arrived and we ran back into the room once more  but surely i have heard that the drawbridge is kept up all night  yes it was up until i lowered it  then how could any murderer have got away it is out of the question mr douglas must have shot himself  that was our first idea but see barker drew aside the curtain and showed that the long diamondpaned window was open to its full extent and look at this he held the lamp down and illuminated a smudge of blood like the mark of a bootsole upon the wooden sill someone has stood there in getting out  you mean that someone waded across the moat  exactly  then if you were in the room within half a minute of the crime he must have been in the water at that very moment  i have not a doubt of it i wish to heaven that i had rushed to the window but the curtain screened it as you can see and so it never occurred to me then i heard the step of mrs douglas and i could not let her enter the room it would have been too horrible  horrible enough said the doctor looking at the shattered head and the terrible marks which surrounded it ive never seen such injuries since the birlstone railway smash  but i say remarked the police sergeant whose slow bucolic common sense was still pondering the open window its all very well your saying that a man escaped by wading this moat but what i ask you is how did he ever get into the house at all if the bridge was up  ah thats the question said barker  at what oclock was it raised  it was nearly six oclock said ames the butler  ive heard said the sergeant that it was usually raised at sunset that would be nearer halfpast four than six at this time of year  mrs douglas had visitors to tea said ames i couldnt raise it until they went then i wound it up myself  then it comes to this said the sergeant if anyone came from outsideif they didthey must have got in across the bridge before six and been in hiding ever since until mr douglas came into the room after eleven  that is so mr douglas went round the house every night the last thing before he turned in to see that the lights were right that brought him in here the man was waiting and shot him then he got away through the window and left his gun behind him thats how i read it for nothing else will fit the facts  the sergeant picked up a card which lay beside the dead man on the floor the initials vv and under them the number 341 were rudely scrawled in ink upon it  whats this he asked holding it up  barker looked at it with curiosity i never noticed it before he said the murderer must have left it behind him  vv341 i can make no sense of that  the sergeant kept turning it over in his big fingers whats vv somebodys initials maybe what have you got there dr wood  it was a goodsized hammer which had been lying on the rug in front of the fireplacea substantial workmanlike hammer cecil barker pointed to a box of brassheaded nails upon the mantelpiece  mr douglas was altering the pictures yesterday he said i saw him myself standing upon that chair and fixing the big picture above it that accounts for the hammer  wed best put it back on the rug where we found it said the sergeant scratching his puzzled head in his perplexity it will want the best brains in the force to get to the bottom of this thing it will be a london job before it is finished he raised the hand lamp and walked slowly round the room hullo he cried excitedly drawing the window curtain to one side what oclock were those curtains drawn  when the lamps were lit said the butler it would be shortly after four  someone had been hiding here sure enough he held down the light and the marks of muddy boots were very visible in the corner im bound to say this bears out your theory mr barker it looks as if the man got into the house after four when the curtains were drawn and before six when the bridge was raised he slipped into this room because it was the first that he saw there was no other place where he could hide so he popped in behind this curtain that all seems clear enough it is likely that his main idea was to burgle the house but mr douglas chanced to come upon him so he murdered him and escaped  thats how i read it said barker but i say arent we wasting precious time couldnt we start out and scout the country before the fellow gets away  the sergeant considered for a moment  there are no trains before six in the morning so he cant get away by rail if he goes by road with his legs all dripping its odds that someone will notice him anyhow i cant leave here myself until i am relieved but i think none of you should go until we see more clearly how we all stand  the doctor had taken the lamp and was narrowly scrutinizing the body whats this mark he asked could this have any connection with the crime  the dead mans right arm was thrust out from his dressing gown and exposed as high as the elbow about halfway up the forearm was a curious brown design a triangle inside a circle standing out in vivid relief upon the lardcoloured skin  its not tattooed said the doctor peering through his glasses i never saw anything like it the man has been branded at some time as they brand cattle what is the meaning of this  i dont profess to know the meaning of it said cecil barker but i have seen the mark on douglas many times this last ten years  and so have i said the butler many a time when the master has rolled up his sleeves i have noticed that very mark ive often wondered what it could be  then it has nothing to do with the crime anyhow said the sergeant but its a rum thing all the same everything about this case is rum well what is it now  the butler had given an exclamation of astonishment and was pointing at the dead mans outstretched hand  theyve taken his wedding ring he gasped  what  yes indeed master always wore his plain gold wedding ring on the little finger of his left hand that ring with the rough nugget on it was above it and the twisted snake ring on the third finger theres the nugget and theres the snake but the wedding ring is gone  hes right said barker  do you tell me said the sergeant that the wedding ring was below the other  always  then the murderer or whoever it was first took off this ring you call the nugget ring then the wedding ring and afterwards put the nugget ring back again  that is so  the worthy country policeman shook his head seems to me the sooner we get london on to this case the better said he white mason is a smart man no local job has ever been too much for white mason it wont be long now before he is here to help us but i expect well have to look to london before we are through anyhow im not ashamed to say that it is a deal too thick for the likes of me     chapter 4darkness    at three in the morning the chief sussex detective obeying the urgent call from sergeant wilson of birlstone arrived from headquarters in a light dogcart behind a breathless trotter by the fiveforty train in the morning he had sent his message to scotland yard and he was at the birlstone station at twelve oclock to welcome us white mason was a quiet comfortablelooking person in a loose tweed suit with a cleanshaved ruddy face a stoutish body and powerful bandy legs adorned with gaiters looking like a small farmer a retired gamekeeper or anything upon earth except a very favourable specimen of the provincial criminal officer  a real downright snorter mr macdonald he kept repeating well have the pressmen down like flies when they understand it im hoping we will get our work done before they get poking their noses into it and messing up all the trails there has been nothing like this that i can remember there are some bits that will come home to you mr holmes or i am mistaken and you also dr watson for the medicos will have a word to say before we finish your room is at the westville arms theres no other place but i hear that it is clean and good the man will carry your bags this way gentlemen if you please  he was a very bustling and genial person this sussex detective in ten minutes we had all found our quarters in ten more we were seated in the parlour of the inn and being treated to a rapid sketch of those events which have been outlined in the previous chapter macdonald made an occasional note while holmes sat absorbed with the expression of surprised and reverent admiration with which the botanist surveys the rare and precious bloom  remarkable he said when the story was unfolded most remarkable i can hardly recall any case where the features have been more peculiar  i thought you would say so mr holmes said white mason in great delight were well up with the times in sussex ive told you now how matters were up to the time when i took over from sergeant wilson between three and four this morning my word i made the old mare go but i need not have been in such a hurry as it turned out for there was nothing immediate that i could do sergeant wilson had all the facts i checked them and considered them and maybe added a few of my own  what were they asked holmes eagerly  well i first had the hammer examined there was dr wood there to help me we found no signs of violence upon it i was hoping that if mr douglas defended himself with the hammer he might have left his mark upon the murderer before he dropped it on the mat but there was no stain  that of course proves nothing at all remarked inspector macdonald there has been many a hammer murder and no trace on the hammer  quite so it doesnt prove it wasnt used but there might have been stains and that would have helped us as a matter of fact there were none then i examined the gun they were buckshot cartridges and as sergeant wilson pointed out the triggers were wired together so that if you pulled on the hinder one both barrels were discharged whoever fixed that up had made up his mind that he was going to take no chances of missing his man the sawed gun was not more than two foot longone could carry it easily under ones coat there was no complete makers name but the printed letters pen were on the fluting between the barrels and the rest of the name had been cut off by the saw  a big p with a flourish above it e and n smaller asked holmes  exactly  pennsylvania small arms companywellknown american firm said holmes  white mason gazed at my friend as the little village practitioner looks at the harley street specialist who by a word can solve the difficulties that perplex him  that is very helpful mr holmes no doubt you are right wonderful wonderful do you carry the names of all the gun makers in the world in your memory  holmes dismissed the subject with a wave  no doubt it is an american shotgun white mason continued i seem to have read that a sawedoff shotgun is a weapon used in some parts of america apart from the name upon the barrel the idea had occurred to me there is some evidence then that this man who entered the house and killed its master was an american  macdonald shook his head man you are surely travelling overfast said he i have heard no evidence yet that any stranger was ever in the house at all  the open window the blood on the sill the queer card the marks of boots in the corner the gun  nothing there that could not have been arranged mr douglas was an american or had lived long in america so had mr barker you dont need to import an american from outside in order to account for american doings  ames the butler  what about him is he reliable  ten years with sir charles chandosas solid as a rock he has been with douglas ever since he took the manor house five years ago he has never seen a gun of this sort in the house  the gun was made to conceal thats why the barrels were sawed it would fit into any box how could he swear there was no such gun in the house  well anyhow he had never seen one  macdonald shook his obstinate scotch head im not convinced yet that there was ever anyone in the house said he im asking you to conseedar his accent became more aberdonian as he lost himself in his argument im asking you to conseedar what it involves if you suppose that this gun was ever brought into the house and that all these strange things were done by a person from outside oh man its just inconceivable its clean against common sense i put it to you mr holmes judging it by what we have heard  well state your case mr mac said holmes in his most judicial style  the man is not a burglar supposing that he ever existed the ring business and the card point to premeditated murder for some private reason very good here is a man who slips into a house with the deliberate intention of committing murder he knows if he knows anything that he will have a deeficulty in making his escape as the house is surrounded with water what weapon would he choose you would say the most silent in the world then he could hope when the deed was done to slip quickly from the window to wade the moat and to get away at his leisure thats understandable but is it understandable that he should go out of his way to bring with him the most noisy weapon he could select knowing well that it will fetch every human being in the house to the spot as quick as they can run and that it is all odds that he will be seen before he can get across the moat is that credible mr holmes  well you put the case strongly my friend replied thoughtfully it certainly needs a good deal of justification may i ask mr white mason whether you examined the farther side of the moat at once to see if there were any signs of the man having climbed out from the water  there were no signs mr holmes but it is a stone ledge and one could hardly expect them  no tracks or marks  none  ha would there be any objection mr white mason to our going down to the house at once there may possibly be some small point which might be suggestive  i was going to propose it mr holmes but i thought it well to put you in touch with all the facts before we go i suppose if anything should strike you white mason looked doubtfully at the amateur  i have worked with mr holmes before said inspector macdonald he plays the game  my own idea of the game at any rate said holmes with a smile i go into a case to help the ends of justice and the work of the police if i have ever separated myself from the official force it is because they have first separated themselves from me i have no wish ever to score at their expense at the same time mr white mason i claim the right to work in my own way and give my results at my own timecomplete rather than in stages  i am sure we are honoured by your presence and to show you all we know said white mason cordially come along dr watson and when the time comes well all hope for a place in your book  we walked down the quaint village street with a row of pollarded elms on each side of it just beyond were two ancient stone pillars weatherstained and lichenblotched bearing upon their summits a shapeless something which had once been the rampant lion of capus of birlstone a short walk along the winding drive with such sward and oaks around it as one only sees in rural england then a sudden turn and the long low jacobean house of dingy livercoloured brick lay before us with an oldfashioned garden of cut yews on each side of it as we approached it there was the wooden drawbridge and the beautiful broad moat as still and luminous as quicksilver in the cold winter sunshine  three centuries had flowed past the old manor house centuries of births and of homecomings of country dances and of the meetings of fox hunters strange that now in its old age this dark business should have cast its shadow upon the venerable walls and yet those strange peaked roofs and quaint overhung gables were a fitting covering to grim and terrible intrigue as i looked at the deepset windows and the long sweep of the dullcoloured waterlapped front i felt that no more fitting scene could be set for such a tragedy  thats the window said white mason that one on the immediate right of the drawbridge its open just as it was found last night  it looks rather narrow for a man to pass  well it wasnt a fat man anyhow we dont need your deductions mr holmes to tell us that but you or i could squeeze through all right  holmes walked to the edge of the moat and looked across then he examined the stone ledge and the grass border beyond it  ive had a good look mr holmes said white mason there is nothing there no sign that anyone has landedbut why should he leave any sign  exactly why should he is the water always turbid  generally about this colour the stream brings down the clay  how deep is it  about two feet at each side and three in the middle  so we can put aside all idea of the man having been drowned in crossing  no a child could not be drowned in it  we walked across the drawbridge and were admitted by a quaint gnarled driedup person who was the butler ames the poor old fellow was white and quivering from the shock the village sergeant a tall formal melancholy man still held his vigil in the room of fate the doctor had departed  anything fresh sergeant wilson asked white mason  no sir  then you can go home youve had enough we can send for you if we want you the butler had better wait outside tell him to warn mr cecil barker mrs douglas and the housekeeper that we may want a word with them presently now gentlemen perhaps you will allow me to give you the views i have formed first and then you will be able to arrive at your own  he impressed me this country specialist he had a solid grip of fact and a cool clear commonsense brain which should take him some way in his profession holmes listened to him intently with no sign of that impatience which the official exponent too often produced  is it suicide or is it murderthats our first question gentlemen is it not if it were suicide then we have to believe that this man began by taking off his wedding ring and concealing it that he then came down here in his dressing gown trampled mud into a corner behind the curtain in order to give the idea someone had waited for him opened the window put blood on the  we can surely dismiss that said macdonald  so i think suicide is out of the question then a murder has been done what we have to determine is whether it was done by someone outside or inside the house  well lets hear the argument  there are considerable difficulties both ways and yet one or the other it must be we will suppose first that some person or persons inside the house did the crime they got this man down here at a time when everything was still and yet no one was asleep they then did the deed with the queerest and noisiest weapon in the world so as to tell everyone what had happeneda weapon that was never seen in the house before that does not seem a very likely start does it  no it does not  well then everyone is agreed that after the alarm was given only a minute at the most had passed before the whole householdnot mr cecil barker alone though he claims to have been the first but ames and all of them were on the spot do you tell me that in that time the guilty person managed to make footmarks in the corner open the window mark the sill with blood take the wedding ring off the dead mans finger and all the rest of it its impossible  you put it very clearly said holmes i am inclined to agree with you  well then we are driven back to the theory that it was done by someone from outside we are still faced with some big difficulties but anyhow they have ceased to be impossibilities the man got into the house between fourthirty and six that is to say between dusk and the time when the bridge was raised there had been some visitors and the door was open so there was nothing to prevent him he may have been a common burglar or he may have had some private grudge against mr douglas since mr douglas has spent most of his life in america and this shotgun seems to be an american weapon it would seem that the private grudge is the more likely theory he slipped into this room because it was the first he came to and he hid behind the curtain there he remained until past eleven at night at that time mr douglas entered the room it was a short interview if there were any interview at all for mrs douglas declares that her husband had not left her more than a few minutes when she heard the shot  the candle shows that said holmes  exactly the candle which was a new one is not burned more than half an inch he must have placed it on the table before he was attacked otherwise of course it would have fallen when he fell this shows that he was not attacked the instant that he entered the room when mr barker arrived the candle was lit and the lamp was out  thats all clear enough  well now we can reconstruct things on those lines mr douglas enters the room he puts down the candle a man appears from behind the curtain he is armed with this gun he demands the wedding ringheaven only knows why but so it must have been mr douglas gave it up then either in cold blood or in the course of a struggledouglas may have gripped the hammer that was found upon the mathe shot douglas in this horrible way he dropped his gun and also it would seem this queer cardvv 341 whatever that may meanand he made his escape through the window and across the moat at the very moment when cecil barker was discovering the crime hows that mr holmes  very interesting but just a little unconvincing  man it would be absolute nonsense if it wasnt that anything else is even worse cried macdonald somebody killed the man and whoever it was i could clearly prove to you that he should have done it some other way what does he mean by allowing his retreat to be cut off like that what does he mean by using a shotgun when silence was his one chance of escape come mr holmes its up to you to give us a lead since you say mr white masons theory is unconvincing  holmes had sat intently observant during this long discussion missing no word that was said with his keen eyes darting to right and to left and his forehead wrinkled with speculation  i should like a few more facts before i get so far as a theory mr mac said he kneeling down beside the body dear me these injuries are really appalling can we have the butler in for a moment ames i understand that you have often seen this very unusual marka branded triangle inside a circleupon mr douglass forearm  frequently sir  you never heard any speculation as to what it meant  no sir  it must have caused great pain when it was inflicted it is undoubtedly a burn now i observe ames that there is a small piece of plaster at the angle of mr douglass jaw did you observe that in life  yes sir he cut himself in shaving yesterday morning  did you ever know him to cut himself in shaving before  not for a very long time sir  suggestive said holmes it may of course be a mere coincidence or it may point to some nervousness which would indicate that he had reason to apprehend danger had you noticed anything unusual in his conduct yesterday ames  it struck me that he was a little restless and excited sir  ha the attack may not have been entirely unexpected we do seem to make a little progress do we not perhaps you would rather do the questioning mr mac  no mr holmes its in better hands than mine  well then we will pass to this cardvv 341 it is rough cardboard have you any of the sort in the house  i dont think so  holmes walked across to the desk and dabbed a little ink from each bottle on to the blotting paper it was not printed in this room he said this is black ink and the other purplish it was done by a thick pen and these are fine no it was done elsewhere i should say can you make anything of the inscription ames  no sir nothing  what do you think mr mac  it gives me the impression of a secret society of some sort the same with his badge upon the forearm  thats my idea too said white mason  well we can adopt it as a working hypothesis and then see how far our difficulties disappear an agent from such a society makes his way into the house waits for mr douglas blows his head nearly off with this weapon and escapes by wading the moat after leaving a card beside the dead man which will when mentioned in the papers tell other members of the society that vengeance has been done that all hangs together but why this gun of all weapons  exactly  and why the missing ring  quite so  and why no arrest its past two now i take it for granted that since dawn every constable within forty miles has been looking out for a wet stranger  that is so mr holmes  well unless he has a burrow close by or a change of clothes ready they can hardly miss him and yet they have missed him up to now holmes had gone to the window and was examining with his lens the blood mark on the sill it is clearly the tread of a shoe it is remarkably broad a splayfoot one would say curious because so far as one can trace any footmark in this mudstained corner one would say it was a more shapely sole however they are certainly very indistinct whats this under the side table  mr douglass dumbbells said ames  dumbbelltheres only one wheres the other  i dont know mr holmes there may have been only one i have not noticed them for months  one dumbbell holmes said seriously but his remarks were interrupted by a sharp knock at the door  a tall sunburned capablelooking cleanshaved man looked in at us i had no difficulty in guessing that it was the cecil barker of whom i had heard his masterful eyes travelled quickly with a questioning glance from face to face  sorry to interrupt your consultation said he but you should hear the latest news  an arrest  no such luck but theyve found his bicycle the fellow left his bicycle behind him come and have a look it is within a hundred yards of the hall door  we found three or four grooms and idlers standing in the drive inspecting a bicycle which had been drawn out from a clump of evergreens in which it had been concealed it was a well used rudgewhitworth splashed as from a considerable journey there was a saddlebag with spanner and oilcan but no clue as to the owner  it would be a grand help to the police said the inspector if these things were numbered and registered but we must be thankful for what weve got if we cant find where he went to at least we are likely to get where he came from but what in the name of all that is wonderful made the fellow leave it behind and how in the world has he got away without it we dont seem to get a gleam of light in the case mr holmes  dont we my friend answered thoughtfully i wonder     chapter 5the people of the drama    have you seen all you want of the study asked white mason as we reentered the house  for the time said the inspector and holmes nodded  then perhaps you would now like to hear the evidence of some of the people in the house we could use the dining room ames please come yourself first and tell us what you know  the butlers account was a simple and a clear one and he gave a convincing impression of sincerity he had been engaged five years before when douglas first came to birlstone he understood that mr douglas was a rich gentleman who had made his money in america he had been a kind and considerate employernot quite what ames was used to perhaps but one cant have everything he never saw any signs of apprehension in mr douglas on the contrary he was the most fearless man he had ever known he ordered the drawbridge to be pulled up every night because it was the ancient custom of the old house and he liked to keep the old ways up  mr douglas seldom went to london or left the village but on the day before the crime he had been shopping at tunbridge wells he ames had observed some restlessness and excitement on the part of mr douglas that day for he had seemed impatient and irritable which was unusual with him he had not gone to bed that night but was in the pantry at the back of the house putting away the silver when he heard the bell ring violently he heard no shot but it was hardly possible he would as the pantry and kitchens were at the very back of the house and there were several closed doors and a long passage between the housekeeper had come out of her room attracted by the violent ringing of the bell they had gone to the front of the house together  as they reached the bottom of the stairs he had seen mrs douglas coming down it no she was not hurrying it did not seem to him that she was particularly agitated just as she reached the bottom of the stair mr barker had rushed out of the study he had stopped mrs douglas and begged her to go back  for gods sake go back to your room he cried poor jack is dead you can do nothing for gods sake go back  after some persuasion upon the stairs mrs douglas had gone back she did not scream she made no outcry whatever mrs allen the housekeeper had taken her upstairs and stayed with her in the bedroom ames and mr barker had then returned to the study where they had found everything exactly as the police had seen it the candle was not lit at that time but the lamp was burning they had looked out of the window but the night was very dark and nothing could be seen or heard they had then rushed out into the hall where ames had turned the windlass which lowered the drawbridge mr barker had then hurried off to get the police  such in its essentials was the evidence of the butler  the account of mrs allen the housekeeper was so far as it went a corroboration of that of her fellow servant the housekeepers room was rather nearer to the front of the house than the pantry in which ames had been working she was preparing to go to bed when the loud ringing of the bell had attracted her attention she was a little hard of hearing perhaps that was why she had not heard the shot but in any case the study was a long way off she remembered hearing some sound which she imagined to be the slamming of a door that was a good deal earlierhalf an hour at least before the ringing of the bell when mr ames ran to the front she went with him she saw mr barker very pale and excited come out of the study he intercepted mrs douglas who was coming down the stairs he entreated her to go back and she answered him but what she said could not be heard  take her up stay with her he had said to mrs allen  she had therefore taken her to the bedroom and endeavoured to soothe her she was greatly excited trembling all over but made no other attempt to go downstairs she just sat in her dressing gown by her bedroom fire with her head sunk in her hands mrs allen stayed with her most of the night as to the other servants they had all gone to bed and the alarm did not reach them until just before the police arrived they slept at the extreme back of the house and could not possibly have heard anything  so far the housekeeper could add nothing on crossexamination save lamentations and expressions of amazement  cecil barker succeeded mrs allen as a witness as to the occurrences of the night before he had very little to add to what he had already told the police personally he was convinced that the murderer had escaped by the window the bloodstain was conclusive in his opinion on that point besides as the bridge was up there was no other possible way of escaping he could not explain what had become of the assassin or why he had not taken his bicycle if it were indeed his he could not possibly have been drowned in the moat which was at no place more than three feet deep  in his own mind he had a very definite theory about the murder douglas was a reticent man and there were some chapters in his life of which he never spoke he had emigrated to america when he was a very young man he had prospered well and barker had first met him in california where they had become partners in a successful mining claim at a place called benito canyon they had done very well but douglas had suddenly sold out and started for england he was a widower at that time barker had afterwards realized his money and come to live in london thus they had renewed their friendship  douglas had given him the impression that some danger was hanging over his head and he had always looked upon his sudden departure from california and also his renting a house in so quiet a place in england as being connected with this peril he imagined that some secret society some implacable organization was on douglass track which would never rest until it killed him some remarks of his had given him this idea though he had never told him what the society was nor how he had come to offend it he could only suppose that the legend upon the placard had some reference to this secret society  how long were you with douglas in california asked inspector macdonald  five years altogether  he was a bachelor you say  a widower  have you ever heard where his first wife came from  no i remember his saying that she was of german extraction and i have seen her portrait she was a very beautiful woman she died of typhoid the year before i met him  you dont associate his past with any particular part of america  i have heard him talk of chicago he knew that city well and had worked there i have heard him talk of the coal and iron districts he had travelled a good deal in his time  was he a politician had this secret society to do with politics  no he cared nothing about politics  you have no reason to think it was criminal  on the contrary i never met a straighter man in my life  was there anything curious about his life in california  he liked best to stay and to work at our claim in the mountains he would never go where other men were if he could help it thats why i first thought that someone was after him then when he left so suddenly for europe i made sure that it was so i believe that he had a warning of some sort within a week of his leaving half a dozen men were inquiring for him  what sort of men  well they were a mighty hardlooking crowd they came up to the claim and wanted to know where he was i told them that he was gone to europe and that i did not know where to find him they meant him no goodit was easy to see that  were these men americanscalifornians  well i dont know about californians they were americans all right but they were not miners i dont know what they were and was very glad to see their backs  that was six years ago  nearer seven  and then you were together five years in california so that this business dates back not less than eleven years at the least  that is so  it must be a very serious feud that would be kept up with such earnestness for as long as that it would be no light thing that would give rise to it  i think it shadowed his whole life it was never quite out of his mind  but if a man had a danger hanging over him and knew what it was dont you think he would turn to the police for protection  maybe it was some danger that he could not be protected against theres one thing you should know he always went about armed his revolver was never out of his pocket but by bad luck he was in his dressing gown and had left it in the bedroom last night once the bridge was up i guess he thought he was safe  i should like these dates a little clearer said macdonald it is quite six years since douglas left california you followed him next year did you not  that is so  and he had been married five years you must have returned about the time of his marriage  about a month before i was his best man  did you know mrs douglas before her marriage  no i did not i had been away from england for ten years  but you have seen a good deal of her since  barker looked sternly at the detective i have seen a good deal of him since he answered if i have seen her it is because you cannot visit a man without knowing his wife if you imagine there is any connection  i imagine nothing mr barker i am bound to make every inquiry which can bear upon the case but i mean no offense  some inquiries are offensive barker answered angrily  its only the facts that we want it is in your interest and everyones interest that they should be cleared up did mr douglas entirely approve your friendship with his wife  barker grew paler and his great strong hands were clasped convulsively together you have no right to ask such questions he cried what has this to do with the matter you are investigating  i must repeat the question  well i refuse to answer  you can refuse to answer but you must be aware that your refusal is in itself an answer for you would not refuse if you had not something to conceal  barker stood for a moment with his face set grimly and his strong black eyebrows drawn low in intense thought then he looked up with a smile well i guess you gentlemen are only doing your clear duty after all and i have no right to stand in the way of it id only ask you not to worry mrs douglas over this matter for she has enough upon her just now i may tell you that poor douglas had just one fault in the world and that was his jealousy he was fond of meno man could be fonder of a friend and he was devoted to his wife he loved me to come here and was forever sending for me and yet if his wife and i talked together or there seemed any sympathy between us a kind of wave of jealousy would pass over him and he would be off the handle and saying the wildest things in a moment more than once ive sworn off coming for that reason and then he would write me such penitent imploring letters that i just had to but you can take it from me gentlemen if it was my last word that no man ever had a more loving faithful wifeand i can say also no friend could be more loyal than i  it was spoken with fervour and feeling and yet inspector macdonald could not dismiss the subject  you are aware said he that the dead mans wedding ring has been taken from his finger  so it appears said barker  what do you mean by appears you know it as a fact  the man seemed confused and undecided when i said appears i meant that it was conceivable that he had himself taken off the ring  the mere fact that the ring should be absent whoever may have removed it would suggest to anyones mind would it not that the marriage and the tragedy were connected  barker shrugged his broad shoulders i cant profess to say what it means he answered but if you mean to hint that it could reflect in any way upon this ladys honourhis eyes blazed for an instant and then with an evident effort he got a grip upon his own emotionswell you are on the wrong track thats all  i dont know that ive anything else to ask you at present said macdonald coldly  there was one small point remarked sherlock holmes when you entered the room there was only a candle lighted on the table was there not  yes that was so  by its light you saw that some terrible incident had occurred  exactly  you at once rang for help  yes  and it arrived very speedily  within a minute or so  and yet when they arrived they found that the candle was out and that the lamp had been lighted that seems very remarkable  again barker showed some signs of indecision i dont see that it was remarkable mr holmes he answered after a pause the candle threw a very bad light my first thought was to get a better one the lamp was on the table so i lit it  and blew out the candle  exactly  holmes asked no further question and barker with a deliberate look from one to the other of us which had as it seemed to me something of defiance in it turned and left the room  inspector macdonald had sent up a note to the effect that he would wait upon mrs douglas in her room but she had replied that she would meet us in the dining room she entered now a tall and beautiful woman of thirty reserved and selfpossessed to a remarkable degree very different from the tragic and distracted figure i had pictured it is true that her face was pale and drawn like that of one who has endured a great shock but her manner was composed and the finely moulded hand which she rested upon the edge of the table was as steady as my own her sad appealing eyes travelled from one to the other of us with a curiously inquisitive expression that questioning gaze transformed itself suddenly into abrupt speech  have you found anything out yet she asked  was it my imagination that there was an undertone of fear rather than of hope in the question  we have taken every possible step mrs douglas said the inspector you may rest assured that nothing will be neglected  spare no money she said in a dead even tone it is my desire that every possible effort should be made  perhaps you can tell us something which may throw some light upon the matter  i fear not but all i know is at your service  we have heard from mr cecil barker that you did not actually seethat you were never in the room where the tragedy occurred  no he turned me back upon the stairs he begged me to return to my room  quite so you had heard the shot and you had at once come down  i put on my dressing gown and then came down  how long was it after hearing the shot that you were stopped on the stair by mr barker  it may have been a couple of minutes it is so hard to reckon time at such a moment he implored me not to go on he assured me that i could do nothing then mrs allen the housekeeper led me upstairs again it was all like some dreadful dream  can you give us any idea how long your husband had been downstairs before you heard the shot  no i cannot say he went from his dressing room and i did not hear him go he did the round of the house every night for he was nervous of fire it is the only thing that i have ever known him nervous of  that is just the point which i want to come to mrs douglas you have known your husband only in england have you not  yes we have been married five years  have you heard him speak of anything which occurred in america and might bring some danger upon him  mrs douglas thought earnestly before she answered yes she said at last i have always felt that there was a danger hanging over him he refused to discuss it with me it was not from want of confidence in methere was the most complete love and confidence between usbut it was out of his desire to keep all alarm away from me he thought i should brood over it if i knew all and so he was silent  how did you know it then  mrs douglass face lit with a quick smile can a husband ever carry about a secret all his life and a woman who loves him have no suspicion of it i knew it by his refusal to talk about some episodes in his american life i knew it by certain precautions he took i knew it by certain words he let fall i knew it by the way he looked at unexpected strangers i was perfectly certain that he had some powerful enemies that he believed they were on his track and that he was always on his guard against them i was so sure of it that for years i have been terrified if ever he came home later than was expected  might i ask asked holmes what the words were which attracted your attention  the valley of fear the lady answered that was an expression he has used when i questioned him i have been in the valley of fear i am not out of it yetare we never to get out of the valley of fear i have asked him when i have seen him more serious than usual sometimes i think that we never shall he has answered  surely you asked him what he meant by the valley of fear  i did but his face would become very grave and he would shake his head it is bad enough that one of us should have been in its shadow he said please god it shall never fall upon you it was some real valley in which he had lived and in which something terrible had occurred to him of that i am certain but i can tell you no more  and he never mentioned any names  yes he was delirious with fever once when he had his hunting accident three years ago then i remember that there was a name that came continually to his lips he spoke it with anger and a sort of horror mcginty was the namebodymaster mcginty i asked him when he recovered who bodymaster mcginty was and whose body he was master of never of mine thank god he answered with a laugh and that was all i could get from him but there is a connection between bodymaster mcginty and the valley of fear  there is one other point said inspector macdonald you met mr douglas in a boarding house in london did you not and became engaged to him there was there any romance anything secret or mysterious about the wedding  there was romance there is always romance there was nothing mysterious  he had no rival  no i was quite free  you have heard no doubt that his wedding ring has been taken does that suggest anything to you suppose that some enemy of his old life had tracked him down and committed this crime what possible reason could he have for taking his wedding ring  for an instant i could have sworn that the faintest shadow of a smile flickered over the womans lips  i really cannot tell she answered it is certainly a most extraordinary thing  well we will not detain you any longer and we are sorry to have put you to this trouble at such a time said the inspector there are some other points no doubt but we can refer to you as they arise  she rose and i was again conscious of that quick questioning glance with which she had just surveyed us what impression has my evidence made upon you the question might as well have been spoken then with a bow she swept from the room  shes a beautiful womana very beautiful woman said macdonald thoughtfully after the door had closed behind her this man barker has certainly been down here a good deal he is a man who might be attractive to a woman he admits that the dead man was jealous and maybe he knew best himself what cause he had for jealousy then theres that wedding ring you cant get past that the man who tears a wedding ring off a dead manswhat do you say to it mr holmes  my friend had sat with his head upon his hands sunk in the deepest thought now he rose and rang the bell ames he said when the butler entered where is mr cecil barker now  ill see sir  he came back in a moment to say that barker was in the garden  can you remember ames what mr barker had on his feet last night when you joined him in the study  yes mr holmes he had a pair of bedroom slippers i brought him his boots when he went for the police  where are the slippers now  they are still under the chair in the hall  very good ames it is of course important for us to know which tracks may be mr barkers and which from outside  yes sir i may say that i noticed that the slippers were stained with bloodso indeed were my own  that is natural enough considering the condition of the room very good ames we will ring if we want you  a few minutes later we were in the study holmes had brought with him the carpet slippers from the hall as ames had observed the soles of both were dark with blood  strange murmured holmes as he stood in the light of the window and examined them minutely very strange indeed  stooping with one of his quick feline pounces he placed the slipper upon the blood mark on the sill it exactly corresponded he smiled in silence at his colleagues  the inspector was transfigured with excitement his native accent rattled like a stick upon railings  man he cried theres not a doubt of it barker has just marked the window himself its a good deal broader than any bootmark i mind that you said it was a splayfoot and heres the explanation but whats the game mr holmeswhats the game  ay whats the game my friend repeated thoughtfully  white mason chuckled and rubbed his fat hands together in his professional satisfaction i said it was a snorter he cried and a real snorter it is     chapter 6a dawning light    the three detectives had many matters of detail into which to inquire so i returned alone to our modest quarters at the village inn but before doing so i took a stroll in the curious oldworld garden which flanked the house rows of very ancient yew trees cut into strange designs girded it round inside was a beautiful stretch of lawn with an old sundial in the middle the whole effect so soothing and restful that it was welcome to my somewhat jangled nerves  in that deeply peaceful atmosphere one could forget or remember only as some fantastic nightmare that darkened study with the sprawling bloodstained figure on the floor and yet as i strolled round it and tried to steep my soul in its gentle balm a strange incident occurred which brought me back to the tragedy and left a sinister impression in my mind  i have said that a decoration of yew trees circled the garden at the end farthest from the house they thickened into a continuous hedge on the other side of this hedge concealed from the eyes of anyone approaching from the direction of the house there was a stone seat as i approached the spot i was aware of voices some remark in the deep tones of a man answered by a little ripple of feminine laughter  an instant later i had come round the end of the hedge and my eyes lit upon mrs douglas and the man barker before they were aware of my presence her appearance gave me a shock in the diningroom she had been demure and discreet now all pretense of grief had passed away from her her eyes shone with the joy of living and her face still quivered with amusement at some remark of her companion he sat forward his hands clasped and his forearms on his knees with an answering smile upon his bold handsome face in an instantbut it was just one instant too latethey resumed their solemn masks as my figure came into view a hurried word or two passed between them and then barker rose and came towards me  excuse me sir said he but am i addressing dr watson  i bowed with a coldness which showed i dare say very plainly the impression which had been produced upon my mind  we thought that it was probably you as your friendship with mr sherlock holmes is so well known would you mind coming over and speaking to mrs douglas for one instant  i followed him with a dour face very clearly i could see in my minds eye that shattered figure on the floor here within a few hours of the tragedy were his wife and his nearest friend laughing together behind a bush in the garden which had been his i greeted the lady with reserve i had grieved with her grief in the dining room now i met her appealing gaze with an unresponsive eye  i fear that you think me callous and hardhearted said she  i shrugged my shoulders it is no business of mine said i  perhaps some day you will do me justice if you only realized  there is no need why dr watson should realize said barker quickly as he has himself said it is no possible business of his  exactly said i and so i will beg leave to resume my walk  one moment dr watson cried the woman in a pleading voice there is one question which you can answer with more authority than anyone else in the world and it may make a very great difference to me you know mr holmes and his relations with the police better than anyone else can supposing that a matter were brought confidentially to his knowledge is it absolutely necessary that he should pass it on to the detectives  yes thats it said barker eagerly is he on his own or is he entirely in with them  i really dont know that i should be justified in discussing such a point  i begi implore that you will dr watson i assure you that you will be helping ushelping me greatly if you will guide us on that point  there was such a ring of sincerity in the womans voice that for the instant i forgot all about her levity and was moved only to do her will  mr holmes is an independent investigator i said he is his own master and would act as his own judgment directed at the same time he would naturally feel loyalty towards the officials who were working on the same case and he would not conceal from them anything which would help them in bringing a criminal to justice beyond this i can say nothing and i would refer you to mr holmes himself if you wanted fuller information  so saying i raised my hat and went upon my way leaving them still seated behind that concealing hedge i looked back as i rounded the far end of it and saw that they were still talking very earnestly together and as they were gazing after me it was clear that it was our interview that was the subject of their debate  i wish none of their confidences said holmes when i reported to him what had occurred he had spent the whole afternoon at the manor house in consultation with his two colleagues and returned about five with a ravenous appetite for a high tea which i had ordered for him no confidences watson for they are mighty awkward if it comes to an arrest for conspiracy and murder  you think it will come to that  he was in his most cheerful and debonair humour my dear watson when i have exterminated that fourth egg i shall be ready to put you in touch with the whole situation i dont say that we have fathomed itfar from itbut when we have traced the missing dumbbell  the dumbbell  dear me watson is it possible that you have not penetrated the fact that the case hangs upon the missing dumbbell well well you need not be downcast for between ourselves i dont think that either inspector mac or the excellent local practitioner has grasped the overwhelming importance of this incident one dumbbell watson consider an athlete with one dumbbell picture to yourself the unilateral development the imminent danger of a spinal curvature shocking watson shocking  he sat with his mouth full of toast and his eyes sparkling with mischief watching my intellectual entanglement the mere sight of his excellent appetite was an assurance of success for i had very clear recollections of days and nights without a thought of food when his baffled mind had chafed before some problem while his thin eager features became more attenuated with the asceticism of complete mental concentration finally he lit his pipe and sitting in the inglenook of the old village inn he talked slowly and at random about his case rather as one who thinks aloud than as one who makes a considered statement  a lie watsona great big thumping obtrusive uncompromising liethats what meets us on the threshold there is our starting point the whole story told by barker is a lie but barkers story is corroborated by mrs douglas therefore she is lying also they are both lying and in a conspiracy so now we have the clear problem why are they lying and what is the truth which they are trying so hard to conceal let us try watson you and i if we can get behind the lie and reconstruct the truth  how do i know that they are lying because it is a clumsy fabrication which simply could not be true consider according to the story given to us the assassin had less than a minute after the murder had been committed to take that ring which was under another ring from the dead mans finger to replace the other ringa thing which he would surely never have doneand to put that singular card beside his victim i say that this was obviously impossible  you may arguebut i have too much respect for your judgment watson to think that you will do sothat the ring may have been taken before the man was killed the fact that the candle had been lit only a short time shows that there had been no lengthy interview was douglas from what we hear of his fearless character a man who would be likely to give up his wedding ring at such short notice or could we conceive of his giving it up at all no no watson the assassin was alone with the dead man for some time with the lamp lit of that i have no doubt at all  but the gunshot was apparently the cause of death therefore the shot must have been fired some time earlier than we are told but there could be no mistake about such a matter as that we are in the presence therefore of a deliberate conspiracy upon the part of the two people who heard the gunshotof the man barker and of the woman douglas when on the top of this i am able to show that the blood mark on the windowsill was deliberately placed there by barker in order to give a false clue to the police you will admit that the case grows dark against him  now we have to ask ourselves at what hour the murder actually did occur up to halfpast ten the servants were moving about the house so it was certainly not before that time at a quarter to eleven they had all gone to their rooms with the exception of ames who was in the pantry i have been trying some experiments after you left us this afternoon and i find that no noise which macdonald can make in the study can penetrate to me in the pantry when the doors are all shut  it is otherwise however from the housekeepers room it is not so far down the corridor and from it i could vaguely hear a voice when it was very loudly raised the sound from a shotgun is to some extent muffled when the discharge is at very close range as it undoubtedly was in this instance it would not be very loud and yet in the silence of the night it should have easily penetrated to mrs allens room she is as she has told us somewhat deaf but none the less she mentioned in her evidence that she did hear something like a door slamming half an hour before the alarm was given half an hour before the alarm was given would be a quarter to eleven i have no doubt that what she heard was the report of the gun and that this was the real instant of the murder  if this is so we have now to determine what barker and mrs douglas presuming that they are not the actual murderers could have been doing from quarter to eleven when the sound of the shot brought them down until quarter past eleven when they rang the bell and summoned the servants what were they doing and why did they not instantly give the alarm that is the question which faces us and when it has been answered we shall surely have gone some way to solve our problem  i am convinced myself said i that there is an understanding between those two people she must be a heartless creature to sit laughing at some jest within a few hours of her husbands murder  exactly she does not shine as a wife even in her own account of what occurred i am not a wholesouled admirer of womankind as you are aware watson but my experience of life has taught me that there are few wives having any regard for their husbands who would let any mans spoken word stand between them and that husbands dead body should i ever marry watson i should hope to inspire my wife with some feeling which would prevent her from being walked off by a housekeeper when my corpse was lying within a few yards of her it was badly stagemanaged for even the rawest investigators must be struck by the absence of the usual feminine ululation if there had been nothing else this incident alone would have suggested a prearranged conspiracy to my mind  you think then definitely that barker and mrs douglas are guilty of the murder  there is an appalling directness about your questions watson said holmes shaking his pipe at me they come at me like bullets if you put it that mrs douglas and barker know the truth about the murder and are conspiring to conceal it then i can give you a wholesouled answer i am sure they do but your more deadly proposition is not so clear let us for a moment consider the difficulties which stand in the way  we will suppose that this couple are united by the bonds of a guilty love and that they have determined to get rid of the man who stands between them it is a large supposition for discreet inquiry among servants and others has failed to corroborate it in any way on the contrary there is a good deal of evidence that the douglases were very attached to each other  that i am sure cannot be true said i thinking of the beautiful smiling face in the garden  well at least they gave that impression however we will suppose that they are an extraordinarily astute couple who deceive everyone upon this point and conspire to murder the husband he happens to be a man over whose head some danger hangs  we have only their word for that  holmes looked thoughtful i see watson you are sketching out a theory by which everything they say from the beginning is false according to your idea there was never any hidden menace or secret society or valley of fear or boss macsomebody or anything else well that is a good sweeping generalization let us see what that brings us to they invent this theory to account for the crime they then play up to the idea by leaving this bicycle in the park as proof of the existence of some outsider the stain on the windowsill conveys the same idea so does the card on the body which might have been prepared in the house that all fits into your hypothesis watson but now we come on the nasty angular uncompromising bits which wont slip into their places why a cutoff shotgun of all weaponsand an american one at that how could they be so sure that the sound of it would not bring someone on to them its a mere chance as it is that mrs allen did not start out to inquire for the slamming door why did your guilty couple do all this watson  i confess that i cant explain it  then again if a woman and her lover conspire to murder a husband are they going to advertise their guilt by ostentatiously removing his wedding ring after his death does that strike you as very probable watson  no it does not  and once again if the thought of leaving a bicycle concealed outside had occurred to you would it really have seemed worth doing when the dullest detective would naturally say this is an obvious blind as the bicycle is the first thing which the fugitive needed in order to make his escape  i can conceive of no explanation  and yet there should be no combination of events for which the wit of man cannot conceive an explanation simply as a mental exercise without any assertion that it is true let me indicate a possible line of thought it is i admit mere imagination but how often is imagination the mother of truth  we will suppose that there was a guilty secret a really shameful secret in the life of this man douglas this leads to his murder by someone who is we will suppose an avenger someone from outside this avenger for some reason which i confess i am still at a loss to explain took the dead mans wedding ring the vendetta might conceivably date back to the mans first marriage and the ring be taken for some such reason  before this avenger got away barker and the wife had reached the room the assassin convinced them that any attempt to arrest him would lead to the publication of some hideous scandal they were converted to this idea and preferred to let him go for this purpose they probably lowered the bridge which can be done quite noiselessly and then raised it again he made his escape and for some reason thought that he could do so more safely on foot than on the bicycle he therefore left his machine where it would not be discovered until he had got safely away so far we are within the bounds of possibility are we not  well it is possible no doubt said i with some reserve  we have to remember watson that whatever occurred is certainly something very extraordinary well now to continue our supposititious case the couplenot necessarily a guilty couplerealize after the murderer is gone that they have placed themselves in a position in which it may be difficult for them to prove that they did not themselves either do the deed or connive at it they rapidly and rather clumsily met the situation the mark was put by barkers bloodstained slipper upon the windowsill to suggest how the fugitive got away they obviously were the two who must have heard the sound of the gun so they gave the alarm exactly as they would have done but a good half hour after the event  and how do you propose to prove all this  well if there were an outsider he may be traced and taken that would be the most effective of all proofs but if notwell the resources of science are far from being exhausted i think that an evening alone in that study would help me much  an evening alone  i propose to go up there presently i have arranged it with the estimable ames who is by no means wholehearted about barker i shall sit in that room and see if its atmosphere brings me inspiration im a believer in the genius loci you smile friend watson well we shall see by the way you have that big umbrella of yours have you not  it is here  well ill borrow that if i may  certainlybut what a wretched weapon if there is danger  nothing serious my dear watson or i should certainly ask for your assistance but ill take the umbrella at present i am only awaiting the return of our colleagues from tunbridge wells where they are at present engaged in trying for a likely owner to the bicycle  it was nightfall before inspector macdonald and white mason came back from their expedition and they arrived exultant reporting a great advance in our investigation  man ill admeet that i had my doubts if there was ever an outsider said macdonald but thats all past now weve had the bicycle identified and we have a description of our man so thats a long step on our journey  it sounds to me like the beginning of the end said holmes im sure i congratulate you both with all my heart  well i started from the fact that mr douglas had seemed disturbed since the day before when he had been at tunbridge wells it was at tunbridge wells then that he had become conscious of some danger it was clear therefore that if a man had come over with a bicycle it was from tunbridge wells that he might be expected to have come we took the bicycle over with us and showed it at the hotels it was identified at once by the manager of the eagle commercial as belonging to a man named hargrave who had taken a room there two days before this bicycle and a small valise were his whole belongings he had registered his name as coming from london but had given no address the valise was london made and the contents were british but the man himself was undoubtedly an american  well well said holmes gleefully you have indeed done some solid work while i have been sitting spinning theories with my friend its a lesson in being practical mr mac  ay its just that mr holmes said the inspector with satisfaction  but this may all fit in with your theories i remarked  that may or may not be but let us hear the end mr mac was there nothing to identify this man  so little that it was evident that he had carefully guarded himself against identification there were no papers or letters and no marking upon the clothes a cycle map of the county lay on his bedroom table he had left the hotel after breakfast yesterday morning on his bicycle and no more was heard of him until our inquiries  thats what puzzles me mr holmes said white mason if the fellow did not want the hue and cry raised over him one would imagine that he would have returned and remained at the hotel as an inoffensive tourist as it is he must know that he will be reported to the police by the hotel manager and that his disappearance will be connected with the murder  so one would imagine still he has been justified of his wisdom up to date at any rate since he has not been taken but his descriptionwhat of that  macdonald referred to his notebook here we have it so far as they could give it they dont seem to have taken any very particular stock of him but still the porter the clerk and the chambermaid are all agreed that this about covers the points he was a man about five foot nine in height fifty or so years of age his hair slightly grizzled a grayish moustache a curved nose and a face which all of them described as fierce and forbidding  well bar the expression that might almost be a description of douglas himself said holmes he is just over fifty with grizzled hair and moustache and about the same height did you get anything else  he was dressed in a heavy gray suit with a reefer jacket and he wore a short yellow overcoat and a soft cap  what about the shotgun  it is less than two feet long it could very well have fitted into his valise he could have carried it inside his overcoat without difficulty  and how do you consider that all this bears upon the general case  well mr holmes said macdonald when we have got our manand you may be sure that i had his description on the wires within five minutes of hearing itwe shall be better able to judge but even as it stands we have surely gone a long way we know that an american calling himself hargrave came to tunbridge wells two days ago with bicycle and valise in the latter was a sawedoff shotgun so he came with the deliberate purpose of crime yesterday morning he set off for this place on his bicycle with his gun concealed in his overcoat no one saw him arrive so far as we can learn but he need not pass through the village to reach the park gates and there are many cyclists upon the road presumably he at once concealed his cycle among the laurels where it was found and possibly lurked there himself with his eye on the house waiting for mr douglas to come out the shotgun is a strange weapon to use inside a house but he had intended to use it outside and there it has very obvious advantages as it would be impossible to miss with it and the sound of shots is so common in an english sporting neighbourhood that no particular notice would be taken  that is all very clear said holmes  well mr douglas did not appear what was he to do next he left his bicycle and approached the house in the twilight he found the bridge down and no one about he took his chance intending no doubt to make some excuse if he met anyone he met no one he slipped into the first room that he saw and concealed himself behind the curtain thence he could see the drawbridge go up and he knew that his only escape was through the moat he waited until quarterpast eleven when mr douglas upon his usual nightly round came into the room he shot him and escaped as arranged he was aware that the bicycle would be described by the hotel people and be a clue against him so he left it there and made his way by some other means to london or to some safe hiding place which he had already arranged how is that mr holmes  well mr mac it is very good and very clear so far as it goes that is your end of the story my end is that the crime was committed half an hour earlier than reported that mrs douglas and barker are both in a conspiracy to conceal something that they aided the murderers escapeor at least that they reached the room before he escapedand that they fabricated evidence of his escape through the window whereas in all probability they had themselves let him go by lowering the bridge thats my reading of the first half  the two detectives shook their heads  well mr holmes if this is true we only tumble out of one mystery into another said the london inspector  and in some ways a worse one added white mason the lady has never been in america in all her life what possible connection could she have with an american assassin which would cause her to shelter him  i freely admit the difficulties said holmes i propose to make a little investigation of my own tonight and it is just possible that it may contribute something to the common cause  can we help you mr holmes  no no darkness and dr watsons umbrellamy wants are simple and ames the faithful ames no doubt he will stretch a point for me all my lines of thought lead me back invariably to the one basic questionwhy should an athletic man develop his frame upon so unnatural an instrument as a single dumbbell  it was late that night when holmes returned from his solitary excursion we slept in a doublebedded room which was the best that the little country inn could do for us i was already asleep when i was partly awakened by his entrance  well holmes i murmured have you found anything out  he stood beside me in silence his candle in his hand then the tall lean figure inclined towards me i say watson he whispered would you be afraid to sleep in the same room with a lunatic a man with softening of the brain an idiot whose mind has lost its grip  not in the least i answered in astonishment  ah thats lucky he said and not another word would he utter that night     chapter 7the solution    next morning after breakfast we found inspector macdonald and white mason seated in close consultation in the small parlour of the local police sergeant on the table in front of them were piled a number of letters and telegrams which they were carefully sorting and docketing three had been placed on one side  still on the track of the elusive bicyclist holmes asked cheerfully what is the latest news of the ruffian  macdonald pointed ruefully to his heap of correspondence  he is at present reported from leicester nottingham southampton derby east ham richmond and fourteen other places in three of themeast ham leicester and liverpoolthere is a clear case against him and he has actually been arrested the country seems to be full of the fugitives with yellow coats  dear me said holmes sympathetically now mr mac and you mr white mason i wish to give you a very earnest piece of advice when i went into this case with you i bargained as you will no doubt remember that i should not present you with halfproved theories but that i should retain and work out my own ideas until i had satisfied myself that they were correct for this reason i am not at the present moment telling you all that is in my mind on the other hand i said that i would play the game fairly by you and i do not think it is a fair game to allow you for one unnecessary moment to waste your energies upon a profitless task therefore i am here to advise you this morning and my advice to you is summed up in three wordsabandon the case  macdonald and white mason stared in amazement at their celebrated colleague  you consider it hopeless cried the inspector  i consider your case to be hopeless i do not consider that it is hopeless to arrive at the truth  but this cyclist he is not an invention we have his description his valise his bicycle the fellow must be somewhere why should we not get him  yes yes no doubt he is somewhere and no doubt we shall get him but i would not have you waste your energies in east ham or liverpool i am sure that we can find some shorter cut to a result  you are holding something back its hardly fair of you mr holmes the inspector was annoyed  you know my methods of work mr mac but i will hold it back for the shortest time possible i only wish to verify my details in one way which can very readily be done and then i make my bow and return to london leaving my results entirely at your service i owe you too much to act otherwise for in all my experience i cannot recall any more singular and interesting study  this is clean beyond me mr holmes we saw you when we returned from tunbridge wells last night and you were in general agreement with our results what has happened since then to give you a completely new idea of the case  well since you ask me i spent as i told you that i would some hours last night at the manor house  well what happened  ah i can only give you a very general answer to that for the moment by the way i have been reading a short but clear and interesting account of the old building purchasable at the modest sum of one penny from the local tobacconist  here holmes drew a small tract embellished with a rude engraving of the ancient manor house from his waistcoat pocket  it immensely adds to the zest of an investigation my dear mr mac when one is in conscious sympathy with the historical atmosphere of ones surroundings dont look so impatient for i assure you that even so bald an account as this raises some sort of picture of the past in ones mind permit me to give you a sample erected in the fifth year of the reign of james i and standing upon the site of a much older building the manor house of birlstone presents one of the finest surviving examples of the moated jacobean residence  you are making fools of us mr holmes  tut tut mr macthe first sign of temper i have detected in you well i wont read it verbatim since you feel so strongly upon the subject but when i tell you that there is some account of the taking of the place by a parliamentary colonel in 1644 of the concealment of charles for several days in the course of the civil war and finally of a visit there by the second george you will admit that there are various associations of interest connected with this ancient house  i dont doubt it mr holmes but that is no business of ours  is it not is it not breadth of view my dear mr mac is one of the essentials of our profession the interplay of ideas and the oblique uses of knowledge are often of extraordinary interest you will excuse these remarks from one who though a mere connoisseur of crime is still rather older and perhaps more experienced than yourself  im the first to admit that said the detective heartily you get to your point i admit but you have such a deuced roundthecorner way of doing it  well well ill drop past history and get down to presentday facts i called last night as i have already said at the manor house i did not see either barker or mrs douglas i saw no necessity to disturb them but i was pleased to hear that the lady was not visibly pining and that she had partaken of an excellent dinner my visit was specially made to the good mr ames with whom i exchanged some amiabilities which culminated in his allowing me without reference to anyone else to sit alone for a time in the study  what with that i ejaculated  no no everything is now in order you gave permission for that mr mac as i am informed the room was in its normal state and in it i passed an instructive quarter of an hour  what were you doing  well not to make a mystery of so simple a matter i was looking for the missing dumbbell it has always bulked rather large in my estimate of the case i ended by finding it  where  ah there we come to the edge of the unexplored let me go a little further a very little further and i will promise that you shall share everything that i know  well were bound to take you on your own terms said the inspector but when it comes to telling us to abandon the casewhy in the name of goodness should we abandon the case  for the simple reason my dear mr mac that you have not got the first idea what it is that you are investigating  we are investigating the murder of mr john douglas of birlstone manor  yes yes so you are but dont trouble to trace the mysterious gentleman upon the bicycle i assure you that it wont help you  then what do you suggest that we do  i will tell you exactly what to do if you will do it  well im bound to say ive always found you had reason behind all your queer ways ill do what you advise  and you mr white mason  the country detective looked helplessly from one to the other holmes and his methods were new to him well if it is good enough for the inspector it is good enough for me he said at last  capital said holmes well then i should recommend a nice cheery country walk for both of you they tell me that the views from birlstone ridge over the weald are very remarkable no doubt lunch could be got at some suitable hostelry though my ignorance of the country prevents me from recommending one in the evening tired but happy  man this is getting past a joke cried macdonald rising angrily from his chair  well well spend the day as you like said holmes patting him cheerfully upon the shoulder do what you like and go where you will but meet me here before dusk without failwithout fail mr mac  that sounds more like sanity  all of it was excellent advice but i dont insist so long as you are here when i need you but now before we part i want you to write a note to mr barker  well  ill dictate it if you like ready  dear sir  it has struck me that it is our duty to drain the moat in the hope that we may find some  its impossible said the inspector ive made inquiry  tut tut my dear sir please do what i ask you  well go on  in the hope that we may find something which may bear upon our investigation i have made arrangements and the workmen will be at work early tomorrow morning diverting the stream  impossible  diverting the stream so i thought it best to explain matters beforehand  now sign that and send it by hand about four oclock at that hour we shall meet again in this room until then we may each do what we like for i can assure you that this inquiry has come to a definite pause  evening was drawing in when we reassembled holmes was very serious in his manner myself curious and the detectives obviously critical and annoyed  well gentlemen said my friend gravely i am asking you now to put everything to the test with me and you will judge for yourselves whether the observations i have made justify the conclusions to which i have come it is a chill evening and i do not know how long our expedition may last so i beg that you will wear your warmest coats it is of the first importance that we should be in our places before it grows dark so with your permission we shall get started at once  we passed along the outer bounds of the manor house park until we came to a place where there was a gap in the rails which fenced it through this we slipped and then in the gathering gloom we followed holmes until we had reached a shrubbery which lies nearly opposite to the main door and the drawbridge the latter had not been raised holmes crouched down behind the screen of laurels and we all three followed his example  well what are we to do now asked macdonald with some gruffness  possess our souls in patience and make as little noise as possible holmes answered  what are we here for at all i really think that you might treat us with more frankness  holmes laughed watson insists that i am the dramatist in real life said he some touch of the artist wells up within me and calls insistently for a wellstaged performance surely our profession mr mac would be a drab and sordid one if we did not sometimes set the scene so as to glorify our results the blunt accusation the brutal tap upon the shoulderwhat can one make of such a denouement but the quick inference the subtle trap the clever forecast of coming events the triumphant vindication of bold theoriesare these not the pride and the justification of our lifes work at the present moment you thrill with the glamour of the situation and the anticipation of the hunt where would be that thrill if i had been as definite as a timetable i only ask a little patience mr mac and all will be clear to you  well i hope the pride and justification and the rest of it will come before we all get our death of cold said the london detective with comic resignation  we all had good reason to join in the aspiration for our vigil was a long and bitter one slowly the shadows darkened over the long sombre face of the old house a cold damp reek from the moat chilled us to the bones and set our teeth chattering there was a single lamp over the gateway and a steady globe of light in the fatal study everything else was dark and still  how long is this to last asked the inspector finally and what is it we are watching for  i have no more notion than you how long it is to last holmes answered with some asperity if criminals would always schedule their movements like railway trains it would certainly be more convenient for all of us as to what it is wewell thats what we are watching for  as he spoke the bright yellow light in the study was obscured by somebody passing to and fro before it the laurels among which we lay were immediately opposite the window and not more than a hundred feet from it presently it was thrown open with a whining of hinges and we could dimly see the dark outline of a mans head and shoulders looking out into the gloom for some minutes he peered forth in furtive stealthy fashion as one who wishes to be assured that he is unobserved then he leaned forward and in the intense silence we were aware of the soft lapping of agitated water he seemed to be stirring up the moat with something which he held in his hand then suddenly he hauled something in as a fisherman lands a fishsome large round object which obscured the light as it was dragged through the open casement  now cried holmes now  we were all upon our feet staggering after him with our stiffened limbs while he ran swiftly across the bridge and rang violently at the bell there was the rasping of bolts from the other side and the amazed ames stood in the entrance holmes brushed him aside without a word and followed by all of us rushed into the room which had been occupied by the man whom we had been watching  the oil lamp on the table represented the glow which we had seen from outside it was now in the hand of cecil barker who held it towards us as we entered its light shone upon his strong resolute cleanshaved face and his menacing eyes  what the devil is the meaning of all this he cried what are you after anyhow  holmes took a swift glance round and then pounced upon a sodden bundle tied together with cord which lay where it had been thrust under the writing table  this is what we are after mr barkerthis bundle weighted with a dumbbell which you have just raised from the bottom of the moat  barker stared at holmes with amazement in his face how in thunder came you to know anything about it he asked  simply that i put it there  you put it there you  perhaps i should have said replaced it there said holmes you will remember inspector macdonald that i was somewhat struck by the absence of a dumbbell i drew your attention to it but with the pressure of other events you had hardly the time to give it the consideration which would have enabled you to draw deductions from it when water is near and a weight is missing it is not a very farfetched supposition that something has been sunk in the water the idea was at least worth testing so with the help of ames who admitted me to the room and the crook of dr watsons umbrella i was able last night to fish up and inspect this bundle  it was of the first importance however that we should be able to prove who placed it there this we accomplished by the very obvious device of announcing that the moat would be dried tomorrow which had of course the effect that whoever had hidden the bundle would most certainly withdraw it the moment that darkness enabled him to do so we have no less than four witnesses as to who it was who took advantage of the opportunity and so mr barker i think the word lies now with you  sherlock holmes put the sopping bundle upon the table beside the lamp and undid the cord which bound it from within he extracted a dumbbell which he tossed down to its fellow in the corner next he drew forth a pair of boots american as you perceive he remarked pointing to the toes then he laid upon the table a long deadly sheathed knife finally he unravelled a bundle of clothing comprising a complete set of underclothes socks a gray tweed suit and a short yellow overcoat  the clothes are commonplace remarked holmes save only the overcoat which is full of suggestive touches he held it tenderly towards the light here as you perceive is the inner pocket prolonged into the lining in such fashion as to give ample space for the truncated fowling piece the tailors tab is on the neckneal outfitter vermissa usa i have spent an instructive afternoon in the rectors library and have enlarged my knowledge by adding the fact that vermissa is a flourishing little town at the head of one of the best known coal and iron valleys in the united states i have some recollection mr barker that you associated the coal districts with mr douglass first wife and it would surely not be too farfetched an inference that the vv upon the card by the dead body might stand for vermissa valley or that this very valley which sends forth emissaries of murder may be that valley of fear of which we have heard so much is fairly clear and now mr barker i seem to be standing rather in the way of your explanation  it was a sight to see cecil barkers expressive face during this exposition of the great detective anger amazement consternation and indecision swept over it in turn finally he took refuge in a somewhat acrid irony  you know such a lot mr holmes perhaps you had better tell us some more he sneered  i have no doubt that i could tell you a great deal more mr barker but it would come with a better grace from you  oh you think so do you well all i can say is that if theres any secret here it is not my secret and i am not the man to give it away  well if you take that line mr barker said the inspector quietly we must just keep you in sight until we have the warrant and can hold you  you can do what you damn please about that said barker defiantly  the proceedings seemed to have come to a definite end so far as he was concerned for one had only to look at that granite face to realize that no peine forte et dure would ever force him to plead against his will the deadlock was broken however by a womans voice mrs douglas had been standing listening at the half opened door and now she entered the room  you have done enough for now cecil said she whatever comes of it in the future you have done enough  enough and more than enough remarked sherlock holmes gravely i have every sympathy with you madam and should strongly urge you to have some confidence in the common sense of our jurisdiction and to take the police voluntarily into your complete confidence it may be that i am myself at fault for not following up the hint which you conveyed to me through my friend dr watson but at that time i had every reason to believe that you were directly concerned in the crime now i am assured that this is not so at the same time there is much that is unexplained and i should strongly recommend that you ask mr douglas to tell us his own story  mrs douglas gave a cry of astonishment at holmess words the detectives and i must have echoed it when we were aware of a man who seemed to have emerged from the wall who advanced now from the gloom of the corner in which he had appeared mrs douglas turned and in an instant her arms were round him barker had seized his outstretched hand  its best this way jack his wife repeated i am sure that it is best  indeed yes mr douglas said sherlock holmes i am sure that you will find it best  the man stood blinking at us with the dazed look of one who comes from the dark into the light it was a remarkable face bold gray eyes a strong shortclipped grizzled moustache a square projecting chin and a humorous mouth he took a good look at us all and then to my amazement he advanced to me and handed me a bundle of paper  ive heard of you said he in a voice which was not quite english and not quite american but was altogether mellow and pleasing you are the historian of this bunch well dr watson youve never had such a story as that pass through your hands before and ill lay my last dollar on that tell it your own way but there are the facts and you cant miss the public so long as you have those ive been cooped up two days and ive spent the daylight hoursas much daylight as i could get in that rat trapin putting the thing into words youre welcome to themyou and your public theres the story of the valley of fear  thats the past mr douglas said sherlock holmes quietly what we desire now is to hear your story of the present  youll have it sir said douglas may i smoke as i talk well thank you mr holmes youre a smoker yourself if i remember right and youll guess what it is to be sitting for two days with tobacco in your pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away he leaned against the mantelpiece and sucked at the cigar which holmes had handed him ive heard of you mr holmes i never guessed that i should meet you but before you are through with that he nodded at my papers you will say ive brought you something fresh  inspector macdonald had been staring at the newcomer with the greatest amazement well this fairly beats me he cried at last if you are mr john douglas of birlstone manor then whose death have we been investigating for these two days and where in the world have you sprung from now you seemed to me to come out of the floor like a jackinabox  ah mr mac said holmes shaking a reproving forefinger you would not read that excellent local compilation which described the concealment of king charles people did not hide in those days without excellent hiding places and the hiding place that has once been used may be again i had persuaded myself that we should find mr douglas under this roof  and how long have you been playing this trick upon us mr holmes said the inspector angrily how long have you allowed us to waste ourselves upon a search that you knew to be an absurd one  not one instant my dear mr mac only last night did i form my views of the case as they could not be put to the proof until this evening i invited you and your colleague to take a holiday for the day pray what more could i do when i found the suit of clothes in the moat it at once became apparent to me that the body we had found could not have been the body of mr john douglas at all but must be that of the bicyclist from tunbridge wells no other conclusion was possible therefore i had to determine where mr john douglas himself could be and the balance of probability was that with the connivance of his wife and his friend he was concealed in a house which had such conveniences for a fugitive and awaiting quieter times when he could make his final escape  well you figured it out about right said douglas approvingly i thought id dodge your british law for i was not sure how i stood under it and also i saw my chance to throw these hounds once for all off my track mind you from first to last i have done nothing to be ashamed of and nothing that i would not do again but youll judge that for yourselves when i tell you my story never mind warning me inspector im ready to stand pat upon the truth  im not going to begin at the beginning thats all there he indicated my bundle of papers and a mighty queer yarn youll find it it all comes down to this that there are some men that have good cause to hate me and would give their last dollar to know that they had got me so long as i am alive and they are alive there is no safety in this world for me they hunted me from chicago to california then they chased me out of america but when i married and settled down in this quiet spot i thought my last years were going to be peaceable  i never explained to my wife how things were why should i pull her into it she would never have a quiet moment again but would always be imagining trouble i fancy she knew something for i may have dropped a word here or a word there but until yesterday after you gentlemen had seen her she never knew the rights of the matter she told you all she knew and so did barker here for on the night when this thing happened there was mighty little time for explanations she knows everything now and i would have been a wiser man if i had told her sooner but it was a hard question dear he took her hand for an instant in his own and i acted for the best  well gentlemen the day before these happenings i was over in tunbridge wells and i got a glimpse of a man in the street it was only a glimpse but i have a quick eye for these things and i never doubted who it was it was the worst enemy i had among them allone who has been after me like a hungry wolf after a caribou all these years i knew there was trouble coming and i came home and made ready for it i guessed id fight through it all right on my own my luck was a proverb in the states about 76 i never doubted that it would be with me still  i was on my guard all that next day and never went out into the park its as well or hed have had the drop on me with that buckshot gun of his before ever i could draw on him after the bridge was upmy mind was always more restful when that bridge was up in the eveningsi put the thing clear out of my head i never dreamed of his getting into the house and waiting for me but when i made my round in my dressing gown as was my habit i had no sooner entered the study than i scented danger i guess when a man has had dangers in his lifeand ive had more than most in my timethere is a kind of sixth sense that waves the red flag i saw the signal clear enough and yet i couldnt tell you why next instant i spotted a boot under the window curtain and then i saw why plain enough  id just the one candle that was in my hand but there was a good light from the hall lamp through the open door i put down the candle and jumped for a hammer that id left on the mantel at the same moment he sprang at me i saw the glint of a knife and i lashed at him with the hammer i got him somewhere for the knife tinkled down on the floor he dodged round the table as quick as an eel and a moment later hed got his gun from under his coat i heard him cock it but i had got hold of it before he could fire i had it by the barrel and we wrestled for it all ends up for a minute or more it was death to the man that lost his grip  he never lost his grip but he got it butt downward for a moment too long maybe it was i that pulled the trigger maybe we just jolted it off between us anyhow he got both barrels in the face and there i was staring down at all that was left of ted baldwin id recognized him in the township and again when he sprang for me but his own mother wouldnt recognize him as i saw him then im used to rough work but i fairly turned sick at the sight of him  i was hanging on the side of the table when barker came hurrying down i heard my wife coming and i ran to the door and stopped her it was no sight for a woman i promised id come to her soon i said a word or two to barkerhe took it all in at a glanceand we waited for the rest to come along but there was no sign of them then we understood that they could hear nothing and that all that had happened was known only to ourselves  it was at that instant that the idea came to me i was fairly dazzled by the brilliance of it the mans sleeve had slipped up and there was the branded mark of the lodge upon his forearm see here  the man whom we had known as douglas turned up his own coat and cuff to show a brown triangle within a circle exactly like that which we had seen upon the dead man  it was the sight of that which started me on it i seemed to see it all clear at a glance there were his height and hair and figure about the same as my own no one could swear to his face poor devil i brought down this suit of clothes and in a quarter of an hour barker and i had put my dressing gown on him and he lay as you found him we tied all his things into a bundle and i weighted them with the only weight i could find and put them through the window the card he had meant to lay upon my body was lying beside his own  my rings were put on his finger but when it came to the wedding ring he held out his muscular hand you can see for yourselves that i had struck the limit i have not moved it since the day i was married and it would have taken a file to get it off i dont know anyhow that i should have cared to part with it but if i had wanted to i couldnt so we just had to leave that detail to take care of itself on the other hand i brought a bit of plaster down and put it where i am wearing one myself at this instant you slipped up there mr holmes clever as you are for if you had chanced to take off that plaster you would have found no cut underneath it  well that was the situation if i could lie low for a while and then get away where i could be joined by my widow we should have a chance at last of living in peace for the rest of our lives these devils would give me no rest so long as i was above ground but if they saw in the papers that baldwin had got his man there would be an end of all my troubles i hadnt much time to make it all clear to barker and to my wife but they understood enough to be able to help me i knew all about this hiding place so did ames but it never entered his head to connect it with the matter i retired into it and it was up to barker to do the rest  i guess you can fill in for yourselves what he did he opened the window and made the mark on the sill to give an idea of how the murderer escaped it was a tall order that but as the bridge was up there was no other way then when everything was fixed he rang the bell for all he was worth what happened afterward you know and so gentlemen you can do what you please but ive told you the truth and the whole truth so help me god what i ask you now is how do i stand by the english law  there was a silence which was broken by sherlock holmes  the english law is in the main a just law you will get no worse than your deserts from that mr douglas but i would ask you how did this man know that you lived here or how to get into your house or where to hide to get you  i know nothing of this  holmess face was very white and grave the story is not over yet i fear said he you may find worse dangers than the english law or even than your enemies from america i see trouble before you mr douglas youll take my advice and still be on your guard  and now my longsuffering readers i will ask you to come away with me for a time far from the sussex manor house of birlstone and far also from the year of grace in which we made our eventful journey which ended with the strange story of the man who had been known as john douglas i wish you to journey back some twenty years in time and westward some thousands of miles in space that i may lay before you a singular and terrible narrativeso singular and so terrible that you may find it hard to believe that even as i tell it even so did it occur  do not think that i intrude one story before another is finished as you read on you will find that this is not so and when i have detailed those distant events and you have solved this mystery of the past we shall meet once more in those rooms on baker street where this like so many other wonderful happenings will find its end      part 2the scowrers     chapter 1the man    it was the fourth of february in the year 1875 it had been a severe winter and the snow lay deep in the gorges of the gilmerton mountains the steam ploughs had however kept the railroad open and the evening train which connects the long line of coalmining and ironworking settlements was slowly groaning its way up the steep gradients which lead from stagville on the plain to vermissa the central township which lies at the head of vermissa valley from this point the track sweeps downward to bartons crossing helmdale and the purely agricultural county of merton it was a single track railroad but at every sidingand they were numerouslong lines of trucks piled with coal and iron ore told of the hidden wealth which had brought a rude population and a bustling life to this most desolate corner of the united states of america  for desolate it was little could the first pioneer who had traversed it have ever imagined that the fairest prairies and the most lush water pastures were valueless compared to this gloomy land of black crag and tangled forest above the dark and often scarcely penetrable woods upon their flanks the high bare crowns of the mountains white snow and jagged rock towered upon each flank leaving a long winding tortuous valley in the centre up this the little train was slowly crawling  the oil lamps had just been lit in the leading passenger car a long bare carriage in which some twenty or thirty people were seated the greater number of these were workmen returning from their days toil in the lower part of the valley at least a dozen by their grimed faces and the safety lanterns which they carried proclaimed themselves miners these sat smoking in a group and conversed in low voices glancing occasionally at two men on the opposite side of the car whose uniforms and badges showed them to be policemen  several women of the labouring class and one or two travellers who might have been small local storekeepers made up the rest of the company with the exception of one young man in a corner by himself it is with this man that we are concerned take a good look at him for he is worth it  he is a freshcomplexioned middlesized young man not far one would guess from his thirtieth year he has large shrewd humorous gray eyes which twinkle inquiringly from time to time as he looks round through his spectacles at the people about him it is easy to see that he is of a sociable and possibly simple disposition anxious to be friendly to all men anyone could pick him at once as gregarious in his habits and communicative in his nature with a quick wit and a ready smile and yet the man who studied him more closely might discern a certain firmness of jaw and grim tightness about the lips which would warn him that there were depths beyond and that this pleasant brownhaired young irishman might conceivably leave his mark for good or evil upon any society to which he was introduced  having made one or two tentative remarks to the nearest miner and receiving only short gruff replies the traveller resigned himself to uncongenial silence staring moodily out of the window at the fading landscape  it was not a cheering prospect through the growing gloom there pulsed the red glow of the furnaces on the sides of the hills great heaps of slag and dumps of cinders loomed up on each side with the high shafts of the collieries towering above them huddled groups of mean wooden houses the windows of which were beginning to outline themselves in light were scattered here and there along the line and the frequent halting places were crowded with their swarthy inhabitants  the iron and coal valleys of the vermissa district were no resorts for the leisured or the cultured everywhere there were stern signs of the crudest battle of life the rude work to be done and the rude strong workers who did it  the young traveller gazed out into this dismal country with a face of mingled repulsion and interest which showed that the scene was new to him at intervals he drew from his pocket a bulky letter to which he referred and on the margins of which he scribbled some notes once from the back of his waist he produced something which one would hardly have expected to find in the possession of so mildmannered a man it was a navy revolver of the largest size as he turned it slantwise to the light the glint upon the rims of the copper shells within the drum showed that it was fully loaded he quickly restored it to his secret pocket but not before it had been observed by a working man who had seated himself upon the adjoining bench  hullo mate said he you seem heeled and ready  the young man smiled with an air of embarrassment  yes said he we need them sometimes in the place i come from  and where may that be  im last from chicago  a stranger in these parts  yes  you may find you need it here said the workman  ah is that so the young man seemed interested  have you heard nothing of doings hereabouts  nothing out of the way  why i thought the country was full of it youll hear quick enough what made you come here  i heard there was always work for a willing man  are you a member of the union  sure  then youll get your job i guess have you any friends  not yet but i have the means of making them  hows that then  i am one of the eminent order of freemen theres no town without a lodge and where there is a lodge ill find my friends  the remark had a singular effect upon his companion he glanced round suspiciously at the others in the car the miners were still whispering among themselves the two police officers were dozing he came across seated himself close to the young traveller and held out his hand  put it there he said  a handgrip passed between the two  i see you speak the truth said the workman but its well to make certain he raised his right hand to his right eyebrow the traveller at once raised his left hand to his left eyebrow  dark nights are unpleasant said the workman  yes for strangers to travel the other answered  thats good enough im brother scanlan lodge 341 vermissa valley glad to see you in these parts  thank you im brother john mcmurdo lodge 29 chicago bodymaster jh scott but i am in luck to meet a brother so early  well there are plenty of us about you wont find the order more flourishing anywhere in the states than right here in vermissa valley but we could do with some lads like you i cant understand a spry man of the union finding no work to do in chicago  i found plenty of work to do said mcmurdo  then why did you leave  mcmurdo nodded towards the policemen and smiled i guess those chaps would be glad to know he said  scanlan groaned sympathetically in trouble he asked in a whisper  deep  a penitentiary job  and the rest  not a killing  its early days to talk of such things said mcmurdo with the air of a man who had been surprised into saying more than he intended ive my own good reasons for leaving chicago and let that be enough for you who are you that you should take it on yourself to ask such things his gray eyes gleamed with sudden and dangerous anger from behind his glasses  all right mate no offense meant the boys will think none the worse of you whatever you may have done where are you bound for now  vermissa  thats the third halt down the line where are you staying  mcmurdo took out an envelope and held it close to the murky oil lamp here is the addressjacob shafter sheridan street its a boarding house that was recommended by a man i knew in chicago  well i dont know it but vermissa is out of my beat i live at hobsons patch and thats here where we are drawing up but say theres one bit of advice ill give you before we part if youre in trouble in vermissa go straight to the union house and see boss mcginty he is the bodymaster of vermissa lodge and nothing can happen in these parts unless black jack mcginty wants it so long mate maybe well meet in lodge one of these evenings but mind my words if you are in trouble go to boss mcginty  scanlan descended and mcmurdo was left once again to his thoughts night had now fallen and the flames of the frequent furnaces were roaring and leaping in the darkness against their lurid background dark figures were bending and straining twisting and turning with the motion of winch or of windlass to the rhythm of an eternal clank and roar  i guess hell must look something like that said a voice  mcmurdo turned and saw that one of the policemen had shifted in his seat and was staring out into the fiery waste  for that matter said the other policeman i allow that hell must be something like that if there are worse devils down yonder than some we could name its more than id expect i guess you are new to this part young man  well what if i am mcmurdo answered in a surly voice  just this mister that i should advise you to be careful in choosing your friends i dont think id begin with mike scanlan or his gang if i were you  what the hell is it to you who are my friends roared mcmurdo in a voice which brought every head in the carriage round to witness the altercation did i ask you for your advice or did you think me such a sucker that i couldnt move without it you speak when you are spoken to and by the lord youd have to wait a long time if it was me he thrust out his face and grinned at the patrolmen like a snarling dog  the two policemen heavy goodnatured men were taken aback by the extraordinary vehemence with which their friendly advances had been rejected  no offense stranger said one it was a warning for your own good seeing that you are by your own showing new to the place  im new to the place but im not new to you and your kind cried mcmurdo in cold fury i guess youre the same in all places shoving your advice in when nobody asks for it  maybe well see more of you before very long said one of the patrolmen with a grin youre a real handpicked one if i am a judge  i was thinking the same remarked the other i guess we may meet again  im not afraid of you and dont you think it cried mcmurdo my names jack mcmurdosee if you want me youll find me at jacob shafters on sheridan street vermissa so im not hiding from you am i day or night i dare to look the like of you in the facedont make any mistake about that  there was a murmur of sympathy and admiration from the miners at the dauntless demeanour of the newcomer while the two policemen shrugged their shoulders and renewed a conversation between themselves  a few minutes later the train ran into the illlit station and there was a general clearing for vermissa was by far the largest town on the line mcmurdo picked up his leather gripsack and was about to start off into the darkness when one of the miners accosted him  by gar mate you know how to speak to the cops he said in a voice of awe it was grand to hear you let me carry your grip and show you the road im passing shafters on the way to my own shack  there was a chorus of friendly goodnights from the other miners as they passed from the platform before ever he had set foot in it mcmurdo the turbulent had become a character in vermissa  the country had been a place of terror but the town was in its way even more depressing down that long valley there was at least a certain gloomy grandeur in the huge fires and the clouds of drifting smoke while the strength and industry of man found fitting monuments in the hills which he had spilled by the side of his monstrous excavations but the town showed a dead level of mean ugliness and squalor the broad street was churned up by the traffic into a horrible rutted paste of muddy snow the sidewalks were narrow and uneven the numerous gaslamps served only to show more clearly a long line of wooden houses each with its veranda facing the street unkempt and dirty  as they approached the centre of the town the scene was brightened by a row of welllit stores and even more by a cluster of saloons and gaming houses in which the miners spent their hardearned but generous wages  thats the union house said the guide pointing to one saloon which rose almost to the dignity of being a hotel jack mcginty is the boss there  what sort of a man is he mcmurdo asked  what have you never heard of the boss  how could i have heard of him when you know that i am a stranger in these parts  well i thought his name was known clear across the country its been in the papers often enough  what for  well the miner lowered his voiceover the affairs  what affairs  good lord mister you are queer if i must say it without offense theres only one set of affairs that youll hear of in these parts and thats the affairs of the scowrers  why i seem to have read of the scowrers in chicago a gang of murderers are they not  hush on your life cried the miner standing still in alarm and gazing in amazement at his companion man you wont live long in these parts if you speak in the open street like that many a man has had the life beaten out of him for less  well i know nothing about them its only what i have read  and im not saying that you have not read the truth the man looked nervously round him as he spoke peering into the shadows as if he feared to see some lurking danger if killing is murder then god knows there is murder and to spare but dont you dare to breathe the name of jack mcginty in connection with it stranger for every whisper goes back to him and he is not one that is likely to let it pass now thats the house youre after that one standing back from the street youll find old jacob shafter that runs it as honest a man as lives in this township  i thank you said mcmurdo and shaking hands with his new acquaintance he plodded gripsack in hand up the path which led to the dwelling house at the door of which he gave a resounding knock  it was opened at once by someone very different from what he had expected it was a woman young and singularly beautiful she was of the german type blonde and fairhaired with the piquant contrast of a pair of beautiful dark eyes with which she surveyed the stranger with surprise and a pleasing embarrassment which brought a wave of colour over her pale face framed in the bright light of the open doorway it seemed to mcmurdo that he had never seen a more beautiful picture the more attractive for its contrast with the sordid and gloomy surroundings a lovely violet growing upon one of those black slagheaps of the mines would not have seemed more surprising so entranced was he that he stood staring without a word and it was she who broke the silence  i thought it was father said she with a pleasing little touch of a german accent did you come to see him he is down town i expect him back every minute  mcmurdo continued to gaze at her in open admiration until her eyes dropped in confusion before this masterful visitor  no miss he said at last im in no hurry to see him but your house was recommended to me for board i thought it might suit meand now i know it will  you are quick to make up your mind said she with a smile  anyone but a blind man could do as much the other answered  she laughed at the compliment come right in sir she said im miss ettie shafter mr shafters daughter my mothers dead and i run the house you can sit down by the stove in the front room until father comes alongah here he is so you can fix things with him right away  a heavy elderly man came plodding up the path in a few words mcmurdo explained his business a man of the name of murphy had given him the address in chicago he in turn had had it from someone else old shafter was quite ready the stranger made no bones about terms agreed at once to every condition and was apparently fairly flush of money for seven dollars a week paid in advance he was to have board and lodging  so it was that mcmurdo the selfconfessed fugitive from justice took up his abode under the roof of the shafters the first step which was to lead to so long and dark a train of events ending in a far distant land     chapter 2the bodymaster    mcmurdo was a man who made his mark quickly wherever he was the folk around soon knew it within a week he had become infinitely the most important person at shafters there were ten or a dozen boarders there but they were honest foremen or commonplace clerks from the stores of a very different calibre from the young irishman of an evening when they gathered together his joke was always the readiest his conversation the brightest and his song the best he was a born boon companion with a magnetism which drew good humour from all around him  and yet he showed again and again as he had shown in the railway carriage a capacity for sudden fierce anger which compelled the respect and even the fear of those who met him for the law too and all who were connected with it he exhibited a bitter contempt which delighted some and alarmed others of his fellow boarders  from the first he made it evident by his open admiration that the daughter of the house had won his heart from the instant that he had set eyes upon her beauty and her grace he was no backward suitor on the second day he told her that he loved her and from then onward he repeated the same story with an absolute disregard of what she might say to discourage him  someone else he would cry well the worse luck for someone else let him look out for himself am i to lose my lifes chance and all my hearts desire for someone else you can keep on saying no ettie the day will come when you will say yes and im young enough to wait  he was a dangerous suitor with his glib irish tongue and his pretty coaxing ways there was about him also that glamour of experience and of mystery which attracts a womans interest and finally her love he could talk of the sweet valleys of county monaghan from which he came of the lovely distant island the low hills and green meadows of which seemed the more beautiful when imagination viewed them from this place of grime and snow  then he was versed in the life of the cities of the north of detroit and the lumber camps of michigan and finally of chicago where he had worked in a planing mill and afterwards came the hint of romance the feeling that strange things had happened to him in that great city so strange and so intimate that they might not be spoken of he spoke wistfully of a sudden leaving a breaking of old ties a flight into a strange world ending in this dreary valley and ettie listened her dark eyes gleaming with pity and with sympathythose two qualities which may turn so rapidly and so naturally to love   mcmurdo had obtained a temporary job as bookkeeper for he was a welleducated man this kept him out most of the day and he had not found occasion yet to report himself to the head of the lodge of the eminent order of freemen he was reminded of his omission however by a visit one evening from mike scanlan the fellow member whom he had met in the train scanlan the small sharpfaced nervous blackeyed man seemed glad to see him once more after a glass or two of whisky he broached the object of his visit  say mcmurdo said he i remembered your address so i made bold to call im surprised that youve not reported to the bodymaster why havent you seen boss mcginty yet  well i had to find a job i have been busy  you must find time for him if you have none for anything else good lord man youre a fool not to have been down to the union house and registered your name the first morning after you came here if you run against himwell you mustnt thats all  mcmurdo showed mild surprise ive been a member of the lodge for over two years scanlan but i never heard that duties were so pressing as all that  maybe not in chicago  well its the same society here  is it  scanlan looked at him long and fixedly there was something sinister in his eyes  isnt it  youll tell me that in a months time i hear you had a talk with the patrolmen after i left the train  how did you know that  oh it got aboutthings do get about for good and for bad in this district  well yes i told the hounds what i thought of them  by the lord youll be a man after mcgintys heart  what does he hate the police too  scanlan burst out laughing you go and see him my lad said he as he took his leave its not the police but you that hell hate if you dont now take a friends advice and go at once   it chanced that on the same evening mcmurdo had another more pressing interview which urged him in the same direction it may have been that his attentions to ettie had been more evident than before or that they had gradually obtruded themselves into the slow mind of his good german host but whatever the cause the boardinghouse keeper beckoned the young man into his private room and started on the subject without any circumlocution  it seems to me mister said he that you are gettin set on my ettie aint that so or am i wrong  yes that is so the young man answered  vell i vant to tell you right now that it aint no manner of use theres someone slipped in afore you  she told me so  vell you can lay that she told you truth but did she tell you who it vas  no i asked her but she wouldnt tell  i dare say not the leetle baggage perhaps she did not vish to frighten you avay  frighten mcmurdo was on fire in a moment  ah yes my friend you need not be ashamed to be frightened of him it is teddy baldwin  and who the devil is he  he is a boss of scowrers  scowrers ive heard of them before its scowrers here and scowrers there and always in a whisper what are you all afraid of who are the scowrers  the boardinghouse keeper instinctively sank his voice as everyone did who talked about that terrible society the scowrers said he are the eminent order of freemen  the young man stared why i am a member of that order myself  you i vould never have had you in my house if i had known itnot if you vere to pay me a hundred dollar a veek  whats wrong with the order its for charity and good fellowship the rules say so  maybe in some places not here  what is it here  its a murder society thats vat it is  mcmurdo laughed incredulously how can you prove that he asked  prove it are there not fifty murders to prove it vat about milman and van shorst and the nicholson family and old mr hyam and little billy james and the others prove it is there a man or a voman in this valley vat does not know it  see here said mcmurdo earnestly i want you to take back what youve said or else make it good one or the other you must do before i quit this room put yourself in my place here am i a stranger in the town i belong to a society that i know only as an innocent one youll find it through the length and breadth of the states but always as an innocent one now when i am counting upon joining it here you tell me that it is the same as a murder society called the scowrers i guess you owe me either an apology or else an explanation mr shafter  i can but tell you vat the whole vorld knows mister the bosses of the one are the bosses of the other if you offend the one it is the other vat vill strike you we have proved it too often  thats just gossipi want proof said mcmurdo  if you live here long you vill get your proof but i forget that you are yourself one of them you vill soon be as bad as the rest but you vill find other lodgings mister i cannot have you here is it not bad enough that one of these people come courting my ettie and that i dare not turn him down but that i should have another for my boarder yes indeed you shall not sleep here after tonight   mcmurdo found himself under sentence of banishment both from his comfortable quarters and from the girl whom he loved he found her alone in the sittingroom that same evening and he poured his troubles into her ear  sure your father is after giving me notice he said its little i would care if it was just my room but indeed ettie though its only a week that ive known you you are the very breath of life to me and i cant live without you  oh hush mr mcmurdo dont speak so said the girl i have told you have i not that you are too late there is another and if i have not promised to marry him at once at least i can promise no one else  suppose i had been first ettie would i have had a chance  the girl sank her face into her hands i wish to heaven that you had been first she sobbed  mcmurdo was down on his knees before her in an instant for gods sake ettie let it stand at that he cried will you ruin your life and my own for the sake of this promise follow your heart acushla tis a safer guide than any promise before you knew what it was that you were saying  he had seized etties white hand between his own strong brown ones  say that you will be mine and we will face it out together  not here  yes here  no no jack his arms were round her now it could not be here could you take me away  a struggle passed for a moment over mcmurdos face but it ended by setting like granite no here he said ill hold you against the world ettie right here where we are  why should we not leave together  no ettie i cant leave here  but why  id never hold my head up again if i felt that i had been driven out besides what is there to be afraid of are we not free folks in a free country if you love me and i you who will dare to come between  you dont know jack youve been here too short a time you dont know this baldwin you dont know mcginty and his scowrers  no i dont know them and i dont fear them and i dont believe in them said mcmurdo ive lived among rough men my darling and instead of fearing them it has always ended that they have feared mealways ettie its mad on the face of it if these men as your father says have done crime after crime in the valley and if everyone knows them by name how comes it that none are brought to justice you answer me that ettie  because no witness dares to appear against them he would not live a month if he did also because they have always their own men to swear that the accused one was far from the scene of the crime but surely jack you must have read all this i had understood that every paper in the united states was writing about it  well i have read something it is true but i had thought it was a story maybe these men have some reason in what they do maybe they are wronged and have no other way to help themselves  oh jack dont let me hear you speak so that is how he speaksthe other one  baldwinhe speaks like that does he  and that is why i loathe him so oh jack now i can tell you the truth i loathe him with all my heart but i fear him also i fear him for myself but above all i fear him for father i know that some great sorrow would come upon us if i dared to say what i really felt that is why i have put him off with halfpromises it was in real truth our only hope but if you would fly with me jack we could take father with us and live forever far from the power of these wicked men  again there was the struggle upon mcmurdos face and again it set like granite no harm shall come to you ettienor to your father either as to wicked men i expect you may find that i am as bad as the worst of them before were through  no no jack i would trust you anywhere  mcmurdo laughed bitterly good lord how little you know of me your innocent soul my darling could not even guess what is passing in mine but hullo whos the visitor  the door had opened suddenly and a young fellow came swaggering in with the air of one who is the master he was a handsome dashing young man of about the same age and build as mcmurdo himself under his broadbrimmed black felt hat which he had not troubled to remove a handsome face with fierce domineering eyes and a curved hawkbill of a nose looked savagely at the pair who sat by the stove  ettie had jumped to her feet full of confusion and alarm im glad to see you mr baldwin said she youre earlier than i had thought come and sit down  baldwin stood with his hands on his hips looking at mcmurdo who is this he asked curtly  its a friend of mine mr baldwin a new boarder here mr mcmurdo may i introduce you to mr baldwin  the young men nodded in surly fashion to each other  maybe miss ettie has told you how it is with us said baldwin  i didnt understand that there was any relation between you  didnt you well you can understand it now you can take it from me that this young lady is mine and youll find it a very fine evening for a walk  thank you i am in no humour for a walk  arent you the mans savage eyes were blazing with anger maybe you are in a humour for a fight mr boarder  that i am cried mcmurdo springing to his feet you never said a more welcome word  for gods sake jack oh for gods sake cried poor distracted ettie oh jack jack he will hurt you  oh its jack is it said baldwin with an oath youve come to that already have you  oh ted be reasonablebe kind for my sake ted if ever you loved me be bighearted and forgiving  i think ettie that if you were to leave us alone we could get this thing settled said mcmurdo quietly or maybe mr baldwin you will take a turn down the street with me its a fine evening and theres some open ground beyond the next block  ill get even with you without needing to dirty my hands said his enemy youll wish you had never set foot in this house before i am through with you  no time like the present cried mcmurdo  ill choose my own time mister you can leave the time to me see here he suddenly rolled up his sleeve and showed upon his forearm a peculiar sign which appeared to have been branded there it was a circle with a triangle within it dyou know what that means  i neither know nor care  well you will know ill promise you that you wont be much older either perhaps miss ettie can tell you something about it as to you ettie youll come back to me on your kneesdye hear girlon your kneesand then ill tell you what your punishment may be youve sowedand by the lord ill see that you reap he glanced at them both in fury then he turned upon his heel and an instant later the outer door had banged behind him  for a few moments mcmurdo and the girl stood in silence then she threw her arms around him  oh jack how brave you were but it is no use you must fly tonightjacktonight its your only hope he will have your life i read it in his horrible eyes what chance have you against a dozen of them with boss mcginty and all the power of the lodge behind them  mcmurdo disengaged her hands kissed her and gently pushed her back into a chair there acushla there dont be disturbed or fear for me im a freeman myself im after telling your father about it maybe i am no better than the others so dont make a saint of me perhaps you hate me too now that ive told you as much  hate you jack while life lasts i could never do that ive heard that there is no harm in being a freeman anywhere but here so why should i think the worse of you for that but if you are a freeman jack why should you not go down and make a friend of boss mcginty oh hurry jack hurry get your word in first or the hounds will be on your trail  i was thinking the same thing said mcmurdo ill go right now and fix it you can tell your father that ill sleep here tonight and find some other quarters in the morning  the bar of mcgintys saloon was crowded as usual for it was the favourite loafing place of all the rougher elements of the town the man was popular for he had a rough jovial disposition which formed a mask covering a great deal which lay behind it but apart from this popularity the fear in which he was held throughout the township and indeed down the whole thirty miles of the valley and past the mountains on each side of it was enough in itself to fill his bar for none could afford to neglect his good will  besides those secret powers which it was universally believed that he exercised in so pitiless a fashion he was a high public official a municipal councillor and a commissioner of roads elected to the office through the votes of the ruffians who in turn expected to receive favours at his hands assessments and taxes were enormous the public works were notoriously neglected the accounts were slurred over by bribed auditors and the decent citizen was terrorized into paying public blackmail and holding his tongue lest some worse thing befall him  thus it was that year by year boss mcgintys diamond pins became more obtrusive his gold chains more weighty across a more gorgeous vest and his saloon stretched farther and farther until it threatened to absorb one whole side of the market square  mcmurdo pushed open the swinging door of the saloon and made his way amid the crowd of men within through an atmosphere blurred with tobacco smoke and heavy with the smell of spirits the place was brilliantly lighted and the huge heavily gilt mirrors upon every wall reflected and multiplied the garish illumination there were several bartenders in their shirt sleeves hard at work mixing drinks for the loungers who fringed the broad brasstrimmed counter  at the far end with his body resting upon the bar and a cigar stuck at an acute angle from the corner of his mouth stood a tall strong heavily built man who could be none other than the famous mcginty himself he was a blackmaned giant bearded to the cheekbones and with a shock of raven hair which fell to his collar his complexion was as swarthy as that of an italian and his eyes were of a strange dead black which combined with a slight squint gave them a particularly sinister appearance  all else in the manhis noble proportions his fine features and his frank bearingfitted in with that jovial mantoman manner which he affected here one would say is a bluff honest fellow whose heart would be sound however rude his outspoken words might seem it was only when those dead dark eyes deep and remorseless were turned upon a man that he shrank within himself feeling that he was face to face with an infinite possibility of latent evil with a strength and courage and cunning behind it which made it a thousand times more deadly  having had a good look at his man mcmurdo elbowed his way forward with his usual careless audacity and pushed himself through the little group of courtiers who were fawning upon the powerful boss laughing uproariously at the smallest of his jokes the young strangers bold gray eyes looked back fearlessly through their glasses at the deadly black ones which turned sharply upon him  well young man i cant call your face to mind  im new here mr mcginty  you are not so new that you cant give a gentleman his proper title  hes councillor mcginty young man said a voice from the group  im sorry councillor im strange to the ways of the place but i was advised to see you  well you see me this is all there is what dyou think of me  well its early days if your heart is as big as your body and your soul as fine as your face then id ask for nothing better said mcmurdo  by gar youve got an irish tongue in your head anyhow cried the saloonkeeper not quite certain whether to humour this audacious visitor or to stand upon his dignity  so you are good enough to pass my appearance  sure said mcmurdo  and you were told to see me  i was  and who told you  brother scanlan of lodge 341 vermissa i drink your health councillor and to our better acquaintance he raised a glass with which he had been served to his lips and elevated his little finger as he drank it  mcginty who had been watching him narrowly raised his thick black eyebrows oh its like that is it said he ill have to look a bit closer into this mister  mcmurdo  a bit closer mr mcmurdo for we dont take folk on trust in these parts nor believe all were told neither come in here for a moment behind the bar  there was a small room there lined with barrels mcginty carefully closed the door and then seated himself on one of them biting thoughtfully on his cigar and surveying his companion with those disquieting eyes for a couple of minutes he sat in complete silence mcmurdo bore the inspection cheerfully one hand in his coat pocket the other twisting his brown moustache suddenly mcginty stooped and produced a wickedlooking revolver  see here my joker said he if i thought you were playing any game on us it would be short work for you  this is a strange welcome mcmurdo answered with some dignity for the bodymaster of a lodge of freemen to give to a stranger brother  ay but its just that same that you have to prove said mcginty and god help you if you fail where were you made  lodge 29 chicago  when  june 24 1872  what bodymaster  james h scott  who is your district ruler  bartholomew wilson  hum you seem glib enough in your tests what are you doing here  working the same as youbut a poorer job  you have your back answer quick enough  yes i was always quick of speech  are you quick of action  i have had that name among those that knew me best  well we may try you sooner than you think have you heard anything of the lodge in these parts  ive heard that it takes a man to be a brother  true for you mr mcmurdo why did you leave chicago  im damned if i tell you that  mcginty opened his eyes he was not used to being answered in such fashion and it amused him why wont you tell me  because no brother may tell another a lie  then the truth is too bad to tell  you can put it that way if you like  see here mister you cant expect me as bodymaster to pass into the lodge a man for whose past he cant answer  mcmurdo looked puzzled then he took a worn newspaper cutting from an inner pocket  you wouldnt squeal on a fellow said he  ill wipe my hand across your face if you say such words to me cried mcginty hotly  you are right councillor said mcmurdo meekly i should apologize i spoke without thought well i know that i am safe in your hands look at that clipping  mcginty glanced his eyes over the account of the shooting of one jonas pinto in the lake saloon market street chicago in the new year week of 1874  your work he asked as he handed back the paper  mcmurdo nodded  why did you shoot him  i was helping uncle sam to make dollars maybe mine were not as good gold as his but they looked as well and were cheaper to make this man pinto helped me to shove the queer  to do what  well it means to pass the dollars out into circulation then he said he would split maybe he did split i didnt wait to see i just killed him and lighted out for the coal country  why the coal country  cause id read in the papers that they werent too particular in those parts  mcginty laughed you were first a coiner and then a murderer and you came to these parts because you thought youd be welcome  thats about the size of it mcmurdo answered  well i guess youll go far say can you make those dollars yet  mcmurdo took half a dozen from his pocket those never passed the philadelphia mint said he  you dont say mcginty held them to the light in his enormous hand which was hairy as a gorillas i can see no difference gar youll be a mighty useful brother im thinking we can do with a bad man or two among us friend mcmurdo for there are times when we have to take our own part wed soon be against the wall if we didnt shove back at those that were pushing us  well i guess ill do my share of shoving with the rest of the boys  you seem to have a good nerve you didnt squirm when i shoved this gun at you  it was not me that was in danger  who then  it was you councillor mcmurdo drew a cocked pistol from the side pocket of his peajacket i was covering you all the time i guess my shot would have been as quick as yours  by gar mcginty flushed an angry red and then burst into a roar of laughter say weve had no such holy terror come to hand this many a year i reckon the lodge will learn to be proud of you well what the hell do you want and cant i speak alone with a gentleman for five minutes but you must butt in on us  the bartender stood abashed im sorry councillor but its ted baldwin he says he must see you this very minute  the message was unnecessary for the set cruel face of the man himself was looking over the servants shoulder he pushed the bartender out and closed the door on him  so said he with a furious glance at mcmurdo you got here first did you ive a word to say to you councillor about this man  then say it here and now before my face cried mcmurdo  ill say it at my own time in my own way  tut tut said mcginty getting off his barrel this will never do we have a new brother here baldwin and its not for us to greet him in such fashion hold out your hand man and make it up  never cried baldwin in a fury  ive offered to fight him if he thinks i have wronged him said mcmurdo ill fight him with fists or if that wont satisfy him ill fight him any other way he chooses now ill leave it to you councillor to judge between us as a bodymaster should  what is it then  a young lady shes free to choose for herself  is she cried baldwin  as between two brothers of the lodge i should say that she was said the boss  oh thats your ruling is it  yes it is ted baldwin said mcginty with a wicked stare is it you that would dispute it  you would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in favour of a man that you never saw before in your life youre not bodymaster for life jack mcginty and by god when next it comes to a vote  the councillor sprang at him like a tiger his hand closed round the others neck and he hurled him back across one of the barrels in his mad fury he would have squeezed the life out of him if mcmurdo had not interfered  easy councillor for heavens sake go easy he cried as he dragged him back  mcginty released his hold and baldwin cowed and shaken gasping for breath and shivering in every limb as one who has looked over the very edge of death sat up on the barrel over which he had been hurled  youve been asking for it this many a day ted baldwinnow youve got it cried mcginty his huge chest rising and falling maybe you think if i was voted down from bodymaster you would find yourself in my shoes its for the lodge to say that but so long as i am the chief ill have no man lift his voice against me or my rulings  i have nothing against you mumbled baldwin feeling his throat  well then cried the other relapsing in a moment into a bluff joviality we are all good friends again and theres an end of the matter  he took a bottle of champagne down from the shelf and twisted out the cork  see now he continued as he filled three high glasses let us drink the quarrelling toast of the lodge after that as you know there can be no bad blood between us now then the left hand on the apple of my throat i say to you ted baldwin what is the offense sir  the clouds are heavy answered baldwin  but they will forever brighten  and this i swear  the men drank their glasses and the same ceremony was performed between baldwin and mcmurdo  there cried mcginty rubbing his hands thats the end of the black blood you come under lodge discipline if it goes further and thats a heavy hand in these parts as brother baldwin knowsand as you will damn soon find out brother mcmurdo if you ask for trouble  faith id be slow to do that said mcmurdo he held out his hand to baldwin im quick to quarrel and quick to forgive its my hot irish blood they tell me but its over for me and i bear no grudge  baldwin had to take the proffered hand for the baleful eye of the terrible boss was upon him but his sullen face showed how little the words of the other had moved him  mcginty clapped them both on the shoulders tut these girls these girls he cried to think that the same petticoats should come between two of my boys its the devils own luck well its the colleen inside of them that must settle the question for its outside the jurisdiction of a bodymasterand the lord be praised for that we have enough on us without the women as well youll have to be affiliated to lodge 341 brother mcmurdo we have our own ways and methods different from chicago saturday night is our meeting and if you come then well make you free forever of the vermissa valley     chapter 3lodge 341 vermissa    on the day following the evening which had contained so many exciting events mcmurdo moved his lodgings from old jacob shafters and took up his quarters at the widow macnamaras on the extreme outskirts of the town scanlan his original acquaintance aboard the train had occasion shortly afterwards to move into vermissa and the two lodged together there was no other boarder and the hostess was an easygoing old irishwoman who left them to themselves so that they had a freedom for speech and action welcome to men who had secrets in common  shafter had relented to the extent of letting mcmurdo come to his meals there when he liked so that his intercourse with ettie was by no means broken on the contrary it drew closer and more intimate as the weeks went by  in his bedroom at his new abode mcmurdo felt it safe to take out the coining moulds and under many a pledge of secrecy a number of brothers from the lodge were allowed to come in and see them each carrying away in his pocket some examples of the false money so cunningly struck that there was never the slightest difficulty or danger in passing it why with such a wonderful art at his command mcmurdo should condescend to work at all was a perpetual mystery to his companions though he made it clear to anyone who asked him that if he lived without any visible means it would very quickly bring the police upon his track  one policeman was indeed after him already but the incident as luck would have it did the adventurer a great deal more good than harm after the first introduction there were few evenings when he did not find his way to mcgintys saloon there to make closer acquaintance with the boys which was the jovial title by which the dangerous gang who infested the place were known to one another his dashing manner and fearlessness of speech made him a favourite with them all while the rapid and scientific way in which he polished off his antagonist in an all in barroom scrap earned the respect of that rough community another incident however raised him even higher in their estimation  just at the crowded hour one night the door opened and a man entered with the quiet blue uniform and peaked cap of the mine police this was a special body raised by the railways and colliery owners to supplement the efforts of the ordinary civil police who were perfectly helpless in the face of the organized ruffianism which terrorized the district there was a hush as he entered and many a curious glance was cast at him but the relations between policemen and criminals are peculiar in some parts of the states and mcginty himself standing behind his counter showed no surprise when the policeman enrolled himself among his customers  a straight whisky for the night is bitter said the police officer i dont think we have met before councillor  youll be the new captain said mcginty  thats so were looking to you councillor and to the other leading citizens to help us in upholding law and order in this township captain marvin is my name  wed do better without you captain marvin said mcginty coldly for we have our own police of the township and no need for any imported goods what are you but the paid tool of the capitalists hired by them to club or shoot your poorer fellow citizen  well well we wont argue about that said the police officer goodhumouredly i expect we all do our duty same as we see it but we cant all see it the same he had drunk off his glass and had turned to go when his eyes fell upon the face of jack mcmurdo who was scowling at his elbow hullo hullo he cried looking him up and down heres an old acquaintance  mcmurdo shrank away from him i was never a friend to you nor any other cursed copper in my life said he  an acquaintance isnt always a friend said the police captain grinning youre jack mcmurdo of chicago right enough and dont you deny it  mcmurdo shrugged his shoulders im not denying it said he dye think im ashamed of my own name  youve got good cause to be anyhow  what the devil dyou mean by that he roared with his fists clenched  no no jack bluster wont do with me i was an officer in chicago before ever i came to this darned coal bunker and i know a chicago crook when i see one  mcmurdos face fell dont tell me that youre marvin of the chicago central he cried  just the same old teddy marvin at your service we havent forgotten the shooting of jonas pinto up there  i never shot him  did you not thats good impartial evidence aint it well his death came in uncommon handy for you or they would have had you for shoving the queer well we can let that be bygones for between you and meand perhaps im going further than my duty in saying itthey could get no clear case against you and chicagos open to you tomorrow  im very well where i am  well ive given you the pointer and youre a sulky dog not to thank me for it  well i suppose you mean well and i do thank you said mcmurdo in no very gracious manner  its mum with me so long as i see you living on the straight said the captain but by the lord if you get off after this its another story so goodnight to youand goodnight councillor  he left the barroom but not before he had created a local hero mcmurdos deeds in far chicago had been whispered before he had put off all questions with a smile as one who did not wish to have greatness thrust upon him but now the thing was officially confirmed the bar loafers crowded round him and shook him heartily by the hand he was free of the community from that time on he could drink hard and show little trace of it but that evening had his mate scanlan not been at hand to lead him home the feted hero would surely have spent his night under the bar  on a saturday night mcmurdo was introduced to the lodge he had thought to pass in without ceremony as being an initiate of chicago but there were particular rites in vermissa of which they were proud and these had to be undergone by every postulant the assembly met in a large room reserved for such purposes at the union house some sixty members assembled at vermissa but that by no means represented the full strength of the organization for there were several other lodges in the valley and others across the mountains on each side who exchanged members when any serious business was afoot so that a crime might be done by men who were strangers to the locality altogether there were not less than five hundred scattered over the coal district  in the bare assembly room the men were gathered round a long table at the side was a second one laden with bottles and glasses on which some members of the company were already turning their eyes mcginty sat at the head with a flat black velvet cap upon his shock of tangled black hair and a coloured purple stole round his neck so that he seemed to be a priest presiding over some diabolical ritual to right and left of him were the higher lodge officials the cruel handsome face of ted baldwin among them each of these wore some scarf or medallion as emblem of his office  they were for the most part men of mature age but the rest of the company consisted of young fellows from eighteen to twentyfive the ready and capable agents who carried out the commands of their seniors among the older men were many whose features showed the tigerish lawless souls within but looking at the rank and file it was difficult to believe that these eager and openfaced young fellows were in very truth a dangerous gang of murderers whose minds had suffered such complete moral perversion that they took a horrible pride in their proficiency at the business and looked with deepest respect at the man who had the reputation of making what they called a clean job  to their contorted natures it had become a spirited and chivalrous thing to volunteer for service against some man who had never injured them and whom in many cases they had never seen in their lives the crime committed they quarrelled as to who had actually struck the fatal blow and amused one another and the company by describing the cries and contortions of the murdered man  at first they had shown some secrecy in their arrangements but at the time which this narrative describes their proceedings were extraordinarily open for the repeated failure of the law had proved to them that on the one hand no one would dare to witness against them and on the other they had an unlimited number of stanch witnesses upon whom they could call and a wellfilled treasure chest from which they could draw the funds to engage the best legal talent in the state in ten long years of outrage there had been no single conviction and the only danger that ever threatened the scowrers lay in the victim himselfwho however outnumbered and taken by surprise might and occasionally did leave his mark upon his assailants  mcmurdo had been warned that some ordeal lay before him but no one would tell him in what it consisted he was led now into an outer room by two solemn brothers through the plank partition he could hear the murmur of many voices from the assembly within once or twice he caught the sound of his own name and he knew that they were discussing his candidacy then there entered an inner guard with a green and gold sash across his chest  the bodymaster orders that he shall be trussed blinded and entered said he  the three of them removed his coat turned up the sleeve of his right arm and finally passed a rope round above the elbows and made it fast they next placed a thick black cap right over his head and the upper part of his face so that he could see nothing he was then led into the assembly hall  it was pitch dark and very oppressive under his hood he heard the rustle and murmur of the people round him and then the voice of mcginty sounded dull and distant through the covering of his ears  john mcmurdo said the voice are you already a member of the ancient order of freemen  he bowed in assent  is your lodge no 29 chicago  he bowed again  dark nights are unpleasant said the voice  yes for strangers to travel he answered  the clouds are heavy  yes a storm is approaching  are the brethren satisfied asked the bodymaster  there was a general murmur of assent  we know brother by your sign and by your countersign that you are indeed one of us said mcginty we would have you know however that in this county and in other counties of these parts we have certain rites and also certain duties of our own which call for good men are you ready to be tested  i am  are you of stout heart  i am  take a stride forward to prove it  as the words were said he felt two hard points in front of his eyes pressing upon them so that it appeared as if he could not move forward without a danger of losing them none the less he nerved himself to step resolutely out and as he did so the pressure melted away there was a low murmur of applause  he is of stout heart said the voice can you bear pain  as well as another he answered  test him  it was all he could do to keep himself from screaming out for an agonizing pain shot through his forearm he nearly fainted at the sudden shock of it but he bit his lip and clenched his hands to hide his agony  i can take more than that said he  this time there was loud applause a finer first appearance had never been made in the lodge hands clapped him on the back and the hood was plucked from his head he stood blinking and smiling amid the congratulations of the brothers  one last word brother mcmurdo said mcginty you have already sworn the oath of secrecy and fidelity and you are aware that the punishment for any breach of it is instant and inevitable death  i am said mcmurdo  and you accept the rule of the bodymaster for the time being under all circumstances  i do  then in the name of lodge 341 vermissa i welcome you to its privileges and debates you will put the liquor on the table brother scanlan and we will drink to our worthy brother  mcmurdos coat had been brought to him but before putting it on he examined his right arm which still smarted heavily there on the flesh of the forearm was a circle with a triangle within it deep and red as the branding iron had left it one or two of his neighbours pulled up their sleeves and showed their own lodge marks  weve all had it said one but not all as brave as you over it  tut it was nothing said he but it burned and ached all the same  when the drinks which followed the ceremony of initiation had all been disposed of the business of the lodge proceeded mcmurdo accustomed only to the prosaic performances of chicago listened with open ears and more surprise than he ventured to show to what followed  the first business on the agenda paper said mcginty is to read the following letter from division master windle of merton county lodge 249 he says  dear sir  there is a job to be done on andrew rae of rae  sturmash coal owners near this place you will remember that your lodge owes us a return having had the service of two brethren in the matter of the patrolman last fall you will send two good men they will be taken charge of by treasurer higgins of this lodge whose address you know he will show them when to act and where yours in freedom  jw windle dmaof  windle has never refused us when we have had occasion to ask for the loan of a man or two and it is not for us to refuse him mcginty paused and looked round the room with his dull malevolent eyes who will volunteer for the job  several young fellows held up their hands the bodymaster looked at them with an approving smile  youll do tiger cormac if you handle it as well as you did the last you wont be wrong and you wilson  ive no pistol said the volunteer a mere boy in his teens  its your first is it not well you have to be blooded some time it will be a great start for you as to the pistol youll find it waiting for you or im mistaken if you report yourselves on monday it will be time enough youll get a great welcome when you return  any reward this time asked cormac a thickset darkfaced brutallooking young man whose ferocity had earned him the nickname of tiger  never mind the reward you just do it for the honour of the thing maybe when it is done there will be a few odd dollars at the bottom of the box  what has the man done asked young wilson  sure its not for the likes of you to ask what the man has done he has been judged over there thats no business of ours all we have to do is to carry it out for them same as they would for us speaking of that two brothers from the merton lodge are coming over to us next week to do some business in this quarter  who are they asked someone  faith it is wiser not to ask if you know nothing you can testify nothing and no trouble can come of it but they are men who will make a clean job when they are about it  and time too cried ted baldwin folk are gettin out of hand in these parts it was only last week that three of our men were turned off by foreman blaker its been owing him a long time and hell get it full and proper  get what mcmurdo whispered to his neighbour  the business end of a buckshot cartridge cried the man with a loud laugh what think you of our ways brother  mcmurdos criminal soul seemed to have already absorbed the spirit of the vile association of which he was now a member i like it well said he tis a proper place for a lad of mettle  several of those who sat around heard his words and applauded them  whats that cried the blackmaned bodymaster from the end of the table  tis our new brother sir who finds our ways to his taste  mcmurdo rose to his feet for an instant i would say eminent bodymaster that if a man should be wanted i should take it as an honour to be chosen to help the lodge  there was great applause at this it was felt that a new sun was pushing its rim above the horizon to some of the elders it seemed that the progress was a little too rapid  i would move said the secretary harraway a vulturefaced old graybeard who sat near the chairman that brother mcmurdo should wait until it is the good pleasure of the lodge to employ him  sure that was what i meant im in your hands said mcmurdo  your time will come brother said the chairman we have marked you down as a willing man and we believe that you will do good work in these parts there is a small matter tonight in which you may take a hand if it so please you  i will wait for something that is worth while  you can come tonight anyhow and it will help you to know what we stand for in this community i will make the announcement later meanwhile he glanced at his agenda paper i have one or two more points to bring before the meeting first of all i will ask the treasurer as to our bank balance there is the pension to jim carnaways widow he was struck down doing the work of the lodge and it is for us to see that she is not the loser  jim was shot last month when they tried to kill chester wilcox of marley creek mcmurdos neighbour informed him  the funds are good at the moment said the treasurer with the bankbook in front of him the firms have been generous of late max linder  co paid five hundred to be left alone walker brothers sent in a hundred but i took it on myself to return it and ask for five if i do not hear by wednesday their winding gear may get out of order we had to burn their breaker last year before they became reasonable then the west section coaling company has paid its annual contribution we have enough on hand to meet any obligations  what about archie swindon asked a brother  he has sold out and left the district the old devil left a note for us to say that he had rather be a free crossing sweeper in new york than a large mine owner under the power of a ring of blackmailers by gar it was as well that he made a break for it before the note reached us i guess he wont show his face in this valley again  an elderly cleanshaved man with a kindly face and a good brow rose from the end of the table which faced the chairman mr treasurer he asked may i ask who has bought the property of this man that we have driven out of the district  yes brother morris it has been bought by the state  merton county railroad company  and who bought the mines of todman and of lee that came into the market in the same way last year  the same company brother morris  and who bought the ironworks of manson and of shuman and of van deher and of atwood which have all been given up of late  they were all bought by the west gilmerton general mining company  i dont see brother morris said the chairman that it matters to us who buys them since they cant carry them out of the district  with all respect to you eminent bodymaster i think it may matter very much to us this process has been going on now for ten long years we are gradually driving all the small men out of trade what is the result we find in their places great companies like the railroad or the general iron who have their directors in new york or philadelphia and care nothing for our threats we can take it out of their local bosses but it only means that others will be sent in their stead and we are making it dangerous for ourselves the small men could not harm us they had not the money nor the power so long as we did not squeeze them too dry they would stay on under our power but if these big companies find that we stand between them and their profits they will spare no pains and no expense to hunt us down and bring us to court  there was a hush at these ominous words and every face darkened as gloomy looks were exchanged so omnipotent and unchallenged had they been that the very thought that there was possible retribution in the background had been banished from their minds and yet the idea struck a chill to the most reckless of them  it is my advice the speaker continued that we go easier upon the small men on the day that they have all been driven out the power of this society will have been broken  unwelcome truths are not popular there were angry cries as the speaker resumed his seat mcginty rose with gloom upon his brow  brother morris said he you were always a croaker so long as the members of this lodge stand together there is no power in the united states that can touch them sure have we not tried it often enough in the lawcourts i expect the big companies will find it easier to pay than to fight same as the little companies do and now brethren mcginty took off his black velvet cap and his stole as he spoke this lodge has finished its business for the evening save for one small matter which may be mentioned when we are parting the time has now come for fraternal refreshment and for harmony  strange indeed is human nature here were these men to whom murder was familiar who again and again had struck down the father of the family some man against whom they had no personal feeling without one thought of compunction or of compassion for his weeping wife or helpless children and yet the tender or pathetic in music could move them to tears mcmurdo had a fine tenor voice and if he had failed to gain the good will of the lodge before it could no longer have been withheld after he had thrilled them with im sitting on the stile mary and on the banks of allan water  in his very first night the new recruit had made himself one of the most popular of the brethren marked already for advancement and high office there were other qualities needed however besides those of good fellowship to make a worthy freeman and of these he was given an example before the evening was over the whisky bottle had passed round many times and the men were flushed and ripe for mischief when their bodymaster rose once more to address them  boys said he theres one man in this town that wants trimming up and its for you to see that he gets it im speaking of james stanger of the herald youve seen how hes been opening his mouth against us again  there was a murmur of assent with many a muttered oath mcginty took a slip of paper from his waistcoat pocket  law and order  thats how he heads it  reign of terror in the coal and iron district  twelve years have now elapsed since the first assassinations which proved the existence of a criminal organization in our midst from that day these outrages have never ceased until now they have reached a pitch which makes us the opprobrium of the civilized world is it for such results as this that our great country welcomes to its bosom the alien who flies from the despotisms of europe is it that they shall themselves become tyrants over the very men who have given them shelter and that a state of terrorism and lawlessness should be established under the very shadow of the sacred folds of the starry flag of freedom which would raise horror in our minds if we read of it as existing under the most effete monarchy of the east the men are known the organization is patent and public how long are we to endure it can we forever live  sure ive read enough of the slush cried the chairman tossing the paper down upon the table thats what he says of us the question im asking you is what shall we say to him  kill him cried a dozen fierce voices  i protest against that said brother morris the man of the good brow and shaved face i tell you brethren that our hand is too heavy in this valley and that there will come a point where in selfdefense every man will unite to crush us out james stanger is an old man he is respected in the township and the district his paper stands for all that is solid in the valley if that man is struck down there will be a stir through this state that will only end with our destruction  and how would they bring about our destruction mr standback cried mcginty is it by the police sure half of them are in our pay and half of them afraid of us or is it by the law courts and the judge havent we tried that before now and what ever came of it  there is a judge lynch that might try the case said brother morris  a general shout of anger greeted the suggestion  i have but to raise my finger cried mcginty and i could put two hundred men into this town that would clear it out from end to end then suddenly raising his voice and bending his huge black brows into a terrible frown see here brother morris i have my eye on you and have had for some time youve no heart yourself and you try to take the heart out of others it will be an ill day for you brother morris when your own name comes on our agenda paper and im thinking that its just there that i ought to place it  morris had turned deadly pale and his knees seemed to give way under him as he fell back into his chair he raised his glass in his trembling hand and drank before he could answer i apologize eminent bodymaster to you and to every brother in this lodge if i have said more than i should i am a faithful memberyou all know thatand it is my fear lest evil come to the lodge which makes me speak in anxious words but i have greater trust in your judgment than in my own eminent bodymaster and i promise you that i will not offend again  the bodymasters scowl relaxed as he listened to the humble words very good brother morris its myself that would be sorry if it were needful to give you a lesson but so long as i am in this chair we shall be a united lodge in word and in deed and now boys he continued looking round at the company ill say this much that if stanger got his full deserts there would be more trouble than we need ask for these editors hang together and every journal in the state would be crying out for police and troops but i guess you can give him a pretty severe warning will you fix it brother baldwin  sure said the young man eagerly  how many will you take  half a dozen and two to guard the door youll come gower and you mansel and you scanlan and the two willabys  i promised the new brother he should go said the chairman  ted baldwin looked at mcmurdo with eyes which showed that he had not forgotten nor forgiven well he can come if he wants he said in a surly voice thats enough the sooner we get to work the better  the company broke up with shouts and yells and snatches of drunken song the bar was still crowded with revellers and many of the brethren remained there the little band who had been told off for duty passed out into the street proceeding in twos and threes along the sidewalk so as not to provoke attention it was a bitterly cold night with a halfmoon shining brilliantly in a frosty starspangled sky the men stopped and gathered in a yard which faced a high building the words vermissa herald were printed in gold lettering between the brightly lit windows from within came the clanking of the printing press  here you said baldwin to mcmurdo you can stand below at the door and see that the road is kept open for us arthur willaby can stay with you you others come with me have no fears boys for we have a dozen witnesses that we are in the union bar at this very moment  it was nearly midnight and the street was deserted save for one or two revellers upon their way home the party crossed the road and pushing open the door of the newspaper office baldwin and his men rushed in and up the stair which faced them mcmurdo and another remained below from the room above came a shout a cry for help and then the sound of trampling feet and of falling chairs an instant later a grayhaired man rushed out on the landing  he was seized before he could get farther and his spectacles came tinkling down to mcmurdos feet there was a thud and a groan he was on his face and half a dozen sticks were clattering together as they fell upon him he writhed and his long thin limbs quivered under the blows the others ceased at last but baldwin his cruel face set in an infernal smile was hacking at the mans head which he vainly endeavoured to defend with his arms his white hair was dabbled with patches of blood baldwin was still stooping over his victim putting in a short vicious blow whenever he could see a part exposed when mcmurdo dashed up the stair and pushed him back  youll kill the man said he drop it  baldwin looked at him in amazement curse you he cried who are you to interfereyou that are new to the lodge stand back he raised his stick but mcmurdo had whipped his pistol out of his pocket  stand back yourself he cried ill blow your face in if you lay a hand on me as to the lodge wasnt it the order of the bodymaster that the man was not to be killedand what are you doing but killing him  its truth he says remarked one of the men  by gar youd best hurry yourselves cried the man below the windows are all lighting up and youll have the whole town here inside of five minutes  there was indeed the sound of shouting in the street and a little group of compositors and pressmen was forming in the hall below and nerving itself to action leaving the limp and motionless body of the editor at the head of the stair the criminals rushed down and made their way swiftly along the street having reached the union house some of them mixed with the crowd in mcgintys saloon whispering across the bar to the boss that the job had been well carried through others and among them mcmurdo broke away into side streets and so by devious paths to their own homes     chapter 4the valley of fear    when mcmurdo awoke next morning he had good reason to remember his initiation into the lodge his head ached with the effect of the drink and his arm where he had been branded was hot and swollen having his own peculiar source of income he was irregular in his attendance at his work so he had a late breakfast and remained at home for the morning writing a long letter to a friend afterwards he read the daily herald in a special column put in at the last moment he read  outrage at the herald officeeditor seriously injured  it was a short account of the facts with which he was himself more familiar than the writer could have been it ended with the statement  the matter is now in the hands of the police but it can hardly be hoped that their exertions will be attended by any better results than in the past some of the men were recognized and there is hope that a conviction may be obtained the source of the outrage was it need hardly be said that infamous society which has held this community in bondage for so long a period and against which the herald has taken so uncompromising a stand mr stangers many friends will rejoice to hear that though he has been cruelly and brutally beaten and though he has sustained severe injuries about the head there is no immediate danger to his life  below it stated that a guard of police armed with winchester rifles had been requisitioned for the defense of the office  mcmurdo had laid down the paper and was lighting his pipe with a hand which was shaky from the excesses of the previous evening when there was a knock outside and his landlady brought to him a note which had just been handed in by a lad it was unsigned and ran thus  i should wish to speak to you but would rather not do so in your house you will find me beside the flagstaff upon miller hill if you will come there now i have something which it is important for you to hear and for me to say  mcmurdo read the note twice with the utmost surprise for he could not imagine what it meant or who was the author of it had it been in a feminine hand he might have imagined that it was the beginning of one of those adventures which had been familiar enough in his past life but it was the writing of a man and of a well educated one too finally after some hesitation he determined to see the matter through  miller hill is an illkept public park in the very centre of the town in summer it is a favourite resort of the people but in winter it is desolate enough from the top of it one has a view not only of the whole straggling grimy town but of the winding valley beneath with its scattered mines and factories blackening the snow on each side of it and of the wooded and whitecapped ranges flanking it  mcmurdo strolled up the winding path hedged in with evergreens until he reached the deserted restaurant which forms the centre of summer gaiety beside it was a bare flagstaff and underneath it a man his hat drawn down and the collar of his overcoat turned up when he turned his face mcmurdo saw that it was brother morris he who had incurred the anger of the bodymaster the night before the lodge sign was given and exchanged as they met  i wanted to have a word with you mr mcmurdo said the older man speaking with a hesitation which showed that he was on delicate ground it was kind of you to come  why did you not put your name to the note  one has to be cautious mister one never knows in times like these how a thing may come back to one one never knows either who to trust or who not to trust  surely one may trust brothers of the lodge  no no not always cried morris with vehemence whatever we say even what we think seems to go back to that man mcginty  look here said mcmurdo sternly it was only last night as you know well that i swore good faith to our bodymaster would you be asking me to break my oath  if that is the view you take said morris sadly i can only say that i am sorry i gave you the trouble to come and meet me things have come to a bad pass when two free citizens cannot speak their thoughts to each other  mcmurdo who had been watching his companion very narrowly relaxed somewhat in his bearing sure i spoke for myself only said he i am a newcomer as you know and i am strange to it all it is not for me to open my mouth mr morris and if you think well to say anything to me i am here to hear it  and to take it back to boss mcginty said morris bitterly  indeed then you do me injustice there cried mcmurdo for myself i am loyal to the lodge and so i tell you straight but i would be a poor creature if i were to repeat to any other what you might say to me in confidence it will go no further than me though i warn you that you may get neither help nor sympathy  i have given up looking for either the one or the other said morris i may be putting my very life in your hands by what i say but bad as you areand it seemed to me last night that you were shaping to be as bad as the worststill you are new to it and your conscience cannot yet be as hardened as theirs that was why i thought to speak with you  well what have you to say  if you give me away may a curse be on you  sure i said i would not  i would ask you then when you joined the freemans society in chicago and swore vows of charity and fidelity did ever it cross your mind that you might find it would lead you to crime  if you call it crime mcmurdo answered  call it crime cried morris his voice vibrating with passion you have seen little of it if you can call it anything else was it crime last night when a man old enough to be your father was beaten till the blood dripped from his white hairs was that crimeor what else would you call it  there are some would say it was war said mcmurdo a war of two classes with all in so that each struck as best it could  well did you think of such a thing when you joined the freemans society at chicago  no im bound to say i did not  nor did i when i joined it at philadelphia it was just a benefit club and a meeting place for ones fellows then i heard of this placecurse the hour that the name first fell upon my earsand i came to better myself my god to better myself my wife and three children came with me i started a drygoods store on market square and i prospered well the word had gone round that i was a freeman and i was forced to join the local lodge same as you did last night ive the badge of shame on my forearm and something worse branded on my heart i found that i was under the orders of a black villain and caught in a meshwork of crime what could i do every word i said to make things better was taken as treason same as it was last night i cant get away for all i have in the world is in my store if i leave the society i know well that it means murder to me and god knows what to my wife and children oh man it is awfulawful he put his hands to his face and his body shook with convulsive sobs  mcmurdo shrugged his shoulders you were too soft for the job said he you are the wrong sort for such work  i had a conscience and a religion but they made me a criminal among them i was chosen for a job if i backed down i knew well what would come to me maybe im a coward maybe its the thought of my poor little woman and the children that makes me one anyhow i went i guess it will haunt me forever  it was a lonely house twenty miles from here over the range yonder i was told off for the door same as you were last night they could not trust me with the job the others went in when they came out their hands were crimson to the wrists as we turned away a child was screaming out of the house behind us it was a boy of five who had seen his father murdered i nearly fainted with the horror of it and yet i had to keep a bold and smiling face for well i knew that if i did not it would be out of my house that they would come next with their bloody hands and it would be my little fred that would be screaming for his father  but i was a criminal then part sharer in a murder lost forever in this world and lost also in the next i am a good catholic but the priest would have no word with me when he heard i was a scowrer and i am excommunicated from my faith thats how it stands with me and i see you going down the same road and i ask you what the end is to be are you ready to be a coldblooded murderer also or can we do anything to stop it  what would you do asked mcmurdo abruptly you would not inform  god forbid cried morris sure the very thought would cost me my life  thats well said mcmurdo im thinking that you are a weak man and that you make too much of the matter  too much wait till you have lived here longer look down the valley see the cloud of a hundred chimneys that overshadows it i tell you that the cloud of murder hangs thicker and lower than that over the heads of the people it is the valley of fear the valley of death the terror is in the hearts of the people from the dusk to the dawn wait young man and you will learn for yourself  well ill let you know what i think when i have seen more said mcmurdo carelessly what is very clear is that you are not the man for the place and that the sooner you sell outif you only get a dime a dollar for what the business is worththe better it will be for you what you have said is safe with me but by gar if i thought you were an informer  no no cried morris piteously  well let it rest at that ill bear what you have said in mind and maybe some day ill come back to it i expect you meant kindly by speaking to me like this now ill be getting home  one word before you go said morris we may have been seen together they may want to know what we have spoken about  ah thats well thought of  i offer you a clerkship in my store  and i refuse it thats our business well so long brother morris and may you find things go better with you in the future  that same afternoon as mcmurdo sat smoking lost in thought beside the stove of his sittingroom the door swung open and its framework was filled with the huge figure of boss mcginty he passed the sign and then seating himself opposite to the young man he looked at him steadily for some time a look which was as steadily returned  im not much of a visitor brother mcmurdo he said at last i guess i am too busy over the folk that visit me but i thought id stretch a point and drop down to see you in your own house  im proud to see you here councillor mcmurdo answered heartily bringing his whisky bottle out of the cupboard its an honour that i had not expected  hows the arm asked the boss  mcmurdo made a wry face well im not forgetting it he said but its worth it  yes its worth it the other answered to those that are loyal and go through with it and are a help to the lodge what were you speaking to brother morris about on miller hill this morning  the question came so suddenly that it was well that he had his answer prepared he burst into a hearty laugh morris didnt know i could earn a living here at home he shant know either for he has got too much conscience for the likes of me but hes a goodhearted old chap it was his idea that i was at a loose end and that he would do me a good turn by offering me a clerkship in a drygoods store  oh that was it  yes that was it  and you refused it  sure couldnt i earn ten times as much in my own bedroom with four hours work  thats so but i wouldnt get about too much with morris  why not  well i guess because i tell you not thats enough for most folk in these parts  it may be enough for most folk but it aint enough for me councillor said mcmurdo boldly if you are a judge of men youll know that  the swarthy giant glared at him and his hairy paw closed for an instant round the glass as though he would hurl it at the head of his companion then he laughed in his loud boisterous insincere fashion  youre a queer card for sure said he well if you want reasons ill give them did morris say nothing to you against the lodge  no  nor against me  no  well thats because he darent trust you but in his heart he is not a loyal brother we know that well so we watch him and we wait for the time to admonish him im thinking that the time is drawing near theres no room for scabby sheep in our pen but if you keep company with a disloyal man we might think that you were disloyal too see  theres no chance of my keeping company with him for i dislike the man mcmurdo answered as to being disloyal if it was any man but you he would not use the word to me twice  well thats enough said mcginty draining off his glass i came down to give you a word in season and youve had it  id like to know said mcmurdo how you ever came to learn that i had spoken with morris at all  mcginty laughed its my business to know what goes on in this township said he i guess youd best reckon on my hearing all that passes well times up and ill just say  but his leavetaking was cut short in a very unexpected fashion with a sudden crash the door flew open and three frowning intent faces glared in at them from under the peaks of police caps mcmurdo sprang to his feet and half drew his revolver but his arm stopped midway as he became conscious that two winchester rifles were levelled at his head a man in uniform advanced into the room a sixshooter in his hand it was captain marvin once of chicago and now of the mine constabulary he shook his head with a halfsmile at mcmurdo  i thought youd be getting into trouble mr crooked mcmurdo of chicago said he cant keep out of it can you take your hat and come along with us  i guess youll pay for this captain marvin said mcginty who are you id like to know to break into a house in this fashion and molest honest lawabiding men  youre standing out in this deal councillor mcginty said the police captain we are not out after you but after this man mcmurdo it is for you to help not to hinder us in our duty  he is a friend of mine and ill answer for his conduct said the boss  by all accounts mr mcginty you may have to answer for your own conduct some of these days the captain answered this man mcmurdo was a crook before ever he came here and hes a crook still cover him patrolman while i disarm him  theres my pistol said mcmurdo coolly maybe captain marvin if you and i were alone and face to face you would not take me so easily  wheres your warrant asked mcginty by gar a man might as well live in russia as in vermissa while folk like you are running the police its a capitalist outrage and youll hear more of it i reckon  you do what you think is your duty the best way you can councillor well look after ours  what am i accused of asked mcmurdo  of being concerned in the beating of old editor stanger at the herald office it wasnt your fault that it isnt a murder charge  well if thats all you have against him cried mcginty with a laugh you can save yourself a deal of trouble by dropping it right now this man was with me in my saloon playing poker up to midnight and i can bring a dozen to prove it  thats your affair and i guess you can settle it in court tomorrow meanwhile come on mcmurdo and come quietly if you dont want a gun across your head you stand wide mr mcginty for i warn you i will stand no resistance when i am on duty  so determined was the appearance of the captain that both mcmurdo and his boss were forced to accept the situation the latter managed to have a few whispered words with the prisoner before they parted  what about he jerked his thumb upward to signify the coining plant  all right whispered mcmurdo who had devised a safe hiding place under the floor  ill bid you goodbye said the boss shaking hands ill see reilly the lawyer and take the defense upon myself take my word for it that they wont be able to hold you  i wouldnt bet on that guard the prisoner you two and shoot him if he tries any games ill search the house before i leave  he did so but apparently found no trace of the concealed plant when he had descended he and his men escorted mcmurdo to headquarters darkness had fallen and a keen blizzard was blowing so that the streets were nearly deserted but a few loiterers followed the group and emboldened by invisibility shouted imprecations at the prisoner  lynch the cursed scowrer they cried lynch him they laughed and jeered as he was pushed into the police station after a short formal examination from the inspector in charge he was put into the common cell here he found baldwin and three other criminals of the night before all arrested that afternoon and waiting their trial next morning  but even within this inner fortress of the law the long arm of the freemen was able to extend late at night there came a jailer with a straw bundle for their bedding out of which he extracted two bottles of whisky some glasses and a pack of cards they spent a hilarious night without an anxious thought as to the ordeal of the morning  nor had they cause as the result was to show the magistrate could not possibly on the evidence have held them for a higher court on the one hand the compositors and pressmen were forced to admit that the light was uncertain that they were themselves much perturbed and that it was difficult for them to swear to the identity of the assailants although they believed that the accused were among them cross examined by the clever attorney who had been engaged by mcginty they were even more nebulous in their evidence  the injured man had already deposed that he was so taken by surprise by the suddenness of the attack that he could state nothing beyond the fact that the first man who struck him wore a moustache he added that he knew them to be scowrers since no one else in the community could possibly have any enmity to him and he had long been threatened on account of his outspoken editorials on the other hand it was clearly shown by the united and unfaltering evidence of six citizens including that high municipal official councillor mcginty that the men had been at a card party at the union house until an hour very much later than the commission of the outrage  needless to say that they were discharged with something very near to an apology from the bench for the inconvenience to which they had been put together with an implied censure of captain marvin and the police for their officious zeal  the verdict was greeted with loud applause by a court in which mcmurdo saw many familiar faces brothers of the lodge smiled and waved but there were others who sat with compressed lips and brooding eyes as the men filed out of the dock one of them a little darkbearded resolute fellow put the thoughts of himself and comrades into words as the exprisoners passed him  you damned murderers he said well fix you yet     chapter 5the darkest hour    if anything had been needed to give an impetus to jack mcmurdos popularity among his fellows it would have been his arrest and acquittal that a man on the very night of joining the lodge should have done something which brought him before the magistrate was a new record in the annals of the society already he had earned the reputation of a good boon companion a cheery reveller and withal a man of high temper who would not take an insult even from the allpowerful boss himself but in addition to this he impressed his comrades with the idea that among them all there was not one whose brain was so ready to devise a bloodthirsty scheme or whose hand would be more capable of carrying it out hell be the boy for the clean job said the oldsters to one another and waited their time until they could set him to his work  mcginty had instruments enough already but he recognized that this was a supremely able one he felt like a man holding a fierce bloodhound in leash there were curs to do the smaller work but some day he would slip this creature upon its prey a few members of the lodge ted baldwin among them resented the rapid rise of the stranger and hated him for it but they kept clear of him for he was as ready to fight as to laugh  but if he gained favour with his fellows there was another quarter one which had become even more vital to him in which he lost it ettie shafters father would have nothing more to do with him nor would he allow him to enter the house ettie herself was too deeply in love to give him up altogether and yet her own good sense warned her of what would come from a marriage with a man who was regarded as a criminal  one morning after a sleepless night she determined to see him possibly for the last time and make one strong endeavour to draw him from those evil influences which were sucking him down she went to his house as he had often begged her to do and made her way into the room which he used as his sittingroom he was seated at a table with his back turned and a letter in front of him a sudden spirit of girlish mischief came over hershe was still only nineteen he had not heard her when she pushed open the door now she tiptoed forward and laid her hand lightly upon his bended shoulders  if she had expected to startle him she certainly succeeded but only in turn to be startled herself with a tiger spring he turned on her and his right hand was feeling for her throat at the same instant with the other hand he crumpled up the paper that lay before him for an instant he stood glaring then astonishment and joy took the place of the ferocity which had convulsed his featuresa ferocity which had sent her shrinking back in horror as from something which had never before intruded into her gentle life  its you said he mopping his brow and to think that you should come to me heart of my heart and i should find nothing better to do than to want to strangle you come then darling and he held out his arms let me make it up to you  but she had not recovered from that sudden glimpse of guilty fear which she had read in the mans face all her womans instinct told her that it was not the mere fright of a man who is startled guiltthat was itguilt and fear  whats come over you jack she cried why were you so scared of me oh jack if your conscience was at ease you would not have looked at me like that  sure i was thinking of other things and when you came tripping so lightly on those fairy feet of yours  no no it was more than that jack then a sudden suspicion seized her let me see that letter you were writing  ah ettie i couldnt do that  her suspicions became certainties its to another woman she cried i know it why else should you hold it from me was it to your wife that you were writing how am i to know that you are not a married manyou a stranger that nobody knows  i am not married ettie see now i swear it youre the only one woman on earth to me by the cross of christ i swear it  he was so white with passionate earnestness that she could not but believe him  well then she cried why will you not show me the letter  ill tell you acushla said he im under oath not to show it and just as i wouldnt break my word to you so i would keep it to those who hold my promise its the business of the lodge and even to you its secret and if i was scared when a hand fell on me cant you understand it when it might have been the hand of a detective  she felt that he was telling the truth he gathered her into his arms and kissed away her fears and doubts  sit here by me then its a queer throne for such a queen but its the best your poor lover can find hell do better for you some of these days im thinking now your mind is easy once again is it not  how can it ever be at ease jack when i know that you are a criminal among criminals when i never know the day that i may hear you are in court for murder mcmurdo the scowrer thats what one of our boarders called you yesterday it went through my heart like a knife  sure hard words break no bones  but they were true  well dear its not so bad as you think we are but poor men that are trying in our own way to get our rights  ettie threw her arms round her lovers neck give it up jack for my sake for gods sake give it up it was to ask you that i came here today oh jack seei beg it of you on my bended knees kneeling here before you i implore you to give it up  he raised her and soothed her with her head against his breast  sure my darlin you dont know what it is you are asking how could i give it up when it would be to break my oath and to desert my comrades if you could see how things stand with me you could never ask it of me besides if i wanted to how could i do it you dont suppose that the lodge would let a man go free with all its secrets  ive thought of that jack ive planned it all father has saved some money he is weary of this place where the fear of these people darkens our lives he is ready to go we would fly together to philadelphia or new york where we would be safe from them  mcmurdo laughed the lodge has a long arm do you think it could not stretch from here to philadelphia or new york  well then to the west or to england or to germany where father came fromanywhere to get away from this valley of fear  mcmurdo thought of old brother morris sure it is the second time i have heard the valley so named said he the shadow does indeed seem to lie heavy on some of you  it darkens every moment of our lives do you suppose that ted baldwin has ever forgiven us if it were not that he fears you what do you suppose our chances would be if you saw the look in those dark hungry eyes of his when they fall on me  by gar id teach him better manners if i caught him at it but see here little girl i cant leave here i canttake that from me once and for all but if you will leave me to find my own way i will try to prepare a way of getting honourably out of it  there is no honour in such a matter  well well its just how you look at it but if youll give me six months ill work it so that i can leave without being ashamed to look others in the face  the girl laughed with joy six months she cried is it a promise  well it may be seven or eight but within a year at the furthest we will leave the valley behind us  it was the most that ettie could obtain and yet it was something there was this distant light to illuminate the gloom of the immediate future she returned to her fathers house more lighthearted than she had ever been since jack mcmurdo had come into her life  it might be thought that as a member all the doings of the society would be told to him but he was soon to discover that the organization was wider and more complex than the simple lodge even boss mcginty was ignorant as to many things for there was an official named the county delegate living at hobsons patch farther down the line who had power over several different lodges which he wielded in a sudden and arbitrary way only once did mcmurdo see him a sly little grayhaired rat of a man with a slinking gait and a sidelong glance which was charged with malice evans pott was his name and even the great boss of vermissa felt towards him something of the repulsion and fear which the huge danton may have felt for the puny but dangerous robespierre  one day scanlan who was mcmurdos fellow boarder received a note from mcginty inclosing one from evans pott which informed him that he was sending over two good men lawler and andrews who had instructions to act in the neighbourhood though it was best for the cause that no particulars as to their objects should be given would the bodymaster see to it that suitable arrangements be made for their lodgings and comfort until the time for action should arrive mcginty added that it was impossible for anyone to remain secret at the union house and that therefore he would be obliged if mcmurdo and scanlan would put the strangers up for a few days in their boarding house  the same evening the two men arrived each carrying his gripsack lawler was an elderly man shrewd silent and selfcontained clad in an old black frock coat which with his soft felt hat and ragged grizzled beard gave him a general resemblance to an itinerant preacher his companion andrews was little more than a boy frankfaced and cheerful with the breezy manner of one who is out for a holiday and means to enjoy every minute of it both men were total abstainers and behaved in all ways as exemplary members of the society with the one simple exception that they were assassins who had often proved themselves to be most capable instruments for this association of murder lawler had already carried out fourteen commissions of the kind and andrews three  they were as mcmurdo found quite ready to converse about their deeds in the past which they recounted with the halfbashful pride of men who had done good and unselfish service for the community they were reticent however as to the immediate job in hand  they chose us because neither i nor the boy here drink lawler explained they can count on us saying no more than we should you must not take it amiss but it is the orders of the county delegate that we obey  sure we are all in it together said scanlan mcmurdos mate as the four sat together at supper  thats true enough and well talk till the cows come home of the killing of charlie williams or of simon bird or any other job in the past but till the work is done we say nothing  there are half a dozen about here that i have a word to say to said mcmurdo with an oath i suppose it isnt jack knox of ironhill that you are after id go some way to see him get his deserts  no its not him yet  or herman strauss  no nor him either  well if you wont tell us we cant make you but id be glad to know  lawler smiled and shook his head he was not to be drawn  in spite of the reticence of their guests scanlan and mcmurdo were quite determined to be present at what they called the fun when therefore at an early hour one morning mcmurdo heard them creeping down the stairs he awakened scanlan and the two hurried on their clothes when they were dressed they found that the others had stolen out leaving the door open behind them it was not yet dawn and by the light of the lamps they could see the two men some distance down the street they followed them warily treading noiselessly in the deep snow  the boarding house was near the edge of the town and soon they were at the crossroads which is beyond its boundary here three men were waiting with whom lawler and andrews held a short eager conversation then they all moved on together it was clearly some notable job which needed numbers at this point there are several trails which lead to various mines the strangers took that which led to the crow hill a huge business which was in strong hands which had been able thanks to their energetic and fearless new england manager josiah h dunn to keep some order and discipline during the long reign of terror  day was breaking now and a line of workmen were slowly making their way singly and in groups along the blackened path  mcmurdo and scanlan strolled on with the others keeping in sight of the men whom they followed a thick mist lay over them and from the heart of it there came the sudden scream of a steam whistle it was the tenminute signal before the cages descended and the days labour began  when they reached the open space round the mine shaft there were a hundred miners waiting stamping their feet and blowing on their fingers for it was bitterly cold the strangers stood in a little group under the shadow of the engine house scanlan and mcmurdo climbed a heap of slag from which the whole scene lay before them they saw the mine engineer a great bearded scotchman named menzies come out of the engine house and blow his whistle for the cages to be lowered  at the same instant a tall looseframed young man with a cleanshaved earnest face advanced eagerly towards the pit head as he came forward his eyes fell upon the group silent and motionless under the engine house the men had drawn down their hats and turned up their collars to screen their faces for a moment the presentiment of death laid its cold hand upon the managers heart at the next he had shaken it off and saw only his duty towards intrusive strangers  who are you he asked as he advanced what are you loitering there for  there was no answer but the lad andrews stepped forward and shot him in the stomach the hundred waiting miners stood as motionless and helpless as if they were paralyzed the manager clapped his two hands to the wound and doubled himself up then he staggered away but another of the assassins fired and he went down sidewise kicking and clawing among a heap of clinkers menzies the scotchman gave a roar of rage at the sight and rushed with an iron spanner at the murderers but was met by two balls in the face which dropped him dead at their very feet  there was a surge forward of some of the miners and an inarticulate cry of pity and of anger but a couple of the strangers emptied their sixshooters over the heads of the crowd and they broke and scattered some of them rushing wildly back to their homes in vermissa  when a few of the bravest had rallied and there was a return to the mine the murderous gang had vanished in the mists of morning without a single witness being able to swear to the identity of these men who in front of a hundred spectators had wrought this double crime  scanlan and mcmurdo made their way back scanlan somewhat subdued for it was the first murder job that he had seen with his own eyes and it appeared less funny than he had been led to believe the horrible screams of the dead managers wife pursued them as they hurried to the town mcmurdo was absorbed and silent but he showed no sympathy for the weakening of his companion  sure it is like a war he repeated what is it but a war between us and them and we hit back where we best can  there was high revel in the lodge room at the union house that night not only over the killing of the manager and engineer of the crow hill mine which would bring this organization into line with the other blackmailed and terrorstricken companies of the district but also over a distant triumph which had been wrought by the hands of the lodge itself  it would appear that when the county delegate had sent over five good men to strike a blow in vermissa he had demanded that in return three vermissa men should be secretly selected and sent across to kill william hales of stake royal one of the best known and most popular mine owners in the gilmerton district a man who was believed not to have an enemy in the world for he was in all ways a model employer he had insisted however upon efficiency in the work and had therefore paid off certain drunken and idle employees who were members of the allpowerful society coffin notices hung outside his door had not weakened his resolution and so in a free civilized country he found himself condemned to death  the execution had now been duly carried out ted baldwin who sprawled now in the seat of honour beside the bodymaster had been chief of the party his flushed face and glazed bloodshot eyes told of sleeplessness and drink he and his two comrades had spent the night before among the mountains they were unkempt and weatherstained but no heroes returning from a forlorn hope could have had a warmer welcome from their comrades  the story was told and retold amid cries of delight and shouts of laughter they had waited for their man as he drove home at nightfall taking their station at the top of a steep hill where his horse must be at a walk he was so furred to keep out the cold that he could not lay his hand on his pistol they had pulled him out and shot him again and again he had screamed for mercy the screams were repeated for the amusement of the lodge  lets hear again how he squealed they cried  none of them knew the man but there is eternal drama in a killing and they had shown the scowrers of gilmerton that the vermissa men were to be relied upon  there had been one contretemps for a man and his wife had driven up while they were still emptying their revolvers into the silent body it had been suggested that they should shoot them both but they were harmless folk who were not connected with the mines so they were sternly bidden to drive on and keep silent lest a worse thing befall them and so the bloodmottled figure had been left as a warning to all such hardhearted employers and the three noble avengers had hurried off into the mountains where unbroken nature comes down to the very edge of the furnaces and the slag heaps here they were safe and sound their work well done and the plaudits of their companions in their ears  it had been a great day for the scowrers the shadow had fallen even darker over the valley but as the wise general chooses the moment of victory in which to redouble his efforts so that his foes may have no time to steady themselves after disaster so boss mcginty looking out upon the scene of his operations with his brooding and malicious eyes had devised a new attack upon those who opposed him that very night as the halfdrunken company broke up he touched mcmurdo on the arm and led him aside into that inner room where they had their first interview  see here my lad said he ive got a job thats worthy of you at last youll have the doing of it in your own hands  proud i am to hear it mcmurdo answered  you can take two men with youmanders and reilly they have been warned for service well never be right in this district until chester wilcox has been settled and youll have the thanks of every lodge in the coal fields if you can down him  ill do my best anyhow who is he and where shall i find him  mcginty took his eternal halfchewed halfsmoked cigar from the corner of his mouth and proceeded to draw a rough diagram on a page torn from his notebook  hes the chief foreman of the iron dike company hes a hard citizen an old colour sergeant of the war all scars and grizzle weve had two tries at him but had no luck and jim carnaway lost his life over it now its for you to take it over thats the houseall alone at the iron dike crossroad same as you see here on the mapwithout another within earshot its no good by day hes armed and shoots quick and straight with no questions asked but at nightwell there he is with his wife three children and a hired help you cant pick or choose its all or none if you could get a bag of blasting powder at the front door with a slow match to it  whats the man done  didnt i tell you he shot jim carnaway  why did he shoot him  what in thunder has that to do with you carnaway was about his house at night and he shot him thats enough for me and you youve got to settle the thing right  theres these two women and the children do they go up too  they have toelse how can we get him  it seems hard on them for theyve done nothing  what sort of fools talk is this do you back out  easy councillor easy what have i ever said or done that you should think i would be after standing back from an order of the bodymaster of my own lodge if its right or if its wrong its for you to decide  youll do it then  of course i will do it  when  well you had best give me a night or two that i may see the house and make my plans then  very good said mcginty shaking him by the hand i leave it with you it will be a great day when you bring us the news its just the last stroke that will bring them all to their knees  mcmurdo thought long and deeply over the commission which had been so suddenly placed in his hands the isolated house in which chester wilcox lived was about five miles off in an adjacent valley that very night he started off all alone to prepare for the attempt it was daylight before he returned from his reconnaissance next day he interviewed his two subordinates manders and reilly reckless youngsters who were as elated as if it were a deerhunt  two nights later they met outside the town all three armed and one of them carrying a sack stuffed with the powder which was used in the quarries it was two in the morning before they came to the lonely house the night was a windy one with broken clouds drifting swiftly across the face of a threequarter moon they had been warned to be on their guard against bloodhounds so they moved forward cautiously with their pistols cocked in their hands but there was no sound save the howling of the wind and no movement but the swaying branches above them  mcmurdo listened at the door of the lonely house but all was still within then he leaned the powder bag against it ripped a hole in it with his knife and attached the fuse when it was well alight he and his two companions took to their heels and were some distance off safe and snug in a sheltering ditch before the shattering roar of the explosion with the low deep rumble of the collapsing building told them that their work was done no cleaner job had ever been carried out in the bloodstained annals of the society  but alas that work so well organized and boldly carried out should all have gone for nothing warned by the fate of the various victims and knowing that he was marked down for destruction chester wilcox had moved himself and his family only the day before to some safer and less known quarters where a guard of police should watch over them it was an empty house which had been torn down by the gunpowder and the grim old colour sergeant of the war was still teaching discipline to the miners of iron dike  leave him to me said mcmurdo hes my man and ill get him sure if i have to wait a year for him  a vote of thanks and confidence was passed in full lodge and so for the time the matter ended when a few weeks later it was reported in the papers that wilcox had been shot at from an ambuscade it was an open secret that mcmurdo was still at work upon his unfinished job  such were the methods of the society of freemen and such were the deeds of the scowrers by which they spread their rule of fear over the great and rich district which was for so long a period haunted by their terrible presence why should these pages be stained by further crimes have i not said enough to show the men and their methods  these deeds are written in history and there are records wherein one may read the details of them there one may learn of the shooting of policemen hunt and evans because they had ventured to arrest two members of the societya double outrage planned at the vermissa lodge and carried out in cold blood upon two helpless and disarmed men there also one may read of the shooting of mrs larbey when she was nursing her husband who had been beaten almost to death by orders of boss mcginty the killing of the elder jenkins shortly followed by that of his brother the mutilation of james murdoch the blowing up of the staphouse family and the murder of the stendals all followed hard upon one another in the same terrible winter  darkly the shadow lay upon the valley of fear the spring had come with running brooks and blossoming trees there was hope for all nature bound so long in an iron grip but nowhere was there any hope for the men and women who lived under the yoke of the terror never had the cloud above them been so dark and hopeless as in the early summer of the year 1875     chapter 6danger    it was the height of the reign of terror mcmurdo who had already been appointed inner deacon with every prospect of some day succeeding mcginty as bodymaster was now so necessary to the councils of his comrades that nothing was done without his help and advice the more popular he became however with the freemen the blacker were the scowls which greeted him as he passed along the streets of vermissa in spite of their terror the citizens were taking heart to band themselves together against their oppressors rumours had reached the lodge of secret gatherings in the herald office and of distribution of firearms among the lawabiding people but mcginty and his men were undisturbed by such reports they were numerous resolute and well armed their opponents were scattered and powerless it would all end as it had done in the past in aimless talk and possibly in impotent arrests so said mcginty mcmurdo and all the bolder spirits  it was a saturday evening in may saturday was always the lodge night and mcmurdo was leaving his house to attend it when morris the weaker brother of the order came to see him his brow was creased with care and his kindly face was drawn and haggard  can i speak with you freely mr mcmurdo  sure  i cant forget that i spoke my heart to you once and that you kept it to yourself even though the boss himself came to ask you about it  what else could i do if you trusted me it wasnt that i agreed with what you said  i know that well but you are the one that i can speak to and be safe ive a secret here he put his hand to his breast and it is just burning the life out of me i wish it had come to any one of you but me if i tell it it will mean murder for sure if i dont it may bring the end of us all god help me but i am near out of my wits over it  mcmurdo looked at the man earnestly he was trembling in every limb he poured some whisky into a glass and handed it to him thats the physic for the likes of you said he now let me hear of it  morris drank and his white face took a tinge of colour i can tell it to you all in one sentence said he theres a detective on our trail  mcmurdo stared at him in astonishment why man youre crazy he said isnt the place full of police and detectives and what harm did they ever do us  no no its no man of the district as you say we know them and it is little that they can do but youve heard of pinkertons  ive read of some folk of that name  well you can take it from me youve no show when they are on your trail its not a takeitormissit government concern its a dead earnest business proposition thats out for results and keeps out till by hook or crook it gets them if a pinkerton man is deep in this business we are all destroyed  we must kill him  ah its the first thought that came to you so it will be up at the lodge didnt i say to you that it would end in murder  sure what is murder isnt it common enough in these parts  it is indeed but its not for me to point out the man that is to be murdered id never rest easy again and yet its our own necks that may be at stake in gods name what shall i do he rocked to and fro in his agony of indecision  but his words had moved mcmurdo deeply it was easy to see that he shared the others opinion as to the danger and the need for meeting it he gripped morriss shoulder and shook him in his earnestness  see here man he cried and he almost screeched the words in his excitement you wont gain anything by sitting keening like an old wife at a wake lets have the facts who is the fellow where is he how did you hear of him why did you come to me  i came to you for you are the one man that would advise me i told you that i had a store in the east before i came here i left good friends behind me and one of them is in the telegraph service heres a letter that i had from him yesterday its this part from the top of the page you can read it yourself  this was what mcmurdo read  how are the scowrers getting on in your parts we read plenty of them in the papers between you and me i expect to hear news from you before long five big corporations and the two railroads have taken the thing up in dead earnest they mean it and you can bet theyll get there they are right deep down into it pinkerton has taken hold under their orders and his best man birdy edwards is operating the thing has got to be stopped right now  now read the postscript  of course what i give you is what i learned in business so it goes no further its a queer cipher that you handle by the yard every day and can get no meaning from  mcmurdo sat in silence for some time with the letter in his listless hands the mist had lifted for a moment and there was the abyss before him  does anyone else know of this he asked  i have told no one else  but this manyour friendhas he any other person that he would be likely to write to  well i dare say he knows one or two more  of the lodge  its likely enough  i was asking because it is likely that he may have given some description of this fellow birdy edwardsthen we could get on his trail  well its possible but i should not think he knew him he is just telling me the news that came to him by way of business how would he know this pinkerton man  mcmurdo gave a violent start  by gar he cried ive got him what a fool i was not to know it lord but were in luck we will fix him before he can do any harm see here morris will you leave this thing in my hands  sure if you will only take it off mine  ill do that you can stand right back and let me run it even your name need not be mentioned ill take it all on myself as if it were to me that this letter has come will that content you  its just what i would ask  then leave it at that and keep your head shut now ill get down to the lodge and well soon make old man pinkerton sorry for himself  you wouldnt kill this man  the less you know friend morris the easier your conscience will be and the better you will sleep ask no questions and let these things settle themselves i have hold of it now  morris shook his head sadly as he left i feel that his blood is on my hands he groaned  selfprotection is no murder anyhow said mcmurdo smiling grimly its him or us i guess this man would destroy us all if we left him long in the valley why brother morris well have to elect you bodymaster yet for youve surely saved the lodge  and yet it was clear from his actions that he thought more seriously of this new intrusion than his words would show it may have been his guilty conscience it may have been the reputation of the pinkerton organization it may have been the knowledge that great rich corporations had set themselves the task of clearing out the scowrers but whatever his reason his actions were those of a man who is preparing for the worst every paper which would incriminate him was destroyed before he left the house after that he gave a long sigh of satisfaction for it seemed to him that he was safe and yet the danger must still have pressed somewhat upon him for on his way to the lodge he stopped at old man shafters the house was forbidden him but when he tapped at the window ettie came out to him the dancing irish deviltry had gone from her lovers eyes she read his danger in his earnest face  something has happened she cried oh jack you are in danger  sure it is not very bad my sweetheart and yet it may be wise that we make a move before it is worse  make a move  i promised you once that i would go some day i think the time is coming i had news tonight bad news and i see trouble coming  the police  well a pinkerton but sure you wouldnt know what that is acushla nor what it may mean to the likes of me im too deep in this thing and i may have to get out of it quick you said you would come with me if i went  oh jack it would be the saving of you  im an honest man in some things ettie i wouldnt hurt a hair of your bonny head for all that the world can give nor ever pull you down one inch from the golden throne above the clouds where i always see you would you trust me  she put her hand in his without a word well then listen to what i say and do as i order you for indeed its the only way for us things are going to happen in this valley i feel it in my bones there may be many of us that will have to look out for ourselves im one anyhow if i go by day or night its you that must come with me  id come after you jack  no no you shall come with me if this valley is closed to me and i can never come back how can i leave you behind and me perhaps in hiding from the police with never a chance of a message its with me you must come i know a good woman in the place i come from and its there id leave you till we can get married will you come  yes jack i will come  god bless you for your trust in me its a fiend out of hell that i should be if i abused it now mark you ettie it will be just a word to you and when it reaches you you will drop everything and come right down to the waiting room at the depot and stay there till i come for you  day or night ill come at the word jack  somewhat eased in mind now that his own preparations for escape had been begun mcmurdo went on to the lodge it had already assembled and only by complicated signs and countersigns could he pass through the outer guard and inner guard who closetiled it a buzz of pleasure and welcome greeted him as he entered the long room was crowded and through the haze of tobacco smoke he saw the tangled black mane of the bodymaster the cruel unfriendly features of baldwin the vulture face of harraway the secretary and a dozen more who were among the leaders of the lodge he rejoiced that they should all be there to take counsel over his news  indeed its glad we are to see you brother cried the chairman theres business here that wants a solomon in judgment to set it right  its lander and egan explained his neighbour as he took his seat they both claim the head money given by the lodge for the shooting of old man crabbe over at stylestown and whos to say which fired the bullet  mcmurdo rose in his place and raised his hand the expression of his face froze the attention of the audience there was a dead hush of expectation  eminent bodymaster he said in a solemn voice i claim urgency  brother mcmurdo claims urgency said mcginty its a claim that by the rules of this lodge takes precedence now brother we attend you  mcmurdo took the letter from his pocket  eminent bodymaster and brethren he said i am the bearer of ill news this day but it is better that it should be known and discussed than that a blow should fall upon us without warning which would destroy us all i have information that the most powerful and richest organizations in this state have bound themselves together for our destruction and that at this very moment there is a pinkerton detective one birdy edwards at work in the valley collecting the evidence which may put a rope round the necks of many of us and send every man in this room into a felons cell that is the situation for the discussion of which i have made a claim of urgency  there was a dead silence in the room it was broken by the chairman  what is your evidence for this brother mcmurdo he asked  it is in this letter which has come into my hands said mcmurdo he read the passage aloud it is a matter of honour with me that i can give no further particulars about the letter nor put it into your hands but i assure you that there is nothing else in it which can affect the interests of the lodge i put the case before you as it has reached me  let me say mr chairman said one of the older brethren that i have heard of birdy edwards and that he has the name of being the best man in the pinkerton service  does anyone know him by sight asked mcginty  yes said mcmurdo i do  there was a murmur of astonishment through the hall  i believe we hold him in the hollow of our hands he continued with an exulting smile upon his face if we act quickly and wisely we can cut this thing short if i have your confidence and your help it is little that we have to fear  what have we to fear anyhow what can he know of our affairs  you might say so if all were as stanch as you councillor but this man has all the millions of the capitalists at his back do you think there is no weaker brother among all our lodges that could not be bought he will get at our secretsmaybe has got them already theres only one sure cure  that he never leaves the valley said baldwin  mcmurdo nodded good for you brother baldwin he said you and i have had our differences but you have said the true word tonight  where is he then where shall we know him  eminent bodymaster said mcmurdo earnestly i would put it to you that this is too vital a thing for us to discuss in open lodge god forbid that i should throw a doubt on anyone here but if so much as a word of gossip got to the ears of this man there would be an end of any chance of our getting him i would ask the lodge to choose a trusty committee mr chairmanyourself if i might suggest it and brother baldwin here and five more then i can talk freely of what i know and of what i advise should be done  the proposition was at once adopted and the committee chosen besides the chairman and baldwin there were the vulturefaced secretary harraway tiger cormac the brutal young assassin carter the treasurer and the brothers willaby fearless and desperate men who would stick at nothing  the usual revelry of the lodge was short and subdued for there was a cloud upon the mens spirits and many there for the first time began to see the cloud of avenging law drifting up in that serene sky under which they had dwelt so long the horrors they had dealt out to others had been so much a part of their settled lives that the thought of retribution had become a remote one and so seemed the more startling now that it came so closely upon them they broke up early and left their leaders to their council  now mcmurdo said mcginty when they were alone the seven men sat frozen in their seats  i said just now that i knew birdy edwards mcmurdo explained i need not tell you that he is not here under that name hes a brave man but not a crazy one he passes under the name of steve wilson and he is lodging at hobsons patch  how do you know this  because i fell into talk with him i thought little of it at the time nor would have given it a second thought but for this letter but now im sure its the man i met him on the cars when i went down the line on wednesdaya hard case if ever there was one he said he was a reporter i believed it for the moment wanted to know all he could about the scowrers and what he called the outrages for a new york paper asked me every kind of question so as to get something you bet i was giving nothing away id pay for it and pay well said he if i could get some stuff that would suit my editor i said what i thought would please him best and he handed me a twentydollar bill for my information theres ten times that for you said he if you can find me all that i want  what did you tell him then  any stuff i could make up  how do you know he wasnt a newspaper man  ill tell you he got out at hobsons patch and so did i i chanced into the telegraph bureau and he was leaving it  see here said the operator after hed gone out i guess we should charge double rates for thisi guess you should said i he had filled the form with stuff that might have been chinese for all we could make of it he fires a sheet of this off every day said the clerk yes said i its special news for his paper and hes scared that the others should tap it that was what the operator thought and what i thought at the time but i think differently now  by gar i believe you are right said mcginty but what do you allow that we should do about it  why not go right down now and fix him someone suggested  ay the sooner the better  id start this next minute if i knew where we could find him said mcmurdo hes in hobsons patch but i dont know the house ive got a plan though if youll only take my advice  well what is it  ill go to the patch tomorrow morning ill find him through the operator he can locate him i guess well then ill tell him that im a freeman myself ill offer him all the secrets of the lodge for a price you bet hell tumble to it ill tell him the papers are at my house and that its as much as my life would be worth to let him come while folk were about hell see that thats horse sense let him come at ten oclock at night and he shall see everything that will fetch him sure  well  you can plan the rest for yourselves widow macnamaras is a lonely house shes as true as steel and as deaf as a post theres only scanlan and me in the house if i get his promiseand ill let you know if i doid have the whole seven of you come to me by nine oclock well get him in if ever he gets out alivewell he can talk of birdy edwardss luck for the rest of his days  theres going to be a vacancy at pinkertons or im mistaken leave it at that mcmurdo at nine tomorrow well be with you you once get the door shut behind him and you can leave the rest with us     chapter 7the trapping of birdy edwards    as mcmurdo had said the house in which he lived was a lonely one and very well suited for such a crime as they had planned it was on the extreme fringe of the town and stood well back from the road in any other case the conspirators would have simply called out their man as they had many a time before and emptied their pistols into his body but in this instance it was very necessary to find out how much he knew how he knew it and what had been passed on to his employers  it was possible that they were already too late and that the work had been done if that was indeed so they could at least have their revenge upon the man who had done it but they were hopeful that nothing of great importance had yet come to the detectives knowledge as otherwise they argued he would not have troubled to write down and forward such trivial information as mcmurdo claimed to have given him however all this they would learn from his own lips once in their power they would find a way to make him speak it was not the first time that they had handled an unwilling witness  mcmurdo went to hobsons patch as agreed the police seemed to take particular interest in him that morning and captain marvinhe who had claimed the old acquaintance with him at chicagoactually addressed him as he waited at the station mcmurdo turned away and refused to speak with him he was back from his mission in the afternoon and saw mcginty at the union house  he is coming he said  good said mcginty the giant was in his shirt sleeves with chains and seals gleaming athwart his ample waistcoat and a diamond twinkling through the fringe of his bristling beard drink and politics had made the boss a very rich as well as powerful man the more terrible therefore seemed that glimpse of the prison or the gallows which had risen before him the night before  do you reckon he knows much he asked anxiously  mcmurdo shook his head gloomily hes been here some timesix weeks at the least i guess he didnt come into these parts to look at the prospect if he has been working among us all that time with the railroad money at his back i should expect that he has got results and that he has passed them on  theres not a weak man in the lodge cried mcginty true as steel every man of them and yet by the lord there is that skunk morris what about him if any man gives us away it would be he ive a mind to send a couple of the boys round before evening to give him a beating up and see what they can get from him  well there would be no harm in that mcmurdo answered i wont deny that i have a liking for morris and would be sorry to see him come to harm he has spoken to me once or twice over lodge matters and though he may not see them the same as you or i he never seemed the sort that squeals but still it is not for me to stand between him and you  ill fix the old devil said mcginty with an oath ive had my eye on him this year past  well you know best about that mcmurdo answered but whatever you do must be tomorrow for we must lie low until the pinkerton affair is settled up we cant afford to set the police buzzing today of all days  true for you said mcginty and well learn from birdy edwards himself where he got his news if we have to cut his heart out first did he seem to scent a trap  mcmurdo laughed i guess i took him on his weak point he said if he could get on a good trail of the scowrers hes ready to follow it into hell i took his money mcmurdo grinned as he produced a wad of dollar notes and as much more when he has seen all my papers  what papers  well there are no papers but i filled him up about constitutions and books of rules and forms of membership he expects to get right down to the end of everything before he leaves  faith hes right there said mcginty grimly didnt he ask you why you didnt bring him the papers  as if i would carry such things and me a suspected man and captain marvin after speaking to me this very day at the depot  ay i heard of that said mcginty i guess the heavy end of this business is coming on to you we could put him down an old shaft when weve done with him but however we work it we cant get past the man living at hobsons patch and you being there today  mcmurdo shrugged his shoulders if we handle it right they can never prove the killing said he no one can see him come to the house after dark and ill lay to it that no one will see him go now see here councillor ill show you my plan and ill ask you to fit the others into it you will all come in good time very well he comes at ten he is to tap three times and me to open the door for him then ill get behind him and shut it hes our man then  thats all easy and plain  yes but the next step wants considering hes a hard proposition hes heavily armed ive fooled him proper and yet he is likely to be on his guard suppose i show him right into a room with seven men in it where he expected to find me alone there is going to be shooting and somebody is going to be hurt  thats so  and the noise is going to bring every damned copper in the township on top of it  i guess you are right  this is how i should work it you will all be in the big roomsame as you saw when you had a chat with me ill open the door for him show him into the parlour beside the door and leave him there while i get the papers that will give me the chance of telling you how things are shaping then i will go back to him with some faked papers as he is reading them i will jump for him and get my grip on his pistol arm youll hear me call and in you will rush the quicker the better for he is as strong a man as i and i may have more than i can manage but i allow that i can hold him till you come  its a good plan said mcginty the lodge will owe you a debt for this i guess when i move out of the chair i can put a name to the man thats coming after me  sure councillor i am little more than a recruit said mcmurdo but his face showed what he thought of the great mans compliment  when he had returned home he made his own preparations for the grim evening in front of him first he cleaned oiled and loaded his smith  wesson revolver then he surveyed the room in which the detective was to be trapped it was a large apartment with a long deal table in the centre and the big stove at one side at each of the other sides were windows there were no shutters on these only light curtains which drew across mcmurdo examined these attentively no doubt it must have struck him that the apartment was very exposed for so secret a meeting yet its distance from the road made it of less consequence finally he discussed the matter with his fellow lodger scanlan though a scowrer was an inoffensive little man who was too weak to stand against the opinion of his comrades but was secretly horrified by the deeds of blood at which he had sometimes been forced to assist mcmurdo told him shortly what was intended  and if i were you mike scanlan i would take a night off and keep clear of it there will be bloody work here before morning  well indeed then mac scanlan answered its not the will but the nerve that is wanting in me when i saw manager dunn go down at the colliery yonder it was just more than i could stand im not made for it same as you or mcginty if the lodge will think none the worse of me ill just do as you advise and leave you to yourselves for the evening  the men came in good time as arranged they were outwardly respectable citizens well clad and cleanly but a judge of faces would have read little hope for birdy edwards in those hard mouths and remorseless eyes there was not a man in the room whose hands had not been reddened a dozen times before they were as hardened to human murder as a butcher to sheep  foremost of course both in appearance and in guilt was the formidable boss harraway the secretary was a lean bitter man with a long scraggy neck and nervous jerky limbs a man of incorruptible fidelity where the finances of the order were concerned and with no notion of justice or honesty to anyone beyond the treasurer carter was a middleaged man with an impassive rather sulky expression and a yellow parchment skin he was a capable organizer and the actual details of nearly every outrage had sprung from his plotting brain the two willabys were men of action tall lithe young fellows with determined faces while their companion tiger cormac a heavy dark youth was feared even by his own comrades for the ferocity of his disposition these were the men who assembled that night under the roof of mcmurdo for the killing of the pinkerton detective  their host had placed whisky upon the table and they had hastened to prime themselves for the work before them baldwin and cormac were already halfdrunk and the liquor had brought out all their ferocity cormac placed his hands on the stove for an instantit had been lighted for the nights were still cold  that will do said he with an oath  ay said baldwin catching his meaning if he is strapped to that we will have the truth out of him  well have the truth out of him never fear said mcmurdo he had nerves of steel this man for though the whole weight of the affair was on him his manner was as cool and unconcerned as ever the others marked it and applauded  you are the one to handle him said the boss approvingly not a warning will he get till your hand is on his throat its a pity there are no shutters to your windows  mcmurdo went from one to the other and drew the curtains tighter sure no one can spy upon us now its close upon the hour  maybe he wont come maybe hell get a sniff of danger said the secretary  hell come never fear mcmurdo answered he is as eager to come as you can be to see him hark to that  they all sat like wax figures some with their glasses arrested halfway to their lips three loud knocks had sounded at the door  hush mcmurdo raised his hand in caution an exulting glance went round the circle and hands were laid upon their weapons  not a sound for your lives mcmurdo whispered as he went from the room closing the door carefully behind him  with strained ears the murderers waited they counted the steps of their comrade down the passage then they heard him open the outer door there were a few words as of greeting then they were aware of a strange step inside and of an unfamiliar voice an instant later came the slam of the door and the turning of the key in the lock their prey was safe within the trap tiger cormac laughed horribly and boss mcginty clapped his great hand across his mouth  be quiet you fool he whispered youll be the undoing of us yet  there was a mutter of conversation from the next room it seemed interminable then the door opened and mcmurdo appeared his finger upon his lip  he came to the end of the table and looked round at them a subtle change had come over him his manner was as of one who has great work to do his face had set into granite firmness his eyes shone with a fierce excitement behind his spectacles he had become a visible leader of men they stared at him with eager interest but he said nothing still with the same singular gaze he looked from man to man  well cried boss mcginty at last is he here is birdy edwards here  yes mcmurdo answered slowly birdy edwards is here i am birdy edwards  there were ten seconds after that brief speech during which the room might have been empty so profound was the silence the hissing of a kettle upon the stove rose sharp and strident to the ear seven white faces all turned upward to this man who dominated them were set motionless with utter terror then with a sudden shivering of glass a bristle of glistening rifle barrels broke through each window while the curtains were torn from their hangings  at the sight boss mcginty gave the roar of a wounded bear and plunged for the halfopened door a levelled revolver met him there with the stern blue eyes of captain marvin of the mine police gleaming behind the sights the boss recoiled and fell back into his chair  youre safer there councillor said the man whom they had known as mcmurdo and you baldwin if you dont take your hand off your pistol youll cheat the hangman yet pull it out or by the lord that made methere that will do there are forty armed men round this house and you can figure it out for yourself what chance you have take their pistols marvin  there was no possible resistance under the menace of those rifles the men were disarmed sulky sheepish and amazed they still sat round the table  id like to say a word to you before we separate said the man who had trapped them i guess we may not meet again until you see me on the stand in the courthouse ill give you something to think over between now and then you know me now for what i am at last i can put my cards on the table i am birdy edwards of pinkertons i was chosen to break up your gang i had a hard and dangerous game to play not a soul not one soul not my nearest and dearest knew that i was playing it only captain marvin here and my employers knew that but its over tonight thank god and i am the winner  the seven pale rigid faces looked up at him there was unappeasable hatred in their eyes he read the relentless threat  maybe you think that the game is not over yet well i take my chance of that anyhow some of you will take no further hand and there are sixty more besides yourselves that will see a jail this night ill tell you this that when i was put upon this job i never believed there was such a society as yours i thought it was paper talk and that i would prove it so they told me it was to do with the freemen so i went to chicago and was made one then i was surer than ever that it was just paper talk for i found no harm in the society but a deal of good  still i had to carry out my job and i came to the coal valleys when i reached this place i learned that i was wrong and that it wasnt a dime novel after all so i stayed to look after it i never killed a man in chicago i never minted a dollar in my life those i gave you were as good as any others but i never spent money better but i knew the way into your good wishes and so i pretended to you that the law was after me it all worked just as i thought  so i joined your infernal lodge and i took my share in your councils maybe they will say that i was as bad as you they can say what they like so long as i get you but what is the truth the night i joined you beat up old man stanger i could not warn him for there was no time but i held your hand baldwin when you would have killed him if ever i have suggested things so as to keep my place among you they were things which i knew i could prevent i could not save dunn and menzies for i did not know enough but i will see that their murderers are hanged i gave chester wilcox warning so that when i blew his house in he and his folk were in hiding there was many a crime that i could not stop but if you look back and think how often your man came home the other road or was down in town when you went for him or stayed indoors when you thought he would come out youll see my work  you blasted traitor hissed mcginty through his closed teeth  ay john mcginty you may call me that if it eases your smart you and your like have been the enemy of god and man in these parts it took a man to get between you and the poor devils of men and women that you held under your grip there was just one way of doing it and i did it you call me a traitor but i guess theres many a thousand will call me a deliverer that went down into hell to save them ive had three months of it i wouldnt have three such months again if they let me loose in the treasury at washington for it i had to stay till i had it all every man and every secret right here in this hand id have waited a little longer if it hadnt come to my knowledge that my secret was coming out a letter had come into the town that would have set you wise to it all then i had to act and act quickly  ive nothing more to say to you except that when my time comes ill die the easier when i think of the work i have done in this valley now marvin ill keep you no more take them in and get it over  there is little more to tell scanlan had been given a sealed note to be left at the address of miss ettie shafter a mission which he had accepted with a wink and a knowing smile in the early hours of the morning a beautiful woman and a much muffled man boarded a special train which had been sent by the railroad company and made a swift unbroken journey out of the land of danger it was the last time that ever either ettie or her lover set foot in the valley of fear ten days later they were married in chicago with old jacob shafter as witness of the wedding  the trial of the scowrers was held far from the place where their adherents might have terrified the guardians of the law in vain they struggled in vain the money of the lodgemoney squeezed by blackmail out of the whole countrysidewas spent like water in the attempt to save them that cold clear unimpassioned statement from one who knew every detail of their lives their organization and their crimes was unshaken by all the wiles of their defenders at last after so many years they were broken and scattered the cloud was lifted forever from the valley  mcginty met his fate upon the scaffold cringing and whining when the last hour came eight of his chief followers shared his fate fiftyodd had various degrees of imprisonment the work of birdy edwards was complete  and yet as he had guessed the game was not over yet there was another hand to be played and yet another and another ted baldwin for one had escaped the scaffold so had the willabys so had several others of the fiercest spirits of the gang for ten years they were out of the world and then came a day when they were free once morea day which edwards who knew his men was very sure would be an end of his life of peace they had sworn an oath on all that they thought holy to have his blood as a vengeance for their comrades and well they strove to keep their vow  from chicago he was chased after two attempts so near success that it was sure that the third would get him from chicago he went under a changed name to california and it was there that the light went for a time out of his life when ettie edwards died once again he was nearly killed and once again under the name of douglas he worked in a lonely canyon where with an english partner named barker he amassed a fortune at last there came a warning to him that the bloodhounds were on his track once more and he clearedonly just in timefor england and thence came the john douglas who for a second time married a worthy mate and lived for five years as a sussex county gentleman a life which ended with the strange happenings of which we have heard     epilogue    the police trial had passed in which the case of john douglas was referred to a higher court so had the quarter sessions at which he was acquitted as having acted in selfdefense  get him out of england at any cost wrote holmes to the wife there are forces here which may be more dangerous than those he has escaped there is no safety for your husband in england  two months had gone by and the case had to some extent passed from our minds then one morning there came an enigmatic note slipped into our letter box dear me mr holmes dear me said this singular epistle there was neither superscription nor signature i laughed at the quaint message but holmes showed unwonted seriousness  deviltry watson he remarked and sat long with a clouded brow  late last night mrs hudson our landlady brought up a message that a gentleman wished to see mr holmes and that the matter was of the utmost importance close at the heels of his messenger came cecil barker our friend of the moated manor house his face was drawn and haggard  ive had bad newsterrible news mr holmes said he  i feared as much said holmes  you have not had a cable have you  i have had a note from someone who has  its poor douglas they tell me his name is edwards but he will always be jack douglas of benito canyon to me i told you that they started together for south africa in the palmyra three weeks ago  exactly  the ship reached cape town last night i received this cable from mrs douglas this morning  jack has been lost overboard in gale off st helena no one knows how accident occurred  ivy douglas  ha it came like that did it said holmes thoughtfully well ive no doubt it was well stagemanaged  you mean that you think there was no accident  none in the world  he was murdered  surely  so i think also these infernal scowrers this cursed vindictive nest of criminals  no no my good sir said holmes there is a master hand here it is no case of sawedoff shotguns and clumsy sixshooters you can tell an old master by the sweep of his brush i can tell a moriarty when i see one this crime is from london not from america  but for what motive  because it is done by a man who cannot afford to fail one whose whole unique position depends upon the fact that all he does must succeed a great brain and a huge organization have been turned to the extinction of one man it is crushing the nut with the triphammeran absurd extravagance of energybut the nut is very effectually crushed all the same  how came this man to have anything to do with it  i can only say that the first word that ever came to us of the business was from one of his lieutenants these americans were well advised having an english job to do they took into partnership as any foreign criminal could do this great consultant in crime from that moment their man was doomed at first he would content himself by using his machinery in order to find their victim then he would indicate how the matter might be treated finally when he read in the reports of the failure of this agent he would step in himself with a master touch you heard me warn this man at birlstone manor house that the coming danger was greater than the past was i right  barker beat his head with his clenched fist in his impotent anger do not tell me that we have to sit down under this do you say that no one can ever get level with this king devil  no i dont say that said holmes and his eyes seemed to be looking far into the future i dont say that he cant be beat but you must give me timeyou must give me time  we all sat in silence for some minutes while those fateful eyes still strained to pierce the veil
