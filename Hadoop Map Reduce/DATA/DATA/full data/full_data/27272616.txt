 to himself  the cloven hoof by george  this is a breach of faith  ill write to him jackman confound it  id certainly never have sold if id known he was going to do this  mrs j  no sir im sure sir  they do say its to do with the potteries  he wants the cottages for his workmen  hillcrist  sharply  thats all very well but he shouldnt have led me to suppose that he would make no change  jackman heavily  they talk about his havin bought the centry to gut up more chimneys there and thats why he wants the cottages  hint  the centry  impossible       mrs j  yes air its such a pretty spotlooks beautiful      from here  she looks out through the window  loveliest spot      in all deepwater i always say  and your father owned it and      his father before im  its a pity they ever sold it sir

gentleman i said  this man i said dont care for the neighbourhood or the people he dont care for anything so long as he makes his money and has his importance  you cant expect it i suppose i said bitterly  havin got rich so sudden  the gentry dont do things like that  hillcrist  abstracted  quite mrs jackman quite to himself  the centry  no       mrs hillcrist enters  a welldressed woman with a firm      clearcut face  oh  amy  mr and mrs jackman turned out of their cottage and mrs harvey and the drews  when i sold to hornblower i stipulated that they shouldnt be  mrs j  our weeks up on

hillcrist  turning people out that have been there thirty years  i wont have it  its a breach of faith  mrs h  do you suppose this hornblower will care two straws about that jack  hillcrist  he must when its put to him if hes got any decent feeling  mrs h  he hasnt  hillcrist  suddenly  the jackmans talk of his having bought the centry to put up more chimneys  mrs h  never  at the window looking out  impossible  it would ruin the place utterly besides cutting us off from the dukes  oh no  miss mullins would never sell behind our backs  hillcrist  anyway i must stop his turning these people out  mrs h  with a little smile almost contemptuous  you might have known hed do something of the sort  you will imagine people are like yourself jack  you always ought to make dawker have things in black and white  hillcrist  i said quite distinctly of course you wont want to disturb the tenancies theres a great shortage of cottages hornblower told me as distinctly that he wouldnt  what more do you want  mrs h  a man like that thinks of nothing but the short cut to his own way  looking out of the window towards the rise  if he buys the centry and puts up chimneys we simply couldnt stop here  hillcrist  my father would turn in his grave  mrs h  it would have been more useful if hed not dipped the estate and sold the centry  this hornblower hates us he thinks we turn up our noses at him  hillcrist  as we do amy  mrs h  who wouldnt  a man without traditions who believes in nothing but money and push  hillcrist  suppose he wont budge can we do anything for the jackmans  mrs h  there are the two rooms beaver used to have over the stables  fellows  mr dawker sir       dawkers is a short square rather redfaced terrier of a man      in riding clothes and gaiters  hillcrist  ah dawker ive got gout again  dawker  very sorry sir  how de do maam  hillcrist  did you meet the jackmans  dawkers  yeh       he hardly ever quite finishes a word seeming to snap of their      tails  hillcrist  then you heard  dawker  nodding  smart man hornblower never lets grass grow  hillcrist  smart  dawker  grinning  dont do to underrate your neighbours  mrs h  a cadi call him  dawker  thats it maamgot all the advantage  hillcrist  heard anything about the centry dawker  dawker  hornblower wants to buy  hillcrist  miss mullins would never sell would she  dawker  she wants to  hillcrist  the deuce she does  dawker  he wont stick at the price either  mrs h  whats it worth dawker  dawker  depends on what you want it for  mrs h  he wants it for spite we want it for sentiment  dawker  grinning  worth what you like to give then but hes a rich man  mrs h  intolerable  dawker  to hillcrist  give me your figure sir  ill try the old lady before he gets at her  hillcrist  pondering  i dont want to buy unless theres nothing else for it  i should have to raise the money on the estate it wont stand much more  i cant believe the fellow would be such a barbarian  chimneys within three hundred yards right in front of this house  its a nightmare  mrs h  youd much better let dawker make sure jack  hillcrist  uncomfortable  jackman says hornblowers coming round to see me  i shall put it to him

eyebrow a wide      mouth  he wears quite ordinary clothes as if that department      were in charge of someone who knew about such things  he has      a small rose in his buttonhole and carries a homburg hat      which one suspects will look too small on his head  hornblower  good morning  good morning  how are ye dawker  fine morning  lovely weather       his voice has a curious blend in its tone of brass and oil      and an accent not quite scotch nor quite north country  havent seen ye for a long time hillcrist  hillcrist  who has risen  not since i sold you longmeadow and those cottages i believe  hornblower  dear me now  thats what i came about  hillcrist  subsiding again into his chair  forgive me  wont you sit down  hornblower  not sitting  have ye got gout  thats

youd kindly explain yourself  hornblower  with a great smile  ca canny im fra the north  hillcrist  im told you wish to buy the centry and put more of your chimneys up there regardless of the fact he points through the window  that it would utterly ruin the house weve had for generations and all our pleasure here  hornblower  how the man talks  why  yed think he owned the sky because his fathers built him a house with a pretty view where hes nothing to do but live  its sheer want of something to do that gives ye your fine sentiments hillcrist   hillcrist  have the goodness not to charge me with idleness dawkerwhere is hehe shows the bureau  when you do the drudgery of your works as thoroughly as i do that of my estate is it true about the centry  hornblower  gospel true  if ye want to

we shall see if you can ride roughshod like this  we used to have decent ways of going about things here  you want to change all that  well we shall do our damnedest to stop you  to fellows at the door  are the jackmans still in the house  ask them to be good enough to come in  hornblower  with the first sign of uneasiness  ive seen these people  ive nothing more to say to them  i told em id give em five pounds to cover their moving  hillcrist  it doesnt occur to you that people however humble like to have some say in their own fate  hornblower  i never had any say in mine till i had the brass and nobody ever will  its all hypocrisy  you county folk are fair awful hypocrites  ye talk about good form and all that sort o thing  its just the comfortable doctrine of the man in the saddle sentimental varnish  yere every bit as hard as i am underneath  mrs h  who had been standing very still all this time  you flatter us  hornblower  not at all  god helps those who elp themselves thats at the bottom of all religion  im goin to help meself and gods going to help me  mrs h  i admire your knowledge  hillcrist  we are in the right and god helps  hornblower  dont ye believe it ye avent

two from it  mrs j  to mrs hillcrist  were attached to it like maam  hillcrist  to hornblower  how would you like being turned out of a place you were fond of  hornblower  not a bit  but little considerations have to give way to big ones  now missis ill make it ten pounds and ill send a wagon to shift your things  if that isnt fair  yed better accept i shant keep it open       the jackmans look at each other their faces show deep anger      and the question they ask each other is which will speak  mrs j  we wont take it eh george  jackman  not a farden  we come there when we was married  hornblower  throwing out his finger  yere very improvident folk  hillcrist  dont lecture them mr hornblower they come out of this miles above you  hornblower angry  well i was going to give ye

ladys gone  hillcrist  with dignity  im not going in for a slanging match i resent your conduct much too deeply  hornblower look here hillcrist i dont object to you personally ye seem to me a poor creature thats bound to get left with your gout and your dignity but of course ye can make yourself very disagreeable before yere done  now i want to be the movin spirit here  im full of plans  im goin to stand for parliament im goin to make this a prosperous place  im a goodmatured man if youll treat me as such  now you take me on as a neighbour and all that and ill manage without chimneys on the centry  is it a bargain  he holds out his hand  hillcrist  ignoring it  i thought you said you didnt keep your word when it suited you to break it  hornblower  now dont get on the high horse  you and me could be very good friends but i can be a very nasty enemy  the chimneys will not look nice from that windie ye know  hillcrist  deeply angry  mr hornblower if you think ill take your hand after this jackman business youre greatly mistaken  you are proposing that i shall stand in with you while you tyrannise over the neighbourhood  please realise that unless you leave those tenancies

 and make no mistakehes got it in his packet  its your last chance hillcrist  im not averse to you as a man i think yere the best of the fossils round here at least i think ye can do me the most harm socially  come now       he holds out his hand again  hillcrist  not if youd bought the centry ten times over  your ways are not mine and ill have nothing to do with you  hornblower  very angry  really  is that so  very well  now yere goin to learn something an its time ye did  dye realise that im very nearly round ye  he draws a circle slowly in the air  im at uphill the works are here heres

your north and i shall come out on it there to your west  when ive got me new works up on the centry i shall be makin a trolley track between the works up to the road at both ends so any goods will be running right round ye howll ye like that for a country place       for answer hillcrist who is angry beyond the power of speech      walks forgetting to use his stick up to the french window      while he stands there with his back to hornblower the door l      is flung open and jim enters preceding charles his wife      chloe and rolf  charles is a goodishlooking moustached      young man of about twentyeight with a white rim to the collar      of his waistcoat and spats  he has his hand behind chloes      back as if to prevent her turning tail  she is rather a      handsome young woman with dark eyes full red lips and a      suspicion of powder a little underdressed for the country      rolf mho brings up the rear is about twenty with an open      face and stiffish buttercoloured hair  jill runs over to her      father at the window  she has a bottle  jill  sotto voce  look dodo ive brought the lot  isnt it a treat dear papa  and heres the stuff  hallo       the exclamation is

 unhappily acquiescent  certainly  ill go to the other end       she moves to the left mounts the steps and sits down       rolf looking in through the door and seeing where she is      joins her  mrs

hair fitting him like a cap and a clipped grey moustache      his lids come down over his quick eyes till he can see you      very sharply and you can hardly see that he can see you he      can break into a smile at any moment which has no connection      with him as it were  by a certain hurt look however when      bidding is slow he discloses that he is not merely an      auctioneer but has in him elements of the human being  he can      wink with anyone and is dressed in a snugbrown suit with a      perfectly unbuttoned waistcoat a low turned down collar and      small black and white sailor knot tie  while he is settling      his papers the hillcrists settle themselves tensely  chloe      has drunk her water and leaned back again with the smelling      salts to her nose  rolf

thinking of her                  curtain falls for a minute    scene ii        when it rises again the room is empty and dark same for      moonlight coming in through the french window which is open       the figure of chloe in a black cloak appears outside in the      moonlight she peers in moves past comes bank hesitatingly      enters  the cloak fallen back reveals a white evening dress      and that magpie figure stands poised watchfully in the dim      light then flaps unhappily left and right as if she could not      keep still  suddenly she stands listening  rolfs voice  outside  chloe  chloe       he appears  chloe  going to the window  what are you doing here  rolf  what are you  i only followed you  chloe  go away  rolf  whats the matter  tell me  chloe  go away and dont

 chloe      with a little moaning sound flutters again magpielike up      and down then stands by the window listening  voices are      heard left  she darts out of the window and away to the      right as hillcrist and jill come in  they have turned up the      electric light and come down in frond of the fireplace where      hillcrist sits in an armchair and jill on the arm of it  they      are in undress evening attire  hillcrist  now tell me  jill  there isnt much dodo  i was in an awful funk for fear i should meet any of the others and of course i did meet rolf but i told him some lie and he took me to her roomboudoir they call it isnt boudoir a dugout word  hillcrist  meditatively  the sulking room  well  jill  she was sitting like this  she buries her chin in her hands wide her elbows on her knees  and she said in a sort of fierce way what do you want  and i said im awfully sorry but i thought you might like it  hillcrist  well  jill  she looked at me hard and said i suppose you know all about it  and i said only vaguely because of course i dont and she said well it was decent of you to come  dodo she looks like a lost soul  what has she done  hillcrist  she committed her real crime when she married young hornblower without telling him  she came out of a certain world to do it  jill  oh  staring in front of her is it very awful in that world dodo  hillcrist  uneasy  i dont know jill  some can stand it i suppose some cant  i dont know which sort she is  jill  one thing im sure of shes awfully fond of chearlie  hillcrist  thats bad thats very bad  jill  and shes frightened horribly  i think shes desperate  hillcrist  women like that are pretty tough jill dont judge her too much by your own feelings  jill  no onlyoh  it was beastly and of course i dried up  hillcrist  feelingly  hm  one always does  but perhaps it was as well youd have been blundering in a dark passage  jill  i just said father and i feel awfully sorry if theres anything we can do  hillcrist  that was risky jill  jill  disconsolately i had to say something  im glad i went anyway  i feel more human  hillcrist  we had to fight for our home  i should have felt like a traitor if i hadnt  jill  im not enjoying home tonight dodo  hillcrist  i never could hate proper its a confounded nuisance  jill  mothers fearfully bucked and dawkers simply oozing triumph  i dont trust him  dodo hes toonot pugilisticthe other one with a pugnaceous  hillcrist  he is rather  jill  im sure he wouldnt care tuppence if chloe committed suicide  hillcrist  rising uneasily nonsense  nonsense  jill  i wonder if mother would  hillcrist turning his face towards the window  whats that  i thought i heardlouderis these anybody out there       no answer  jill springs up and runs to the window  jill  you       she dives through to the right and returns holding chloes      hand and drawing her forward  come in  its only us  to hillcrist  dodo  hillcrist  flustered but making a show of courtesy  good evening  wont you sit down  jill  sit down youre all shaky       she makes chloe sit down in the armchair out of which they      have risen then locks the door and closing the windows draws      the curtains hastily over them  hillcrist  awkward and expectant  can i do anything for you  chloe  i couldnt bear it hes coming to ask you  hillcrist  who  chloe  my husband  she draws in her breath with a long shudder then seem to seize her courage in her hands  ive got to be quick he keeps on askinghe knows theres something  hillcrist  make your mind easy  we shant tell him  chloe  appealing  oh  thats not enough  cant you tell him something to put him back to thinking its all right  ive done him such a wrong  i didnt realise till afteri thought meeting him was just a piece of wonderful good luck after what id been through  im not such a bad lotnot really       she stops from the overquivering of her lips  jill standing      beside the chair strokes her shoulder  hillcrist stands very      still painfully biting at a finger  you see my father went bankrupt and i was in a shop  hillcrist  soothingly and to prevent disclosures yes yes yes yes  chloe  i never gave a man away or did anything i was ashamed ofat leasti mean i had to make my living in all sorts of ways and then i met charlie       again she stopped from the quivering of her lips  jill  its all right  chloe  he thought i was respectable and that was such a relief you cant think soso i let him  jill  dodo  its awful  hillcrist  it is  chloe  and after i married him you see i fell in love  if i had before perhaps i wouldnt have dared only i dont knowyou never know do you  when theres a straw going you catch at it  jill  of course you do  chloe  and now you see im going to have a child  jill  aghast  oh  are you  hillcrist  good god  chloe  dully  ive been on hot bricks all this month ever since that day here  i knew it was in the wind  what gets in the wind never gets out  she rises and throws out her arms  never  it just blows here and there  desolately  and thenblows home  her voice changes to resentment  but ive paid for being a fool tisnt fun that sort of life i can tell you  im not ashamed and repentant and all that  if it wasnt for him  im afraid hell never forgive me its such a disgrace for himand then to have his child  being fond of him i feel it much worse than anything i ever felt and thats saying a good bit  it is  jill  energetically  look here  he simply mustnt find out  chloe  thats it but its started and hes bound to keep on because he knows theres something  a man isnt going to be satisfied when theres something he suspects about his wife charlie wouldnt never  hes clever and hes jealous and hes coming here       she stops and looks round wildly listening  jill  dodo what can we say to put him clean off the scent  hillcrist  anythingin reason  chloe  catching at this straw  you will  you see i dont know what ill do  ive got soft being looked afterhe does love me and if he throws me off ill go underthats all  hillcrist  have you any suggestion  chloe  eagerly  the only thing is to tell him something positive something hell believe thats not too badlike my having been a lady clerk with those people who came here and having been dismissed on suspicion of taking money  i could get him to believe that wasnt true  jill  yes and it isntthats splendid  youd be able to put such conviction into it  dont you think so dodo  hillcrist  anything i can  im deeply sorry  chloe  thank you  and dont say ive been here will you  hes very suspicious  you see he knows that his father has resold that land to you thats what he cant make outthat and my coming here this morning he knows somethings being kept from him and he noticed that man with dawker yesterday  and my maids been spying on me  its in the air  he puts two and two together  but ive told him theres nothing he need worry about nothing thats true  hillcrist  what a coil  chloe  im very honest and careful about money  so he wont believe that about me and the old man wants to keep it from charlie i know  hillcrist  that does seem the best way out  chloe  with a touch of defiance  im a true wife to him  chloe  of course we know that  hillcrist  its all unspeakably sad  deceptions horribly against the grainbut  chloe  eagerly  when i deceived him id have deceived god himselfi was so desperate  youve never been right down in the mud  you cant understand what ive been through  hillcrist  yes yes  i daresay id have done the same  i should be the last to judge       chloe covers her eyes with her hands  there there  cheer up  he puts his hand on her arm  chloe  to herself  darling dodo  chloe  starting  theres somebody at the door  i must go i must go       she runs to the window and slips through the curtains       the handle of the door is again turned  jill  dismayed  oh  its lockedi forgot       she spring to the door unlocks and opens it while hillcrist      goes to the bureau and sits down  its all right fellows i was only saying something rather important  fellows  coming in a step or two and closing the door behind him certainly miss  mr charles ornblower is in the hall

dodo  hillcrist  no i will  wont you sit down  charles  no  go on  hillcrist  moistening his lips  it appears mr hornblower that my agent mr dawker       charles who is breathing hard utters a sound of anger  that my agent happens to know a firm who in old days employed your wife  i should greatly prefer not to say any more especially as we dont believe the story  jill  no we dont  charles  go on  hillcrist  getting up  come  if i were you i should refuse to listen to anything against my wife  charles  go on i tell you  hillcrist  you insist  well they say there was some question about the
