15536371	the master of ballantrae a winters tale     to sir percy florence and lady shelley   here is a tale which extends over many years and travels into many countries  by a peculiar fitness of circumstance the writer began continued it and concluded it among distant and diverse scenes above all he was much upon the sea  the character and fortune of the fraternal enemies the hall and shrubbery of durrisdeer the problem of mackellars homespun and how to shape it for superior flights these were his company on deck in many starreflecting harbours ran often in his mind at sea to the tune of slatting canvas and were dismissed something of the suddenest on the approach of squalls  it is my hope that these surroundings of its manufacture may to some degree find favour for my story with seafarers and sealovers like yourselves  and at least here is a dedication from a great way off  written by the loud shores of a subtropical island near upon ten thousand miles from boscombe chine and manor  scenes which rise before me as i write along with the faces and voices of my friends  well i am for the sea once more no doubt sir percy also  let us make the signal b r d  r l s  waikiki may 17 1889    preface    although an old consistent exile the editor of the following pages revisits now and again the city of which he exults to be a native and there are few things more strange more painful or more salutary than such revisitations  outside in foreign spots he comes by surprise and awakens more attention than he had expected in his own city the relation is reversed and he stands amazed to be so little recollected  elsewhere he is refreshed to see attractive faces to remark possible friends there he scouts the long streets with a pang at heart for the faces and friends that are no more  elsewhere he is delighted with the presence of what is new there tormented by the absence of what is old elsewhere he is content to be his present self there he is smitten with an equal regret for what he once was and for what he once hoped to be  he was feeling all this dimly as he drove from the station on his last visit he was feeling it still as he alighted at the door of his friend mr johnstone thomson ws with whom he was to stay a hearty welcome a face not altogether changed a few words that sounded of old days a laugh provoked and shared a glimpse in passing of the snowy cloth and bright decanters and the piranesis on the diningroom wall brought him to his bedroom with a somewhat lightened cheer and when he and mr thomson sat down a few minutes later cheek by jowl and pledged the past in a preliminary bumper he was already almost consoled he had already almost forgiven himself his two unpardonable errors that he should ever have left his native city or ever returned to it  i have something quite in your way said mr thomson  i wished to do honour to your arrival because my dear fellow it is my own youth that comes back along with you in a very tattered and withered state to be sure but  well  all thats left of it  a great deal better than nothing said the editor  but what is this which is quite in my way  i was coming to that said mr thomson  fate has put it in my power to honour your arrival with something really original by way of dessert  a mystery  a mystery i repeated  yes said his friend a mystery  it may prove to be nothing and it may prove to be a great deal  but in the meanwhile it is truly mysterious no eye having looked on it for near a hundred years it is highly genteel for it treats of a titled family and it ought to be melodramatic for according to the superscription it is concerned with death  i think i rarely heard a more obscure or a more promising annunciation the other remarked  but what is it  you remember my predecessors old peter mbrairs business  i remember him acutely he could not look at me without a pang of reprobation and he could not feel the pang without betraying it he was to me a man of a great historical interest but the interest was not returned  ah well we go beyond him said mr thomson  i daresay old peter knew as little about this as i do  you see i succeeded to a prodigious accumulation of old lawpapers and old tin boxes some of them of peters hoarding some of his fathers john first of the dynasty a great man in his day  among other collections were all the papers of the durrisdeers  the durrisdeers cried i  my dear fellow these may be of the greatest interest  one of them was out in the 45 one had some strange passages with the devil  you will find a note of it in laws memorials i think and there was an unexplained tragedy i know not what much later about a hundred years ago    more than a hundred years ago said mr thomson  in 1783  how do you know that  i mean some death  yes the lamentable deaths of my lord durrisdeer and his brother the master of ballantrae attainted in the troubles said mr thomson with something the tone of a man quoting  is that it  to say truth said i i have only seen some dim reference to the things in memoirs and heard some traditions dimmer still through my uncle whom i think you knew  my uncle lived when he was a boy in the neighbourhood of st brides he has often told me of the avenue closed up and grown over with grass the great gates never opened the last lord and his old maid sister who lived in the back parts of the house a quiet plain poor humdrum couple it would seem  but pathetic too as the last of that stirring and brave house  and to the country folk faintly terrible from some deformed traditions  yes said mr thomson  henry graeme durie the last lord died in 1820 his sister the honourable miss katherine durie in 27 so much i know and by what i have been going over the last few days they were what you say decent quiet people and not rich to say truth it was a letter of my lords that put me on the search for the packet we are going to open this evening  some papers could not be found and he wrote to jack mbrair suggesting they might be among those sealed up by a mr mackellar  mbrair answered that the papers in question were all in mackellars own hand all as the writer understood of a purely narrative character and besides said he i am bound not to open them before the year 1889  you may fancy if these words struck me  i instituted a hunt through all the mbrair repositories and at last hit upon that packet which if you have had enough wine i propose to show you at once  in the smokingroom to which my host now led me was a packet fastened with many seals and enclosed in a single sheet of strong paper thus endorsed   papers relating to the lives and lamentable deaths of the late lord durisdeer and his elder brother james commonly called master of ballantrae attainted in the troubles  entrusted into the hands of john mbrair in the lawnmarket of edinburgh ws this 20th day of september anno domini 1789 by him to be kept secret until the revolution of one hundred years complete or until the 20th day of september 1889  the same compiled and written by me ephraim mackellar  for near forty years land steward on the estates of his lordship   as mr thomson is a married man i will not say what hour had struck when we laid down the last of the following pages but i will give a few words of what ensued  here said mr thomson is a novel ready to your hand  all you have to do is to work up the scenery develop the characters and improve the style  my dear fellow said i they are just the three things that i would rather die than set my hand to  it shall be published as it stands  but its so bald objected mr thomson  i believe there is nothing so noble as baldness replied i and i am sure there in nothing so interesting  i would have all literature bald and all authors if you like but one  well well add mr thomson we shall see    chapter i  summary of events during this masters wanderings    the full truth of this odd matter is what the world has long been looking for and public curiosity is sure to welcome  it so befell that i was intimately mingled with the last years and history of the house and there does not live one man so able as myself to make these matters plain or so desirous to narrate them faithfully  i knew the master on many secret steps of his career i have an authentic memoir in my hand i sailed with him on his last voyage almost alone i made one upon that winters journey of which so many tales have gone abroad and i was there at the mans death  as for my late lord durrisdeer i served him and loved him near twenty years and thought more of him the more i knew of him altogether i think it not fit that so much evidence should perish the truth is a debt i owe my lords memory and i think my old years will flow more smoothly and my white hair lie quieter on the pillow when the debt is paid  the duries of durrisdeer and ballantrae were a strong family in the southwest from the days of david first  a rhyme still current in the countryside    kittle folk are the durrisdeers they ride wi over mony spears    bears the mark of its antiquity and the name appears in another which common report attributes to thomas of ercildoune himself  i cannot say how truly and which some have applied  i dare not say with how much justice  to the events of this narration   twa duries in durrisdeer ane to tie and ane to ride an ill day for the groom and a waur day for the bride   authentic history besides is filled with their exploits which to our modern eyes seem not very commendable  and the family suffered its full share of those ups and downs to which the great houses of scotland have been ever liable  but all these i pass over to come to that memorable year 1745 when the foundations of this tragedy were laid  at that time there dwelt a family of four persons in the house of durrisdeer near st brides on the solway shore a chief hold of their race since the reformation  my old lord eighth of the name was not old in years but he suffered prematurely from the disabilities of age his place was at the chimney side there he sat reading in a lined gown with few words for any man and wry words for none  the model of an old retired housekeeper and yet his mind very well nourished with study and reputed in the country to be more cunning than he seemed  the master of ballantrae james in baptism took from his father the love of serious reading some of his tact perhaps as well but that which was only policy in the father became black dissimulation in the son  the face of his behaviour was merely popular and wild  he sat late at wine later at the cards had the name in the country of an unco man for the lasses and was ever in the front of broils  but for all he was the first to go in yet it was observed he was invariably the best to come off and his partners in mischief were usually alone to pay the piper  this luck or dexterity got him several illwishers but with the rest of the country enhanced his reputation so that great things were looked for in his future when he should have gained more gravity  one very black mark he had to his name but the matter was hushed up at the time and so defaced by legends before i came into those parts that i scruple to set it down  if it was true it was a horrid fact in one so young and if false it was a horrid calumny  i think it notable that he had always vaunted himself quite implacable and was taken at his word so that he had the addition among his neighbours of an ill man to cross  here was altogether a young nobleman not yet twentyfour in the year 45 who had made a figure in the country beyond his time of life  the less marvel if there were little heard of the second son mr henry my late lord durrisdeer who was neither very bad nor yet very able but an honest solid sort of lad like many of his neighbours  little heard i say but indeed it was a case of little spoken  he was known among the salmon fishers in the firth for that was a sport that he assiduously followed he was an excellent good horsedoctor besides and took a chief hand almost from a boy in the management of the estates  how hard a part that was in the situation of that family none knows better than myself nor yet with how little colour of justice a man may there acquire the reputation of a tyrant and a miser  the fourth person in the house was miss alison graeme a near kinswoman an orphan and the heir to a considerable fortune which her father had acquired in trade  this money was loudly called for by my lords necessities indeed the land was deeply mortgaged and miss alison was designed accordingly to be the masters wife gladly enough on her side with how much goodwill on his is another matter  she was a comely girl and in those days very spirited and selfwilled for the old lord having no daughter of his own and my lady being long dead she had grown up as best she might  to these four came the news of prince charlies landing and set them presently by the ears  my lord like the chimneykeeper that he was was all for temporising  miss alison held the other side because it appeared romantical and the master though i have heard they did not agree often was for this once of her opinion  the adventure tempted him as i conceive he was tempted by the opportunity to raise the fortunes of the house and not less by the hope of paying off his private liabilities which were heavy beyond all opinion  as for mr henry it appears he said little enough at first his part came later on  it took the three a whole days disputation before they agreed to steer a middle course one son going forth to strike a blow for king james my lord and the other staying at home to keep in favour with king george  doubtless this was my lords decision and as is well known it was the part played by many considerable families  but the one dispute settled another opened  for my lord miss alison and mr henry all held the one view  that it was the cadets part to go out and the master what with restlessness and vanity would at no rate consent to stay at home  my lord pleaded miss alison wept mr henry was very plain spoken  all was of no avail  it is the direct heir of durrisdeer that should ride by his kings bridle says the master  if we were playing a manly part says mr henry there might be sense in such talk  but what are we doing  cheating at cards  we are saving the house of durrisdeer henry his father said  and see james said mr henry if i go and the prince has the upper hand it will be easy to make your peace with king james but if you go and the expedition fails we divide the right and the title  and what shall i be then  you will be lord durrisdeer said the master  i put all i have upon the table  i play at no such game cries mr henry  i shall be left in such a situation as no man of sense and honour could endure  i shall be neither fish nor flesh he cried  and a little after he had another expression plainer perhaps than he intended  it is your duty to be here with my father said he  you know well enough you are the favourite  ay said the master  and there spoke envy  would you trip up my heels  jacob said he and dwelled upon the name maliciously  mr henry went and walked at the low end of the hall without reply for he had an excellent gift of silence  presently he came back  i am the cadet and i should go said he  and my lord here in the master and he says i shall go  what say ye to that my brother  i say this harry returned the master that when very obstinate folk are met there are only two ways out  blows  and i think none of us could care to go so far or the arbitrament of chance  and here is a guinea piece  will you stand by the toss of the coin  i will stand and fall by it said mr henry  heads i go shield i stay  the coin was spun and it fell shield  so there is a lesson for jacob says the master  we shall live to repent of this says mr henry and flung out of the hall  as for miss alison she caught up that piece of gold which had just sent her lover to the wars and flung it clean through the family shield in the great painted window  if you loved me as well as i love you you would have stayed cried she  i could not love you dear so well loved i not honour more sang the master  oh she cried you have no heart  i hope you may be killed and she ran from the room and in tears to her own chamber  it seems the master turned to my lord with his most comical manner and says he this looks like a devil of a wife  i think you are a devil of a son to me cried his father you that have always been the favourite to my shame be it spoken never a good hour have i gotten of you since you were born no never one good hour and repeated it again the third time whether it was the masters levity or his insubordination or mr henrys word about the favourite son that had so much disturbed my lord i do not know but i incline to think it was the last for i have it by all accounts that mr henry was more made up to from that hour  altogether it was in pretty ill blood with his family that the master rode to the north which was the more sorrowful for others to remember when it seemed too late  by fear and favour he had scraped together near upon a dozen men principally tenants sons they were all pretty full when they set forth and rode up the hill by the old abbey roaring and singing the white cockade in every hat  it was a desperate venture for so small a company to cross the most of scotland unsupported and what made folk think so the more even as that poor dozen was clattering up the hill a great ship of the kings navy that could have brought them under with a single boat lay with her broad ensign streaming in the bay  the next afternoon having given the master a fair start it was mr henrys turn and he rode off all by himself to offer his sword and carry letters from his father to king georges government miss alison was shut in her room and did little but weep till both were gone only she stitched the cockade upon the masters hat and as john paul told me it was wetted with tears when he carried it down to him  in all that followed mr henry and my old lord were true to their bargain  that ever they accomplished anything is more than i could learn and that they were anyway strong on the kings side more than believe  but they kept the letter of loyalty corresponded with my lord president sat still at home and had little or no commerce with the master while that business lasted  nor was he on his side more communicative  miss alison indeed was always sending him expresses but i do not know if she had many answers macconochie rode for her once and found the highlanders before carlisle and the master riding by the princes side in high favour he took the letter so macconochie tells opened it glanced it through with a mouth like a man whistling and stuck it in his belt whence on his horse passageing it fell unregarded to the ground  it was macconochie who picked it up and he still kept it and indeed i have seen it in his hands  news came to durrisdeer of course by the common report as it goes travelling through a country a thing always wonderful to me  by that means the family learned more of the masters favour with the prince and the ground it was said to stand on  for by a strange condescension in a man so proud  only that he was a man still more ambitious  he was said to have crept into notability by truckling to the irish  sir thomas sullivan colonel burke and the rest were his daily comrades by which course he withdrew himself from his own countryfolk  all the small intrigues he had a hand in fomenting thwarted my lord george upon a thousand points was always for the advice that seemed palatable to the prince no matter if it was good or bad and seems upon the whole like the gambler he was all through life to have had less regard to the chances of the campaign than to the greatness of favour he might aspire to if by any luck it should succeed  for the rest he did very well in the field no one questioned that for he was no coward  the next was the news of culloden which was brought to durrisdeer by one of the tenants sons  the only survivor he declared of all those that had gone singing up the hill  by an unfortunate chance john paul and macconochie had that very morning found the guinea piece  which was the root of all the evil  sticking in a holly bush they had been up the gait as the servants say at durrisdeer to the changehouse and if they had little left of the guinea they had less of their wits  what must john paul do but burst into the hall where the family sat at dinner and cry the news to them that tam macmorland was but new lichtit at the door and  wirra wirra  there were nane to come behind him  they took the word in silence like folk condemned only mr henry carrying his palm to his face and miss alison laying her head outright upon her hands  as for my lord he was like ashes  i have still one son says he  and henry i will do you this justice  it is the kinder that is left  it was a strange thing to say in such a moment but my lord had never forgotten mr henrys speech and he had years of injustice on his conscience  still it was a strange thing and more than miss alison could let pass  she broke out and blamed my lord for his unnatural words and mr henry because he was sitting there in safety when his brother lay dead and herself because she had given her sweetheart ill words at his departure calling him the flower of the flock wringing her hands protesting her love and crying on him by his name  so that the servants stood astonished  mr henry got to his feet and stood holding his chair  it was he that was like ashes now  oh he burst out suddenly i know you loved him  the world knows that glory be to god cries she and then to mr henry  there is none but me to know one thing  that you were a traitor to him in your heart  god knows groans he it was lost love on both sides  time went by in the house after that without much change only they were now three instead of four which was a perpetual reminder of their loss  miss alisons money you are to bear in mind wag highly needful for the estates and the one brother being dead my old lord soon set his heart upon her marrying the other  day in day out he would work upon her sitting by the chimneyside with his finger in his latin book and his eyes set upon her face with a kind of pleasant intentness that became the old gentleman very well  if she wept he would condole with her like an ancient man that has seen worse times and begins to think lightly even of sorrow if she raged he would fall to reading again in his latin book but always with some civil excuse if she offered as she often did to let them have her money in a gift he would show her how little it consisted with his honour and remind her even if he should consent that mr henry would certainly refuse  non vi sed saepe cadendo was a favourite word of his and no doubt this quiet persecution wore away much of her resolve no doubt besides he had a great influence on the girl having stood in the place of both her parents and for that matter she was herself filled with the spirit of the duries and would have gone a great way for the glory of durrisdeer but not so far i think as to marry my poor patron had it not been  strangely enough  for the circumstance of his extreme unpopularity  this was the work of tam macmorland  there was not much harm in tam but he had that grievous weakness a long tongue and as the only man in that country who had been out  or rather who had come in again  he was sure of listeners  those that have the underhand in any fighting i have observed are ever anxious to persuade themselves they were betrayed  by tams account of it the rebels had been betrayed at every turn and by every officer they had they had been betrayed at derby and betrayed at falkirk the night march was a step of treachery of my lord georges and culloden was lost by the treachery of the macdonalds  this habit of imputing treason grew upon the fool till at last he must have in mr henry also  mr henry by his account had betrayed the lads of durrisdeer he had promised to follow with more men and instead of that he had ridden to king george  ay and the next day tam would cry  the puir bonnie master and the puir kind lads that rade wi him were hardly ower the scaur or he was aff  the judis  ay weel  he has his way ot  hes to be my lord nae less and theres mony a cold corp amang the hieland heather  and at this if tam had been drinking he would begin to weep  let anyone speak long enough he will get believers  this view of mr henrys behaviour crept about the country by little and little it was talked upon by folk that knew the contrary but were short of topics and it was heard and believed and given out for gospel by the ignorant and the illwilling  mr henry began to be shunned yet awhile and the commons began to murmur as he went by and the women who are always the most bold because they are the most safe to cry out their reproaches to his face  the master was cried up for a saint  it was remembered how he had never any hand in pressing the tenants as indeed no more he had except to spend the money  he was a little wild perhaps the folk said but how much better was a natural wild lad that would soon have settled down than a skinflint and a sneckdraw sitting with his nose in an account book to persecute poor tenants  one trollop who had had a child to the master and by all accounts been very badly used yet made herself a kind of champion of his memory  she flung a stone one day at mr henry  whaurs the bonnie lad that trustit ye she cried  mr henry reined in his horse and looked upon her the blood flowing from his lip  ay jess says he  you too  and yet ye should ken me better  for it was he who had helped her with money  the woman had another stone ready which she made as if she would cast and he to ward himself threw up the hand that held his ridingrod  what would ye beat a lassie ye ugly   cries she and ran away screaming as though he had struck her  next day word went about the country like wildfire that mr henry had beaten jessie broun within an inch of her life  i give it as one instance of how this snowball grew and one calumny brought another until my poor patron was so perished in reputation that he began to keep the house like my lord  all this while you may be very sure he uttered no complaints at home the very ground of the scandal was too sore a matter to be handled and mr henry was very proud and strangely obstinate in silence  my old lord must have heard of it by john paul if by no one else and he must at least have remarked the altered habits of his son  yet even he it is probable knew not how high the feeling ran and as for miss alison she was ever the last person to hear news and the least interested when she heard them  in the height of the illfeeling for it died away as it came no man could say why there was an election forward in the town of st brides which is the next to durrisdeer standing on the water of swift some grievance was fermenting i forget what if ever i heard and it was currently said there would be broken heads ere night and that the sheriff had sent as far as dumfries for soldiers  my lord moved that mr henry should be present assuring him it was necessary to appear for the credit of the house  it will soon be reported said he that we do not take the lead in our own country  it is a strange lead that i can take said mr henry and when they had pushed him further i tell you the plain truth he said i dare not show my face  you are the first of the house that ever said so cries miss alison  we will go all three said my lord and sure enough he got into his boots the first time in four years  a sore business john paul had to get them on and miss alison into her ridingcoat and all three rode together to st brides  the streets were full of the riftraff of all the countryside who had no sooner clapped eyes on mr henry than the hissing began and the hooting and the cries of judas and where was the master and where were the poor lads that rode with him  even a stone was cast but the more part cried shame at that for my old lords sake and miss alisons  it took not ten minutes to persuade my lord that mr henry had been right  he said never a word but turned his horse about and home again with his chin upon his bosom  never a word said miss alison no doubt she thought the more no doubt her pride was stung for she was a bonebred durie and no doubt her heart was touched to see her cousin so unjustly used  that night she was never in bed i have often blamed my lady  when i call to mind that night i readily forgive her all and the first thing in the morning she came to the old lord in his usual seat  if henry still wants me said she he can have me now  to himself she had a different speech  i bring you no love henry but god knows all the pity in the world  june the 1st 1748 was the day of their marriage  it was december of the same year that first saw me alighting at the doors of the great house and from there i take up the history of events as they befell under my own observation like a witness in a court    chapter ii  summary of events continued    i made the last of my journey in the cold end of december in a mighty dry day of frost and who should be my guide but patey macmorland brother of tam  for a towheaded barelegged brat of ten he had more ill tales upon his tongue than ever i heard the match of having drunken betimes in his brothers cup  i was still not so old myself pride had not yet the upper hand of curiosity and indeed it would have taken any man that cold morning to hear all the old clashes of the country and be shown all the places by the way where strange things had fallen out  i had tales of claverhouse as we came through the bogs and tales of the devil as we came over the top of the scaur  as we came in by the abbey i heard somewhat of the old monks and more of the freetraders who use its ruins for a magazine landing for that cause within a cannonshot of durrisdeer and along all the road the duries and poor mr henry were in the first rank of slander  my mind was thus highly prejudiced against the family i was about to serve so that i was half surprised when i beheld durrisdeer itself lying in a pretty sheltered bay under the abbey hill the house most commodiously built in the french fashion or perhaps italianate for i have no skill in these arts and the place the most beautified with gardens lawns shrubberies and trees i had ever seen  the money sunk here unproductively would have quite restored the family but as it was it cost a revenue to keep it up  mr henry came himself to the door to welcome me  a tall dark young gentleman the duries are all black men of a plain and not cheerful face very strong in body but not so strong in health taking me by the hand without any pride and putting me at home with plain kind speeches  he led me into the hall booted as i was to present me to my lord  it was still daylight and the first thing i observed was a lozenge of clear glass in the midst of the shield in the painted window which i remember thinking a blemish on a room otherwise so handsome with its family portraits and the pargeted ceiling with pendants and the carved chimney in one corner of which my old lord sat reading in his livy  he was like mr henry with much the same plain countenance only more subtle and pleasant and his talk a thousand times more entertaining  he had many questions to ask me i remember of edinburgh college where i had just received my mastership of arts and of the various professors with whom and their proficiency he seemed well acquainted and thus talking of things that i knew i soon got liberty of speech in my new home  in the midst of this came mrs henry into the room she was very far gone miss katharine being due in about six weeks which made me think less of her beauty at the first sight and she used me with more of condescension than the rest so that upon all accounts i kept her in the third place of my esteem  it did not take long before all patey macmorlands tales were blotted out of my belief and i was become what i have ever since remained a loving servant of the house of durrisdeer  mr henry had the chief part of my affection  it was with him i worked and i found him an exacting master keeping all his kindness for those hours in which we were unemployed and in the stewards office not only loading me with work but viewing me with a shrewd supervision  at length one day he looked up from his paper with a kind of timidness and says he mr mackellar i think i ought to tell you that you do very well  that was my first word of commendation and from that day his jealousy of my performance was relaxed soon it was mr mackellar here and mr mackellar there with the whole family and for much of my service at durrisdeer i have transacted everything at my own time and to my own fancy and never a farthing challenged  even while he was driving me i had begun to find my heart go out to mr henry no doubt partly in pity he was a man so palpably unhappy  he would fall into a deep muse over our accounts staring at the page or out of the window and at those times the look of his face and the sigh that would break from him awoke in me strong feelings of curiosity and commiseration  one day i remember we were late upon some business in the stewards room  this room is in the top of the house and has a view upon the bay and over a little wooded cape on the long sands and there right over against the sun which was then dipping we saw the freetraders with a great force of men and horses scouring on the beach  mr henry had been staring straight west so that i marvelled he was not blinded by the sun suddenly he frowns rubs his hand upon his brow and turns to me with a smile  you would not guess what i was thinking says he  i was thinking i would be a happier man if i could ride and run the danger of my life with these lawless companions  i told him i had observed he did not enjoy good spirits and that it was a common fancy to envy others and think we should be the better of some change quoting horace to the point like a young man fresh from college  why just so said he  and with that we may get back to our accounts  it was not long before i began to get wind of the causes that so much depressed him  indeed a blind man must have soon discovered there was a shadow on that house the shadow of the master of ballantrae  dead or alive and he was then supposed to be dead that man was his brothers rival  his rival abroad where there was never a good word for mr henry and nothing but regret and praise for the master and his rival at home not only with his father and his wife but with the very servants  they were two old servingmen that were the leaders  john paul a little bald solemn stomachy man a great professor of piety and take him for all in all a pretty faithful servant was the chief of the masters faction  none durst go so far as john  he took a pleasure in disregarding mr henry publicly often with a slighting comparison  my lord and mrs henry took him up to be sure but never so resolutely as they should and he had only to pull his weeping face and begin his lamentations for the master  his laddie as he called him  to have the whole condoned  as for henry he let these things pass in silence sometimes with a sad and sometimes with a black look  there was no rivalling the dead he knew that and how to censure an old servingman for a fault of loyalty was more than he could see  his was not the tongue to do it  macconochie was chief upon the other side an old illspoken swearing ranting drunken dog and i have often thought it an odd circumstance in human nature that these two servingmen should each have been the champion of his contrary and blackened their own faults and made light of their own virtues when they beheld them in a master  macconochie had soon smelled out my secret inclination took me much into his confidence and would rant against the master by the hour so that even my work suffered  theyre a daft here he would cry and be damned to them  the master  the deils in their thrapples that should call him sae its mr henry should be master now  they were nane sae fond o the master when they had him ill can tell ye that  sorrow on his name  never a guid word did i hear on his lips nor naebody else but just fleering and flyting and profane cursing  deil hae him  theres nane kent his wickedness  him a gentleman  did ever ye hear tell mr mackellar o wully white the wabster  no  aweel wully was an unco praying kind o man a dreigh body nane o my kind i never could abide the sight o him onyway he was a great hand by his way of it and he up and rebukit the master for some of his on goings  it was a grand thing for the master o ballntrae to tak up a feud wi a wabster wasnaet  macconochie would sneer indeed he never took the full name upon his lips but with a sort of a whine of hatred  but he did  a fine employ it was chapping at the mans door and crying boo in his lum and puttin poother in his fire and peeoys 1 in his window till the man thocht it was auld hornie was come seekin him  weel to mak a lang story short wully gaed gyte  at the hinder end they couldnae get him frae his knees but he just roared and prayed and grat straucht on till he got his release  it was fair murder abody said that  ask john paul  he was brawly ashamed o that game him thats sic a christian man  grand doins for the master o ballntrae  i asked him what the master had thought of it himself  how would i ken says he  he never said naething and on again in his usual manner of banning and swearing with every now and again a master of ballantrae sneered through his nose  it was in one of these confidences that he showed me the carlisle letter the print of the horseshoe still stamped in the paper  indeed that was our last confidence for he then expressed himself so illnaturedly of mrs henry that i had to reprimand him sharply and must thenceforth hold him at a distance  my old lord was uniformly kind to mr henry he had even pretty ways of gratitude and would sometimes clap him on the shoulder and say as if to the world at large  this is a very good son to me and grateful he was no doubt being a man of sense and justice but i think that was all and i am sure mr henry thought so  the love was all for the dead son  not that this was often given breath to indeed with me but once  my lord had asked me one day how i got on with mr henry and i had told him the truth  ay said he looking sideways on the burning fire henry is a good lad a very good lad said he  you have heard mr mackellar that i had another son  i am afraid he was not so virtuous a lad as mr henry but dear me hes dead mr mackellar and while he lived we were all very proud of him all very proud if he was not all he should have been in some ways well perhaps we loved him better  this last he said looking musingly in the fire and then to me with a great deal of briskness but i am rejoiced you do so well with mr henry  you will find him a good master  and with that he opened his book which was the customary signal of dismission  but it would be little that he read and less that he understood culloden field and the master these would be the burthen of his thought and the burthen of mine was an unnatural jealousy of the dead man for mr henrys sake that had even then begun to grow on me  i am keeping mrs henry for the last so that this expression of my sentiment may seem unwarrantably strong  the reader shall judge for himself when i have done  but i must first tell of another matter which was the means of bringing me more intimate  i had not yet been six months at durrisdeer when it chanced that john paul fell sick and must keep his bed drink was the root of his malady in my poor thought but he was tended and indeed carried himself like an afflicted saint and the very minister who came to visit him professed himself edified when he went away  the third morning of his sickness mr henry comes to me with something of a hangdog look  mackellar says he i wish i could trouble you upon a little service  there is a pension we pay it is johns part to carry it and now that he is sick i know not to whom i should look unless it was yourself  the matter is very delicate i could not carry it with my own hand for a sufficient reason i dare not send macconochie who is a talker and i am  i have  i am desirous this should not come to mrs henrys ears says he and flushed to his neck as he said it  to say truth when i found i was to carry money to one jessie broun who was no better than she should be i supposed it was some trip of his own that mr henry was dissembling  i was the more impressed when the truth came out  it was up a wynd off a side street in st brides that jessie had her lodging  the place was very ill inhabited mostly by the freetrading sort  there was a man with a broken head at the entry halfway up in a tavern fellows were roaring and singing though it was not yet nine in the day  altogether i had never seen a worse neighbourhood even in the great city of edinburgh and i was in two minds to go back  jessies room was of a piece with her surroundings and herself no better  she would not give me the receipt which mr henry had told me to demand for he was very methodical until she had sent out for spirits and i had pledged her in a glass and all the time she carried on in a lightheaded reckless way  now aping the manners of a lady now breaking into unseemly mirth now making coquettish advances that oppressed me to the ground  of the money she spoke more tragically  its blood money said she i take it for that  blood money for the betrayed  see what im brought down to  ah if the bonnie lad were back again it would be changed days  but hes deid  hes lyin deid amang the hieland hills  the bonnie lad the bonnie lad  she had a rapt manner of crying on the bonnie lad clasping her hands and casting up her eyes that i think she must have learned of strolling players and i thought her sorrow very much of an affectation and that she dwelled upon the business because her shame was now all she had to be proud of  i will not say i did not pity her but it was a loathing pity at the best and her last change of manner wiped it out  this was when she had had enough of me for an audience and had set her name at last to the receipt there says she and taking the most unwomanly oaths upon her tongue bade me begone and carry it to the judas who had sent me it was the first time i had heard the name applied to mr henry i was staggered besides at her sudden vehemence of word and manner and got forth from the room under this shower of curses like a beaten dog  but even then i was not quit for the vixen threw up her window and leaning forth continued to revile me as i went up the wynd the freetraders coming to the tavern door joined in the mockery and one had even the inhumanity to set upon me a very savage small dog which bit me in the ankle  this was a strong lesson had i required one to avoid ill company and i rode home in much pain from the bite and considerable indignation of mind  mr henry was in the stewards room affecting employment but i could see he was only impatient to hear of my errand  well says he as soon as i came in and when i had told him something of what passed and that jessie seemed an undeserving woman and far from grateful  she is no friend to me said he but indeed mackellar i have few friends to boast of and jessie has some cause to be unjust  i need not dissemble what all the country knows  she was not very well used by one of our family this was the first time i had heard him refer to the master even distantly and i think he found his tongue rebellious even for that much but presently he resumed  this is why i would have nothing said  it would give pain to mrs henry    and to my father he added with another flush  mr henry said i if you will take a freedom at my hands i would tell you to let that woman be  what service is your money to the like of her  she has no sobriety and no economy  as for gratitude you will as soon get milk from a whinstone and if you will pretermit your bounty it will make no change at all but just to save the ankles of your messengers  mr henry smiled  but i am grieved about your ankle said he the next moment with a proper gravity  and observe i continued i give you this advice upon consideration and yet my heart was touched for the woman in the beginning  why there it is you see said mr henry  and you are to remember that i knew her once a very decent lass  besides which although i speak little of my family i think much of its repute  and with that he broke up the talk which was the first we had together in such confidence  but the same afternoon i had the proof that his father was perfectly acquainted with the business and that it was only from his wife that mr henry kept it secret  i fear you had a painful errand today says my lord to me for which as it enters in no way among your duties i wish to thank you and to remind you at the same time in case mr henry should have neglected how very desirable it is that no word of it should reach my daughter  reflections on the dead mr mackellar are doubly painful  anger glowed in my heart and i could have told my lord to his face how little he had to do bolstering up the image of the dead in mrs henrys heart and how much better he were employed to shatter that false idol for by this time i saw very well how the land lay between my patron and his wife  my pen is clear enough to tell a plain tale but to render the effect of an infinity of small things not one great enough in itself to be narrated and to translate the story of looks and the message of voices when they are saying no great matter and to put in half a page the essence of near eighteen months  this is what i despair to accomplish  the fault to be very blunt lay all in mrs henry  she felt it a merit to have consented to the marriage and she took it like a martyrdom in which my old lord whether he knew it or not fomented her  she made a merit besides of her constancy to the dead though its name to a nicer conscience should have seemed rather disloyalty to the living and here also my lord gave her his countenance  i suppose he was glad to talk of his loss and ashamed to dwell on it with mr henry  certainly at least he made a little coterie apart in that family of three and it was the husband who was shut out  it seems it was an old custom when the family were alone in durrisdeer that my lord should take his wine to the chimneyside and miss alison instead of withdrawing should bring a stool to his knee and chatter to him privately and after she had become my patrons wife the same manner of doing was continued  it should have been pleasant to behold this ancient gentleman so loving with his daughter but i was too much a partisan of mr henrys to be anything but wroth at his exclusion  manys the time i have seen him make an obvious resolve quit the table and go and join himself to his wife and my lord durrisdeer and on their part they were never backward to make him welcome turned to him smilingly as to an intruding child and took him into their talk with an effort so illconcealed that he was soon back again beside me at the table whence so great is the hall of durrisdeer we could but hear the murmur of voices at the chimney  there he would sit and watch and i along with him and sometimes by my lords head sorrowfully shaken or his hand laid on mrs henrys head or hers upon his knee as if in consolation or sometimes by an exchange of tearful looks we would draw our conclusion that the talk had gone to the old subject and the shadow of the dead was in the hall  i have hours when i blame mr henry for taking all too patiently yet we are to remember he was married in pity and accepted his wife upon that term  and indeed he had small encouragement to make a stand  once i remember he announced he had found a man to replace the pane of the stained window which as it was he that managed all the business was a thing clearly within his attributions  but to the masters fancies that pane was like a relic and on the first word of any change the blood flew to mrs henrys face  i wonder at you she cried  i wonder at myself says mr henry with more of bitterness than i had ever heard him to express  thereupon my old lord stepped in with his smooth talk so that before the meal was at an end all seemed forgotten only that after dinner when the pair had withdrawn as usual to the chimney side we could see her weeping with her head upon his knee  mr henry kept up the talk with me upon some topic of the estates  he could speak of little else but business and was never the best of company but he kept it up that day with more continuity his eye straying ever and again to the chimney and his voice changing to another key but without check of delivery  the pane however was not replaced and i believe he counted it a great defeat  whether he was stout enough or no god knows he was kind enough mrs henry had a manner of condescension with him such as in a wife would have pricked my vanity into an ulcer he took it like a favour  she held him at the staffs end forgot and then remembered and unbent to him as we do to children burthened him with cold kindness reproved him with a change of colour and a bitten lip like one shamed by his disgrace  ordered him with a look of the eye when she was off her guard when she was on the watch pleaded with him for the most natural attentions as though they were unheardof favours  and to all this he replied with the most unwearied service loving as folk say the very ground she trod on and carrying that love in his eyes as bright as a lamp when miss katharine was to be born nothing would serve but he must stay in the room behind the head of the bed  there he sat as white they tell me as a sheet and the sweat dropping from his brow and the handkerchief he had in his hand was crushed into a little ball no bigger than a musketbullet  nor could he bear the sight of miss katharine for many a day indeed i doubt if he was ever what he should have been to my young lady for the which want of natural feeling he was loudly blamed  such was the state of this family down to the 7th april 1749 when there befell the first of that series of events which were to break so many hearts and lose so many lives   on that day i was sitting in my room a little before supper when john paul burst open the door with no civility of knocking and told me there was one below that wished to speak with the steward sneering at the name of my office  i asked what manner of man and what his name was and this disclosed the cause of johns illhumour for it appeared the visitor refused to name himself except to me a sore affront to the majordomos consequence  well said i smiling a little i will see what he wants  i found in the entrance hall a big man very plainly habited and wrapped in a seacloak like one new landed as indeed he was not far off macconochie was standing with his tongue out of his mouth and his hand upon his chin like a dull fellow thinking hard and the stranger who had brought his cloak about his face appeared uneasy  he had no sooner seen me coming than he went to meet me with an effusive manner  my dear man said he a thousand apologies for disturbing you but im in the most awkward position  and theres a son of a ramrod there that i should know the looks of and more betoken i believe that he knows mine  being in this family sir and in a place of some responsibility which was the cause i took the liberty to send for you you are doubtless of the honest party  you may be sure at least says i that all of that party are quite safe in durrisdeer  my dear man it is my very thought says he  you see i have just been set on shore here by a very honest man whose name i cannot remember and who is to stand off and on for me till morning at some danger to himself and to be clear with you i am a little concerned lest it should be at some to me  i have saved my life so often mr  i forget your name which is a very good one  that faith i would be very loath to lose it after all  and the son of a ramrod whom i believe i saw before carlisle      oh sir said i you can trust macconochie until tomorrow  well and its a delight to hear you say so says the stranger the truth is that my name is not a very suitable one in this country of scotland  with a gentleman like you my dear man i would have no concealments of course and by your leave ill just breathe it in your ear  they call me francis burke  colonel francis burke and i am here at a most damnable risk to myself to see your masters  if youll excuse me my good man for giving them the name for im sure its a circumstance i would never have guessed from your appearance  and if you would just be so very obliging as to take my name to them you might say that i come bearing letters which i am sure they will be very rejoiced to have the reading of  colonel francis burke was one of the princes irishmen that did his cause such an infinity of hurt and were so much distasted of the scots at the time of the rebellion and it came at once into my mind how the master of ballantrae had astonished all men by going with that party  in the same moment a strong foreboding of the truth possessed my soul  if you will step in here said i opening a chamber door i will let my lord know  and i am sure its very good of you mr whatisyourname says the colonel  up to the hall i went slowfooted  there they were all three  my old lord in his place mrs henry at work by the window mr henry as was much his custom pacing the low end  in the midst was the table laid for supper  i told them briefly what i had to say  my old lord lay back in his seat  mrs henry sprang up standing with a mechanical motion and she and her husband stared at each others eyes across the room it was the strangest challenging look these two exchanged and as they looked the colour faded in their faces  then mr henry turned to me not to speak only to sign with his finger but that was enough and i went down again for the colonel  when we returned these three were in much the same position i same left them in i believe no word had passed  my lord durrisdeer no doubt says the colonel bowing and my lord bowed in answer  and this continues the colonel should be the master of ballantrae  i have never taken that name said mr henry but i am henry durie at your service  then the colonel turns to mrs henry bowing with his hat upon his heart and the most killing airs of gallantry  there can be no mistake about so fine a figure of a lady says he  i address the seductive miss alison of whom i have so often heard  once more husband and wife exchanged a look  i am mrs henry durie said she but before my marriage my name was alison graeme  then my lord spoke up  i am an old man colonel burke said he and a frail one  it will be mercy on your part to be expeditious do you bring me news of   he hesitated and then the words broke from him with a singular change of voice  my son  my dear lord i will be round with you like a soldier said the colonel  i do  my lord held out a wavering hand he seemed to wave a signal but whether it was to give him time or to speak on was more than we could guess  at length he got out the one word good  why the very best in the creation cries the colonel  for my good friend and admired comrade is at this hour in the fine city of paris and as like as not if i know anything of his habits he will be drawing in his chair to a piece of dinner  bedad i believe the ladys fainting  mrs henry was indeed the colour of death and drooped against the windowframe  but when mr henry made a movement as if to run to her she straightened with a sort of shiver  i am well she said with her white lips  mr henry stopped and his face had a strong twitch of anger  the next moment he had turned to the colonel  you must not blame yourself says he for this effect on mrs durie  it is only natural we were all brought up like brother and sister  mrs henry looked at her husband with something like relief or even gratitude  in my way of thinking that speech was the first step he made in her good graces  you must try to forgive me mrs durie for indeed and i am just an irish savage said the colonel and i deserve to be shot for not breaking the matter more artistically to a lady  but here are the masters own letters one for each of the three of you and to be sure if i know anything of my friends genius he will tell his own story with a better grace  he brought the three letters forth as he spoke arranged them by their superscriptions presented the first to my lord who took it greedily and advanced towards mrs henry holding out the second  but the lady waved it back  to my husband says she with a choked voice  the colonel was a quick man but at this he was somewhat nonplussed  to be sure says he how very dull of me  to be sure  but he still held the letter  at last mr henry reached forth his hand and there was nothing to be done but give it up  mr henry took the letters both hers and his own and looked upon their outside with his brows knit hard as if he were thinking  he had surprised me all through by his excellent behaviour but he was to excel himself now  let me give you a hand to your room said he to his wife  this has come something of the suddenest and at any rate you will wish to read your letter by yourself  again she looked upon him with the same thought of wonder but he gave her no time coming straight to where she stood  it will be better so believe me said he and colonel burke is too considerate not to excuse you  and with that he took her hand by the fingers and led her from the hall  mrs henry returned no more that night and when mr henry went to visit her next morning as i heard long afterwards she gave him the letter again still unopened  oh read it and be done he had cried  spare me that said she  and by these two speeches to my way of thinking each undid a great part of what they had previously done well  but the letter sure enough came into my hands and by me was burned unopened   to be very exact as to the adventures of the master after culloden i wrote not long ago to colonel burke now a chevalier of the order of st louis begging him for some notes in writing since i could scarce depend upon my memory at so great an interval  to confess the truth i have been somewhat embarrassed by his response for he sent me the complete memoirs of his life touching only in places on the master running to a much greater length than my whole story and not everywhere as it seems to me designed for edification  he begged in his letter dated from ettenheim that i would find a publisher for the whole after i had made what use of it i required and i think i shall best answer my own purpose and fulfil his wishes by printing certain parts of it in full  in this way my readers will have a detailed and i believe a very genuine account of some essential matters and if any publisher should take a fancy to the chevaliers manner of narration he knows where to apply for the rest of which there is plenty at his service  i put in my first extract here so that it may stand in the place of what the chevalier told us over our wine in the hall of durrisdeer but you are to suppose it was not the brutal fact but a very varnished version that he offered to my lord    chapter iii  the masters wanderings    from the memoirs of the chevalier de burke      i left ruthven its hardly necessary to remark with much greater satisfaction than i had come to it but whether i missed my way in the deserts or whether my companions failed me i soon found myself alone  this was a predicament very disagreeable for i never understood this horrid country or savage people and the last stroke of the princes withdrawal had made us of the irish more unpopular than ever  i was reflecting on my poor chances when i saw another horseman on the hill whom i supposed at first to have been a phantom the news of his death in the very front at culloden being current in the army generally  this was the master of ballantrae my lord durrisdeers son a young nobleman of the rarest gallantry and parts and equally designed by nature to adorn a court and to reap laurels in the field  our meeting was the more welcome to both as he was one of the few scots who had used the irish with consideration and as he might now be of very high utility in aiding my escape  yet what founded our particular friendship was a circumstance by itself as romantic as any fable of king arthur  this was on the second day of our flight after we had slept one night in the rain upon the inclination of a mountain  there was an appin man alan black stewart or some such name 2 but i have seen him since in france who chanced to be passing the same way and had a jealousy of my companion  very uncivil expressions were exchanged and stewart calls upon the master to alight and have it out  why mr stewart says the master i think at the present time i would prefer to run a race with you  and with the word claps spurs to his horse  stewart ran after us a childish thing to do for more than a mile and i could not help laughing as i looked back at last and saw him on a hill holding his hand to his side and nearly burst with running  but all the same i could not help saying to my companion i would let no man run after me for any such proper purpose and not give him his desire  it was a good jest but it smells a trifle cowardly  he bent his brows at me  i do pretty well says he when i saddle myself with the most unpopular man in scotland and let that suffice for courage  o bedad says i i could show you a more unpopular with the naked eye  and if you like not my company you can saddle yourself on some one else  colonel burke says he do not let us quarrel and to that effect let me assure you i am the least patient man in the world  i am as little patient as yourself said i  i care not who knows that  at this rate says he reining in we shall not go very far and i propose we do one of two things upon the instant  either quarrel and be done or make a sure bargain to bear everything at each others hands  like a pair of brothers said i  i said no such foolishness he replied  i have a brother of my own and i think no more of him than of a colewort  but if we are to have our noses rubbed together in this course of flight let us each dare to be ourselves like savages and each swear that he will neither resent nor deprecate the other  i am a pretty bad fellow at bottom and i find the pretence of virtues very irksome  o i am as bad as yourself said i  there is no skim milk in francis burke  but which is it to be  fight or make friends  why says be i think it will be the best manner to spin a coin for it  this proposition was too highly chivalrous not to take my fancy and strange as it may seem of two wellborn gentlemen of today we span a halfcrown like a pair of ancient paladins whether we were to cut each others throats or be sworn friends  a more romantic circumstance can rarely have occurred and it is one of those points in my memoirs by which we may see the old tales of homer and the poets are equally true today  at least of the noble and genteel  the coin fell for peace and we shook hands upon our bargain  and then it was that my companion explained to me his thought in running away from mr stewart which was certainly worthy of his political intellect  the report of his death he said was a great guard to him mr stewart having recognised him had become a danger and he had taken the briefest road to that gentlemans silence  for says he alan black is too vain a man to narrate any such story of himself  towards afternoon we came down to the shores of that loch for which we were heading and there was the ship but newly come to anchor she was the saintemariedesanges out of the port of havrede grace  the master after we had signalled for a boat asked me if i knew the captain  i told him he was a countryman of mine of the most unblemished integrity but i was afraid a rather timorous man  no matter says he  for all that he should certainly hear the truth  i asked him if he meant about the battle for if the captain once knew the standard was down he would certainly put to sea again at once  and even then said he the arms are now of no sort of utility  my dear man said i who thinks of the arms  but to be sure we must remember our friends  they will be close upon our heels perhaps the prince himself and if the ship be gone a great number of valuable lives may be imperilled  the captain and the crew have lives also if you come to that says ballantrae  this i declared was but a quibble and that i would not hear of the captain being told and then it was that ballantrae made me a witty answer for the sake of which and also because i have been blamed myself in this business of the saintemariedesanges i have related the whole conversation as it passed  frank says he remember our bargain  i must not object to your holding your tongue which i hereby even encourage you to do but by the same terms you are not to resent my telling  i could not help laughing at this though i still forewarned him what would come of it  the devil may come of it for what i care says the reckless fellow  i have always done exactly as i felt inclined  as is well known my prediction came true  the captain had no sooner heard the news than he cut his cable and to sea again and before morning broke we were in the great minch  the ship was very old and the skipper although the most honest of men and irish too was one of the least capable  the wind blew very boisterous and the sea raged extremely  all that day we had little heart whether to eat or drink went early to rest in some concern of mind and as if to give us a lesson in the night the wind chopped suddenly into the northeast and blew a hurricane we were awaked by the dreadful thunder of the tempest and the stamping of the mariners on deck so that i supposed our last hour was certainly come and the terror of my mind was increased out of all measure by ballantrae who mocked at my devotions  it is in hours like these that a man of any piety appears in his true light and we find what we are taught as babes the small trust that can be set in worldly friends  i would be unworthy of my religion if i let this pass without particular remark  for three days we lay in the dark in the cabin and had but a biscuit to nibble  on the fourth the wind fell leaving the ship dismasted and heaving on vast billows  the captain had not a guess of whither we were blown he was stark ignorant of his trade and could do naught but bless the holy virgin a very good thing too but scarce the whole of seamanship  it seemed our one hope was to be picked up by another vessel and if that should prove to be an english ship it might be no great blessing to the master and myself  the fifth and sixth days we tossed there helpless  the seventh some sail was got on her but she was an unwieldy vessel at the best and we made little but leeway  all the time indeed we had been drifting to the south and west and during the tempest must have driven in that direction with unheardof violence  the ninth dawn was cold and black with a great sea running and every mark of foul weather  in this situation we were overjoyed to sight a small ship on the horizon and to perceive her go about and head for the saintemarie  but our gratification did not very long endure for when she had laid to and lowered a boat it was immediately filled with disorderly fellows who sang and shouted as they pulled across to us and swarmed in on our deck with bare cutlasses cursing loudly  their leader was a horrible villain with his face blacked and his whiskers curled in ringlets teach his name a most notorious pirate  he stamped about the deck raving and crying out that his name was satan and his ship was called hell  there was something about him like a wicked child or a halfwitted person that daunted me beyond expression  i whispered in the ear of ballantrae that i would not be the last to volunteer and only prayed god they might be short of hands he approved my purpose with a nod  bedad said i to master teach if you are satan here is a devil for ye  the word pleased him and not to dwell upon these shocking incidents ballantrae and i and two others were taken for recruits while the skipper and all the rest were cast into the sea by the method of walking the plank  it was the first time i had seen this done my heart died within me at the spectacle and master teach or one of his acolytes for my head was too much lost to be precise remarked upon my pale face in a very alarming manner  i had the strength to cut a step or two of a jig and cry out some ribaldry which saved me for that time but my legs were like water when i must get down into the skiff among these miscreants and what with my horror of my company and fear of the monstrous billows it was all i could do to keep an irish tongue and break a jest or two as we were pulled aboard  by the blessing of god there was a fiddle in the pirate ship which i had no sooner seen than i fell upon and in my quality of crowder i had the heavenly good luck to get favour in their eyes crowding pat was the name they dubbed me with and it was little i cared for a name so long as my skin was whole  what kind of a pandemonium that vessel was i cannot describe but she was commanded by a lunatic and might be called a floating bedlam  drinking roaring singing quarrelling dancing they were never all sober at one time and there were days together when if a squall had supervened it must have sent us to the bottom or if a kings ship had come along it would have found us quite helpless for defence  once or twice we sighted a sail and if we were sober enough overhauled it god forgive us and if we were all too drunk she got away and i would bless the saints under my breath  teach ruled if you can call that rule which brought no order by the terror he created and i observed the man was very vain of his position  i have known marshals of france  ay and even highland chieftains  that were less openly puffed up which throws a singular light on the pursuit of honour and glory indeed the longer we live the more we perceive the sagacity of aristotle and the other old philosophers and though i have all my life been eager for legitimate distinctions i can lay my hand upon my heart at the end of my career and declare there is not one  no nor yet life itself  which is worth acquiring or preserving at the slightest cost of dignity  it was long before i got private speech of ballantrae but at length one night we crept out upon the boltsprit when the rest were better employed and commiserated our position  none can deliver us but the saints said i  my mind is very different said ballantrae for i am going to deliver myself  this teach is the poorest creature possible we make no profit of him and lie continually open to capture and says he i am not going to be a tarry pirate for nothing nor yet to hang in chains if i can help it  and he told me what was in his mind to better the state of the ship in the way of discipline which would give us safety for the present and a sooner hope of deliverance when they should have gained enough and should break up their company  i confessed to him ingenuously that my nerve was quite shook amid these horrible surroundings and i durst scarce tell him to count upon me  i am not very easy frightened said he nor very easy beat  a few days after there befell an accident which had nearly hanged us all and offers the most extraordinary picture of the folly that ruled in our concerns  we were all pretty drunk  and some bedlamite spying a sail teach put the ship about in chase without a glance and we began to bustle up the arms and boast of the horrors that should follow  i observed ballantrae stood quiet in the bows looking under the shade of his hand but for my part true to my policy among these savages i was at work with the busiest and passing irish jests for their diversion  run up the colours cries teach  show the s the jolly roger  it was the merest drunken braggadocio at such a stage and might have lost us a valuable prize but i thought it no part of mine to reason and i ran up the black flag with my own hand  ballantrae steps presently aft with a smile upon his face  you may perhaps like to know you drunken dog says he that you are chasing a kings ship  teach roared him the lie but he ran at the same time to the bulwarks and so did they all  i have never seen so many drunken men struck suddenly sober  the cruiser had gone about upon our impudent display of colours she was just then filling on the new tack her ensign blew out quite plain to see and even as we stared there came a puff of smoke and then a report and a shot plunged in the waves a good way short of us  some ran to the ropes and got the sarah round with an incredible swiftness  one fellow fell on the rum barrel which stood broached upon the deck and rolled it promptly overboard  on my part i made for the jolly roger struck it tossed it in the sea and could have flung myself after so vexed was i with our mismanagement  as for teach he grew as pale as death and incontinently went down to his cabin only twice he came on deck that afternoon went to the taffrail took a long look at the kings ship which was still on the horizon heading after us and then without speech back to his cabin  you may say he deserted us and if it had not been for one very capable sailor we had on board and for the lightness of the airs that blew all day we must certainly have gone to the yardarm  it is to be supposed teach was humiliated and perhaps alarmed for his position with the crew and the way in which he set about regaining what he had lost was highly characteristic of the man early next day we smelled him burning sulphur in his cabin and crying out of hell hell which was well understood among the crew and filled their minds with apprehension  presently he comes on deck a perfect figure of fun his face blacked his hair and whiskers curled his belt stuck full of pistols chewing bits of glass so that the blood ran down his chin and brandishing a dirk i do not know if he had taken these manners from the indians of america where he was a native but such was his way and he would always thus announce that he was wound up to horrid deeds  the first that came near him was the fellow who had sent the rum overboard the day before him he stabbed to the heart damning him for a mutineer and then capered about the body raving and swearing and daring us to come on  it was the silliest exhibition and yet dangerous too for the cowardly fellow was plainly working himself up to another murder  all of a sudden ballantrae stepped forth  have done with this playacting says he  do you think to frighten us with making faces  we saw nothing of you yesterday when you were wanted and we did well without you let me tell you that  there was a murmur and a movement in the crew of pleasure and alarm i thought in nearly equal parts  as for teach he gave a barbarous howl and swung his dirk to fling it an art in which like many seamen he was very expert  knock that out of his hand says ballantrae so sudden and sharp that my arm obeyed him before my mind had understood  teach stood like one stupid never thinking on his pistols  go down to your cabin cries ballantrae and come on deck again when you are sober  do you think we are going to hang for you you blackfaced halfwitted drunken brute and butcher  go down and he stamped his foot at him with such a sudden smartness that teach fairly ran for it to the companion  and now mates says ballantrae a word with you  i dont know if you are gentlemen of fortune for the fun of the thing but i am not  i want to make money and get ashore again and spend it like a man  and on one thing my mind is made up  i will not hang if i can help it  come  give me a hint im only a beginner  is there no way to get a little discipline and common sense about this business  one of the men spoke up  he said by rights they should have a quartermaster and no sooner was the word out of his mouth than they were all of that opinion  the thing went by acclamation ballantrae was made quartermaster the rum was put in his charge laws were passed in imitation of those of a pirate by the name of roberts and the last proposal was to make an end of teach  but ballantrae was afraid of a more efficient captain who might be a counterweight to himself and he opposed this stoutly  teach he said was good enough to board ships and frighten fools with his blacked face and swearing we could scarce get a better man than teach for that and besides as the man was now disconsidered and as good as deposed we might reduce his proportion of the plunder this carried it teachs share was cut down to a mere derision being actually less than mine and there remained only two points whether he would consent and who was to announce to him this resolution  do not let that stick you says ballantrae i will do that  and he stepped to the companion and down alone into the cabin to face that drunken savage  this is the man for us cries one of the hands  three cheers for the quartermaster which were given with a will my own voice among the loudest and i dare say these plaudits had their effect on master teach in the cabin as we have seen of late days how shouting in the streets may trouble even the minds of legislators  what passed precisely was never known though some of the heads of it came to the surface later on and we were all amazed as well as gratified when ballantrae came on deck with teach upon his arm and announced that all had been consented  i pass swiftly over those twelve or fifteen months in which we continued to keep the sea in the north atlantic getting our food and water from the ships we overhauled and doing on the whole a pretty fortunate business  sure no one could wish to read anything so ungenteel as the memoirs of a pirate even an unwilling one like me  things went extremely better with our designs and ballantrae kept his lead to my admiration from that day forth  i would be tempted to suppose that a gentleman must everywhere be first even aboard a rover  but my birth is every whit as good as any scottish lords and i am not ashamed to confess that i stayed crowding pat until the end and was not much better than the crews buffoon  indeed it was no scene to bring out my merits  my health suffered from a variety of reasons i was more at home to the last on a horses back than a ships deck and to be ingenuous the fear of the sea was constantly in my mind battling with the fear of my companions  i need not cry myself up for courage i have done well on many fields under the eyes of famous generals and earned my late advancement by an act of the most distinguished valour before many witnesses  but when we must proceed on one of our abordages the heart of francis burke was in his boots the little eggshell skiff in which we must set forth the horrible heaving of the vast billows the height of the ship that we must scale the thought of how many might be there in garrison upon their legitimate defence the scowling heavens which in that climate so often looked darkly down upon our exploits and the mere crying of the wind in my ears were all considerations most unpalatable to my valour  besides which as i was always a creature of the nicest sensibility the scenes that must follow on our success tempted me as little as the chances of defeat  twice we found women on board and though i have seen towns sacked and of late days in france some very horrid public tumults there was something in the smallness of the numbers engaged and the bleak dangerous seasurroundings that made these acts of piracy far the most revolting  i confess ingenuously i could never proceed unless i was three parts drunk it was the same even with the crew teach himself was fit for no enterprise till he was full of rum and it was one of the most difficult parts of ballantraes performance to serve us with liquor in the proper quantities  even this he did to admiration being upon the whole the most capable man i ever met with and the one of the most natural genius  he did not even scrape favour with the crew as i did by continual buffoonery made upon a very anxious heart but preserved on most occasions a great deal of gravity and distance so that he was like a parent among a family of young children or a schoolmaster with his boys  what made his part the harder to perform the men were most inveterate grumblers ballantraes discipline little as it was was yet irksome to their love of licence and what was worse being kept sober they had time to think  some of them accordingly would fall to repenting their abominable crimes one in particular who was a good catholic and with whom i would sometimes steal apart for prayer above all in bad weather fogs lashing rain and the like when we would be the less observed and i am sure no two criminals in the cart have ever performed their devotions with more anxious sincerity  but the rest having no such grounds of hope fell to another pastime that of computation  all day long they would he telling up their shares or grooming over the result  i have said we were pretty fortunate  but an observation fails to be made that in this world in no business that i have tried do the profits rise to a mans expectations  we found many ships and took many yet few of them contained much money their goods were usually nothing to our purpose  what did we want with a cargo of ploughs or even of tobacco  and it is quite a painful reflection how many whole crews we have made to walk the plank for no more than a stock of biscuit or an anker or two of spirit  in the meanwhile our ship was growing very foul and it was high time we should make for our port de carrenage which was in the estuary of a river among swamps  it was openly understood that we should then break up and go and squander our proportions of the spoil and this made every man greedy of a little more so that our decision was delayed from day to day  what finally decided matters was a trifling accident such as an ignorant person might suppose incidental to our way of life  but here i must explain on only one of all the ships we boarded the first on which we found women did we meet with any genuine resistance  on that occasion we had two men killed and several injured and if it had not been for the gallantry of ballantrae we had surely been beat back at last  everywhere else the defence where there was any at all was what the worst troops in europe would have laughed at so that the most dangerous part of our employment was to clamber up the side of the ship and i have even known the poor souls on board to cast us a line so eager were they to volunteer instead of walking the plank  this constant immunity had made our fellows very soft so that i understood how teach had made so deep a mark upon their minds for indeed the company of that lunatic was the chief danger in our way of life  the accident to which i have referred was this we had sighted a little fullrigged ship very close under our board in a haze she sailed near as well as we did  i should be nearer truth if i said near as ill and we cleared the bowchaser to see if we could bring a spar or two about their ears  the swell was exceeding great the motion of the ship beyond description it was little wonder if our gunners should fire thrice and be still quite broad of what they aimed at  but in the meanwhile the chase had cleared a stern gun the thickness of the air concealing them and being better marksmen their first shot struck us in the bows knocked our two gunners into mincemeat so that we were all sprinkled with the blood and plunged through the deck into the forecastle where we slept  ballantrae would have held on indeed there was nothing in this contretemps to affect the mind of any soldier but he had a quick perception of the mens wishes and it was plain this lucky shot had given them a sickener of their trade  in a moment they were all of one mind  the chase was drawing away from us it was needless to hold on the sarah was too foul to overhaul a bottle it was mere foolery to keep the sea with her and on these pretended grounds her head was incontinently put about and the course laid for the river  it was strange to see what merriment fell on that ships company and how they stamped about the deck jesting and each computing what increase had come to his share by the death of the two gunners  we were nine days making our port so light were the airs we had to sail on so foul the ships bottom but early on the tenth before dawn and in a light lifting haze we passed the head  a little after the haze lifted and fell again showing us a cruiser very close  this was a sore blow happening so near our refuge  there was a great debate of whether she had seen us and if so whether it was likely they had recognised the sarah  we were very careful by destroying every member of those crews we overhauled to leave no evidence as to our own persons but the appearance of the sarah herself we could not keep so private and above all of late since she had been foul and we had pursued many ships without success it was plain that her description had been often published  i supposed this alert would have made us separate upon the instant but here again that original genius of ballantraes had a surprise in store for me  he and teach and it was the most remarkable step of his success had gone hand in hand since the first day of his appointment  i often questioned him upon the fact and never got an answer but once when he told me he and teach had an understanding which would very much surprise the crew if they should hear of it and would surprise himself a good deal if it was carried out  well here again he and teach were of a mind and by their joint procurement the anchor was no sooner down than the whole crew went off upon a scene of drunkenness indescribable  by afternoon we were a mere shipful of lunatical persons throwing of things overboard howling of different songs at the same time quarrelling and falling together and then forgetting our quarrels to embrace  ballantrae had bidden me drink nothing and feign drunkenness as i valued my life and i have never passed a day so wearisomely lying the best part of the time upon the forecastle and watching the swamps and thickets by which our little basin was entirely surrounded for the eye  a little after dusk ballantrae stumbled up to my side feigned to fall with a drunken laugh and before he got his feet again whispered me to reel down into the cabin and seem to fall asleep upon a locker for there would be need of me soon  i did as i was told and coming into the cabin where it was quite dark let myself fall on the first locker there was a man there already by the way he stirred and threw me off i could not think he was much in liquor and yet when i had found another place he seemed to continue to sleep on  my heart now beat very hard for i saw some desperate matter was in act presently down came ballantrae lit the lamp looked about the cabin nodded as if pleased and on deck again without a word  i peered out from between my fingers and saw there were three of us slumbering or feigning to slumber on the lockers  myself one dutton and one grady both resolute men  on deck the rest were got to a pitch of revelry quite beyond the bounds of what is human so that no reasonable name can describe the sounds they were now making  i have heard many a drunken bout in my time many on board that very sarah but never anything the least like this which made me early suppose the liquor had been tampered with  it was a long while before these yells and howls died out into a sort of miserable moaning and then to silence and it seemed a long while after that before ballantrae came down again this time with teach upon his heels  the latter cursed at the sight of us three upon the lockers  tut says ballantrae you might fire a pistol at their ears you know what stuff they have been swallowing  there was a hatch in the cabin floor and under that the richest part of the booty was stored against the day of division  it fastened with a ring and three padlocks the keys for greater security being divided one to teach one to ballantrae and one to the mate a man called hammond  yet i was amazed to see they were now all in the one hand and yet more amazed still looking through my fingers to observe ballantrae and teach bring up several packets four of them in all very carefully made up and with a loop for carriage  and now says teach let us be going  one word says ballantrae  i have discovered there is another man besides yourself who knows a private path across the swamp and it seems it is shorter than yours  teach cried out in that case they were undone  i do not know for that says ballantrae  for there are several other circumstances with which i must acquaint you  first of all there is no bullet in your pistols which if you remember i was kind enough to load for both of us this morning  secondly as there is someone else who knows a passage you must think it highly improbable i should saddle myself with a lunatic like you thirdly these gentlemen who need no longer pretend to be asleep are those of my party and will now proceed to gag and bind you to the mast and when your men awaken if they ever do awake after the drugs we have mingled in their liquor i am sure they will be so obliging as to deliver you and you will have no difficulty i daresay to explain the business of the keys  not a word said teach but looked at us like a frightened baby as we gagged and bound him  now you see you mooncalf says ballantrae why we made four packets  heretofore you have been called captain teach but i think you are now rather captain learn  that was our last word on board the sarah  we four with our four packets lowered ourselves softly into a skiff and left that ship behind us as silent as the grave only for the moaning of some of the drunkards  there was a fog about breasthigh on the waters so that dutton who knew the passage must stand on his feet to direct our rowing and this as it forced us to row gently was the means of our deliverance  we were yet but a little way from the ship when it began to come grey and the birds to fly abroad upon the water  all of a sudden dutton clapped down upon his hams and whispered us to be silent for our lives and hearken  sure enough we heard a little faint creak of oars upon one hand and then again and further off a creak of oars upon the other  it was clear we had been sighted yesterday in the morning here were the cruisers boats to cut us out here were we defenceless in their very midst  sure never were poor souls more perilously placed and as we lay there on our oars praying god the mist might hold the sweat poured from my brow  presently we heard one of the boats where we might have thrown a biscuit in her  softly men we heard an officer whisper and i marvelled they could not hear the drumming of my heart  never mind the path says ballantrae we must get shelter anyhow let us pull straight ahead for the sides of the basin  this we did with the most anxious precaution rowing as best we could upon our hands and steering at a venture in the fog which was for all that our only safety  but heaven guided us we touched ground at a thicket scrambled ashore with our treasure and having no other way of concealment and the mist beginning already to lighten hove down the skiff and let her sink  we were still but new under cover when the sun rose and at the same time from the midst of the basin a great shouting of seamen sprang up and we knew the sarah was being boarded  i heard afterwards the officer that took her got great honour and its true the approach was creditably managed but i think he had an easy capture when he came to board 3  i was still blessing the saints for my escape when i became aware we were in trouble of another kind  we were here landed at random in a vast and dangerous swamp and how to come at the path was a concern of doubt fatigue and peril  dutton indeed was of opinion we should wait until the ship was gone and fish up the skiff for any delay would be more wise than to go blindly ahead in that morass  one went back accordingly to the basinside and peering through the thicket saw the fog already quite drunk up and english colours flying on the sarah but no movement made to get her under way  our situation was now very doubtful  the swamp was an unhealthful place to linger in we had been so greedy to bring treasures that we had brought but little food it was highly desirable besides that we should get clear of the neighbourhood and into the settlements before the news of the capture went abroad and against all these considerations there was only the peril of the passage on the other side  i think it not wonderful we decided on the active part  it was already blistering hot when we set forth to pass the marsh or rather to strike the path by compass  dutton took the compass and one or other of us three carried his proportion of the treasure  i promise you he kept a sharp eye to his rear for it was like the mans soul that he must trust us with  the thicket was as close as a bush the ground very treacherous so that we often sank in the most terrifying manner and must go round about the heat besides was stifling the air singularly heavy and the stinging insects abounded in such myriads that each of us walked under his own cloud  it has often been commented on how much better gentlemen of birth endure fatigue than persons of the rabble so that walking officers who must tramp in the dirt beside their men shame them by their constancy  this was well to be observed in the present instance for here were ballantrae and i two gentlemen of the highest breeding on the one hand and on the other grady a common mariner and a man nearly a giant in physical strength  the case of dutton is not in point for i confess he did as well as any of us 4  but as for grady he began early to lament his case tailed in the rear refused to carry duttons packet when it came his turn clamoured continually for rum of which we had too little and at last even threatened us from behind with a cooked pistol unless we should allow him rest  ballantrae would have fought it out i believe but i prevailed with him the other way and we made a stop and ate a meal  it seemed to benefit grady little he was in the rear again at once growling and bemoaning his lot and at last by some carelessness not having followed properly in our tracks stumbled into a deep part of the slough where it was mostly water gave some very dreadful screams and before we could come to his aid had sunk along with his booty  his fate and above all these screams of his appalled us to the soul yet it was on the whole a fortunate circumstance and the means of our deliverance for it moved dutton to mount into a tree whence he was able to perceive and to show me who had climbed after him a high piece of the wood which was a landmark for the path  he went forward the more carelessly i must suppose for presently we saw him sink a little down draw up his feet and sink again and so twice  then he turned his face to us pretty white  lend a hand said he i am in a bad place  i dont know about that says ballantrae standing still  dutton broke out into the most violent oaths sinking a little lower as he did so that the mud was nearly to his waist and plucking a pistol from his belt help me he cries or die and be damned to you  nay says ballantrae i did but jest  i am coming  and he set down his own packet and duttons which he was then carrying  do not venture near till we see if you are needed said he to me and went forward alone to where the man was bogged  he was quiet now though he still held the pistol and the marks of terror in his countenance were very moving to behold  for the lords sake says he look sharp  ballantrae was now got close up  keep still says he and seemed to consider and then reach out both your hands  dutton laid down his pistol and so watery was the top surface that it went clear out of sight with an oath he stooped to snatch it and as he did so ballantrae leaned forth and stabbed him between the shoulders  up went his hands over his head  i know not whether with the pain or to ward himself and the next moment he doubled forward in the mud  ballantrae was already over the ankles but he plucked himself out and came back to me where i stood with my knees smiting one another  the devil take you francis says he  i believe you are a halfhearted fellow after all  i have only done justice on a pirate  and here we are quite clear of the sarah  who shall now say that we have dipped our hands in any irregularities  i assured him he did me injustice but my sense of humanity was so much affected by the horridness of the fact that i could scarce find breath to answer with  come said he you must be more resolved  the need for this fellow ceased when he had shown you where the path ran and you cannot deny i would have been daft to let slip so fair an opportunity  i could not deny but he was right in principle nor yet could i refrain from shedding tears of which i think no man of valour need have been ashamed and it was not until i had a share of the rum that i was able to proceed  i repeat i am far from ashamed of my generous emotion mercy is honourable in the warrior and yet i cannot altogether censure ballantrae whose step was really fortunate as we struck the path without further misadventure and the same night about sundown came to the edge of the morass  we were too weary to seek far on some dry sands still warm with the days sun and close under a wood of pines we lay down and were instantly plunged in sleep  we awaked the next morning very early and began with a sullen spirit a conversation that came near to end in blows  we were now cast on shore in the southern provinces thousands of miles from any french settlement a dreadful journey and a thousand perils lay in front of us and sure if there was ever need for amity it was in such an hour  i must suppose that ballantrae had suffered in his sense of what is truly polite indeed and there is nothing strange in the idea after the seawolves we had consorted with so long and as for myself he fubbed me off unhandsomely and any gentleman would have resented his behaviour  i told him in what light i saw his conduct he walked a little off i following to upbraid him and at last he stopped me with his hand  frank says he you know what we swore and yet there is no oath invented would induce me to swallow such expressions if i did not regard you with sincere affection  it is impossible you should doubt me there  i have given proofs  dutton i had to take because he knew the pass and grady because dutton would not move without him but what call was there to carry you along  you are a perpetual danger to me with your cursed irish tongue  by rights you should now be in irons in the cruiser  and you quarrel with me like a baby for some trinkets  i considered this one of the most unhandsome speeches ever made and indeed to this day i can scarce reconcile it to my notion of a gentleman that was my friend  i retorted upon him with his scotch accent of which he had not so much as some but enough to be very barbarous and disgusting as i told him plainly and the affair would have gone to a great length but for an alarming intervention  we had got some way off upon the sand  the place where we had slept with the packets lying undone and the money scattered openly was now between us and the pines and it was out of these the stranger must have come  there he was at least a great hulking fellow of the country with a broad axe on his shoulder looking openmouthed now at the treasure which was just at his feet and now at our disputation in which we had gone far enough to have weapons in our hands  we had no sooner observed him than he found his legs and made off again among the pines  this was no scene to put our minds at rest  a couple of armed men in seaclothes found quarrelling over a treasure not many miles from where a pirate had been captured  here was enough to bring the whole country about our ears  the quarrel was not even made up it was blotted from our minds and we got our packets together in the twinkling of an eye and made off running with the best will in the world  but the trouble was we did not know in what direction and must continually return upon our steps  ballantrae had indeed collected what he could from dutton but its hard to travel upon hearsay and the estuary which spreads into a vast irregular harbour turned us off upon every side with a new stretch of water  we were near beside ourselves and already quite spent with running when coming to the top of a dune we saw we were again cut off by another ramification of the bay  this was a creek however very different from those that had arrested us before being set in rocks and so precipitously deep that a small vessel was able to lie alongside made fast with a hawser and her crew had laid a plank to the shore  here they had lighted a fire and were sitting at their meal  as for the vessel herself she was one of those they build in the bermudas  the love of gold and the great hatred that everybody has to pirates were motives of the most influential and would certainly raise the country in our pursuit  besides it was now plain we were on some sort of straggling peninsula like the fingers of a hand and the wrist or passage to the mainland which we should have taken at the first was by this time not improbably secured  these considerations put us on a bolder counsel  for as long as we dared looking every moment to hear sounds of the chase we lay among some bushes on the top of the dune and having by this means secured a little breath and recomposed our appearance we strolled down at last with a great affectation of carelessness to the party by the fire  it was a trader and his negroes belonging to albany in the province of new york and now on the way home from the indies with a cargo his name i cannot recall  we were amazed to learn he had put in here from terror of the sarah for we had no thought our exploits had been so notorious  as soon as the albanian heard she had been taken the day before he jumped to his feet gave us a cup of spirits for our good news and sent big negroes to get sail on the bermudan  on our side we profited by the dram to become more confidential and at last offered ourselves as passengers  he looked askance at our tarry clothes and pistols and replied civilly enough that he had scarce accommodation for himself nor could either our prayers or our offers of money in which we advanced pretty far avail to shake him  i see you think ill of us says ballantrae but i will show you how well we think of you by telling you the truth  we are jacobite fugitives and there is a price upon our heads  at this the albanian was plainly moved a little  he asked us many questions as to the scotch war which ballantrae very patiently answered  and then with a wink in a vulgar manner i guess you and your prince charlie got more than you cared about said he  bedad and that we did said i  and my dear man i wish you would set a new example and give us just that much  this i said in the irish way about which there is allowed to be something very engaging  its a remarkable thing and a testimony to the love with which our nation is regarded that this address scarce ever fails in a handsome fellow  i cannot tell how often i have seen a private soldier escape the horse or a beggar wheedle out a good alms by a touch of the brogue  and indeed as soon as the albanian had laughed at me i was pretty much at rest  even then however he made many conditions and  for one thing  took away our arms before he suffered us aboard which was the signal to cast off so that in a moment after we were gliding down the bay with a good breeze and blessing the name of god for our deliverance  almost in the mouth of the estuary we passed the cruiser and a little after the poor sarah with her prize crew and these were both sights to make us tremble  the bermudan seemed a very safe place to be in and our bold stroke to have been fortunately played when we were thus reminded of the case of our companions  for all that we had only exchanged traps jumped out of the fryingpan into the fire ran from the yardarm to the block and escaped the open hostility of the manofwar to lie at the mercy of the doubtful faith of our albanian merchant  from many circumstances it chanced we were safer than we could have dared to hope  the town of albany was at that time much concerned in contraband trade across the desert with the indians and the french  this as it was highly illegal relaxed their loyalty and as it brought them in relation with the politest people on the earth divided even their sympathies  in short they were like all the smugglers in the world spies and agents ready made for either party  our albanian besides was a very honest man indeed and very greedy and to crown our luck he conceived a great delight in our society  before we had reached the town of new york we had come to a full agreement that he should carry us as far as albany upon his ship and thence put us on a way to pass the boundaries and join the french  for all this we were to pay at a high rate but beggars cannot be choosers nor outlaws bargainers  we sailed then up the hudson river which i protest is a very fine stream and put up at the kings arms in albany  the town was full of the militia of the province breathing slaughter against the french  governor clinton was there himself a very busy man and by what i could learn very near distracted by the factiousness of his assembly  the indians on both sides were on the warpath we saw parties of them bringing in prisoners and what was much worse scalps both male and female for which they were paid at a fixed rate and i assure you the sight was not encouraging  altogether we could scarce have come at a period more unsuitable for our designs our position in the chief inn was dreadfully conspicuous our albanian fubbed us off with a thousand delays and seemed upon the point of a retreat from his engagements nothing but peril appeared to environ the poor fugitives and for some time we drowned our concern in a very irregular course of living  this too proved to be fortunate and its one of the remarks that fall to be made upon our escape how providentially our steps were conducted to the very end  what a humiliation to the dignity of man  my philosophy the extraordinary genius of ballantrae our valour in which i grant that we were equal  all these might have proved insufficient without the divine blessing on our efforts and how true it is as the church tells us that the truths of religion are after all quite applicable even to daily affairs at least it was in the course of our revelry that we made the acquaintance of a spirited youth by the name of chew  he was one of the most daring of the indian traders very well acquainted with the secret paths of the wilderness needy dissolute and by a last good fortune in some disgrace with his family  him we persuaded to come to our relief he privately provided what was needful for our flight and one day we slipped out of albany without a word to our former friend and embarked a little above in a canoe  to the toils and perils of this journey it would require a pen more elegant than mine to do full justice  the reader must conceive for himself the dreadful wilderness which we had now to thread its thickets swamps precipitous rocks impetuous rivers and amazing waterfalls  among these barbarous scenes we must toil all day now paddling now carrying our canoe upon our shoulders and at night we slept about a fire surrounded by the howling of wolves and other savage animals  it was our design to mount the headwaters of the hudson to the neighbourhood of crown point where the french had a strong place in the woods upon lake champlain  but to have done this directly were too perilous and it was accordingly gone upon by such a labyrinth of rivers lakes and portages as makes my head giddy to remember  these paths were in ordinary times entirely desert but the country was now up the tribes on the warpath the woods full of indian scouts  again and again we came upon these parties when we least expected them and one day in particular i shall never forget how as dawn was coming in we were suddenly surrounded by five or six of these painted devils uttering a very dreary sort of cry and brandishing their hatchets  it passed off harmlessly indeed as did the rest of our encounters for chew was well known and highly valued among the different tribes  indeed he was a very gallant respectable young man but even with the advantage of his companionship you must not think these meetings were without sensible peril  to prove friendship on our part it was needful to draw upon our stock of rum  indeed under whatever disguise that is the true business of the indian trader to keep a travelling publichouse in the forest and when once the braves had got their bottle of scaura as they call this beastly liquor it behoved us to set forth and paddle for our scalps  once they were a little drunk goodbye to any sense or decency they had but the one thought to get more scaura  they might easily take it in their heads to give us chase and had we been overtaken i had never written these memoirs  we were come to the most critical portion of our course where we might equally expect to fall into the hands of french or english when a terrible calamity befell us  chew was taken suddenly sick with symptoms like those of poison and in the course of a few hours expired in the bottom of the canoe  we thus lost at once our guide our interpreter our boatman and our passport for he was all these in one and found ourselves reduced at a blow to the most desperate and irremediable distress  chew who took a great pride in his knowledge had indeed often lectured us on the geography and ballantrae i believe would listen  but for my part i have always found such information highly tedious and beyond the fact that we were now in the country of the adirondack indians and not so distant from our destination could we but have found the way i was entirely ignorant  the wisdom of my course was soon the more apparent for with all his pains ballantrae was no further advanced than myself  he knew we must continue to go up one stream then by way of a portage down another and then up a third  but you are to consider in a mountain country how many streams come rolling in from every hand  and how is a gentleman who is a perfect stranger in that part of the world to tell any one of them from any other  nor was this our only trouble  we were great novices besides in handling a canoe the portages were almost beyond our strength so that i have seen us sit down in despair for half an hour at a time without one word and the appearance of a single indian since we had now no means of speaking to them would have been in all probability the means of our destruction  there is altogether some excuse if ballantrae showed something of a grooming disposition his habit of imputing blame to others quite as capable as himself was less tolerable and his language it was not always easy to accept  indeed he had contracted on board the pirate ship a manner of address which was in a high degree unusual between gentlemen and now when you might say he was in a fever it increased upon him hugely  the third day of these wanderings as we were carrying the canoe upon a rocky portage she fell and was entirely bilged  the portage was between two lakes both pretty extensive the track such as it was opened at both ends upon the water and on both hands was enclosed by the unbroken woods and the sides of the lakes were quite impassable with bog  so that we beheld ourselves not only condemned to go without our boat and the greater part of our provisions but to plunge at once into impenetrable thickets and to desert what little guidance we still had  the course of the river  each stuck his pistols in his belt shouldered an axe made a pack of his treasure and as much food as he could stagger under and deserting the rest of our possessions even to our swords which would have much embarrassed us among the woods we set forth on this deplorable adventure  the labours of hercules so finely described by homer were a trifle to what we now underwent  some parts of the forest were perfectly dense down to the ground so that we must cut our way like mites in a cheese  in some the bottom was full of deep swamp and the whole wood entirely rotten i have leaped on a great fallen log and sunk to the knees in touchwood i have sought to stay myself in falling against what looked to be a solid trunk and the whole thing has whiffed away at my touch like a sheet of paper  stumbling falling bogging to the knees hewing our way our eyes almost put out with twigs and branches our clothes plucked from our bodies we laboured all day and it is doubtful if we made two miles  what was worse as we could rarely get a view of the country and were perpetually justled from our path by obstacles it was impossible even to have a guess in what direction we were moving  a little before sundown in an open place with a stream and set about with barbarous mountains ballantrae threw down his pack  i will go no further said he and bade me light the fire damning my blood in terms not proper for a chairman  i told him to try to forget he had ever been a pirate and to remember he had been a gentleman  are you mad he cried  dont cross me here  and then shaking his fist at the hills to think cries he that i must leave my bones in this miserable wilderness  would god i had died upon the scaffold like a gentleman  this he said ranting like an actor and then sat biting his fingers and staring on the ground a most unchristian object  i took a certain horror of the man for i thought a soldier and a gentleman should confront his end with more philosophy  i made him no reply therefore in words and presently the evening fell so chill that i was glad for my own sake to kindle a fire  and yet god knows in such an open spot and the country alive with savages the act was little short of lunacy  ballantrae seemed never to observe me but at last as i was about parching a little corn he looked up  have you ever a brother said be  by the blessing of heaven said i not less than five  i have the one said he with a strange voice and then presently he shall pay me for all this he added  and when i asked him what was his brothers part in our distress what he cried he sits in my place he bears my name he courts my wife and i am here alone with a damned irishman in this toothchattering desert  oh i have been a common gull he cried  the explosion was in all ways so foreign to my friends nature that i was daunted out of all my just susceptibility  sure an offensive expression however vivacious appears a wonderfully small affair in circumstances so extreme  but here there is a strange thing to be noted  he had only once before referred to the lady with whom he was contracted  that was when we came in view of the town of new york when he had told me if all had their rights he was now in sight of his own property for miss graeme enjoyed a large estate in the province  and this was certainly a natural occasion but now here she was named a second time and what is surely fit to be observed in this very month which was november 47 and i believe upon that very day as we sat among these barbarous mountains his brother and miss graeme were married  i am the least superstitious of men but the hand of providence is here displayed too openly not to be remarked 5  the next day and the next were passed in similar labours ballantrae often deciding on our course by the spinning of a coin and once when i expostulated on this childishness he had an odd remark that i have never forgotten  i know no better way said he to express my scorn of human reason  i think it was the third day that we found the body of a christian scalped and most abominably mangled and lying in a pudder of his blood the birds of the desert screaming over him as thick as flies  i cannot describe how dreadfully this sight affected us but it robbed me of all strength and all hope for this world  the same day and only a little after we were scrambling over a part of the forest that had been burned when ballantrae who was a little ahead ducked suddenly behind a fallen trunk  i joined him in this shelter whence we could look abroad without being seen ourselves and in the bottom of the next vale beheld a large war party of the savages going by across our line  there might be the value of a weak battalion present all naked to the waist blacked with grease and soot and painted with white lead and vermilion according to their beastly habits  they went one behind another like a string of geese and at a quickish trot so that they took but a little while to rattle by and disappear again among the woods  yet i suppose we endured a greater agony of hesitation and suspense in these few minutes than goes usually to a mans whole life  whether they were french or english indians whether they desired scalps or prisoners whether we should declare ourselves upon the chance or lie quiet and continue the heartbreaking business of our journey sure i think these were questions to have puzzled the brains of aristotle himself  ballantrae turned to me with a face all wrinkled up and his teeth showing in his mouth like what i have read of people starving he said no word but his whole appearance was a kind of dreadful question  they may be of the english side i whispered and think the best we could then hope is to begin this over again  i know  i know he said  yet it must come to a plunge at last  and he suddenly plucked out his coin shook it in his closed hands looked at it and then lay down with his face in the dust  addition by mr mackellar  i drop the chevaliers narration at this point because the couple quarrelled and separated the same day and the chevaliers account of the quarrel seems to me i must confess quite incompatible with the nature of either of the men henceforth they wandered alone undergoing extraordinary sufferings until first one and then the other was picked up by a party from fort st frederick  only two things are to be noted and first as most important for my purpose that the master in the course of his miseries buried his treasure at a point never since discovered but of which he took a drawing in his own blood on the lining of his hat  and second that on his coming thus penniless to the fort he was welcomed like a brother by the chevalier who thence paid his way to france  the simplicity of mr burkes character leads him at this point to praise the master exceedingly to an eye more worldly wise it would seem it was the chevalier alone that was to be commended  i have the more pleasure in pointing to this really very noble trait of my esteemed correspondent as i fear i may have wounded him immediately before i have refrained from comments on any of his extraordinary and in my eyes immoral opinions for i know him to be jealous of respect but his version of the quarrel is really more than i can reproduce for i knew the master myself and a man more insusceptible of fear is not conceivable  i regret this oversight of the chevaliers and all the more because the tenor of his narrative set aside a few flourishes strikes me as highly ingenuous    chapter iv  persecutions endured by mr henry    you can guess on what part of his adventures the colonel principally dwelled  indeed if we had heard it all it is to be thought the current of this business had been wholly altered but the pirate ship was very gently touched upon  nor did i hear the colonel to an end even of that which he was willing to disclose for mr henry having for some while been plunged in a brown study rose at last from his seat and reminding the colonel there were matters that he must attend to bade me follow him immediately to the office  once there he sought no longer to dissemble his concern walking to and fro in the room with a contorted face and passing his hand repeatedly upon his brow  we have some business he began at last and there broke off declared we must have wine and sent for a magnum of the best this was extremely foreign to his habitudes and what was still more so when the wine had come he gulped down one glass upon another like a man careless of appearances  but the drink steadied him  you will scarce be surprised mackellar says he when i tell you that my brother  whose safety we are all rejoiced to learn  stands in some need of money  i told him i had misdoubted as much but the time was not very fortunate as the stock was low  not mine said he  there is the money for the mortgage  i reminded him it was mrs henrys  i will be answerable to my wife he cried violently  and then said i there is the mortgage  i know said he it is on that i would consult you  i showed him how unfortunate a time it was to divert this money from its destination and how by so doing we must lose the profit of our past economies and plunge back the estate into the mire  i even took the liberty to plead with him and when he still opposed me with a shake of the head and a bitter dogged smile my zeal quite carried me beyond my place  this is midsummer madness cried i and i for one will be no party to it  you speak as though i did it for my pleasure says he  but i have a child now and besides i love order and to say the honest truth mackellar i had begun to take a pride in the estates  he gloomed for a moment  but what would you have he went on nothing is mine nothing this days news has knocked the bottom out of my life  i have only the name and the shadow of things  only the shadow there is no substance in my rights  they will prove substantial enough before a court said i  he looked at me with a burning eye and seemed to repress the word upon his lips and i repented what i had said for i saw that while he spoke of the estate he had still a sidethought to his marriage and then of a sudden he twitched the letter from his pocket where it lay all crumpled smoothed it violently on the table and read these words to me with a trembling tongue  my dear jacob  this is how he begins cries he  my dear jacob i once called you so you may remember and you have now done the business and flung my heels as high as criffel  what do you think of that mackellar says he from an only brother  i declare to god i liked him very well i was always staunch to him and this is how he writes  but i will not sit down under the imputation  walking to and fro  i am as good as he i am a better man than he i call on god to prove it  i cannot give him all the monstrous sum he asks he knows the estate to be incompetent but i will give him what i have and it in more than he expects  i have borne all this too long  see what he writes further on read it for yourself  i know you are a niggardly dog  a niggardly dog  i niggardly  is that true mackellar  you think it is  i really thought he would have struck me at that  oh you all think so  well you shall see and he shall see and god shall see  if i ruin the estate and go barefoot i shall stuff this bloodsucker  let him ask all  all and he shall have it  it is all his by rights  ah he cried and i foresaw all this and worse when he would not let me go  he poured out another glass of wine and was about to carry it to his lips when i made so bold as to lay a finger on his arm he stopped a moment  you are right said he and flung glass and all in the fireplace  come let us count the money  i durst no longer oppose him indeed i was very much affected by the sight of so much disorder in a man usually so controlled and we sat down together counted the money and made it up in packets for the greater ease of colonel burke who was to be the bearer this done mr henry returned to the hall where he and my old lord sat all night through with their guest  a little before dawn i was called and set out with the colonel  he would scarce have liked a less responsible convoy for he was a man who valued himself nor could we afford him one more dignified for mr henry must not appear with the freetraders  it was a very bitter morning of wind and as we went down through the long shrubbery the colonel held himself muffled in his cloak  sir said i this is a great sum of money that your friend requires  i must suppose his necessities to be very great  we must suppose so says he i thought drily but perhaps it was the cloak about his mouth  i am only a servant of the family said i  you may deal openly with me  i think we are likely to get little good by him  my dear man said the colonel ballantrae is a gentleman of the most eminent natural abilities and a man that i admire and that i revere to the very ground he treads on  and then he seemed to me to pause like one in a difficulty  but for all that said i we are likely to get little good by him  sure and you can have it your own way my dear man says the colonel  by this time we had come to the side of the creek where the boat awaited him  well said be i am sure i am very much your debtor for all your civility mr whateveryournameis and just as a last word and since you show so much intelligent interest i will mention a small circumstance that may be of use to the family for i believe my friend omitted to mention that he has the largest pension on the scots fund of any refugee in paris and its the more disgraceful sir cries the colonel warming because theres not one dirty penny for myself  he cocked his hat at me as if i had been to blame for this partiality then changed again into his usual swaggering civility shook me by the hand and set off down to the boat with the money under his arms and whistling as he went the pathetic air of shule aroon  it was the first time i had heard that tune i was to hear it again words and all as you shall learn but i remember how that little stave of it ran in my head after the freetraders had bade him wheesht in the deils name and the grating of the oars had taken its place and i stood and watched the dawn creeping on the sea and the boat drawing away and the lugger lying with her foresail backed awaiting it   the gap made in our money was a sore embarrassment and among other consequences it had this  that i must ride to edinburgh and there raise a new loan on very questionable terms to keep the old afloat and was thus for close upon three weeks absent from the house of durrisdeer  what passed in the interval i had none to tell me but i found mrs henry upon my return much changed in her demeanour  the old talks with my lord for the most part pretermitted a certain deprecation visible towards her husband to whom i thought she addressed herself more often and for one thing she was now greatly wrapped up in miss katharine  you would think the change was agreeable to mr henry no such matter  to the contrary every circumstance of alteration was a stab to him he read in each the avowal of her truant fancies  that constancy to the master of which she was proud while she supposed him dead she had to blush for now she knew he was alive and these blushes were the hated spring of her new conduct  i am to conceal no truth and i will here say plainly i think this was the period in which mr henry showed the worst  he contained himself indeed in public but there was a deepseated irritation visible underneath  with me from whom he had less concealment he was often grossly unjust and even for his wife he would sometimes have a sharp retort  perhaps when she had ruffled him with some unwonted kindness perhaps upon no tangible occasion the mere habitual tenor of the mans annoyance bursting spontaneously forth  when he would thus forget himself a thing so strangely out of keeping with the terms of their relation there went a shook through the whole company and the pair would look upon each other in a kind of pained amazement  all the time too while he was injuring himself by this defect of temper he was hurting his position by a silence of which i scarce know whether to say it was the child of generosity or pride  the freetraders came again and again bringing messengers from the master and none departed emptyhanded  i never durst reason with mr henry he gave what was asked of him in a kind of noble rage perhaps because he knew he was by nature inclining to the parsimonious he took a backforemost pleasure in the recklessness with which he supplied his brothers exigence  perhaps the falsity of the position would have spurred a humbler man into the same excess  but the estate if i may say so groaned under it our daily expenses were shorn lower and lower the stables were emptied all but four roadsters servants were discharged which raised a dreadful murmuring in the country and heated up the old disfavour upon mr henry and at last the yearly visit to edinburgh must be discontinued  this was in 1756  you are to suppose that for seven years this bloodsucker had been drawing the lifes blood from durrisdeer and that all this time my patron had held his peace  it was an effect of devilish malice in the master that he addressed mr henry alone upon the matter of his demands and there was never a word to my lord  the family had looked on wondering at our economies  they had lamented i have no doubt that my patron had become so great a miser  a fault always despicable but in the young abhorrent and mr henry was not yet thirty years of age  still he had managed the business of durrisdeer almost from a boy and they bore with these changes in a silence as proud and bitter as his own until the copingstone of the edinburgh visit  at this time i believe my patron and his wife were rarely together save at meals  immediately on the back of colonel burkes announcement mrs henry made palpable advances you might say she had laid a sort of timid court to her husband different indeed from her former manner of unconcern and distance  i never had the heart to blame mr henry because he recoiled from these advances nor yet to censure the wife when she was cut to the quick by their rejection  but the result was an entire estrangement so that as i say they rarely spoke except at meals  even the matter of the edinburgh visit was first broached at table and it chanced that mrs henry was that day ailing and querulous  she had no sooner understood her husbands meaning than the red flew in her face  at last she cried this is too much  heaven knows what pleasure i have in my life that i should be denied my only consolation  these shameful proclivities must be trod down we are already a mark and an eyesore in the neighbourhood  i will not endure this fresh insanity  i cannot afford it says mr henry  afford she cried  for shame  but i have money of my own  that is all mine madam by marriage he snarled and instantly left the room  my old lord threw up his hands to heaven and he and his daughter withdrawing to the chimney gave me a broad hint to be gone  i found mr henry in his usual retreat the stewards room perched on the end of the table and plunging his penknife in it with a very ugly countenance  mr henry said i you do yourself too much injustice and it is time this should cease  oh cries he nobody minds here  they think it only natural  i have shameful proclivities  i am a niggardly dog and he drove his knife up to the hilt  but i will show that fellow he cried with an oath i will show him which is the more generous  this is no generosity said i this is only pride  do you think i want morality he asked  i thought he wanted help and i should give it him willynilly and no sooner was mrs henry gone to her room than i presented myself at her door and sought admittance  she openly showed her wonder  what do you want with me mr mackellar said she  the lord knows madam says i i have never troubled you before with any freedoms but this thing lies too hard upon my conscience and it will out  is it possible that two people can be so blind as you and my lord and have lived all these years with a noble gentleman like mr henry and understand so little of his nature  what does this mean she cried  do you not know where his money goes to his  and yours  and the money for the very wine he does not drink at table i went on to paris  to that man  eight thousand pounds has he had of us in seven years and my patron fool enough to keep it secret  eight thousand pounds she repeated  it in impossible the estate is not sufficient  god knows how we have sweated farthings to produce it said i but eight thousand and sixty is the sum beside odd shillings and if you can think my patron miserly after that this shall be my last interference  you need say no more mr mackellar said she  you have done most properly in what you too modestly call your interference  i am much to blame you must think me indeed a very unobservant wife looking upon me with a strange smile but i shall put this right at once  the master was always of a very thoughtless nature but his heart is excellent he is the soul of generosity  i shall write to him myself  you cannot think how you have pained me by this communication  indeed madam i had hoped to have pleased you said i for i raged to see her still thinking of the master  and pleased said she and pleased me of course  that same day i will not say but what i watched i had the satisfaction to see mr henry come from his wifes room in a state most unlike himself for his face was all bloated with weeping and yet he seemed to me to walk upon the air  by this i was sure his wife had made him full amends for once  ah thought i to myself i have done a brave stroke this day  on the morrow as i was seated at my books mr henry came in softly behind me took me by the shoulders and shook me in a manner of playfulness  i find you are a faithless fellow after all says he which was his only reference to my part but the tone he spoke in was more to me than any eloquence of protestation nor was this all i had effected for when the next messenger came as he did not long afterwards from the master he got nothing away with him but a letter  for some while back it had been i myself who had conducted these affairs mr henry not setting pen to paper and i only in the dryest and most formal terms  but this letter i did not even see it would scarce be pleasant reading for mr henry felt he had his wife behind him for once and i observed on the day it was despatched he had a very gratified expression  things went better now in the family though it could scarce be pretended they went well  there was now at least no misconception there was kindness upon all sides and i believe my patron and his wife might again have drawn together if he could but have pocketed his pride and she forgot what was the ground of all her brooding on another man  it is wonderful how a private thought leaks out it is wonderful to me now how we should all have followed the current of her sentiments and though she bore herself quietly and had a very even disposition yet we should have known whenever her fancy ran to paris  and would not any one have thought that my disclosure must have rooted up that idol  i think there is the devil in women  all these years passed never a sight of the man little enough kindness to remember by all accounts even while she had him the notion of his death intervening his heartless rapacity laid bare to her that all should not do and she must still keep the best place in her heart for this accursed fellow is a thing to make a plain man rage  i had never much natural sympathy for the passion of love but this unreason in my patrons wife disgusted me outright with the whole matter  i remember checking a maid because she sang some bairnly kickshaw while my mind was thus engaged and my asperity brought about my ears the enmity of all the petticoats about the house of which i reeked very little but it amused mr henry who rallied me much upon our joint unpopularity  it is strange enough for my own mother was certainly one of the salt of the earth and my aunt dickson who paid my fees at the university a very notable woman but i have never had much toleration for the female sex possibly not much understanding and being far from a bold man i have ever shunned their company  not only do i see no cause to regret this diffidence in myself but have invariably remarked the most unhappy consequences follow those who were less wise  so much i thought proper to set down lest i show myself unjust to mrs henry  and besides the remark arose naturally on a reperusal of the letter which was the next step in these affairs and reached me to my sincere astonishment by a private hand some week or so after the departure of the last messenger   letter from colonel burke afterwards chevalier to mr mackellar troyes in champagne july 12 1756  my dear sir  you will doubtless be surprised to receive a communication from one so little known to you but on the occasion i had the good fortune to rencounter you at durrisdeer i remarked you for a young man of a solid gravity of character  a qualification which i profess i admire and revere next to natural genius or the bold chivalrous spirit of the soldier  i was besides interested in the noble family which you have the honour to serve or to speak more by the book to be the humble and respected friend of and a conversation i had the pleasure to have with you very early in the morning has remained much upon my mind  being the other day in paris on a visit from this famous city where i am in garrison i took occasion to inquire your name which i profess i had forgot at my friend the master of b and a fair opportunity occurring i write to inform you of whats new  the master of b when we had last some talk of him together was in receipt as i think i then told you of a highly advantageous pension on the scots fund  he next received a company and was soon after advanced to a regiment of his own  my dear sir i do not offer to explain this circumstance any more than why i myself who have rid at the right hand of princes should be fubbed off with a pair of colours and sent to rot in a hole at the bottom of the province  accustomed as i am to courts i cannot but feel it is no atmosphere for a plain soldier and i could never hope to advance by similar means even could i stoop to the endeavour  but our friend has a particular aptitude to succeed by the means of ladies and if all be true that i have heard he enjoyed a remarkable protection  it is like this turned against him for when i had the honour to shake him by the hand he was but newly released from the bastille where he had been cast on a sealed letter and though now released has both lost his regiment and his pension  my dear sir the loyalty of a plain irishman will ultimately succeed in the place of craft as i am sure a gentleman of your probity will agree  now sir the master is a man whose genius i admire beyond expression and besides he is my friend but i thought a little word of this revolution in his fortunes would not come amiss for in my opinion the mans desperate  he spoke when i saw him of a trip to india whither i am myself in some hope of accompanying my illustrious countryman mr lally but for this he would require as i understood more money than was readily at his command  you may have heard a military proverb  that it is a good thing to make a bridge of gold to a flying enemy  i trust you will take my meaning and i subscribe myself with proper respects to my lord durrisdeer to his son and to the beauteous mrs durie  my dear sir  your obedient humble servant  francis burke   this missive i carried at once to mr henry and i think there was but the one thought between the two of us  that it had come a week too late  i made haste to send an answer to colonel burke in which i begged him if he should see the master to assure him his next messenger would be attended to  but with all my haste i was not in time to avert what was impending the arrow had been drawn it must now fly  i could almost doubt the power of providence and certainly his will to stay the issue of events and it is a strange thought how many of us had been storing up the elements of this catastrophe for how long a time and with how blind an ignorance of what we did   from the coming of the colonels letter i had a spyglass in my room began to drop questions to the tenant folk and as there was no great secrecy observed and the freetrade in our part went by force as much as stealth i had soon got together a knowledge of the signals in use and knew pretty well to an hour when any messenger might be expected  i say i questioned the tenants for with the traders themselves desperate blades that went habitually armed i could never bring myself to meddle willingly  indeed by what proved in the sequel an unhappy chance i was an object of scorn to some of these braggadocios who had not only gratified me with a nickname but catching me one night upon a bypath and being all as they would have said somewhat merry had caused me to dance for their diversion  the method employed was that of cruelly chipping at my toes with naked cutlasses shouting at the same time squaretoes and though they did me no bodily mischief i was none the less deplorably affected and was indeed for several days confined to my bed  a scandal on the state of scotland on which no comment is required  it happened on the afternoon of november 7th in this same unfortunate year that i espied during my walk the smoke of a beacon fire upon the muckleross  it was drawing near time for my return but the uneasiness upon my spirits was that day so great that i must burst through the thickets to the edge of what they call the craig head  the sun was already down but there was still a broad light in the west which showed me some of the smugglers treading out their signal fire upon the ross and in the bay the lugger lying with her sails brailed up  she was plainly but new come to anchor and yet the skiff was already lowered and pulling for the landingplace at the end of the long shrubbery  and this i knew could signify but one thing the coming of a messenger for durrisdeer  i laid aside the remainder of my terrors clambered down the brae  a place i had never ventured through before and was hid among the shoreside thickets in time to see the boat touch  captain crail himself was steering a thing not usual by his side there sat a passenger and the men gave way with difficulty being hampered with near upon half a dozen portmanteaus great and small  but the business of landing was briskly carried through and presently the baggage was all tumbled on shore the boat on its return voyage to the lugger and the passenger standing alone upon the point of rock a tall slender figure of a gentleman habited in black with a sword by his side and a walkingcane upon his wrist  as he so stood he waved the cane to captain crail by way of salutation with something both of grace and mockery that wrote the gesture deeply on my mind  no sooner was the boat away with my sworn enemies than i took a sort of half courage came forth to the margin of the thicket and there halted again my mind being greatly pulled about between natural diffidence and a dark foreboding of the truth  indeed i might have stood there swithering all night had not the stranger turned spied me through the mists which were beginning to fall and waved and cried on me to draw near  i did so with a heart like lead  here my good man said he in the english accent there are some things for durrisdeer  i was now near enough to see him a very handsome figure and countenance swarthy lean long with a quick alert black look as of one who was a fighter and accustomed to command upon one cheek he had a mole not unbecoming a large diamond sparkled on his hand his clothes although of the one hue were of a french and foppish design his ruffles which he wore longer than common of exquisite lace and i wondered the more to see him in such a guise when he was but newly landed from a dirty smuggling lugger at the same time he had a better look at me toised me a second time sharply and then smiled  i wager my friend says he that i know both your name and your nickname  i divined these very clothes upon your hand of writing mr mackellar  at these words i fell to shaking  oh says he you need not be afraid of me  i bear no malice for your tedious letters and it is my purpose to employ you a good deal  you may call me mr bally  it is the name i have assumed or rather since i am addressing so great a precision it is so i have curtailed my own  come now pick up that and that  indicating two of the portmanteaus  that will be as much as you are fit to bear and the rest can very well wait  come lose no more time if you please  his tone was so cutting that i managed to do as he bid by a sort of instinct my mind being all the time quite lost  no sooner had i picked up the portmanteaus than he turned his back and marched off through the long shrubbery where it began already to be dusk for the wood is thick and evergreen  i followed behind loaded almost to the dust though i profess i was not conscious of the burthen being swallowed up in the monstrosity of this return and my mind flying like a weavers shuttle  on a sudden i set the portmanteaus to the ground and halted  he turned and looked back at me  well said he  you are the master of ballantrae  you will do me the justice to observe says he i have made no secret with the astute mackellar  and in the name of god cries i what brings you here  go back while it is yet time  i thank you said he  your master has chosen this way and not i but since he has made the choice he and you also must abide by the result  and now pick up these things of mine which you have set down in a very boggy place and attend to that which i have made your business  but i had no thought now of obedience i came straight up to him if nothing will move you to go back said i though sure under all the circumstances any christian or even any gentleman would scruple to go forward      these are gratifying expressions he threw in  if nothing will move you to go back i continued there are still some decencies to be observed  wait here with your baggage and i will go forward and prepare your family  your father is an old man and     i stumbled    there are decencies to be observed  truly said he this mackellar improves upon acquaintance  but look you here my man and understand it once for all  you waste your breath upon me and i go my own way with inevitable motion  ah says i  is that so  we shall see then  and i turned and took to my heels for durrisdeer  he clutched at me and cried out angrily and then i believe i heard him laugh and then i am certain he pursued me for a step or two and i suppose desisted  one thing at least is sure that i came but a few minutes later to the door of the great house nearly strangled for the lack of breath but quite alone  straight up the stair i ran and burst into the hall and stopped before the family without the power of speech but i must have carried my story in my looks for they rose out of their places and stared on me like changelings  he has come i panted out at last  he said mr henry  himself said i  my son cried my lord  imprudent imprudent boy  oh could he not stay where he was safe  never a word says mrs henry nor did i look at her i scarce knew why  well said mr henry with a very deep breath and where is he  i left him in the long shrubbery said i  take me to him said he  so we went out together he and i without another word from any one and in the midst of the gravelled plot encountered the master strolling up whistling as he came and beating the air with his cane  there was still light enough overhead to recognise though not to read a countenance  ah jacob says the master  so here is esau back  james says mr henry for gods sake call me by my name  i will not pretend that i am glad to see you but i would fain make you as welcome as i can in the house of our fathers  or in my house or yours says the master  which were you about to say  but this is an old sore and we need not rub it  if you would not share with me in paris i hope you will yet scarce deny your elder brother a corner of the fire at durrisdeer  that is very idle speech replied mr henry  and you understand the power of your position excellently well  why i believe i do said the other with a little laugh  and this though they had never touched hands was as we may say the end of the brothers meeting for at this the master turned to me and bade me fetch his baggage  i on my side turned to mr henry for a confirmation perhaps with some defiance  as long as the master is here mr mackellar you will very much oblige me by regarding his wishes as you would my own says mr henry  we are constantly troubling you  will you be so good as send one of the servants  with an accent on the word  if this speech were anything at all it was surely a welldeserved reproof upon the stranger and yet so devilish was his impudence he twisted it the other way  and shall we be common enough to say sneck up inquires he softly looking upon me sideways  had a kingdom depended on the act i could not have trusted myself in words even to call a servant was beyond me i had rather serve the man myself than speak and i turned away in silence and went into the long shrubbery with a heart full of anger and despair it was dark under the trees and i walked before me and forgot what business i was come upon till i near broke my shin on the portmanteaus  then it was that i remarked a strange particular for whereas i had before carried both and scarce observed it it was now as much as i could do to manage one  and this as it forced me to make two journeys kept me the longer from the hall  when i got there the business of welcome was over long ago the company was already at supper and by an oversight that cut me to the quick my place had been forgotten  i had seen one side of the masters return now i was to see the other  it was he who first remarked my coming in and standing back as i did in some annoyance  he jumped from his seat  and if i have not got the good mackellars place cries he john lay another for mr bally i protest he will disturb no one and your table is big enough for all  i could scarce credit my ears nor yet my senses when he took me by the shoulders and thrust me laughing into my own place  such an affectionate playfulness was in his voice  and while john laid the fresh place for him a thing on which he still insisted he went and leaned on his fathers chair and looked down upon him and the old man turned about and looked upwards on his son with such a pleasant mutual tenderness that i could have carried my hand to my head in mere amazement  yet all was of a piece  never a harsh word fell from him never a sneer showed upon his lip  he had laid aside even his cutting english accent and spoke with the kindly scots tongue that set a value on affectionate words and though his manners had a graceful elegance mighty foreign to our ways in durrisdeer it was still a homely courtliness that did not shame but flattered us  all that he did throughout the meal indeed drinking wine with me with a notable respect turning about for a pleasant word with john fondling his fathers hand breaking into little merry tales of his adventures calling up the past with happy reference  all he did was so becoming and himself so handsome that i could scarce wonder if my lord and mrs henry sat about the board with radiant faces or if john waited behind with dropping tears  as soon as supper was over mrs henry rose to withdraw  this was never your way alison said he  it is my way now she replied  which was notoriously false and i will give you a goodnight james and a welcome  from the dead said she and her voice dropped and trembled  poor mr henry who had made rather a heavy figure through the meal was more concerned than ever pleased to see his wife withdraw and yet half displeased as he thought upon the cause of it and the next moment altogether dashed by the fervour of her speech  on my part i thought i was now one too many and was stealing after mrs henry when the master saw me  now mr mackellar says he i take this near on an unfriendliness  i cannot have you go  this is to make a stranger of the prodigal son and let me remind you where  in his own fathers house  come sit ye down and drink another glass with mr bally  ay ay mr mackellar says my lord we must not make a stranger either of him or you  i have been telling my son he added his voice brightening as usual on the word how much we valued all your friendly service  so i sat there silent till my usual hour and might have been almost deceived in the mans nature but for one passage in which his perfidy appeared too plain  here was the passage of which after what he knows of the brothers meeting the reader shall consider for himself  mr henry sitting somewhat dully in spite of his best endeavours to carry things before my lord up jumps the master passes about the board and claps his brother on the shoulder  come come hairry lad says he with a broad accent such as they must have used together when they were boys you must not be downcast because your brother has come home  alls yours thats sure enough and little i grudge it you  neither must you grudge me my place beside my fathers fire  and that is too true henry says my old lord with a little frown a thing rare with him  you have been the elder brother of the parable in the good sense you must be careful of the other  i am easily put in the wrong said mr henry  who puts you in the wrong cried my lord i thought very tartly for so mild a man  you have earned my gratitude and your brothers many thousand times  you may count on its endurance and let that suffice  ay harry that you may said the master and i thought mr henry looked at him with a kind of wildness in his eye  on all the miserable business that now followed i have four questions that i asked myself often at the time and ask myself still was the man moved by a particular sentiment against mr henry or by what he thought to be his interest or by a mere delight in cruelty such as cats display and theologians tell us of the devil or by what he would have called love  my common opinion halts among the three first but perhaps there lay at the spring of his behaviour an element of all  as thus animosity to mr henry would explain his hateful usage of him when they were alone the interests he came to serve would explain his very different attitude before my lord that and some spice of a design of gallantry his care to stand well with mrs henry and the pleasure of malice for itself the pains he was continually at to mingle and oppose these lines of conduct  partly because i was a very open friend to my patron partly because in my letters to paris i had often given myself some freedom of remonstrance i was included in his diabolical amusement  when i was alone with him he pursued me with sneers before the family he used me with the extreme of friendly condescension  this was not only painful in itself not only did it put me continually in the wrong but there was in it an element of insult indescribable  that he should thus leave me out in his dissimulation as though even my testimony were too despicable to be considered galled me to the blood  but what it was to me is not worth notice  i make but memorandum of it here and chiefly for this reason that it had one good result and gave me the quicker sense of mr henrys martyrdom  it was on him the burthen fell  how was he to respond to the public advances of one who never lost a chance of gibing him in private  how was he to smile back on the deceiver and the insulter  he was condemned to seem ungracious  he was condemned to silence  had he been less proud had he spoken who would have credited the truth  the acted calumny had done its work my lord and mrs henry were the daily witnesses of what went on they could have sworn in court that the master was a model of longsuffering goodnature and mr henry a pattern of jealousy and thanklessness and ugly enough as these must have appeared in any one they seemed tenfold uglier in mr henry for who could forget that the master lay in peril of his life and that he had already lost his mistress his title and his fortune  henry will you ride with me asks the master one day  and mr henry who had been goaded by the man all morning raps out  i will not  i sometimes wish you would be kinder henry says the other wistfully  i give this for a specimen but such scenes befell continually small wonder if mr henry was blamed small wonder if i fretted myself into something near upon a bilious fever nay and at the mere recollection feel a bitterness in my blood  sure never in this world was a more diabolical contrivance  so perfidious so simple so impossible to combat  and yet i think again and i think always mrs henry might have road between the lines she might have had more knowledge of her husbands nature after all these years of marriage she might have commanded or captured his confidence  and my old lord too  that very watchful gentleman  where was all his observation  but for one thing the deceit was practised by a master hand and might have gulled an angel  for another in the case of mrs henry i have observed there are no persons so far away as those who are both married and estranged so that they seem out of earshot or to have no common tongue  for a third in the case of both of these spectators they were blinded by old ingrained predilection  and for a fourth the risk the master was supposed to stand in supposed i say  you will soon hear why made it seem the more ungenerous to criticise and keeping them in a perpetual tender solicitude about his life blinded them the more effectually to his faults  it was during this time that i perceived most clearly the effect of manner and was led to lament most deeply the plainness of my own mr henry had the essence of a gentleman when he was moved when there was any call of circumstance he could play his part with dignity and spirit but in the days commerce it is idle to deny it he fell short of the ornamental  the master on the other hand had never a movement but it commanded him  so it befell that when the one appeared gracious and the other ungracious every trick of their bodies seemed to call out confirmation  not that alone  but the more deeply mr henry floundered in his brothers toils the more clownish he grew and the more the master enjoyed his spiteful entertainment the more engagingly the more smilingly he went  so that the plot by its own scope and progress furthered and confirmed itself  it was one of the mans arts to use the peril in which as i say he was supposed to stand  he spoke of it to those who loved him with a gentle pleasantry which made it the more touching  to mr henry he used it as a cruel weapon of offence  i remember his laying his finger on the clean lozenge of the painted window one day when we three were alone together in the hall  here went your lucky guinea jacob said he  and when mr henry only looked upon him darkly oh he added you need not look such impotent malice my good fly  you can be rid of your spider when you please  how long o lord  when are you to be wrought to the point of a denunciation scrupulous brother  it is one of my interests in this dreary hole  i ever loved experiment  still mr henry only stared upon him with a grooming brow and a changed colour and at last the master broke out in a laugh and clapped him on the shoulder calling him a sulky dog  at this my patron leaped back with a gesture i thought very dangerous and i must suppose the master thought so too for he looked the least in the world discountenance and i do not remember him again to have laid hands on mr henry  but though he had his peril always on his lips in the one way or the other i thought his conduct strangely incautious and began to fancy the government  who had set a price upon his head  was gone sound asleep  i will not deny i was tempted with the wish to denounce him but two thoughts withheld me  one that if he were thus to end his life upon an honourable scaffold the man would be canonised for good in the minds of his father and my patrons wife the other that if i was anyway mingled in the matter mr henry himself would scarce escape some glancings of suspicion  and in the meanwhile our enemy went in and out more than i could have thought possible the fact that he was home again was buzzed about all the countryside and yet he was never stirred  of all these somany and sodifferent persons who were acquainted with his presence none had the least greed  as i used to say in my annoyance  or the least loyalty and the man rode here and there  fully more welcome considering the lees of old unpopularity than mr henry  and considering the freetraders far safer than myself  not but what he had a trouble of his own and this as it brought about the gravest consequences i must now relate  the reader will scarce have forgotten jessie broun her way of life was much among the smuggling party captain crail himself was of her intimates and she had early word of mr ballys presence at the house  in my opinion she had long ceased to care two straws for the masters person but it was become her habit to connect herself continually with the masters name that was the ground of all her playacting and so now when he was back she thought she owed it to herself to grow a haunter of the neighbourhood of durrisdeer  the master could scarce go abroad but she was there in wait for him a scandalous figure of a woman not often sober hailing him wildly as her bonny laddie quoting pedlars poetry and as i receive the story even seeking to weep upon his neck  i own i rubbed my hands over this persecution but the master who laid so much upon others was himself the least patient of men  there were strange scenes enacted in the policies  some say he took his cane to her and jessie fell back upon her former weapons  stones  it is certain at least that he made a motion to captain crail to have the woman trepanned and that the captain refused the proposition with uncommon vehemence  and the end of the matter was victory for jessie  money was got together an interview took place in which my proud gentleman must consent to be kissed and wept upon and the woman was set up in a public of her own somewhere on solway side but i forget where and by the only news i ever had of it extremely illfrequented  this is to look forward  after jessie had been but a little while upon his heels the master comes to me one day in the stewards office and with more civility than usual mackellar says he there is a damned crazy wench comes about here  i cannot well move in the matter myself which brings me to you  be so good as to see to it  the men must have a strict injunction to drive the wench away  sir said i trembling a little you can do your own dirty errands for yourself  he said not a word to that and left the room  presently came mr henry  here is news cried he  it seems all is not enough and you must add to my wretchedness  it seems you have insulted mr bally  under your kind favour mr henry said i it was he that insulted me and as i think grossly  but i may have been careless of your position when i spoke and if you think so when you know all my dear patron you have but to say the word  for you i would obey in any point whatever even to sin god pardon me  and thereupon i told him what had passed  mr henry smiled to himself a grimmer smile i never witnessed you did exactly well said he  he shall drink his jessie broun to the dregs  and then spying the master outside he opened the window and crying to him by the name of mr bally asked him to step up and have a word  james said he when our persecutor had come in and closed the door behind him looking at me with a smile as if he thought i was to be humbled you brought me a complaint against mr mackellar into which i have inquired  i need not tell you i would always take his word against yours for we are alone and i am going to use something of your own freedom  mr mackellar is a gentleman i value and you must contrive so long as you are under this roof to bring yourself into no more collisions with one whom i will support at any possible cost to me or mine  as for the errand upon which you came to him you must deliver yourself from the consequences of your own cruelty and none of my servants shall be at all employed in such a case  my fathers servants i believe says the master  go to him with this tale said mr henry  the master grew very white  he pointed at me with his finger  i want that man discharged he said  he shall not be said mr henry  you shall pay pretty dear for this says the master  i have paid so dear already for a wicked brother said mr henry that i am bankrupt even of fears  you have no place left where you can strike me  i will show you about that says the master and went softly away  what will he do next mackellar cries mr henry  let me go away said i  my dear patron let me go away i am but the beginning of fresh sorrows  would you leave me quite alone said he   we were not long in suspense as to the nature of the new assault up to that hour the master had played a very close game with mrs henry avoiding pointedly to be alone with her which i took at the time for an effect of decency but now think to be a most insidious art meeting her you may say at mealtime only and behaving when he did so like an affectionate brother  up to that hour you may say he had scarce directly interfered between mr henry and his wife except in so far as he had manoeuvred the one quite forth from the good graces of the other  now all that was to be changed but whether really in revenge or because he was wearying of durrisdeer and looked about for some diversion who but the devil shall decide  from that hour at least began the siege of mrs henry a thing so deftly carried on that i scarce know if she was aware of it herself and that her husband must look on in silence  the first parallel was opened as was made to appear by accident  the talk fell as it did often on the exiles in france so it glided to the matter of their songs  there is one says the master if you are curious in these matters that has always seemed to me very moving  the poetry is harsh and yet perhaps because of my situation it has always found the way to my heart  it is supposed to be sung i should tell you by an exiles sweetheart and represents perhaps not so much the truth of what she is thinking as the truth of what he hopes of her poor soul in these far lands  and here the master sighed i protest it is a pathetic sight when a score of rough irish all common sentinels get to this song and you may see by their falling tears how it strikes home to them  it goes thus father says he very adroitly taking my lord for his listener and if i cannot get to the end of it you must think it is a common case with us exiles  and thereupon he struck up the same air as i had heard the colonel whistle but now to words rustic indeed yet most pathetically setting forth a poor girls aspirations for an exiled lover of which one verse indeed or something like it still sticks by me   o i will dye my petticoat red with my dear boy ill beg my bread though all my friends should wish me dead for willie among the rushes o   he sang it well even as a song but he did better yet a performer i have heard famous actors when there was not a dry eye in the edinburgh theatre a great wonder to behold but no more wonderful than how the master played upon that little ballad and on those who heard him like an instrument and seemed now upon the point of failing and now to conquer his distress so that words and music seemed to pour out of his own heart and his own past and to be aimed directly at mrs henry  and his art went further yet for all was so delicately touched it seemed impossible to suspect him of the least design and so far from making a parade of emotion you would have sworn he was striving to be calm  when it came to an end we all sat silent for a time he had chosen the dusk of the afternoon so that none could see his neighbours face but it seemed as if we held our breathing only my old lord cleared his throat  the first to move was the singer who got to his feet suddenly and softly and went and walked softly to and fro in the low end of the hall mr henrys customary place  we were to suppose that he there struggled down the last of his emotion for he presently returned and launched into a disquisition on the nature of the irish always so much miscalled and whom he defended in his natural voice so that before the lights were brought we were in the usual course of talk  but even then methought mrs henrys face was a shade pale and for another thing she withdrew almost at once  the next sign was a friendship this insidious devil struck up with innocent miss katharine so that they were always together hand in hand or she climbing on his knee like a pair of children  like all his diabolical acts this cut in several ways  it was the last stroke to mr henry to see his own babe debauched against him it made him harsh with the poor innocent which brought him still a peg lower in his wifes esteem and to conclude it was a bond of union between the lady and the master  under this influence their old reserve melted by daily stages  presently there came walks in the long shrubbery talks in the belvedere and i know not what tender familiarity  i am sure mrs henry was like many a good woman she had a whole conscience but perhaps by the means of a little winking  for even to so dull an observer as myself it was plain her kindness was of a more moving nature than the sisterly the tones of her voice appeared more numerous she had a light and softness in her eye she was more gentle with all of us even with mr henry even with myself methought she breathed of some quiet melancholy happiness  to look on at this what a torment it was for mr henry  and yet it brought our ultimate deliverance as i am soon to tell   the purport of the masters stay was no more noble gild it as they might than to wring money out  he had some design of a fortune in the french indies as the chevalier wrote me and it was the sum required for this that he came seeking  for the rest of the family it spelled ruin but my lord in his incredible partiality pushed ever for the granting  the family was now so narrowed down indeed there were no more of them than just the father and the two sons that it was possible to break the entail and alienate a piece of land  and to this at first by hints and then by open pressure mr henry was brought to consent  he never would have done so i am very well assured but for the weight of the distress under which he laboured  but for his passionate eagerness to see his brother gone he would not thus have broken with his own sentiment and the traditions of his house  and even so he sold them his consent at a dear rate speaking for once openly and holding the business up in its own shameful colours  you will observe he said this is an injustice to my son if ever i have one  but that you are not likely to have said my lord  god knows says mr henry  and considering the cruel falseness of the position in which i stand to my brother and that you my lord are my father and have the right to command me i set my hand to this paper  but one thing i will say first  i have been ungenerously pushed and when next my lord you are tempted to compare your sons i call on you to remember what i have done and what he has done  acts are the fair test  my lord was the most uneasy man i ever saw even in his old face the blood came up  i think this is not a very wisely chosen moment henry for complaints said he  this takes away from the merit of your generosity  do not deceive yourself my lord said mr henry  this injustice is not done from generosity to him but in obedience to yourself  before strangers     begins my lord still more unhappily affected  there is no one but mackellar here said mr henry he is my friend  and my lord as you make him no stranger to your frequent blame it were hard if i must keep him one to a thing so rare as my defence  almost i believe my lord would have rescinded his decision but the master was on the watch  ah  henry henry says he you are the best of us still rugged and true  ah man i wish i was as good  and at that instance of his favourites generosity my lord desisted from his hesitation and the deed was signed  as soon as it could he brought about the land of ochterhall was sold for much below its value and the money paid over to our leech and sent by some private carriage into france  or so he said though i have suspected since it did not go so far  and now here was all the mans business brought to a successful head and his pockets once more bulging with our gold and yet the point for which we had consented to this sacrifice was still denied us and the visitor still lingered on at durrisdeer  whether in malice or because the time was not yet come for his adventure to the indies or because he had hopes of his design on mrs henry or from the orders of the government who shall say but linger he did and that for weeks  you will observe i say  from the orders of government for about this time the mans disreputable secret trickled out  the first hint i had was from a tenant who commented on the masters stay and yet more on his security for this tenant was a jacobitish sympathiser and had lost a son at culloden which gave him the more critical eye  there is one thing said he that i cannot but think strange and that is how he got to cockermouth  to cockermouth said i with a sudden memory of my first wonder on beholding the man disembark so pointdevice after so long a voyage  why yes says the tenant it was there he was picked up by captain crail  you thought he had come from france by sea  and so we all did  i turned this news a little in my head and then carried it to mr henry  here is an odd circumstance said i and told him  what matters how he came mackellar so long as he is here groans mr henry  no sir said i but think again  does not this smack a little of some government connivance  you know how much we have wondered already at the mans security  stop said mr henry  let me think of this  and as he thought there came that grim smile upon his face that was a little like the masters  give me paper said he  and he sat without another word and wrote to a gentleman of his acquaintance  i will name no unnecessary names but he was one in a high place  this letter i despatched by the only hand i could depend upon in such a case  macconochies and the old man rode hard for he was back with the reply before even my eagerness had ventured to expect him again as he read it mr henry had the same grim smile  this is the best you have done for me yet mackellar says he with this in my hand i will give him a shog  watch for us at dinner  at dinner accordingly mr henry proposed some very public appearance for the master and my lord as he had hoped objected to the danger of the course  oh says mr henry very easily you need no longer keep this up with me  i am as much in the secret as yourself  in the secret says my lord  what do you mean henry  i give you my word i am in no secret from which you are excluded  the master had changed countenance and i saw he was struck in a joint of his harness  how says mr henry turning to him with a huge appearance of surprise  i see you serve your masters very faithfully but i had thought you would have been humane enough to set your fathers mind at rest  what are you talking of  i refuse to have my business publicly discussed  i order this to cease cries the master very foolishly and passionately and indeed more like a child than a man  so much discretion was not looked for at your hands i can assure you continued mr henry  for see what my correspondent writes  unfolding the paper  it is of course in the interests both of the government and the gentleman whom we may perhaps best continue to call mr bally to keep this understanding secret but it was never meant his own family should continue to endure the suspense you paint so feelingly and i am pleased mine should be the hand to set these fears at rest  mr bally is as safe in great britain as yourself  is this possible cries my lord looking at his son with a great deal of wonder and still more of suspicion in his face  my dear father says the master already much recovered  i am overjoyed that this may be disclosed  my own instructions direct from london bore a very contrary sense and i was charged to keep the indulgence secret from every one yourself not excepted and indeed yourself expressly named  as i can show in black and white unless i have destroyed the letter  they must have changed their mind very swiftly for the whole matter is still quite fresh or rather henrys correspondent must have misconceived that part as he seems to have misconceived the rest  to tell you the truth sir he continued getting visibly more easy i had supposed this unexplained favour to a rebel was the effect of some application from yourself and the injunction to secrecy among my family the result of a desire on your part to conceal your kindness  hence i was the more careful to obey orders  it remains now to guess by what other channel indulgence can have flowed on so notorious an offender as myself for i do not think your son need defend himself from what seems hinted at in henrys letter  i have never yet heard of a durrisdeer who was a turncoat or a spy says he proudly  and so it seemed he had swum out of this danger unharmed but this was to reckon without a blunder he had made and without the pertinacity of mr henry who was now to show he had something of his brothers spirit  you say the matter is still fresh says mr henry  it is recent says the master with a fair show of stoutness and yet not without a quaver  is it so recent as that asks mr henry like a man a little puzzled and spreading his letter forth again  in all the letter there was no word as to the date but how was the master to know that  it seemed to come late enough for me says he with a laugh  and at the sound of that laugh which rang false like a cracked bell my lord looked at him again across the table and i saw his old lips draw together close  no said mr henry still glancing on his letter but i remember your expression  you said it was very fresh  and here we had a proof of our victory and the strongest instance yet of my lords incredible indulgence for what must he do but interfere to save his favourite from exposure  i think henry says he with a kind of pitiful eagerness i think we need dispute no more  we are all rejoiced at last to find your brother safe we are all at one on that and as grateful subjects we can do no less than drink to the kings health and bounty  thus was the master extricated but at least he had been put to his defence he had come lamely out and the attraction of his personal danger was now publicly plucked away from him  my lord in his heart of hearts now knew his favourite to be a government spy and mrs henry however she explained the tale was notably cold in her behaviour to the discredited hero of romance  thus in the best fabric of duplicity there is some weak point if you can strike it which will loosen all and if by this fortunate stroke we had not shaken the idol who can say how it might have gone with us at the catastrophe  and yet at the time we seemed to have accomplished nothing  before a day or two he had wiped off the illresults of his discomfiture and to all appearance stood as high as ever  as for my lord durrisdeer he was sunk in parental partiality it was not so much love which should be an active quality as an apathy and torpor of his other powers and forgiveness so to misapply a noble word flowed from him in sheer weakness like the tears of senility mrs henrys was a different case and heaven alone knows what he found to say to her or how he persuaded her from her contempt  it is one of the worst things of sentiment that the voice grows to be more important than the words and the speaker than that which is spoken  but some excuse the master must have found or perhaps he had even struck upon some art to wrest this exposure to his own advantage for after a time of coldness it seemed as if things went worse than ever between him and mrs henry  they were then constantly together  i would not be thought to cut one shadow of blame beyond what is due to a halfwilful blindness on that unfortunate lady but i do think in these last days she was playing very near the fire and whether i be wrong or not in that one thing is sure and quite sufficient  mr henry thought so  the poor gentleman sat for days in my room so great a picture of distress that i could never venture to address him yet it is to be thought he found some comfort even in my presence and the knowledge of my sympathy  there were times too when we talked and a strange manner of talk it was there was never a person named nor an individual circumstance referred to yet we had the same matter in our minds and we were each aware of it  it is a strange art that can thus be practised to talk for hours of a thing and never name nor yet so much as hint at it  and i remember i wondered if it was by some such natural skill that the master made love to mrs henry all day long as he manifestly did yet never startled her into reserve  to show how far affairs had gone with mr henry i will give some words of his uttered as i have cause not to forget upon the 26th of february 1757  it was unseasonable weather a cast back into winter  windless bitter cold the world all white with rime the sky low and gray  the sea black and silent like a quarryhole mr henry sat close by the fire and debated as was now common with him whether a man should do things whether interference was wise and the like general propositions which each of us particularly applied  i was by the window looking out when there passed below me the master mrs henry and miss katharine that now constant trio  the child was running to and fro delighted with the frost the master spoke close in the ladys ear with what seemed even from so far a devilish grace of insinuation and she on her part looked on the ground like a person lost in listening i broke out of my reserve  if i were you mr henry said i i would deal openly with my lord  mackellar mackellar said he you do not see the weakness of my ground  i can carry no such base thoughts to any one  to my father least of all that would be to fall into the bottom of his scorn  the weakness of my ground he continued lies in myself that i am not one who engages love  i have their gratitude they all tell me that i have a rich estate of it  but i am not present in their minds they are moved neither to think with me nor to think for me  there is my loss  he got to his feet and trod down the fire  but some method must be found mackellar said he looking at me suddenly over his shoulder some way must be found  i am a man of a great deal of patience  far too much  far too much  i begin to despise myself  and yet sure never was a man involved in such a toil  he fell back to his brooding  cheer up said i  it will burst of itself  i am far past anger now says he which had so little coherency with my own observation that i let both fall    chapter v  account of all that passed on the night on february 27th 1757    on the evening of the interview referred to the master went abroad he was abroad a great deal of the next day also that fatal 27th but where he went or what he did we never concerned ourselves to ask until next day  if we had done so and by any chance found out it might have changed all  but as all we did was done in ignorance and should be so judged i shall so narrate these passages as they appeared to us in the moment of their birth and reserve all that i since discovered for the time of its discovery  for i have now come to one of the dark parts of my narrative and must engage the readers indulgence for my patron  all the 27th that rigorous weather endured  a stifling cold the folk passing about like smoking chimneys the wide hearth in the hall piled high with fuel some of the spring birds that had already blundered north into our neighbourhood besieging the windows of the house or trotting on the frozen turf like things distracted  about noon there came a blink of sunshine showing a very pretty wintry frosty landscape of white hills and woods with crails lugger waiting for a wind under the craig head and the smoke mounting straight into the air from every farm and cottage  with the coming of night the haze closed in overhead it fell dark and still and starless and exceeding cold  a night the most unseasonable fit for strange events  mrs henry withdrew as was now her custom very early  we had set ourselves of late to pass the evening with a game of cards another mark that our visitor was wearying mightily of the life at durrisdeer and we had not been long at this when my old lord slipped from his place beside the fire and was off without a word to seek the warmth of bed  the three thus left together had neither love nor courtesy to share not one of us would have sat up one instant to oblige another yet from the influence of custom and as the cards had just been dealt we continued the form of playing out the round  i should say we were late sitters and though my lord had departed earlier than was his custom twelve was already gone some time upon the clock and the servants long ago in bed  another thing i should say that although i never saw the master anyway affected with liquor he had been drinking freely and was perhaps although he showed it not a trifle heated  anyway he now practised one of his transitions and so soon as the door closed behind my lord and without the smallest change of voice shifted from ordinary civil talk into a stream of insult  my dear henry it is yours to play he had been saying and now continued  it is a very strange thing how even in so small a matter as a game of cards you display your rusticity  you play jacob like a bonnet laird or a sailor in a tavern  the same dulness the same petty greed cette lenteur dhebete qui me fait rager it is strange i should have such a brother  even square toes has a certain vivacity when his stake is imperilled but the dreariness of a game with you i positively lack language to depict  mr henry continued to look at his cards as though very maturely considering some play but his mind was elsewhere  dear god will this never be done cries the master  quel lourdeau  but why do i trouble you with french expressions which are lost on such an ignoramus  a lourdeau my dear brother is as we might say a bumpkin a clown a clodpole  a fellow without grace lightness quickness any gift of pleasing any natural brilliancy  such a one as you shall see when you desire by looking in the mirror  i tell you these things for your good i assure you and besides squaretoes looking at me and stifling a yawn it is one of my diversions in this very dreary spot to toast you and your master at the fire like chestnuts  i have great pleasure in your case for i observe the nickname rustic as it is has always the power to make you writhe  but sometimes i have more trouble with this dear fellow here who seems to have gone to sleep upon his cards  do you not see the applicability of the epithet i have just explained dear henry  let me show you  for instance with all those solid qualities which i delight to recognise in you i never knew a woman who did not prefer me  nor i think he continued with the most silken deliberation i think  who did not continue to prefer me  mr henry laid down his cards  he rose to his feet very softly and seemed all the while like a person in deep thought  you coward he said gently as if to himself  and then with neither hurry nor any particular violence he struck the master in the mouth  the master sprang to his feet like one transfigured i had never seen the man so beautiful  a blow he cried  i would not take a blow from god almighty  lower your voice said mr henry  do you wish my father to interfere for you again  gentlemen gentlemen i cried and sought to come between them  the master caught me by the shoulder held me at arms length and still addressing his brother  do you know what this means said he  it was the most deliberate act of my life says mr henry  i must have blood i must have blood for this says the master  please god it shall be yours said mr henry and he went to the wall and took down a pair of swords that hung there with others naked  these he presented to the master by the points  mackellar shall see us play fair said mr henry  i think it very needful  you need insult me no more said the master taking one of the swords at random  i have hated you all my life  my father is but newly gone to bed said mr henry  we must go somewhere forth of the house  there is an excellent place in the long shrubbery said the master  gentlemen said i shame upon you both  sons of the same mother would you turn against the life she gave you  even so mackellar said mr henry with the same perfect quietude of manner he had shown throughout  it is what i will prevent said i  and now here is a blot upon my life  at these words of mine the master turned his blade against my bosom i saw the light run along the steel and i threw up my arms and fell to my knees before him on the floor  no no i cried like a baby  we shall have no more trouble with him said the master  it is a good thing to have a coward in the house  we must have light said mr henry as though there had been no interruption  this trembler can bring a pair of candles said the master  to my shame be it said i was still so blinded with the flashing of that bare sword that i volunteered to bring a lantern  we do not need a lllantern says the master mocking me there is no breath of air  come get to your feet take a pair of lights and go before  i am close behind with this   making the blade glitter as he spoke  i took up the candlesticks and went before them steps that i would give my hand to recall but a coward is a slave at the best and even as i went my teeth smote each other in my mouth  it was as he had said  there was no breath stirring a windless stricture of frost had bound the air and as we went forth in the shine of the candles the blackness was like a roof over our heads  never a word was said there was never a sound but the creaking of our steps along the frozen path  the cold of the night fell about me like a bucket of water i shook as i went with more than terror but my companions bareheaded like myself and fresh from the warm ball appeared not even conscious of the change  here is the place said the master  set down the candles  i did as he bid me and presently the flames went up as steady as in a chamber in the midst of the frosted trees and i beheld these two brothers take their places  the light is something in my eyes said the master  i will give you every advantage replied mr henry shifting his ground for i think you are about to die  he spoke rather sadly than otherwise yet there was a ring in his voice  henry durie said the master two words before i begin  you are a fencer you can hold a foil you little know what a change it makes to hold a sword  and by that i know you are to fall  but see how strong is my situation  if you fall i shift out of this country to where my money is before me  if i fall where are you my father your wife  who is in love with me as you very well know  your child even who prefers me to yourself how will these avenge me  had you thought of that dear henry  he looked at his brother with a smile then made a fencingroom salute  never a word said mr henry but saluted too and the swords rang together  i am no judge of the play my head besides was gone with cold and fear and horror but it seems that mr henry took and kept the upper hand from the engagement crowding in upon his foe with a contained and glowing fury  nearer and nearer he crept upon the man till of a sudden the master leaped back with a little sobbing oath and i believe the movement brought the light once more against his eyes  to it they went again on the fresh ground but now methought closer mr henry pressing more outrageously the master beyond doubt with shaken confidence  for it is beyond doubt he now recognised himself for lost and had some taste of the cold agony of fear or he had never attempted the foul stroke  i cannot say i followed it my untrained eye was never quick enough to seize details but it appears he caught his brothers blade with his left hand a practice not permitted  certainly mr henry only saved himself by leaping on one side as certainly the master lunging in the air stumbled on his knee and before he could move the sword was through his body  i cried out with a stifled scream and ran in but the body was already fallen to the ground where it writhed a moment like a trodden worm and then lay motionless  look at his left hand said mr henry  it is all bloody said i  on the inside said he  it is cut on the inside said i  i thought so said he and turned his back  i opened the mans clothes the heart was quite still it gave not a flutter  god forgive us mr henry said i  he is dead  dead he repeated a little stupidly and then with a rising tone dead dead says he and suddenly cast his bloody sword upon the ground  what must we do said i  be yourself sir  it is too late now you must be yourself  he turned and stared at me  oh mackellar says he and put his face in his hands  i plucked him by the coat  for gods sake for all our sakes be more courageous said i  what must we do  he showed me his face with the same stupid stare  do says he   and with that his eye fell on the body and oh he cries out with his hand to his brow as if he had never remembered and turning from me made off towards the house of durrisdeer at a strange stumbling run  i stood a moment mused then it seemed to me my duty lay most plain on the side of the living and i ran after him leaving the candles on the frosty ground and the body lying in their light under the trees  but run as i pleased he had the start of me and was got into the house and up to the hall where i found him standing before the fire with his face once more in his hands and as he so stood he visibly shuddered  mr henry mr henry i said this will be the ruin of us all  what is this that i have done cries he and then looking upon me with a countenance that i shall never forget who is to tell the old man he said  the word knocked at my heart but it was no time for weakness  i went and poured him out a glass of brandy  drink that said i drink it down  i forced him to swallow it like a child and being still perished with the cold of the night i followed his example  it has to be told mackellar said he  it must be told  and he fell suddenly in a seat  my old lords seat by the chimneyside  and was shaken with dry sobs  dismay came upon my soul it was plain there was no help in mr henry  well said i sit there and leave all to me  and taking a candle in my hand i set forth out of the room in the dark house  there was no movement i must suppose that all had gone unobserved and i was now to consider how to smuggle through the rest with the like secrecy  it was no hour for scruples and i opened my ladys door without so much as a knock and passed boldly in  there is some calamity happened she cried sitting up in bed  madam said i i will go forth again into the passage and do you get as quickly as you can into your clothes  there is much to be done  she troubled me with no questions nor did she keep me waiting ere i had time to prepare a word of that which i must say to her she was on the threshold signing me to enter  madam said i if you cannot be very brave i must go elsewhere for if no one helps me tonight there is an end of the house of durrisdeer  i am very courageous said she and she looked at me with a sort of smile very painful to see but very brave too  it has come to a duel said i  a duel she repeated  a duel  henry and    and the master said i  things have been borne so long things of which you know nothing which you would not believe if i should tell  but tonight it went too far and when he insulted you    stop said she  he  who  oh madam cried i my bitterness breaking forth do you ask me such a question  indeed then i may go elsewhere for help there is none here  i do not know in what i have offended you said she  forgive me put me out of this suspense  but i dared not tell her yet i felt not sure of her and at the doubt and under the sense of impotence it brought with it i turned on the poor woman with something near to anger  madam said i we are speaking of two men  one of them insulted you and you ask me which  i will help you to the answer  with one of these men you have spent all your hours  has the other reproached you  to one you have been always kind to the other as god sees me and judges between us two i think not always  has his love ever failed you  tonight one of these two men told the other in my hearing  the hearing of a hired stranger  that you were in love with him  before i say one word you shall answer your own question  which was it  nay madam you shall answer me another  if it has come to this dreadful end whose fault is it  she stared at me like one dazzled  good god she said once in a kind of bursting exclamation and then a second time in a whisper to herself  great god  in the name of mercy mackellar what is wrong she cried  i am made up i can hear all  you are not fit to hear said i  whatever it was you shall say first it was your fault  oh she cried with a gesture of wringing her hands this man will drive me mad  can you not put me out of your thoughts  i think not once of you i cried  i think of none but my dear unhappy master  ah she cried with her hand to her heart is henry dead  lower your voice said i  the other  i saw her sway like something stricken by the wind and i know not whether in cowardice or misery turned aside and looked upon the floor  these are dreadful tidings said i at length when her silence began to put me in some fear and you and i behove to be the more bold if the house is to be saved  still she answered nothing  there is miss katharine besides i added  unless we bring this matter through her inheritance is like to be of shame  i do not know if it was the thought of her child or the naked word shame that gave her deliverance at least i had no sooner spoken than a sound passed her lips the like of it i never heard it was as though she had lain buried under a hill and sought to move that burthen  and the next moment she had found a sort of voice  it was a fight she whispered  it was not   and she paused upon the word  it was a fair fight on my dear masters part said i  as for the other he was slain in the very act of a foul stroke  not now she cried  madam said i hatred of that man glows in my bosom like a burning fire ay even now he is dead  god knows i would have stopped the fighting had i dared  it is my shame i did not  but when i saw him fall if i could have spared one thought from pitying of my master it had been to exult in that deliverance  i do not know if she marked but her next words were my lord  that shall be my part said i  you will not speak to him as you have to me she asked  madam said i have you not some one else to think of  leave my lord to me  some one else she repeated  your husband said i  she looked at me with a countenance illegible  are you going to turn your back on him i asked  still she looked at me then her hand went to her heart again no said she  god bless you for that word i said  go to him now where he sits in the hall speak to him  it matters not what you say give him your hand say i know all  if god gives you grace enough say forgive me  god strengthen you and make you merciful said she  i will go to my husband  let me light you there said i taking up the candle  i will find my way in the dark she said with a shudder and i think the shudder was at me  so we separated  she down stairs to where a little light glimmered in the halldoor i along the passage to my lords room  it seems hard to say why but i could not burst in on the old man as i could on the young woman with whatever reluctance i must knock  but his old slumbers were light or perhaps he slept not and at the first summons i was bidden enter  he too sat up in bed very aged and bloodless he looked and whereas he had a certain largeness of appearance when dressed for daylight he now seemed frail and little and his face the wig being laid aside not bigger than a childs  this daunted me nor less the haggard surmise of misfortune in his eye  yet his voice was even peaceful as he inquired my errand  i set my candle down upon a chair leaned on the bedfoot and looked at him  lord durrisdeer said i it is very well known to you that i am a partisan in your family  i hope we are none of us partisans said he  that you love my son sincerely i have always been glad to recognise  oh my lord we are past the hour of these civilities i replied if we are to save anything out of the fire we must look the fact in its bare countenance  a partisan i am partisans we have all been it is as a partisan that i am here in the middle of the night to plead before you  hear me before i go i will tell you why  i would always hear you mr mackellar said he and that at any hour whether of the day or night for i would be always sure you had a reason  you spoke once before to very proper purpose i have not forgotten that  i am here to plead the cause of my master i said  i need not tell you how he acts  you know how he is placed  you know with what generosity he has always met your other  met your wishes i corrected myself stumbling at that name of son  you know  you must know  what he has suffered  what he has suffered about his wife  mr mackellar cried my lord rising in bed like a bearded lion  you said you would hear me i continued  what you do not know what you should know one of the things i am here to speak of is the persecution he must bear in private  your back is not turned before one whom i dare not name to you falls upon him with the most unfeeling taunts twits him  pardon me my lord  twits him with your partiality calls him jacob calls him clown pursues him with ungenerous raillery not to be borne by man  and let but one of you appear instantly he changes and my master must smile and courtesy to the man who has been feeding him with insults i know for i have shared in some of it and i tell you the life is insupportable  all these months it has endured it began with the mans landing it was by the name of jacob that my master was greeted the first night  my lord made a movement as if to throw aside the clothes and rise if there be any truth in this   said he  do i look like a man lying i interrupted checking him with my hand  you should have told me at first he odd  ah my lord indeed i should and you may well hate the face of this unfaithful servant i cried  i will take order said he at once  and again made the movement to rise  again i checked him  i have not done said i  would god i had all this my dear unfortunate patron has endured without help or countenance  your own best word my lord was only gratitude  oh but he was your son too  he had no other father  he was hated in the country god knows how unjustly  he had a loveless marriage he stood on all hands without affection or support  dear generous illfated noble heart  your tears do you much honour and me much shame says my lord with a palsied trembling  but you do me some injustice  henry has been ever dear to me very dear  james i do not deny it mr mackellar james is perhaps dearer you have not seen my james in quite a favourable light he has suffered under his misfortunes and we can only remember how great and how unmerited these were and even now his is the more affectionate nature  but i will not speak of him  all that you say of henry is most true i do not wonder i know him to be very magnanimous you will say i trade upon the knowledge  it is possible there are dangerous virtues virtues that tempt the encroacher  mr mackellar i will make it up to him i will take order with all this  i have been weak and what is worse i have been dull  i must not hear you blame yourself my lord with that which i have yet to tell upon my conscience i replied  you have not been weak you have been abused by a devilish dissembler  you saw yourself how he had deceived you in the matter of his danger he has deceived you throughout in every step of his career  i wish to pluck him from your heart i wish to force your eyes upon your other son ah you have a son there  no no said he two sons  i have two sons  i made some gesture of despair that struck him he looked at me with a changed face  there is much worse behind he asked his voice dying as it rose upon the question  much worse i answered  this night he said these words to mr henry  i have never known a woman who did not prefer me to you and i think who did not continue to prefer me  i will hear nothing against my daughter he cried and from his readiness to stop me in this direction i conclude his eyes were not so dull as i had fancied and he had looked not without anxiety upon the siege of mrs henry  i think not of blaming her cried i  it is not that  these words were said in my hearing to mr henry and if you find them not yet plain enough these others but a little after  your wife who is in love with me  they have quarrelled he said  i nodded  i must fly to them he said beginning once again to leave his bed  no no i cried holding forth my hands  you do not know said he  these are dangerous words  will nothing make you understand my lord said i  his eyes besought me for the truth  i flung myself on my knees by the bedside  oh my lord cried i think on him you have left think of this poor sinner whom you begot whom your wife bore to you whom we have none of us strengthened as we could think of him not of yourself he is the other sufferer  think of him  that is the door for sorrow  christs door gods door  oh it stands open  think of him even as he thought of you  who is to tell the old man  these were his words  it was for that i came that is why i am here pleading at your feet  let me get up he cried thrusting me aside and was on his feet before myself  his voice shook like a sail in the wind yet he spoke with a good loudness his face was like the snow but his eyes were steady and dry  here is too much speech said he  where was it  in the shrubbery said i  and mr henry he asked  and when i had told him he knotted his old face in thought  and mr james says he  i have left him lying said i beside the candles  candles he cried  and with that he ran to the window opened it and looked abroad  it might be spied from the road  where none goes by at such an hour i objected  it makes no matter he said  one might  hark cries he what is that  it was the sound of men very guardedly rowing in the bay and i told him so  the freetraders said my lord  run at once mackellar put these candles out  i will dress in the meanwhile and when you return we can debate on what is wisest  i groped my way downstairs and out at the door  from quite a far way off a sheen was visible making points of brightness in the shrubbery in so black a night it might have been remarked for miles and i blamed myself bitterly for my incaution  how much more sharply when i reached the place  one of the candlesticks was overthrown and that taper quenched  the other burned steadily by itself and made a broad space of light upon the frosted ground all within that circle seemed by the force of contrast and the overhanging blackness brighter than by day  and there was the bloodstain in the midst and a little farther off mr henrys sword the pommel of which was of silver but of the body not a trace  my heart thumped upon my ribs the hair stirred upon my scalp as i stood there staring  so strange was the sight so dire the fears it wakened  i looked right and left the ground was so hard it told no story  i stood and listened till my ears ached but the night was hollow about me like an empty church not even a ripple stirred upon the shore it seemed you might have heard a pin drop in the county  i put the candle out and the blackness fell about me groping dark it was like a crowd surrounding me and i went back to the house of durrisdeer with my chin upon my shoulder startling as i went with craven suppositions  in the door a figure moved to meet me and i had near screamed with terror ere i recognised mrs henry  have you told him says she  it was he who sent me said i  it is gone  but why are you here  it is gone she repeated  what is gone  the body said i  why are you not with your husband  gone said she  you cannot have looked  come back  there is no light now said i  i dare not  i can see in the dark  i have been standing here so long  so long said she  come give me your hand  we returned to the shrubbery hand in hand and to the fatal place  take care of the blood said i  blood she cried and started violently back  i suppose it will be said i  i am like a blind man  no said she nothing  have you not dreamed  ah would to god we had cried i  she spied the sword picked it up and seeing the blood let it fall again with her hands thrown wide  ah she cried  and then with an instant courage handled it the second time and thrust it to the hilt into the frozen ground  i will take it back and clean it properly says she and again looked about her on all sides it cannot be that he was dead she added  there was no flutter of his heart said i and then remembering why are you not with your husband  it is no use said she he will not speak to me  not speak to you i repeated  oh you have not tried  you have a right to doubt me she replied with a gentle dignity  at this for the first time i was seized with sorrow for her god knows madam i cried god knows i am not so hard as i appear on this dreadful night who can veneer his words  but i am a friend to all who are not henry duries enemies  it is hard then you should hesitate about his wife said she  i saw all at once like the rending of a veil how nobly she had borne this unnatural calamity and how generously my reproaches  we must go back and tell this to my lord said i  him i cannot face she cried  you will find him the least moved of all of us said i  and yet i cannot face him said she  well said i you can return to mr henry i will see my lord  as we walked back i bearing the candlesticks she the sword  a strange burthen for that woman  she had another thought  should we tell henry she asked  let my lord decide said i  my lord was nearly dressed when i came to his chamber  he heard me with a frown  the freetraders said he  but whether dead or alive  i thought him   said i and paused ashamed of the word  i know but you may very well have been in error  why should they remove him if not living he asked  oh here is a great door of hope  it must be given out that he departed  as he came  without any note of preparation  we must save all scandal  i saw he had fallen like the rest of us to think mainly of the house  now that all the living members of the family were plunged in irremediable sorrow it was strange how we turned to that conjoint abstraction of the family itself and sought to bolster up the airy nothing of its reputation  not the duries only but the hired steward himself  are we to tell mr henry i asked him  i will see said he  i am going first to visit him then i go forth with you to view the shrubbery and consider  we went downstairs into the hall  mr henry sat by the table with his head upon his hand like a man of stone  his wife stood a little back from him her hand at her mouth it was plain she could not move him  my old lord walked very steadily to where his son was sitting he had a steady countenance too but methought a little cold  when he was come quite up he held out both his hands and said my son  with a broken strangled cry mr henry leaped up and fell on his fathers neck crying and weeping the most pitiful sight that ever a man witnessed  oh father he cried you know i loved him you know i loved him in the beginning i could have died for him  you know that  i would have given my life for him and you  oh say you know that  oh say you can forgive me  o father father what have i done  what have i done  and we used to be bairns together and wept and sobbed and fondled the old man and clutched him about the neck with the passion of a child in terror  and then he caught sight of his wife you would have thought for the first time where she stood weeping to hear him and in a moment had fallen at her knees  and o my lass he cried you must forgive me too  not your husband  i have only been the ruin of your life  but you knew me when i was a lad there was no harm in henry durie then he meant aye to be a friend to you  its him  its the old bairn that played with you  oh can ye never never forgive him  throughout all this my lord was like a cold kind spectator with his wits about him  at the first cry which was indeed enough to call the house about us he had said to me over his shoulder close the door  and now he nodded to himself  we may leave him to his wife now says he  bring a light mr mackellar  upon my going forth again with my lord i was aware of a strange phenomenon for though it was quite dark and the night not yet old methought i smelt the morning  at the same time there went a tossing through the branches of the evergreens so that they sounded like a quiet sea and the air pulled at times against our faces and the flame of the candle shook  we made the more speed i believe being surrounded by this bustle visited the scene of the duel where my lord looked upon the blood with stoicism and passing farther on toward the landingplace came at last upon some evidences of the truth  for first of all where there was a pool across the path the ice had been trodden in plainly by more than one mans weight next and but a little farther a young tree was broken and down by the landingplace where the traders boats were usually beached another stain of blood marked where the body must have been infallibly set down to rest the bearers  this stain we set ourselves to wash away with the seawater carrying it in my lords hat and as we were thus engaged there came up a sudden moaning gust and left us instantly benighted  it will come to snow says my lord and the best thing that we could hope  let us go back now we can do nothing in the dark  as we went houseward the wind being again subsided we were aware of a strong pattering noise about us in the night and when we issued from the shelter of the trees we found it raining smartly  throughout the whole of this my lords clearness of mind no less than his activity of body had not ceased to minister to my amazement  he set the crown upon it in the council we held on our return  the freetraders had certainly secured the master though whether dead or alive we were still left to our conjectures the rain would long before day wipe out all marks of the transaction by this we must profit  the master had unexpectedly come after the fall of night it must now he given out he had as suddenly departed before the break of day and to make all this plausible it now only remained for me to mount into the mans chamber and pack and conceal his baggage  true we still lay at the discretion of the traders but that was the incurable weakness of our guilt  i heard him as i said with wonder and hastened to obey  mr and mrs henry were gone from the hall my lord for warmths sake hurried to his bed there was still no sign of stir among the servants and as i went up the tower stair and entered the dead mans room a horror of solitude weighed upon my mind  to my extreme surprise it was all in the disorder of departure  of his three portmanteaux two were already locked the third lay open and near full  at once there flashed upon me some suspicion of the truth  the man had been going after all he had but waited upon crail as crail waited upon the wind early in the night the seamen had perceived the weather changing the boat had come to give notice of the change and call the passenger aboard and the boats crew had stumbled on him dying in his blood  nay and there was more behind  this prearranged departure shed some light upon his inconceivable insult of the night before it was a parting shot hatred being no longer checked by policy  and for another thing the nature of that insult and the conduct of mrs henry pointed to one conclusion which i have never verified and can now never verify until the great assize  the conclusion that he had at last forgotten himself had gone too far in his advances and had been rebuffed  it can never be verified as i say but as i thought of it that morning among his baggage the thought was sweet to me like honey  into the open portmanteau i dipped a little ere i closed it  the most beautiful lace and linen many suits of those fine plain clothes in which he loved to appear a book or two and those of the best caesars commentaries a volume of mr hobbes the henriade of m de voltaire a book upon the indies one on the mathematics far beyond where i have studied  these were what i observed with very mingled feelings  but in the open portmanteau no papers of any description  this set me musing  it was possible the man was dead but since the traders had carried him away not likely  it was possible he might still die of his wound but it was also possible he might not  and in this latter case i was determined to have the means of some defence  one after another i carried his portmanteaux to a loft in the top of the house which we kept locked went to my own room for my keys and returning to the loft had the gratification to find two that fitted pretty well  in one of the portmanteaux there was a shagreen lettercase which i cut open with my knife and thenceforth so far as any credit went the man was at my mercy here was a vast deal of gallant correspondence chiefly of his paris days and what was more to the purpose here were the copies of his own reports to the english secretary and the originals of the secretarys answers  a most damning series  such as to publish would be to wreck the masters honour and to set a price upon his life  i chuckled to myself as i ran through the documents i rubbed my hands i sang aloud in my glee  day found me at the pleasing task nor did i then remit my diligence except in so far as i went to the window  looked out for a moment to see the frost quite gone the world turned black again and the rain and the wind driving in the bay  and to assure myself that the lugger was gone from its anchorage and the master whether dead or alive now tumbling on the irish sea  it is proper i should add in this place the very little i have subsequently angled out upon the doings of that night  it took me a long while to gather it for we dared not openly ask and the freetraders regarded me with enmity if not with scorn  it was near six months before we even knew for certain that the man survived and it was years before i learned from one of crails men turned publican on his illgotten gain some particulars which smack to me of truth  it seems the traders found the master struggled on one elbow and now staring round him and now gazing at the candle or at his hand which was all bloodied like a man stupid  upon their coming he would seem to have found his mind bade them carry him aboard and hold their tongues and on the captain asking how he had come in such a pickle replied with a burst of passionate swearing and incontinently fainted  they held some debate but they were momently looking for a wind they were highly paid to smuggle him to france and did not care to delay besides which he was well enough liked by these abominable wretches  they supposed him under capital sentence knew not in what mischief he might have got his wound and judged it a piece of good nature to remove him out of the way of danger  so he was taken aboard recovered on the passage over and was set ashore a convalescent at the havre de grace  what is truly notable  he said not a word to anyone of the duel and not a trader knows to this day in what quarrel or by the hand of what adversary he fell  with any other man i should have set this down to natural decency with him to pride  he could not bear to avow perhaps even to himself that he had been vanquished by one whom he had so much insulted whom he so cruelly despised    chapter vi  summary of events during the masters second absence    of the heavy sickness which declared itself next morning i can think with equanimity as of the last unmingled trouble that befell my master and even that was perhaps a mercy in disguise for what pains of the body could equal the miseries of his mind  mrs henry and i had the watching by the bed  my old lord called from time to time to take the news but would not usually pass the door  once i remember when hope was nigh gone he stepped to the bedside looked awhile in his sons face and turned away with a gesture of the head and hand thrown up that remains upon my mind as something tragic such grief and such a scorn of sublunary things were there expressed  but the most of the time mrs henry and i had the room to ourselves taking turns by night and bearing each other company by day for it was dreary watching  mr henry his shaven head bound in a napkin tossed fro without remission beating the bed with his hands  his tongue never lay his voice ran continuously like a river so that my heart was weary with the sound of it  it was notable and to me inexpressibly mortifying that he spoke all the while on matters of no import  comings and goings horses  which he was ever calling to have saddled thinking perhaps the poor soul that he might ride away from his discomfort  matters of the garden the salmon nets and what i particularly raged to hear continually of his affairs cyphering figures and holding disputation with the tenantry  never a word of his father or his wife nor of the master save only for a day or two when his mind dwelled entirely in the past and he supposed himself a boy again and upon some innocent childs play with his brother  what made this the more affecting  it appeared the master had then run some peril of his life for there was a cry  oh  jamie will be drowned  oh save jamie which he came over and over with a great deal of passion  this i say was affecting both to mrs henry and myself but the balance of my masters wanderings did him little justice  it seemed he had set out to justify his brothers calumnies as though he was bent to prove himself a man of a dry nature immersed in moneygetting  had i been there alone i would not have troubled my thumb but all the while as i listened i was estimating the effect on the mans wife and telling myself that he fell lower every day  i was the one person on the surface of the globe that comprehended him and i was bound there should be yet another whether he was to die there and his virtues perish  or whether he should save his days and come back to that inheritance of sorrows his right memory  i was bound he should be heartily lamented in the one case and unaffectedly welcomed in the other by the person he loved the most his wife  finding no occasion of free speech i bethought me at last of a kind of documentary disclosure and for some nights when i was off duty and should have been asleep i gave my time to the preparation of that which i may call my budget  but this i found to be the easiest portion of my task and that which remained  namely the presentation to my lady  almost more than i had fortitude to overtake  several days i went about with my papers under my arm spying for some juncture of talk to serve as introduction  i will not deny but that some offered only when they did my tongue clove to the roof of my mouth and i think i might have been carrying about my packet till this day had not a fortunate accident delivered me from all my hesitations  this was at night when i was once more leaving the room the thing not yet done and myself in despair at my own cowardice  what do you carry about with you mr mackellar she asked these last days i see you always coming in and out with the same armful  i returned upon my steps without a word laid the papers before her on the table and left her to her reading  of what that was i am now to give you some idea and the best will be to reproduce a letter of my own which came first in the budget and of which according to an excellent habitude i have preserved the scroll it will show too the moderation of my part in these affairs a thing which some have called recklessly in question   durrisdeer 1757  honoured madam  i trust i would not step out of my place without occasion but i see how much evil has flowed in the past to all of your noble house from that unhappy and secretive fault of reticency and the papers on which i venture to call your attention are family papers and all highly worthy your acquaintance  i append a schedule with some necessary observations and am honoured madam your ladyships obliged obedient servant ephraim mackellar   schedule of papers  a  scroll of ten letters from ephraim mackellar to the hon james durie esq by courtesy master of ballantrae during the latters residence in paris  under dates     follow the dates    nota  to be read in connection with b and c  b  seven original letters from the said mr of ballantrae to the said e mackellar under dates     follow the dates  c  three original letters from the mr of ballantrae to the hon henry durie esq under dates     follow the dates    nota  given me by mr henry to answer  copies of my answers a 4 a 5 and a 9 of these productions  the purport of mr henrys communications of which i can find no scroll may be gathered from those of his unnatural brother  d  a correspondence original and scroll extending over a period of three years till january of the current year between the said mr of ballantrae and   under secretary of state twentyseven in all  nota  found among the masters papers   weary as i was with watching and distress of mind it was impossible for me to sleep  all night long i walked in my chamber revolving what should be the issue and sometimes repenting the temerity of my immixture in affairs so private and with the first peep of the morning i was at the sickroom door  mrs henry had thrown open the shutters and even the window for the temperature was mild  she looked steadfastly before her where was nothing to see or only the blue of the morning creeping among woods  upon the stir of my entrance she did not so much as turn about her face a circumstance from which i augured very ill  madam i began and then again madam but could make no more of it  nor yet did mrs henry come to my assistance with a word in this pass i began gathering up the papers where they lay scattered on the table and the first thing that struck me their bulk appeared to have diminished  once i ran them through and twice but the correspondence with the secretary of state on which i had reckoned so much against the future was nowhere to be found i looked in the chimney amid the smouldering embers black ashes of paper fluttered in the draught and at that my timidity vanished  good god madam cried i in a voice not fitting for a sickroom good god madam what have you done with my papers  i have burned them said mrs henry turning about  it is enough it is too much that you and i have seen them  this is a fine nights work that you have done cried i  and all to save the reputation of a man that ate bread by the shedding of his comrades blood as i do by the shedding of ink  to save the reputation of that family in which you are a servant mr mackellar she returned and for which you have already done so much  it is a family i will not serve much longer i cried for i am driven desperate  you have stricken the sword out of my hands you have left us all defenceless  i had always these letters i could shake over his head and now  what is to do  we are so falsely situate we dare not show the man the door the country would fly on fire against us and i had this one hold upon him  and now it is gone  now he may come back tomorrow and we must all sit down with him to dinner go for a stroll with him on the terrace or take a hand at cards of all things to divert his leisure  no madam  god forgive you if he can find it in his heart for i cannot find it in mine  i wonder to find you so simple mr mackellar said mrs henry what does this man value reputation  but he knows how high we prize it he knows we would rather die than make these letters public and do you suppose he would not trade upon the knowledge what you call your sword mr mackellar and which had been one indeed against a man of any remnant of propriety would have been but a sword of paper against him  he would smile in your face at such a threat  he stands upon his degradation he makes that his strength it is in vain to struggle with such characters  she cried out this last a little desperately and then with more quiet no mr mackellar i have thought upon this matter all night and there is no way out of it  papers or no papers the door of this house stands open for him he is the rightful heir forsooth  if we sought to exclude him all would redound against poor henry and i should see him stoned again upon the streets  ah if henry dies it is a different matter  they have broke the entail for their own good purposes the estate goes to my daughter and i shall see who sets a foot upon it  but if henry lives my poor mr mackellar and that man returns we must suffer  only this time it will be together  on the whole i was well pleased with mrs henrys attitude of mind nor could i even deny there was some cogency in that which she advanced about the papers  let us say no more about it said i  i can only be sorry i trusted a lady with the originals which was an unbusinesslike proceeding at the best  as for what i said of leaving the service of the family it was spoken with the tongue only and you may set your mind at rest  i belong to durrisdeer mrs henry as if i had been born there  i must do her the justice to say she seemed perfectly relieved so that we began this morning as we were to continue for so many years on a proper ground of mutual indulgence and respect  the same day which was certainly prededicate to joy we observed the first signal of recovery in mr henry and about three of the following afternoon he found his mind again recognising me by name with the strongest evidences of affection  mrs henry was also in the room at the bedfoot but it did not appear that he observed her  and indeed the fever being gone he was so weak that he made but the one effort and sank again into lethargy  the course of his restoration was now slow but equal every day his appetite improved every week we were able to remark an increase both of strength and flesh and before the end of the month he was out of bed and had even begun to be carried in his chair upon the terrace  it was perhaps at this time that mrs henry and i were the most uneasy in mind  apprehension for his days was at an end and a worse fear succeeded  every day we drew consciously nearer to a day of reckoning and the days passed on and still there was nothing  mr  henry bettered in strength he held long talks with us on a great diversity of subjects his father came and sat with him and went again and still there was no reference to the late tragedy or to the former troubles which had brought it on  did he remember and conceal his dreadful knowledge or was the whole blotted from his mind  this was the problem that kept us watching and trembling all day when we were in his company and held us awake at night when we were in our lonely beds  we knew not even which alternative to hope for both appearing so unnatural and pointing so directly to an unsound brain  once this fear offered i observed his conduct with sedulous particularity  something of the child he exhibited  a cheerfulness quite foreign to his previous character an interest readily aroused and then very tenacious in small matters which he had heretofore despised  when he was stricken down i was his only confidant and i may say his only friend and he was on terms of division with his wife upon his recovery all was changed the past forgotten the wife first and even single in his thoughts  he turned to her with all his emotions like a child to its mother and seemed secure of sympathy called her in all his needs with something of that querulous familiarity that marks a certainty of indulgence and i must say in justice to the woman he was never disappointed  to her indeed this changed behaviour was inexpressibly affecting and i think she felt it secretly as a reproach so that i have seen her in early days escape out of the room that she might indulge herself in weeping  but to me the change appeared not natural and viewing it along with all the rest i began to wonder with many headshakings whether his reason were perfectly erect  as this doubt stretched over many years endured indeed until my masters death and clouded all our subsequent relations i may well consider of it more at large  when he was able to resume some charge of his affairs i had many opportunities to try him with precision  there was no lack of understanding nor yet of authority but the old continuous interest had quite departed he grew readily fatigued and fell to yawning and he carried into money relations where it is certainly out of place a facility that bordered upon slackness  true since we had no longer the exactions of the master to contend against there was the less occasion to raise strictness into principle or do battle for a farthing  true again there was nothing excessive in these relaxations or i would have been no party to them  but the whole thing marked a change very slight yet very perceptible and though no man could say my master had gone at all out of his mind no man could deny that he had drifted from his character  it was the same to the end with his manner and appearance  some of the heat of the fever lingered in his veins  his movements a little hurried his speech notably more voluble yet neither truly amiss  his whole mind stood open to happy impressions welcoming these and making much of them but the smallest suggestion of trouble or sorrow he received with visible impatience and dismissed again with immediate relief  it was to this temper that he owed the felicity of his later days and yet here it was if anywhere that you could call the man insane  a great part of this life consists in contemplating what we cannot cure but mr henry if he could not dismiss solicitude by an effort of the mind must instantly and at whatever cost annihilate the cause of it so that he played alternately the ostrich and the bull  it is to this strenuous cowardice of pain that i have to set down all the unfortunate and excessive steps of his subsequent career  certainly this was the reason of his beating mcmanus the groom a thing so much out of all his former practice and which awakened so much comment at the time  it is to this again that i must lay the total lose of near upon two hundred pounds more than the half of which i could have saved if his impatience would have suffered me  but he preferred loss or any desperate extreme to a continuance of mental suffering  all this has led me far from our immediate trouble  whether he remembered or had forgotten his late dreadful act and if he remembered in what light he viewed it  the truth burst upon us suddenly and was indeed one of the chief surprises of my life  he had been several times abroad and was now beginning to walk a little with an arm when it chanced i should be left alone with him upon the terrace  he turned to me with a singular furtive smile such as schoolboys use when in fault and says he in a private whisper and without the least preface  where have you buried him  i could not make one sound in answer  where have you buried him he repeated  i want to see his grave  i conceived i had best take the bull by the horns  mr henry said i i have news to give that will rejoice you exceedingly  in all human likelihood your hands are clear of blood  i reason from certain indices and by these it should appear your brother was not dead but was carried in a swound on board the lugger  but now he may be perfectly recovered  what there was in his countenance i could not read  james he asked  your brother james i answered  i would not raise a hope that may be found deceptive but in my heart i think it very probable he is alive  ah says mr henry and suddenly rising from his seat with more alacrity than he had yet discovered set one finger on my breast and cried at me in a kind of screaming whisper mackellar  these were his words  nothing can kill that man  he is not mortal  he is bound upon my back to all eternity  to all eternity says he and sitting down again fell upon a stubborn silence  a day or two after with the same secret smile and first looking about as if to be sure we were alone mackellar said he when you have any intelligence be sure and let me know  we must keep an eye upon him or he will take us when we least expect  he will not show face here again said i  oh yes he will said mr henry  wherever i am there will he be  and again he looked all about him  you must not dwell upon this thought mr henry said i  no said he that is a very good advice  we will never think of it except when you have news  and we do not know yet he added he may be dead  the manner of his saying this convinced me thoroughly of what i had scarce ventured to suspect  that so far from suffering any penitence for the attempt he did but lament his failure  this was a discovery i kept to myself fearing it might do him a prejudice with his wife  but i might have saved myself the trouble she had divined it for herself and found the sentiment quite natural indeed i could not but say that there were three of us all of the same mind nor could any news have reached durrisdeer more generally welcome than tidings of the masters death  this brings me to speak of the exception my old lord  as soon as my anxiety for my own master began to be relaxed i was aware of a change in the old gentleman his father that seemed to threaten mortal consequences  his face was pale and swollen as he sat in the chimneyside with his latin he would drop off sleeping and the book roll in the ashes some days he would drag his foot others stumble in speaking  the amenity of his behaviour appeared more extreme full of excuses for the least trouble very thoughtful for all to myself of a most flattering civility  one day that he had sent for his lawyer and remained a long while private he met me as he was crossing the hall with painful footsteps and took me kindly by the hand  mr mackellar said he i have had many occasions to set a proper value on your services and today when i recast my will i have taken the freedom to name you for one of my executors i believe you bear love enough to our house to render me this service  at that very time he passed the greater portion of his days in clamber from which it was often difficult to rouse him seemed to have losst all count of years and had several times particularly on waking called for his wife and for an old servant whose very gravestone was now green with moss  if i had been put to my oath i must have declared he was incapable of testing and yet there was never a will drawn more sensible in every trait or showing a more excellent judgment both of persons and affairs  his dissolution though it took not very long proceeded by infinitesimal gradations  his faculties decayed together steadily the power of his limbs was almost gone he was extremely deaf his speech had sunk into mere mumblings and yet to the end he managed to discover something of his former courtesy and kindness pressing the hand of any that helped him presenting me with one of his latin books in which he had laboriously traced my name and in a thousand ways reminding us of the greatness of that loss which it might almost be said we had already suffered  to the end the power of articulation returned to him in flashes it seemed he had only forgotten the art of speech as a child forgets his lesson and at times he would call some part of it to mind  on the last night of his life he suddenly broke silence with these words from virgil gnatique pratisque alma precor miserere perfectly uttered and with a fitting accent  at the sudden clear sound of it we started from our several occupations but it was in vain we turned to him he sat there silent and to all appearance fatuous  a little later he was had to bed with more difficulty than ever before and some time in the night without any more violence his spirit fled  at a far later period i chanced to speak of these particulars with a doctor of medicine a man of so high a reputation that i scruple to adduce his name  by his view of it father and son both suffered from the affection  the father from the strain of his unnatural sorrows  the son perhaps in the excitation of the fever each had ruptured a vessel on the brain and there was probably my doctor added some predisposition in the family to accidents of that description  the father sank the son recovered all the externals of a healthy man but it is like there was some destruction in those delicate tissues where the soul resides and does her earthly business her heavenly i would fain hope cannot be thus obstructed by material accidents  and yet upon a more mature opinion it matters not one jot for he who shall pass judgment on the records of our life is the same that formed us in frailty  the death of my old lord was the occasion of a fresh surprise to us who watched the behaviour of his successor  to any considering mind the two sons had between them slain their father and he who took the sword might be even said to have slain him with his hand but no such thought appeared to trouble my new lord  he was becomingly grave i could scarce say sorrowful or only with a pleasant sorrow talking of the dead with a regretful cheerfulness relating old examples of his character smiling at them with a good conscience and when the day of the funeral came round doing the honours with exact propriety  i could perceive besides that he found a solid gratification in his accession to the title the which he was punctilious in exacting   and now there came upon the scene a new character and one that played his part too in the story i mean the present lord alexander whose birth 17th july 1757 filled the cup of my poor masters happiness  there was nothing then left him to wish for nor yet leisure to wish for it  indeed there never was a parent so fond and doting as he showed himself  he was continually uneasy in his sons absence  was the child abroad the father would be watching the clouds in case it rained  was it night he would rise out of his bed to observe its slumbers  his conversation grew even wearyful to strangers since he talked of little but his son  in matters relating to the estate all was designed with a particular eye to alexander and it would be let us put it in hand at once that the wood may be grown against alexanders majority or this will fall in again handsomely for alexanders marriage  every day this absorption of the mans nature became more observable with many touching and some very blameworthy particulars  soon the child could walk abroad with him at first on the terrace hand in hand and afterward at large about the policies and this grew to be my lords chief occupation  the sound of their two voices audible a great way off for they spoke loud became familiar in the neighbourhood and for my part i found it more agreeable than the sound of birds  it was pretty to see the pair returning full of briars and the father as flushed and sometimes as bemuddied as the child for they were equal sharers in all sorts of boyish entertainment digging in the beach damming of streams and what not and i have seen them gaze through a fence at cattle with the same childish contemplation  the mention of these rambles brings me to a strange scene of which i was a witness  there was one walk i never followed myself without emotion so often had i gone there upon miserable errands so much had there befallen against the house of durrisdeer  but the path lay handy from all points beyond the muckle ross and i was driven although much against my will to take my use of it perhaps once in the two months  it befell when mr alexander was of the age of seven or eight i had some business on the far side in the morning and entered the shrubbery on my homeward way about nine of a bright forenoon  it was that time of year when the woods are all in their spring colours the thorns all in flower and the birds in the high season of their singing  in contrast to this merriment the shrubbery was only the more sad and i the more oppressed by its associations  in this situation of spirit it struck me disagreeably to hear voices a little way in front and to recognise the tones of my lord and mr alexander  i pushed ahead and came presently into their view  they stood together in the open space where the duel was my lord with his hand on his sons shoulder and speaking with some gravity  at least as he raised his head upon my coming i thought i could perceive his countenance to lighten  ah says he here comes the good mackellar  i have just been telling sandie the story of this place and how there was a man whom the devil tried to kill and how near he came to kill the devil instead  i had thought it strange enough he should bring the child into that scene that he should actually be discoursing of his act passed measure  but the worst was yet to come for he added turning to his son  you can ask mackellar he was here and saw it  is it true mr mackellar asked the child  and did you really see the devil  i have not heard the tale i replied and i am in a press of business  so far i said a little sourly fencing with the embarrassment of the position and suddenly the bitterness of the past and the terror of that scene by candlelight rushed in upon my mind  i bethought me that for a difference of a seconds quickness in parade the child before me might have never seen the day and the emotion that always fluttered round my heart in that dark shrubbery burst forth in words  but so much is true i cried that i have met the devil in these woods and seen him foiled here  blessed be god that we escaped with life  blessed be god that one stone yet stands upon another in the walls of durrisdeer  and oh mr alexander if ever you come by this spot though it was a hundred years hence and you came with the gayest and the highest in the land i would step aside and remember a bit prayer  my lord bowed his head gravely  ah says he mackellar is always in the right  come alexander take your bonnet off  and with that he uncovered and held out his hand  o lord said he i thank thee and my son thanks thee for thy manifold great mercies  let us have peace for a little defend us from the evil man  smite him o lord upon the lying mouth  the last broke out of him like a cry and at that whether remembered anger choked his utterance or whether he perceived this was a singular sort of prayer at least he suddenly came to a full stop and after a moment set back his hat upon his head  i think you have forgot a word my lord said i  forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us  for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever and ever  amen  ah that is easy saying said my lord  that is very easy saying mackellar  but for me to forgive  i think i would cut a very silly figure if i had the affectation to pretend it  the bairn my lord said i with some severity for i thought his expressions little fitted for the care of children  why very true said he  this is dull work for a bairn  lets go nesting  i forget if it was the same day but it was soon after my lord finding me alone opened himself a little more on the same head  mackellar he said i am now a very happy man  i think so indeed my lord said i and the sight of it gives me a light heart  there is an obligation in happiness  do you not think so says he musingly  i think so indeed says i and one in sorrow too  if we are not here to try to do the best in my humble opinion the sooner we are away the better for all parties  ay but if you were in my shoes would you forgive him asks my lord  the suddenness of the attack a little gravelled me  it is a duty laid upon us strictly said i  hut said he  these are expressions  do you forgive the man yourself  well  no said i  god forgive me i do not  shake hands upon that cries my lord with a kind of joviality  it is an ill sentiment to shake hands upon said i for christian people  i think i will give you mine on some more evangelical occasion  this i said smiling a little but as for my lord he went from the room laughing aloud   for my lords slavery to the child i can find no expression adequate  he lost himself in that continual thought  business friends and wife being all alike forgotten or only remembered with a painful effort like that of one struggling with a posset it was most notable in the matter of his wife  since i had known durrisdeer she had been the burthen of his thought and the loadstone of his eyes and now she was quite cast out  i have seen him come to the door of a room look round and pass my lady over as though she were a dog before the fire  it would be alexander he was seeking and my lady knew it well  i have heard him speak to her so ruggedly that i nearly found it in my heart to intervene the cause would still be the same that she had in some way thwarted alexander  without doubt this was in the nature of a judgment on my lady  without doubt she had the tables turned upon her as only providence can do it she who had been cold so many years to every mark of tenderness it was her part now to be neglected  the more praise to her that she played it well  an odd situation resulted  that we had once more two parties in the house and that now i was of my ladys  not that ever i lost the love i bore my master  but for one thing he had the less use for my society  for another i could not but compare the case of mr alexander with that of miss katharine for whom my lord had never found the least attention  and for a third i was wounded by the change he discovered to his wife which struck me in the nature of an infidelity  i could not but admire besides the constancy and kindness she displayed  perhaps her sentiment to my lord as it had been founded from the first in pity was that rather of a mother than a wife perhaps it pleased her  if i may so say  to behold her two children so happy in each other the more as one had suffered so unjustly in the past  but for all that and though i could never trace in her one spark of jealousy she must fall back for society on poor neglected miss katharine and i on my part came to pass my spare hours more and more with the mother and daughter  it would be easy to make too much of this division for it was a pleasant family as families go still the thing existed whether my lord knew it or not i am in doubt  i do not think he did he was bound up so entirely in his son but the rest of us knew it and in a manner suffered from the knowledge  what troubled us most however was the great and growing danger to the child  my lord was his father over again it was to be feared the son would prove a second master  time has proved these fears to have been quite exaggerate  certainly there is no more worthy gentleman today in scotland than the seventh lord durrisdeer  of my own exodus from his employment it does not become me to speak above all in a memorandum written only to justify his father     editors note  five pages of mr mackellars ms are here omitted  i have gathered from their perusal an impression that mr mackellar in his old age was rather an exacting servant  against the seventh lord durrisdeer with whom at any rate we have no concern nothing material is alleged  r l s     but our fear at the time was lest he should turn out in the person of his son a second edition of his brother  my lady had tried to interject some wholesome discipline she had been glad to give that up and now looked on with secret dismay sometimes she even spoke of it by hints and sometimes when there was brought to her knowledge some monstrous instance of my lords indulgence she would betray herself in a gesture or perhaps an exclamation  as for myself i was haunted by the thought both day and night  not so much for the childs sake as for the fathers  the man had gone to sleep he was dreaming a dream and any rough wakening must infallibly prove mortal  that he should survive its death was inconceivable and the fear of its dishonour made me cover my face  it was this continual preoccupation that screwed me up at last to a remonstrance  a matter worthy to be narrated in detail  my lord and i sat one day at the same table upon some tedious business of detail i have said that he had lost his former interest in such occupations he was plainly itching to be gone and he looked fretful weary and methought older than i had ever previously observed  i suppose it was the haggard face that put me suddenly upon my enterprise  my lord said i with my head down and feigning to continue my occupation  or rather let me call you again by the name of mr henry for i fear your anger and want you to think upon old times    my good mackellar said he and that in tones so kindly that i had near forsook my purpose  but i called to mind that i was speaking for his good and stuck to my colours  has it never come in upon your mind what you are doing i asked  what i am doing he repeated i was never good at guessing riddles  what you are doing with your son said i  well said he with some defiance in his tone and what am i doing with my son  your father was a very good man says i straying from the direct path  but do you think he was a wise father  there was a pause before he spoke and then  i say nothing against him he replied  i had the most cause perhaps but i say nothing  why there it is said i  you had the cause at least  and yet your father was a good man i never knew a better save on the one point nor yet a wiser  where he stumbled it is highly possible another man should fail  he had the two sons    my lord rapped suddenly and violently on the table  what is this cried he  speak out  i will then said i my voice almost strangled with the thumping of my heart  if you continue to indulge mr alexander you are following in your fathers footsteps  beware my lord lest when he grows up your son should follow in the masters  i had never meant to put the thing so crudely but in the extreme of fear there comes a brutal kind of courage the most brutal indeed of all and i burnt my ships with that plain word  i never had the answer  when i lifted my head my lord had risen to his feet and the next moment he fell heavily on the floor  the fit or seizure endured not very long he came to himself vacantly put his hand to his head which i was then supporting and says he in a broken voice  i have been ill and a little after  help me i got him to his feet and he stood pretty well though he kept hold of the table  i have been ill mackellar he said again something broke mackellar  or was going to break and then all swam away  i think i was very angry  never you mind mackellar never you mind my man  i wouldnae hurt a hair upon your head too much has come and gone  its a certain thing between us two but i think mackellar i will go to mrs henry  i think i will go to mrs henry said he and got pretty steadily from the room leaving me overcome with penitence  presently the door flew open and my lady swept in with flashing eyes  what is all this she cried  what have you done to my husband  will nothing teach you your position in this house  will you never cease from making and meddling  my lady said i since i have been in this house i have had plenty of hard words  for a while they were my daily diet and i swallowed them all  as for today you may call me what you please you will never find the name hard enough for such a blunder  and yet i meant it for the best  i told her all with ingenuity even as it is written here and when she had heard me out she pondered and i could see her animosity fall  yes she said you meant well indeed  i have had the same thought myself or the same temptation rather which makes me pardon you  but dear god can you not understand that he can bear no more  he can bear no more she cried  the cord is stretched to snapping  what matters the future if he have one or two good days  amen said i  i will meddle no more  i am pleased enough that you should recognise the kindness of my meaning  yes said my lady but when it came to the point i have to suppose your courage failed you for what you said was said cruelly  she paused looking at me then suddenly smiled a little and said a singular thing  do you know what you are mr mackellar  you are an old maid   no more incident of any note occurred in the family until the return of that illstarred man the master  but i have to place here a second extract from the memoirs of chevalier burke interesting in itself and highly necessary for my purpose  it is our only sight of the master on his indian travels and the first word in these pages of secundra dass  one fact it is to observe appears here very clearly which if we had known some twenty years ago how many calamities and sorrows had been spared  that secundra dass spoke english    chapter vii  adventure of chevalier burke in india    extracted from his memoirs     here was i therefore on the streets of that city the name of which i cannot call to mind while even then i was so ill acquainted with its situation that i knew not whether to go south or north  the alert being sudden i had run forth without shoes or stockings my hat had been struck from my head in the mellay my kit was in the hands of the english i had no companion but the cipaye no weapon but my sword and the devil a coin in my pocket in short i was for all the world like one of those calendars with whom mr galland has made us acquainted in his elegant tales these gentlemen you will remember were for ever falling in with extraordinary incidents and i was myself upon the brink of one so astonishing that i protest i cannot explain it to this day  the cipaye was a very honest man he had served many years with the french colours and would have let himself be cut to pieces for any of the brave countrymen of mr lally  it is the same fellow his name has quite escaped me of whom i have narrated already a surprising instance of generosity of mind  when he found mr de fessac and myself upon the ramparts entirely overcome with liquor and covered us with straw while the commandant was passing by  i consulted him therefore with perfect freedom  it was a fine question what to do but we decided at last to escalade a garden wall where we could certainly sleep in the shadow of the trees and might perhaps find an occasion to get hold of a pair of slippers and a turban  in that part of the city we had only the difficulty of the choice for it was a quarter consisting entirely of walled gardens and the lanes which divided them were at that hour of the night deserted  i gave the cipaye a back and we had soon dropped into a large enclosure full of trees  the place was soaking with the dew which in that country is exceedingly unwholesome above all to whites yet my fatigue was so extreme that i was already half asleep when the cipaye recalled me to my senses  in the far end of the enclosure a bright light had suddenly shone out and continued to burn steadily among the leaves  it was a circumstance highly unusual in such a place and hour and in our situation it behoved us to proceed with some timidity  the cipaye was sent to reconnoitre and pretty soon returned with the intelligence that we had fallen extremely amiss for the house belonged to a white man who was in all likelihood english  faith says i if there is a white man to be seen i will have a look at him for the lord be praised there are more sorts than the one  the cipaye led me forward accordingly to a place from which i had a clear view upon the house  it was surrounded with a wide verandah a lamp very well trimmed stood upon the floor of it and on either side of the lamp there sat a man crosslegged after the oriental manner  both besides were bundled up in muslin like two natives and yet one of them was not only a white man but a man very well known to me and the reader being indeed that very master of ballantrae of whose gallantry and genius i have had to speak so often  word had reached me that he was come to the indies though we had never met at least and i heard little of his occupations but sure i had no sooner recognised him and found myself in the arms of so old a comrade than i supposed my tribulations were quite done  i stepped plainly forth into the light of the moon which shone exceeding strong and hailing ballantrae by name made him in a few words master of my grievous situation  he turned started the least thing in the world looked me fair in the face while i was speaking and when i had done addressed himself to his companion in the barbarous native dialect  the second person who was of an extraordinary delicate appearance with legs like walking canes and fingers like the stalk of a tobacco pipe 6 now rose to his feet  the sahib says he understands no english language  i understand it myself and i see you make some small mistake  oh which may happen very often  but the sahib would be glad to know how you come in a garden  ballantrae i cried have you the damned impudence to deny me to my face  ballantrae never moved a muscle staring at me like an image in a pagoda  the sahib understands no english language says the native as glib as before  he be glad to know how you come in a garden  oh the divil fetch him says i  he would be glad to know how i come in a garden would he  well now my dear man just have the civility to tell the sahib with my kind love that we are two soldiers here whom he never met and never heard of but the cipaye is a broth of a boy and i am a broth of a boy myself and if we dont get a full meal of meat and a turban and slippers and the value of a gold mohur in small change as a matter of convenience bedad my friend i could lay my finger on a garden where there is going to be trouble  they carried their comedy so far as to converse awhile in hindustanee and then says the hindu with the same smile but sighing as if he were tired of the repetition the sahib would be glad to know how you come in a garden  is that the way of it says i and laying my hand on my sword hilt i bade the cipaye draw  ballantraes hindu still smiling pulled out a pistol from his bosom and though ballantrae himself never moved a muscle i knew him well enough to be sure he was prepared  the sahib thinks you better go away says the hindu  well to be plain it was what i was thinking myself for the report of a pistol would have been under providence the means of hanging the pair of us  tell the sahib i consider him no gentleman says i and turned away with a gesture of contempt  i was not gone three steps when the voice of the hindu called me back  the sahib would be glad to know if you are a dam low irishman says he and at the words ballantrae smiled and bowed very low  what is that says i  the sahib say you ask your friend mackellar says the hindu the sahib he cry quits  tell the sahib i will give him a cure for the scots fiddle when next we meet cried i  the pair were still smiling as i left  there is little doubt some flaws may be picked in my own behaviour and when a man however gallant appeals to posterity with an account of his exploits he must almost certainly expect to share the fate of caesar and alexander and to meet with some detractors but there is one thing that can never be laid at the door of francis burke  he never turned his back on a friend     here follows a passage which the chevalier burke has been at the pains to delete before sending me his manuscript  doubtless it was some very natural complaint of what he supposed to be an indiscretion on my part though indeed i can call none to mind perhaps mr henry was less guarded or it is just possible the master found the means to examine my correspondence and himself read the letter from troyes  in revenge for which this cruel jest was perpetrated on mr burke in his extreme necessity  the master for all his wickedness was not without some natural affection i believe he was sincerely attached to mr burke in the beginning but the thought of treachery dried up the springs of his very shallow friendship and his detestable nature appeared naked  e mck    chapter viii  the enemy in the house    it is a strange thing that i should be at a stick for a date  the date besides of an incident that changed the very nature of my life and sent us all into foreign lands  but the truth is i was stricken out of all my habitudes and find my journals very ill reddup 7 the day not indicated sometimes for a week or two together and the whole fashion of the thing like that of a man near desperate  it was late in march at least or early in april 1764  i had slept heavily and wakened with a premonition of some evil to befall  so strong was this upon my spirit that i hurried downstairs in my shirt and breeches and my hand i remember shook upon the rail  it was a cold sunny morning with a thick white frost the blackbirds sang exceeding sweet and loud about the house of durrisdeer and there was a noise of the sea in all the chambers  as i came by the doors of the hall another sound arrested me  of voices talking  i drew nearer and stood like a man dreaming  here was certainly a human voice and that in my own masters house and yet i knew it not certainly human speech and that in my native land and yet listen as i pleased i could not catch one syllable  an old tale started up in my mind of a fairy wife or perhaps only a wandering stranger that came to the place of my fathers some generations back and stayed the matter of a week talking often in a tongue that signified nothing to the hearers and went again as she had come under cloud of night leaving not so much as a name behind her  a little fear i had but more curiosity and i opened the halldoor and entered  the supperthings still lay upon the table the shutters were still closed although day peeped in the divisions and the great room was lighted only with a single taper and some lurching reverberation of the fire  close in the chimney sat two men  the one that was wrapped in a cloak and wore boots i knew at once  it was the bird of ill omen back again  of the other who was set close to the red embers and made up into a bundle like a mummy i could but see that he was an alien of a darker hue than any man of europe very frailly built with a singular tall forehead and a secret eye  several bundles and a small valise were on the floor and to judge by the smallness of this luggage and by the condition of the masters boots grossly patched by some unscrupulous country cobbler evil had not prospered  he rose upon my entrance our eyes crossed and i know not why it should have been but my courage rose like a lark on a may morning  ha said i is this you  and i was pleased with the unconcern of my own voice  it is even myself worthy mackellar says the master  this time you have brought the black dog visibly upon your back i continued  referring to secundra dass asked the master  let me present you  he is a native gentleman of india  hum said i  i am no great lover either of you or your friends mr bally  but i will let a little daylight in and have a look at you  and so saying i undid the shutters of the eastern window  by the light of the morning i could perceive the man was changed later when we were all together i was more struck to see how lightly time had dealt with him but the first glance was otherwise  you are getting an old man said i  a shade came upon his face  if you could see yourself said he you would perhaps not dwell upon the topic  hut i returned old age is nothing to me  i think i have been always old and i am now i thank god better known and more respected  it is not every one that can say that mr bally  the lines in your brow are calamities your life begins to close in upon you like a prison death will soon be rapping at the door and i see not from what source you are to draw your consolations  here the master addressed himself to secundra dass in hindustanee from which i gathered i freely confess with a high degree of pleasure that my remarks annoyed him  all this while you may be sure my mind had been busy upon other matters even while i rallied my enemy and chiefly as to how i should communicate secretly and quickly with my lord  to this in the breathingspace now given me i turned all the forces of my mind when suddenly shifting my eyes i was aware of the man himself standing in the doorway and to all appearance quite composed  he had no sooner met my looks than he stepped across the threshold  the master heard him coming and advanced upon the other side about four feet apart these brothers came to a full pause and stood exchanging steady looks and then my lord smiled bowed a little forward and turned briskly away  mackellar says he we must see to breakfast for these travellers  it was plain the master was a trifle disconcerted but he assumed the more impudence of speech and manner  i am as hungry as a hawk says he  let it be something good henry  my lord turned to him with the same hard smile  lord durrisdeer says he  oh never in the family returned the master  every one in this house renders me my proper title says my lord if it please you to make an exception i will leave you to consider what appearance it will bear to strangers and whether it may not be translated as an effect of impotent jealousy  i could have clapped my hands together with delight  the more so as my lord left no time for any answer but bidding me with a sign to follow him went straight out of the hall  come quick says he we have to sweep vermin from the house and he sped through the passages with so swift a step that i could scarce keep up with him straight to the door of john paul the which he opened without summons and walked in  john was to all appearance sound asleep but my lord made no pretence of waking him  john paul said he speaking as quietly as ever i heard him you served my father long or i would pack you from the house like a dog  if in half an hours time i find you gone you shall continue to receive your wages in edinburgh  if you linger here or in st brides  old man old servant and altogether  i shall find some very astonishing way to make you smart for your disloyalty  up and begone  the door you let them in by will serve for your departure i do not choose my son shall see your face again  i am rejoiced to find you bear the thing so quietly said i when we were forth again by ourselves  quietly cries he and put my hand suddenly against his heart which struck upon his bosom like a sledge  at this revelation i was filled with wonder and fear  there was no constitution could bear so violent a strain  his least of all that was unhinged already and i decided in my mind that we must bring this monstrous situation to an end  it would be well i think if i took word to my lady said i indeed he should have gone himself but i counted  not in vain  on his indifference  aye says he do  i will hurry breakfast  we must all appear at the table even alexander it must appear we are untroubled  i ran to my ladys room and with no preparatory cruelty disclosed my news  my mind was long ago made up said she  we must make our packets secretly today and leave secretly tonight  thank heaven we have another house  the first ship that sails shall bear us to new york  and what of him i asked  we leave him durrisdeer she cried  let him work his pleasure upon that  not so by your leave said i  there shall be a dog at his heels that can hold fast  bed he shall have and board and a horse to ride upon if he behave himself but the keys  if you think well of it my lady  shall be left in the hands of one mackellar  there will be good care taken trust him for that  mr mackellar she cried i thank you for that thought  all shall be left in your hands  if we must go into a savage country i bequeath it to you to take our vengeance  send macconochie to st brides to arrange privately for horses and to call the lawyer  my lord must leave procuration  at that moment my lord came to the door and we opened our plan to him  i will never hear of it he cried he would think i feared him i will stay in my own house please god until i die  there lives not the man can beard me out of it  once and for all here i am and here i stay in spite of all the devils in hell  i can give no idea of the vehemency of his words and utterance but we both stood aghast and i in particular who had been a witness of his former selfrestraint  my lady looked at me with an appeal that went to my heart and recalled me to my wits  i made her a private sign to go and when my lord and i were alone went up to him where he was racing to and fro in one end of the room like a halflunatic and set my hand firmly on his shoulder  my lord says i i am going to be the plaindealer once more if for the last time so much the better for i am grown weary of the part  nothing will change me he answered  god forbid i should refuse to hear you but nothing will change me  this he said firmly with no signal of the former violence which already raised my hopes  very well said i  i can afford to waste my breath  i pointed to a chair and he sat down and looked at me  i can remember a time when my lady very much neglected you said i  i never spoke of it while it lasted returned my lord with a high flush of colour and it is all changed now  do you know how much i said  do you know how much it is all changed  the tables are turned my lord  it is my lady that now courts you for a word a look  ay and courts you in vain  do you know with whom she passes her days while you are out gallivanting in the policies  my lord she is glad to pass them with a certain dry old grieve 8 of the name of ephraim mackellar and i think you may be able to remember what that means for i am the more in a mistake or you were once driven to the same company yourself  mackellar cries my lord getting to his feet  o my god mackellar  it is neither the name of mackellar nor the name of god that can change the truth said i and i am telling you the fact  now for you that suffered so much to deal out the same suffering to another is that the part of any christian  but you are so swallowed up in your new friend that the old are all forgotten they are all clean vanished from your memory  and yet they stood by you at the darkest my lady not the least  and does my lady ever cross your mind  does it ever cross your mind what she went through that night  or what manner of a wife she has been to you thenceforward  or in what kind of a position she finds herself today  never  it is your pride to stay and face him out and she must stay along with you  oh my lords pride  thats the great affair  and yet she is the woman and you are a great hulking man she is the woman that you swore to protect and more betoken the own mother of that son of yours  you are speaking very bitterly mackellar said he but the lord knows i fear you are speaking very true  i have not proved worthy of my happiness  bring my lady back  my lady was waiting near at hand to learn the issue  when i brought her in my lord took a hand of each of us and laid them both upon his bosom  i have had two friends in my life said he all the comfort ever i had it came from one or other  when you two are in a mind i think i would be an ungrateful dog    he shut his mouth very hard and looked on us with swimming eyes  do what ye like with me says he only dont think    he stopped again  do what ye please with me  god knows i love and honour you  and dropping our two hands he turned his back and went and gazed out of the window  but my lady ran after calling his name and threw herself upon his neck in a passion of weeping  i went out and shut the door behind me and stood and thanked god from the bottom of my heart   at the breakfast board according to my lords design we were all met  the master had by that time plucked off his patched boots and made a toilet suitable to the hour secundra dass was no longer bundled up in wrappers but wore a decent plain black suit which misbecame him strangely and the pair were at the great window looking forth when the family entered  they turned and the black man as they had already named him in the house bowed almost to his knees but the master was for running forward like one of the family  my lady stopped him curtseying low from the far end of the hall and keeping her children at her back  my lord was a little in front  so there were the three cousins of durrisdeer face to face  the hand of time was very legible on all i seemed to read in their changed faces a memento mori and what affected me still more it was the wicked man that bore his years the handsomest  my lady was quite transfigured into the matron a becoming woman for the head of a great tableful of children and dependents  my lord was grown slack in his limbs he stooped he walked with a running motion as though he had learned again from mr alexander his face was drawn it seemed a trifle longer than of old and it wore at times a smile very singularly mingled and which in my eyes appeared both bitter and pathetic  but the master still bore himself erect although perhaps with effort his brow barred about the centre with imperious lines his mouth set as for command  he had all the gravity and something of the splendour of satan in the paradise lost  i could not help but see the man with admiration and was only surprised that i saw him with so little fear  but indeed as long as we were at the table it seemed as if his authority were quite vanished and his teeth all drawn  we had known him a magician that controlled the elements and here he was transformed into an ordinary gentleman chatting like his neighbours at the breakfastboard  for now the father was dead and my lord and lady reconciled in what ear was he to pour his calumnies  it came upon me in a kind of vision how hugely i had overrated the mans subtlety  he had his malice still he was false as ever and the occasion being gone that made his strength he sat there impotent he was still the viper but now spent his venom on a file  two more thoughts occurred to me while yet we sat at breakfast  the first that he was abashed  i had almost said distressed  to find his wickedness quite unavailing the second that perhaps my lord was in the right and we did amiss to fly from our dismasted enemy  but my poor mans leaping heart came in my mind and i remembered it was for his life we played the coward  when the meal was over the master followed me to my room and taking a chair which i had never offered him asked me what was to be done with him  why mr bally said i the house will still be open to you for a time  for a time says he  i do not know if i quite take your meaning  it is plain enough said i  we keep you for our reputation as soon as you shall have publicly disgraced yourself by some of your misconduct we shall pack you forth again  you are become an impudent rogue said the master bending his brows at me dangerously  i learned in a good school i returned  and you must have perceived yourself that with my old lords death your power is quite departed  i do not fear you now mr bally i think even  god forgive me  that i take a certain pleasure in your company  he broke out in a burst of laughter which i clearly saw to be assumed  i have come with empty pockets says he after a pause  i do not think there will be any money going i replied  i would advise you not to build on that  i shall have something to say on the point he returned  indeed said i  i have not a guess what it will be then  oh you affect confidence said the master  i have still one strong position  that you people fear a scandal and i enjoy it  pardon me mr bally says i  we do not in the least fear a scandal against you  he laughed again  you have been studying repartee he said but speech is very easy and sometimes very deceptive  i warn you fairly  you will find me vitriol in the house  you would do wiser to pay money down and see my back  and with that he waved his hand to me and left the room  a little after my lord came with the lawyer mr carlyle a bottle of old wine was brought and we all had a glass before we fell to business  the necessary deeds were then prepared and executed and the scotch estates made over in trust to mr carlyle and myself  there is one point mr carlyle said my lord when these affairs had been adjusted on which i wish that you would do us justice this sudden departure coinciding with my brothers return will be certainly commented on  i wish you would discourage any conjunction of the two  i will make a point of it my lord said mr carlyle  the mas bally does not then accompany you  it is a point i must approach said my lord  mr bally remains at durrisdeer under the care of mr mackellar and i do not mean that he shall even know our destination  common report however   began the lawyer  ah but mr carlyle this is to be a secret quite among ourselves interrupted my lord  none but you and mackellar are to be made acquainted with my movements  and mr bally stays here  quite so said mr carlyle  the powers you leave    then he broke off again  mr mackellar we have a rather heavy weight upon us  no doubt said i  no doubt said he  mr bally will have no voice  he will have no voice said my lord and i hope no influence mr bally is not a good adviser  i see said the lawyer  by the way has mr bally means  i understand him to have nothing replied my lord  i give him table fire and candle in this house  and in the matter of an allowance  if i am to share the responsibility you will see how highly desirable it is that i should understand your views said the lawyer  on the question of an allowance  there will be no allowance said my lord  i wish mr bally to live very private  we have not always been gratified with his behaviour  and in the matter of money i added he has shown himself an infamous bad husband  glance your eye upon that docket mr carlyle where i have brought together the different sums the man has drawn from the estate in the last fifteen or twenty years  the total is pretty  mr carlyle made the motion of whistling  i had no guess of this said he  excuse me once more my lord if i appear to push you but it is really desirable i should penetrate your intentions mr mackellar might die when i should find myself alone upon this trust  would it not be rather your lordships preference that mr bally should  ahem  should leave the country  my lord looked at mr carlyle  why do you ask that said he  i gather my lord that mr bally is not a comfort to his family says the lawyer with a smile  my lords face became suddenly knotted  i wish he was in hell cried he and filled himself a glass of wine but with a hand so tottering that he spilled the half into his bosom  this was the second time that in the midst of the most regular and wise behaviour his animosity had spirted out  it startled mr carlyle who observed my lord thenceforth with covert curiosity and to me it restored the certainty that we were acting for the best in view of my lords health and reason  except for this explosion the interview was very successfully conducted  no doubt mr carlyle would talk as lawyers do little by little  we could thus feel we had laid the foundations of a better feeling in the country and the mans own misconduct would certainly complete what we had begun  indeed before his departure the lawyer showed us there had already gone abroad some glimmerings of the truth  i should perhaps explain to you my lord said he pausing with his hat in his hand that i have not been altogether surprised with your lordships dispositions in the case of mr bally something of this nature oozed out when he was last in durrisdeer there was some talk of a woman at st brides to whom you had behaved extremely handsome and mr bally with no small degree of cruelty  there was the entail again which was much controverted in short there was no want of talk back and forward and some of our wiseacres took up a strong opinion  i remained in suspense as became one of my cloth but mr mackellars docket here has finally opened my eyes  i do not think mr mackellar that you and i will give him that much rope   the rest of that important day passed prosperously through  it was our policy to keep the enemy in view and i took my turn to be his watchman with the rest  i think his spirits rose as he perceived us to be so attentive and i know that mine insensibly declined what chiefly daunted me was the mans singular dexterity to worm himself into our troubles  you may have felt after a horse accident the hand of a bonesetter artfully divide and interrogate the muscles and settle strongly on the injured place  it was so with the masters tongue that was so cunning to question and his eyes that were so quick to observe  i seemed to have said nothing and yet to have let all out  before i knew where i was the man was condoling with me on my lords neglect of my lady and myself and his hurtful indulgence to his son  on this last point i perceived him with panic fear to return repeatedly  the boy had displayed a certain shrinking from his uncle it was strong in my mind his father had been fool enough to indoctrinate the same which was no wise beginning  and when i looked upon the man before me still so handsome so apt a speaker with so great a variety of fortunes to relate i saw he was the very personage to captivate a boyish fancy  john paul had left only that morning it was not to be supposed he had been altogether dumb upon his favourite subject so that here would be mr alexander in the part of dido with a curiosity inflamed to hear and there would be the master like a diabolical aeneas full of matter the most pleasing in the world to any youthful ear such as battles seadisasters flights the forests of the west and since his later voyage the ancient cities of the indies  how cunningly these baits might be employed and what an empire might be so founded little by little in the mind of any boy stood obviously clear to me  there was no inhibition so long as the man was in the house that would be strong enough to hold these two apart for if it be hard to charm serpents it is no very difficult thing to cast a glamour on a little chip of manhood not very long in breeches  i recalled an ancient sailorman who dwelt in a lone house beyond the figgate whins i believe he called it after portobello and how the boys would troop out of leith on a saturday and sit and listen to his swearing tales as thick as crows about a carrion  a thing i often remarked as i went by a young student on my own more meditative holiday diversion  many of these boys went no doubt in the face of an express command many feared and even hated the old brute of whom they made their hero and i have seen them flee from him when he was tipsy and stone him when he was drunk  and yet there they came each saturday  how much more easily would a boy like mr alexander fall under the influence of a highlooking highspoken gentlemanadventurer who should conceive the fancy to entrap him and the influence gained how easy to employ it for the childs perversion  i doubt if our enemy had named mr alexander three times before i perceived which way his mind was aiming  all this train of thought and memory passed in one pulsation through my own  and you may say i started back as though an open hole had gaped across a pathway mr alexander  there was the weak point there was the eve in our perishable paradise and the serpent was already hissing on the trail  i promise you i went the more heartily about the preparations my last scruple gone the danger of delay written before me in huge characters  from that moment forth i seem not to have sat down or breathed  now i would be at my post with the master and his indian now in the garret buckling a valise now sending forth macconochie by the side postern and the woodpath to bear it to the trystingplace and again snatching some words of counsel with my lady  this was the verso of our life in durrisdeer that day but on the recto all appeared quite settled as of a family at home in its paternal seat and what perturbation may have been observable the master would set down to the blow of his unlookedfor coming and the fear he was accustomed to inspire  supper went creditably off cold salutations passed and the company trooped to their respective chambers  i attended the master to the last  we had put him next door to his indian in the north wing because that was the most distant and could be severed from the body of the house with doors  i saw he was a kind friend or a good master whichever it was to his secundra dass  seeing to his comfort mending the fire with his own hand for the indian complained of cold inquiring as to the rice on which the stranger made his diet talking with him pleasantly in the hindustanee while i stood by my candle in my hand and affected to be overcome with slumber  at length the master observed my signals of distress  i perceive says he that you have all your ancient habits  early to bed and early to rise  yawn yourself away  once in my own room i made the customary motions of undressing so that i might time myself and when the cycle was complete set my tinderbox ready and blew out my taper  the matter of an hour afterward i made a light again put on my shoes of list that i had worn by my lords sickbed and set forth into the house to call the voyagers  all were dressed and waiting  my lord my lady miss katharine mr alexander my ladys woman christie and i observed the effect of secrecy even upon quite innocent persons that one after another showed in the chink of the door a face as white as paper  we slipped out of the side postern into a night of darkness scarce broken by a star or two so that at first we groped and stumbled and fell among the bushes  a few hundred yards up the woodpath macconochie was waiting us with a great lantern so the rest of the way we went easy enough but still in a kind of guilty silence  a little beyond the abbey the path debauched on the main road and some quarter of a mile farther at the place called eagles where the moors begin we saw the lights of the two carriages stand shining by the wayside  scarce a word or two was uttered at our parting and these regarded business  a silent grasping of hands a turning of faces aside and the thing was over the horses broke into a trot the lamplight sped like will othewisp upon the broken moorland it dipped beyond stony brae and there were macconochie and i alone with our lantern on the road  there was one thing more to wait for and that was the reappearance of the coach upon cartmore  it seems they must have pulled up upon the summit looked back for a last time and seen our lantern not yet moved away from the place of separation  for a lamp was taken from a carriage and waved three times up and down by way of a farewell  and then they were gone indeed having looked their last on the kind roof of durrisdeer their faces toward a barbarous country  i never knew before the greatness of that vault of night in which we two poor servingmen  the one old and the one elderly  stood for the first time deserted i had never felt before my own dependency upon the countenance of others the sense of isolation burned in my bowels like a fire  it seemed that we who remained at home were the true exiles and that durrisdeer and solwayside and all that made my country native its air good to me and its language welcome had gone forth and was far over the sea with my old masters  the remainder of that night i paced to and fro on the smooth highway reflecting on the future and the past  my thoughts which at first dwelled tenderly on those who were just gone took a more manly temper as i considered what remained for me to do  day came upon the inland mountaintops and the fowls began to cry and the smoke of homesteads to arise in the brown bosom of the moors before i turned my face homeward and went down the path to where the roof of durrisdeer shone in the morning by the sea   at the customary hour i had the master called and awaited his coming in the hall with a quiet mind  he looked about him at the empty room and the three covers set  we are a small party said he  how comes  this is the party to which we must grow accustomed i replied  he looked at me with a sudden sharpness  what is all this said he  you and i and your friend mr dass are now all the company i replied  my lord my lady and the children are gone upon a voyage  upon my word said he  can this be possible  i have indeed fluttered your volscians in corioli  but this is no reason why our breakfast should go cold  sit down mr mackellar if you please  taking as he spoke the head of the table which i had designed to occupy myself  and as we eat you can give me the details of this evasion  i could see he was more affected than his language carried and i determined to equal him in coolness  i was about to ask you to take the head of the table said i for though i am now thrust into the position of your host i could never forget that you were after all a member of the family  for a while he played the part of entertainer giving directions to macconochie who received them with an evil grace and attending specially upon secundra  and where has my good family withdrawn to he asked carelessly  ah mr bally that is another point said i  i have no orders to communicate their destination  to me he corrected  to any one said i  it is the less pointed said the master cest de bon ton  my brother improves as he continues  and i dear mr mackellar  you will have bed and board mr bally said i  i am permitted to give you the run of the cellar which is pretty reasonably stocked  you have only to keep well with me which is no very difficult matter and you shall want neither for wine nor a saddle horse  he made an excuse to send macconochie from the room  and for money he inquired  have i to keep well with my good friend mackellar for my pocketmoney also  this is a pleasing return to the principles of boyhood  there was no allowance made said i but i will take it on myself to see you are supplied in moderation  in moderation he repeated  and you will take it on yourself he drew himself up and looked about the hall at the dark rows of portraits  in the name of my ancestors i thank you says he and then with a return to irony but there must certainly be an allowance for secundra dass he said  it in not possible they have omitted that  i will make a note of it and ask instructions when i write said i  and he with a sudden change of manner and leaning forward with an elbow on the table  do you think this entirely wise  i execute my orders mr bally said i  profoundly modest said the master perhaps not equally ingenuous  you told me yesterday my power was fallen with my fathers death  how comes it then that a peer of the realm flees under cloud of night out of a house in which his fathers have stood several sieges that he conceals his address which must be a matter of concern to his gracious majesty and to the whole republic and that he should leave me in possession and under the paternal charge of his invaluable mackellar  this smacks to me of a very considerable and genuine apprehension  i sought to interrupt him with some not very truthful denegation but he waved me down and pursued his speech  i say it smacks of it he said but i will go beyond that for i think the apprehension grounded  i came to this house with some reluctancy  in view of the manner of my last departure nothing but necessity could have induced me to return  money however is that which i must have  you will not give with a good grace well i have the power to force it from you  inside of a week without leaving durrisdeer i will find out where these fools are fled to i will follow and when i have run my quarry down i will drive a wedge into that family that shall once more burst it into shivers i shall see then whether my lord durrisdeer said with indescribable scorn and rage will choose to buy my absence and you will all see whether by that time i decide for profit or revenge  i was amazed to hear the man so open  the truth is he was consumed with anger at my lords successful flight felt himself to figure as a dupe and was in no humour to weigh language  do you consider this entirely wise said i copying his words  these twenty years i have lived by my poor wisdom he answered with a smile that seemed almost foolish in its vanity  and come out a beggar in the end said i if beggar be a strong enough word for it  i would have you to observe mr mackellar cried he with a sudden imperious heat in which i could not but admire him that i am scrupulously civil  copy me in that and we shall be the better friends  throughout this dialogue i had been incommoded by the observation of secundra dass  not one of us since the first word had made a feint of eating  our eyes were in each others faces  you might say in each others bosoms and those of the indian troubled me with a certain changing brightness as of comprehension  but i brushed the fancy aside telling myself once more he understood no english only from the gravity of both voices and the occasional scorn and anger in the masters smelled out there was something of import in the wind   for the matter of three weeks we continued to live together in the house of durrisdeer  the beginning of that most singular chapter of my life  what i must call my intimacy with the master  at first he was somewhat changeable in his behaviour  now civil now returning to his old manner of flouting me to my face and in both i met him halfway  thanks be to providence i had now no measure to keep with the man and i was never afraid of black brows only of naked swords  so that i found a certain entertainment in these bouts of incivility and was not always illinspired in my rejoinders  at last it was at supper i had a droll expression that entirely vanquished him  he laughed again and again and who would have guessed he cried that this old wife had any wit under his petticoats  it is no wit mr bally said i  a dry scots humour and something of the driest  and indeed i never had the least pretension to be thought a wit  from that hour he was never rude with me but all passed between us in a manner of pleasantry  one of our chief times of daffing 9 was when he required a horse another bottle or some money  he would approach me then after the manner of a schoolboy and i would carry it on by way of being his father  on both sides with an infinity of mirth  i could not but perceive that he thought more of me which tickled that poor part of mankind the vanity  he dropped besides i must suppose unconsciously into a manner that was not only familiar but even friendly and this on the part of one who had so long detested me i found the more insidious  he went little abroad sometimes even refusing invitations  no he would say what do i care for these thickheaded bonnetlairds  i will stay at home mackellar and we shall share a bottle quietly and have one of our good talks  and indeed mealtime at durrisdeer must have been a delight to any one by reason of the brilliancy of the discourse  he would often express wonder at his former indifference to my society  but you see he would add we were upon opposite sides  and so we are today but let us never speak of that  i would think much less of you if you were not staunch to your employer  you are to consider he seemed to me quite impotent for any evil and how it is a most engaging form of flattery when after many years tardy justice is done to a mans character and parts  but i have no thought to excuse myself  i was to blame i let him cajole me and in short i think the watchdog was going sound asleep when he was suddenly aroused  i should say the indian was continually travelling to and fro in the house  he never spoke save in his own dialect and with the master walked without sound and was always turning up where you would least expect him fallen into a deep abstraction from which he would start upon your coming to mock you with one of his grovelling obeisances  he seemed so quiet so frail and so wrapped in his own fancies that i came to pass him over without much regard or even to pity him for a harmless exile from his country  and yet without doubt the creature was still eavesdropping and without doubt it was through his stealth and my security that our secret reached the master  it was one very wild night after supper and when we had been making more than usually merry that the blow fell on me  this is all very fine says the master but we should do better to be buckling our valise  why so i cried  are you leaving  we are all leaving tomorrow in the morning said he  for the port of glascow first thence for the province of new york  i suppose i must have groaned aloud  yes he continued i boasted i said a week and it has taken me near twenty days  but never mind i shall make it up i will go the faster  have you the money for this voyage i asked  dear and ingenuous personage i have said he  blame me if you choose for my duplicity but while i have been wringing shillings from my daddy i had a stock of my own put by against a rainy day you will pay for your own passage if you choose to accompany us on our flank march i have enough for secundra and myself but not more  enough to be dangerous not enough to be generous  there is however an outside seat upon the chaise which i will let you have upon a moderate commutation so that the whole menagerie can go together  the housedog the monkey and the tiger  i go with you said i  i count upon it said the master  you have seen me foiled i mean you shall see me victorious  to gain that i will risk wetting you like a sop in this wild weather  and at least i added you know very well you could not throw me off  not easily said he  you put your finger on the point with your usual excellent good sense  i never fight with the inevitable  i suppose it is useless to appeal to you said i  believe me perfectly said he  and yet if you would give me time i could write   i began  and what would be my lord durrisdeers answer asks he  aye said i that is the rub  and at any rate how much more expeditions that i should go myself says he  but all this is quite a waste of breath  at seven tomorrow the chaise will be at the door  for i start from the door mackellar i do not skulk through woods and take my chaise upon the wayside  shall we say at eagles  my mind was now thoroughly made up  can you spare me quarter of an hour at st brides said i  i have a little necessary business with carlyle  an hour if you prefer said he  i do not seek to deny that the money for your seat is an object to me and you could always get the first to glascow with saddlehorses  well said i i never thought to leave old scotland  it will brisken you up says he  this will be an ill journey for some one i said  i think sir for you  something speaks in my bosom and so much it says plain  that this is an illomened journey  if you take to prophecy says he listen to that  there came up a violent squall off the open solway and the rain was dashed on the great windows  do ye ken what that bodes warlock said he in a broad accent that therell be a man mackellar unco sick at sea  when i got to my chamber i sat there under a painful excitation hearkening to the turmoil of the gale which struck full upon that gable of the house  what with the pressure on my spirits the eldritch cries of the wind among the turrettops and the perpetual trepidation of the masoned house sleep fled my eyelids utterly  i sat by my taper looking on the black panes of the window where the storm appeared continually on the point of bursting in its entrance and upon that empty field i beheld a perspective of consequences that made the hair to rise upon my scalp  the child corrupted the home broken up my master dead or worse than dead my mistress plunged in desolation  all these i saw before me painted brightly on the darkness and the outcry of the wind appeared to mock at my inaction    chapter ix  mr mackellars journey with the master    the chaise came to the door in a strong drenching mist  we took our leave in silence  the house of durrisdeer standing with dropping gutters and windows closed like a place dedicate to melancholy  i observed the master kept his head out looking back on these splashed walls and glimmering roofs till they were suddenly swallowed in the mist and i must suppose some natural sadness fell upon the man at this departure or was it some provision of the end  at least upon our mounting the long brae from durrisdeer as we walked side by side in the wet he began first to whistle and then to sing the saddest of our country tunes which sets folk weeping in a tavern wandering willie  the set of words he used with it i have not heard elsewhere and could never come by any copy but some of them which were the most appropriate to our departure linger in my memory  one verse began    home was home then my dear full of kindly faces home was home then my dear happy for the child   and ended somewhat thus    now when day dawns on the brow of the moorland lone stands the house and the chimneystone is cold lone let it stand now the folks are all departed the kind hearts the true hearts that loved the place of old   i could never be a judge of the merit of these verses they were so hallowed by the melancholy of the air and were sung or rather soothed to me by a mastersinger at a time so fitting  he looked in my face when he had done and saw that my eyes watered  ah  mackellar said he do you think i have never a regret  i do not think you could be so bad a man said i if you had not all the machinery to be a good one  no not all says he  not all  you are there in error  the malady of not wanting my evangelist  but methought he sighed as he mounted again into the chaise  all day long we journeyed in the same miserable weather  the mist besetting us closely the heavens incessantly weeping on my head the road lay over moorish hills where was no sound but the crying of moorfowl in the wet heather and the pouring of the swollen burns  sometimes i would doze off in slumber when i would find myself plunged at once in some foul and ominous nightmare from the which i would awake strangling  sometimes if the way was steep and the wheels turning slowly i would overhear the voices from within talking in that tropical tongue which was to me as inarticulate as the piping of the fowls  sometimes at a longer ascent the master would set foot to ground and walk by my side mostly without speech  and all the time sleeping or waking i beheld the same black perspective of approaching ruin and the same pictures rose in my view only they were now painted upon hillside mist  one i remember stood before me with the colours of a true illusion  it showed me my lord seated at a table in a small room his head which was at first buried in his hands he slowly raised and turned upon me a countenance from which hope had fled  i saw it first on the black windowpanes my last night in durrisdeer it haunted and returned upon me half the voyage through and yet it was no effect of lunacy for i have come to a ripe old age with no decay of my intelligence nor yet as i was then tempted to suppose a heavensent warning of the future for all manner of calamities befell not that calamity  and i saw many pitiful sights but never that one  it was decided we should travel on all night and it was singular once the dusk had fallen my spirits somewhat rose  the bright lamps shining forth into the mist and on the smoking horses and the hodding postboy gave me perhaps an outlook intrinsically more cheerful than what day had shown or perhaps my mind had become wearied of its melancholy  at least i spent some waking hours not without satisfaction in my thoughts although wet and weary in my body and fell at last into a natural slumber without dreams yet i must have been at work even in the deepest of my sleep and at work with at least a measure of intelligence  for i started broad awake in the very act of crying out to myself   home was home then my dear happy for the child   stricken to find in it an appropriateness which i had not yesterday observed to the masters detestable purpose in the present journey  we were then close upon the city of glascow where we were soon breakfasting together at an inn and where as the devil would have it we found a ship in the very article of sailing  we took our places in the cabin and two days after carried our effects on board  her name was the nonesuch a very ancient ship and very happily named  by all accounts this should be her last voyage people shook their heads upon the quays and i had several warnings offered me by strangers in the street to the effect that she was rotten as a cheese too deeply loaden and must infallibly founder if we met a gale  from this it fell out we were the only passengers the captain mcmurtrie was a silent absorbed man with the glascow or gaelic accent the mates ignorant rough seafarers come in through the hawsehole and the master and i were cast upon each others company  the nonesuch carried a fair wind out of the clyde and for near upon a week we enjoyed bright weather and a sense of progress  i found myself to my wonder a born seaman in so far at least as i was never sick yet i was far from tasting the usual serenity of my health  whether it was the motion of the ship on the billows the confinement the salted food or all of these together i suffered from a blackness of spirit and a painful strain upon my temper the nature of my errand on that ship perhaps contributed i think it did no more the malady whatever it was sprang from my environment and if the ship were not to blame then it was the master  hatred and fear are ill bedfellows but to my shame be it spoken i have tasted those in other places lain down and got up with them and eaten and drunk with them and yet never before nor after have i been so poisoned through and through in soul and body as i was on board the nonesuch  i freely confess my enemy set me a fair example of forbearance in our worst days displayed the most patient geniality holding me in conversation as long as i would suffer and when i had rebuffed his civility stretching himself on deck to read  the book he had on board with him was mr richardsons famous clarissa and among other small attentions he would read me passages aloud nor could any elocutionist have given with greater potency the pathetic portions of that work  i would retort upon him with passages out of the bible which was all my library  and very fresh to me my religious duties i grieve to say it being always and even to this day extremely neglected  he tasted the merits of the word like the connoisseur he was and would sometimes take it from my hand turn the leaves over like a man that knew his way and give me with his fine declamation a roland for my oliver  but it was singular how little he applied his reading to himself it passed high above his head like summer thunder  lovelace and clarissa the tales of davids generosity the psalms of his penitence the solemn questions of the book of job the touching poetry of isaiah  they were to him a source of entertainment only like the scraping of a fiddle in a change house  this outer sensibility and inner toughness set me against him it seemed of a piece with that impudent grossness which i knew to underlie the veneer of his fine manners and sometimes my gorge rose against him as though he were deformed  and sometimes i would draw away as though from something partly spectral  i had moments when i thought of him as of a man of pasteboard  as though if one should strike smartly through the buckram of his countenance there would be found a mere vacuity within  this horror not merely fanciful i think vastly increased my detestation of his neighbourhood i began to feel something shiver within me on his drawing near i had at times a longing to cry out there were days when i thought i could have struck him  this frame of mind was doubtless helped by shame because i had dropped during our last days at durrisdeer into a certain toleration of the man and if any one had then told me i should drop into it again i must have laughed in his face  it is possible he remained unconscious of this extreme fever of my resentment yet i think he was too quick and rather that he had fallen in a long life of idleness into a positive need of company which obliged him to confront and tolerate my unconcealed aversion  certain at least that he loved the note of his own tongue as indeed he entirely loved all the parts and properties of himself a sort of imbecility which almost necessarily attends on wickedness  i have seen him driven when i proved recalcitrant to long discourses with the skipper and this although the man plainly testified his weariness fiddling miserably with both hand and foot and replying only with a grunt  after the first week out we fell in with foul winds and heavy weather  the sea was high  the nonesuch being an oldfashioned ship and badly loaden rolled beyond belief so that the skipper trembled for his masts and i for my life  we made no progress on our course  an unbearable illhumour settled on the ship  men mates and master girding at one another all day long  a saucy word on the one hand and a blow on the other made a daily incident  there were times when the whole crew refused their duty and we of the afterguard were twice got under arms  being the first time that ever i bore weapons  in the fear of mutiny  in the midst of our evil season sprang up a hurricane of wind so that all supposed she must go down  i was shut in the cabin from noon of one day till sundown of the next the master was somewhere lashed on deck  secundra had eaten of some drug and lay insensible so you may say i passed these hours in an unbroken solitude  at first i was terrified beyond motion and almost beyond thought my mind appearing to be frozen  presently there stole in on me a ray of comfort  if the nonesuch foundered she would carry down with her into the deeps of that unsounded sea the creature whom we all so feared and hated there would be no more master of ballantrae the fish would sport among his ribs his schemes all brought to nothing his harmless enemies at peace  at first i have said it was but a ray of comfort but it had soon grown to be broad sunshine  the thought of the mans death of his deletion from this world which he embittered for so many took possession of my mind  i hugged it i found it sweet in my belly i conceived the ships last plunge the sea bursting upon all sides into the cabin the brief mortal conflict there all by myself in that closed place i numbered the horrors i had almost said with satisfaction i felt i could bear all and more if the nonesuch carried down with her overtook by the same ruin the enemy of my poor masters house  towards noon of the second day the screaming of the wind abated the ship lay not so perilously over and it began to be clear to me that we were past the height of the tempest  as i hope for mercy i was singly disappointed  in the selfishness of that vile absorbing passion of hatred i forgot the case of our innocent shipmates and thought but of myself and my enemy  for myself i was already old i had never been young i was not formed for the worlds pleasures i had few affections it mattered not the toss of a silver tester whether i was drowned there and then in the atlantic or dribbled out a few more years to die perhaps no less terribly in a deserted sickbed  down i went upon my knees  holding on by the locker or else i had been instantly dashed across the tossing cabin  and lifting up my voice in the midst of that clamour of the abating hurricane impiously prayed for my own death  o god i cried i would be liker a man if i rose and struck this creature down but thou madest me a coward from my mothers womb o lord thou madest me so thou knowest my weakness thou knowest that any face of death will set me shaking in my shoes  but lo here is thy servant ready his mortal weakness laid aside  let me give my life for this creatures take the two of them lord take the two and have mercy on the innocent  in some such words as these only yet more irreverent and with more sacred adjurations i continued to pour forth my spirit  god heard me not i must suppose in mercy and i was still absorbed in my agony of supplication when some one removing the tarpaulin cover let the light of the sunset pour into the cabin  i stumbled to my feet ashamed and was seized with surprise to find myself totter and ache like one that had been stretched upon the rack  secundra dass who had slept off the effects of his drug stood in a corner not far off gazing at me with wild eyes and from the open skylight the captain thanked me for my supplications  its you that saved the ship mr mackellar says he  there is no craft of seamanship that could have kept her floating  well may we say except the lord the city keep the watchmen watch in vain  i was abashed by the captains error abashed also by the surprise and fear with which the indian regarded me at first and the obsequious civilities with which he soon began to cumber me  i know now that he must have overheard and comprehended the peculiar nature of my prayers  it is certain of course that he at once disclosed the matter to his patron and looking back with greater knowledge i can now understand what so much puzzled me at the moment those singular and so to speak approving smiles with which the master honoured me  similarly i can understand a word that i remember to have fallen from him in conversation that same night when holding up his hand and smiling ah mackellar said he not every man is so great a coward as he thinks he is  nor yet so good a christian  he did not guess how true he spoke  for the fact is the thoughts which had come to me in the violence of the storm retained their hold upon my spirit and the words that rose to my lips unbidden in the instancy of prayer continued to sound in my ears  with what shameful consequences it is fitting i should honestly relate for i could not support a part of such disloyalty as to describe the sins of others and conceal my own  the wind fell but the sea hove ever the higher  all night the nonesuch rolled outrageously the next day dawned and the next and brought no change  to cross the cabin was scarce possible old experienced seamen were cast down upon the deck and one cruelly mauled in the concussion every board and block in the old ship cried out aloud and the great bell by the anchorbitts continually and dolefully rang  one of these days the master and i sate alone together at the break of the poop  i should say the nonesuch carried a high raised poop  about the top of it ran considerable bulwarks which made the ship unweatherly and these as they approached the front on each side ran down in a fine old fashioned carven scroll to join the bulwarks of the waist  from this disposition which seems designed rather for ornament than use it followed there was a discontinuance of protection  and that besides at the very margin of the elevated part where in certain movements of the ship it might be the most needful  it was here we were sitting  our feet hanging down the master betwixt me and the side and i holding on with both hands to the grating of the cabin skylight for it struck me it was a dangerous position the more so as i had continually before my eyes a measure of our evolutions in the person of the master which stood out in the break of the bulwarks against the sun  now his head would be in the zenith and his shadow fall quite beyond the nonesuch on the farther side and now he would swing down till he was underneath my feet and the line of the sea leaped high above him like the ceiling of a room  i looked on upon this with a growing fascination as birds are said to look on snakes  my mind besides was troubled with an astonishing diversity of noises for now that we had all sails spread in the vain hope to bring her to the sea the ship sounded like a factory with their reverberations we spoke first of the mutiny with which we had been threatened this led us on to the topic of assassination and that offered a temptation to the master more strong than he was able to resist he must tell me a tale and show me at the same time how clever he was and how wicked  it was a thing he did always with affectation and display generally with a good effect  but this tale told in a high key in the midst of so great a tumult and by a narrator who was one moment looking down at me from the skies and the next up from under the soles of my feet  this particular tale i say took hold upon me in a degree quite singular  my friend the count it was thus that he began his story had for an enemy a certain german baron a stranger in rome  it matters not what was the ground of the counts enmity but as he had a firm design to be revenged and that with safety to himself he kept it secret even from the baron  indeed that is the first principle of vengeance and hatred betrayed is hatred impotent the count was a man of a curious searching mind he had something of the artist if anything fell for him to do it must always be done with an exact perfection not only as to the result but in the very means and instruments or he thought the thing miscarried it chanced he was one day riding in the outer suburbs when he came to a disused byroad branching off into the moor which lies about rome  on the one hand was an ancient roman tomb on the other a deserted house in a garden of evergreen trees  this road brought him presently into a field of ruins in the midst of which in the side of a hill he saw an open door and not far off a single stunted pine no greater than a currantbush  the place was desert and very secret a voice spoke in the counts bosom that there was something here to his advantage  he tied his horse to the pine tree took his flint and steel in his hand to make a light and entered into the hill  the doorway opened on a passage of old roman masonry which shortly after branched in two  the count took the turning to the right and followed it groping forward in the dark till he was brought up by a kind of fence about elbowhigh which extended quite across the passage  sounding forward with his foot he found an edge of polished stone and then vacancy  all his curiosity was now awakened and getting some rotten sticks that lay about the floor he made a fire  in front of him was a profound well doubtless some neighbouring peasant had once used it for his water and it was he that had set up the fence  a long while the count stood leaning on the rail and looking down into the pit  it was of roman foundation and like all that nation set their hands to built as for eternity the sides were still straight and the joints smooth to a man who should fall in no escape was possible  now the count was thinking a strong impulsion brought me to this place  what for what have i gained why should i be sent to gaze into this well when the rail of the fence gave suddenly under his weight and he came within an ace of falling headlong in  leaping back to save himself he trod out the last flicker of his fire which gave him thenceforward no more light only an incommoding smoke  was i sent here to my death says he and shook from head to foot  and then a thought flashed in his mind  he crept forth on hands and knees to the brink of the pit and felt above him in the air  the rail had been fast to a pair of uprights it had only broken from the one and still depended from the other  the count set it back again as he had found it so that the place meant death to the first comer and groped out of the catacomb like a sick man  the next day riding in the corso with the baron he purposely betrayed a strong preoccupation  the other as he had designed inquired into the cause and he after some fencing admitted that his spirits had been dashed by an unusual dream  this was calculated to draw on the baron  a superstitious man who affected the scorn of superstition  some rallying followed and then the count as if suddenly carried away called on his friend to beware for it was of him that he had dreamed  you know enough of human nature my excellent mackellar to be certain of one thing  i mean that the baron did not rest till he had heard the dream  the count sure that he would never desist kept him in play till his curiosity was highly inflamed and then suffered himself with seeming reluctance to be overborne  i warn you says he evil will come of it something tells me so  but since there is to be no peace either for you or me except on this condition the blame be on your own head  this was the dream i beheld you riding i know not where yet i think it must have been near rome for on your one hand was an ancient tomb and on the other a garden of evergreen trees  methought i cried and cried upon you to come back in a very agony of terror whether you heard me i know not but you went doggedly on  the road brought you to a desert place among ruins where was a door in a hillside and hard by the door a misbegotten pine  here you dismounted i still crying on you to beware tied your horse to the pinetree and entered resolutely in by the door within it was dark but in my dream i could still see you and still besought you to hold back  you felt your way along the righthand wall took a branching passage to the right and came to a little chamber where was a well with a railing  at this  i know not why  my alarm for you increased a thousandfold so that i seemed to scream myself hoarse with warnings crying it was still time and bidding you begone at once from that vestibule  such was the word i used in my dream and it seemed then to have a clear significancy but today and awake i profess i know not what it means  to all my outcry you rendered not the least attention leaning the while upon the rail and looking down intently in the water  and then there was made to you a communication i do not think i even gathered what it was but the fear of it plucked me clean out of my slumber and i awoke shaking and sobbing  and now continues the count i thank you from my heart for your insistency  this dream lay on me like a load and now i have told it in plain words and in the broad daylight it seems no great matter  i do not know says the baron  it is in some points strange  a communication did you say  oh it is an odd dream it will make a story to amuse our friends  i am not so sure says the count  i am sensible of some reluctancy  let us rather forget it  by all means says the baron  and in fact the dream was not again referred to  some days after the count proposed a ride in the fields which the baron since they were daily growing faster friends very readily accepted  on the way back to rome the count led them insensibly by a particular route presently he reined in his horse clapped his hand before his eyes and cried out aloud  then he showed his face again which was now quite white for he was a consummate actor and stared upon the baron  what ails you cries the baron  what is wrong with you  nothing cries the count  it is nothing  a seizure i know not what  let us hurry back to rome  but in the meanwhile the baron had looked about him and there on the lefthand side of the way as they went back to rome he saw a dusty byroad with a tomb upon the one hand and a garden of evergreen trees upon the other  yes says he with a changed voice  let us by all means hurry back to rome  i fear you are not well in health  oh for gods sake cries the count shuddering back to rome and let me get to bed  they made their return with scarce a word and the count who should by rights have gone into society took to his bed and gave out he had a touch of country fever  the next day the barons horse was found tied to the pine but himself was never heard of from that hour  and now was that a murder says the master breaking sharply off  are you sure he was a count i asked  i am not certain of the title said he but he was a gentleman of family  and the lord deliver you mackellar from an enemy so subtile  these last words he spoke down at me smiling from high above the next he was under my feet  i continued to follow his evolutions with a childish fixity they made me giddy and vacant and i spoke as in a dream  he hated the baron with a great hatred i asked  his belly moved when the man came near him said the master  i have felt that same said i  verily cries the master  here is news indeed  i wonder  do i flatter myself or am i the cause of these ventral perturbations  he was quite capable of choosing out a graceful posture even with no one to behold him but myself and all the more if there were any element of peril  he sat now with one knee flung across the other his arms on his bosom fitting the swing of the ship with an exquisite balance such as a featherweight might overthrow  all at once i had the vision of my lord at the table with his head upon his hands only now when he showed me his countenance it was heavy with reproach  the words of my own prayer  i were liker a man if i struck this creature down  shot at the same time into my memory  i called my energies together and the ship then heeling downward toward my enemy thrust at him swiftly with my foot  it was written i should have the guilt of this attempt without the profit  whether from my own uncertainty or his incredible quickness he escaped the thrust leaping to his feet and catching hold at the same moment of a stay  i do not know how long a time passed by  i lying where i was upon the deck overcome with terror and remorse and shame  he standing with the stay in his hand backed against the bulwarks and regarding me with an expression singularly mingled  at last he spoke  mackellar said he i make no reproaches but i offer you a bargain  on your side i do not suppose you desire to have this exploit made public on mine i own to you freely i do not care to draw my breath in a perpetual terror of assassination by the man i sit at meat with  promise me  but no says he breaking off you are not yet in the quiet possession of your mind you might think i had extorted the promise from your weakness and i would leave no door open for casuistry to come in  that dishonesty of the conscientious  take time to meditate  with that he made off up the sliding deck like a squirrel and plunged into the cabin  about half an hour later he returned  i still lying as he had left me  now says be will you give me your troth as a christian and a faithful servant of my brothers that i shall have no more to fear from your attempts  i give it you said i  i shall require your hand upon it says he  you have the right to make conditions i replied and we shook hands  he sat down at once in the same place and the old perilous attitude  hold on cried i covering my eyes  i cannot bear to see you in that posture  the least irregularity of the sea might plunge you overboard  you are highly inconsistent he replied smiling but doing as i asked  for all that mackellar i would have you to know you have risen forty feet in my esteem  you think i cannot set a price upon fidelity  but why do you suppose i carry that secundra dass about the world with me  because he would die or do murder for me to morrow and i love him for it  well you may think it odd but i like you the better for this afternoons performance  i thought you were magnetised with the ten commandments but no  god damn my soul  he cries the old wife has blood in his body after all which does not change the fact he continued smiling again that you have done well to give your promise for i doubt if you would ever shine in your new trade  i suppose said i i should ask your pardon and gods for my attempt  at any rate i have passed my word which i will keep faithfully  but when i think of those you persecute   i paused  life is a singular thing said he and mankind a very singular people  you suppose yourself to love my brother  i assure you it is merely custom  interrogate your memory and when first you came to durrisdeer you will find you considered him a dull ordinary youth  he is as dull and ordinary now though not so young  had you instead fallen in with me you would today be as strong upon my side  i would never say you were ordinary mr bally i returned but here you prove yourself dull  you have just shown your reliance on my word  in other terms that is my conscience  the same which starts instinctively back from you like the eye from a strong light  ah says he but i mean otherwise  i mean had i met you in my youth  you are to consider i was not always as i am today nor had i met in with a friend of your description should i have ever been so  hut mr bally says i you would have made a mock of me you would never have spent ten civil words on such a squaretoes  but he was now fairly started on his new course of justification with which he wearied me throughout the remainder of the passage no doubt in the past he had taken pleasure to paint himself unnecessarily black and made a vaunt of his wickedness bearing it for a coatofarms  nor was he so illogical as to abate one item of his old confessions  but now that i know you are a human being he would say i can take the trouble to explain myself for i assure you i am human too and have my virtues like my neighbours  i say he wearied me for i had only the one word to say in answer  twenty times i must have said it  give up your present purpose and return with me to durrisdeer then i will believe you  thereupon he would shake his head at me  ah mackellar you might live a thousand years and never understand my nature he would say  this battle is now committed the hour of reflection quite past the hour for mercy not yet come  it began between us when we span a coin in the hall of durrisdeer now twenty years ago we have had our ups and downs but never either of us dreamed of giving in and as for me when my glove is cast life and honour go with it  a fig for your honour i would say  and by your leave these warlike similitudes are something too highsounding for the matter in hand  you want some dirty money there is the bottom of your contention and as for your means what are they to stir up sorrow in a family that never harmed you to debauch if you can your own nephew and to wring the heart of your born brother  a footpad that kills an old granny in a woollen mutch with a dirty bludgeon and that for a shillingpiece and a paper of snuff  there is all the warrior that you are  when i would attack him thus or somewhat thus he would smile and sigh like a man misunderstood  once i remember he defended himself more at large and had some curious sophistries worth repeating for a light upon his character  you are very like a civilian to think war consists in drums and banners said he  war as the ancients said very wisely is ultima ratio  when we take our advantage unrelentingly then we make war  ah mackellar you are a devil of a soldier in the stewards room at durrisdeer or the tenants do you sad injustice  i think little of what war is or is not i replied  but you weary me with claiming my respect  your brother is a good man and you are a bad one  neither more nor less  had i been alexander   he began  it is so we all dupe ourselves i cried  had i been st paul it would have been all one i would have made the same hash of that career that you now see me making of my own  i tell you he cried bearing down my interruption had i been the least petty chieftain in the highlands had i been the least king of naked negroes in the african desert my people would have adored me  a bad man am i  ah but i was born for a good tyrant ask secundra dass he will tell you i treat him like a son  cast in your lot with me tomorrow become my slave my chattel a thing i can command as i command the powers of my own limbs and spirit  you will see no more that dark side that i turn upon the world in anger  i must have all or none  but where all is given i give it back with usury  i have a kingly nature  there is my loss  it has been hitherto rather the loss of others i remarked which seems a little on the hither side of royalty  tillyvally cried he  even now i tell you i would spare that family in which you take so great an interest  yes even now  to morrow i would leave them to their petty welfare and disappear in that forest of cutthroats and thimbleriggers that we call the world  i would do it tomorrow says he  only  only    only what i asked  only they must beg it on their bended knees  i think in public too he added smiling  indeed mackellar i doubt if there be a hall big enough to serve my purpose for that act of reparation  vanity vanity i moralised  to think that this great force for evil should be swayed by the same sentiment that sets a lassie mincing to her glass  oh there are double words for everything  the word that swells the word that belittles you cannot fight me with a word said he you said the other day that i relied on your conscience  were i in your humour of detraction i might say i built upon your vanity it is your pretension to be un homme de parole tis mine not to accept defeat  call it vanity call it virtue call it greatness of soul  what signifies the expression  but recognise in each of us a common strain  that we both live for an idea  it will be gathered from so much familiar talk and so much patience on both sides that we now lived together upon excellent terms  such was again the fact and this time more seriously than before  apart from disputations such as that which i have tried to reproduce not only consideration reigned but i am tempted to say even kindness  when i fell sick as i did shortly after our great storm he sat by my berth to entertain me with his conversation and treated me with excellent remedies which i accepted with security  himself commented on the circumstance you see says he you begin to know me better  a very little while ago upon this lonely ship where no one but myself has any smattering of science you would have made sure i had designs upon your life  and observe it is since i found you had designs upon my own that i have shown you most respect  you will tell me if this speaks of a small mind  i found little to reply  in so far as regarded myself i believed him to mean well i am perhaps the more a dupe of his dissimulation but i believed and i still believe that he regarded me with genuine kindness  singular and sad fact so soon as this change began my animosity abated and these haunting visions of my master passed utterly away  so that perhaps there was truth in the mans last vaunting word to me uttered on the second day of july when our long voyage was at last brought almost to an end and we lay becalmed at the sea end of the vast harbour of new york in a gasping heat which was presently exchanged for a surprising waterfall of rain  i stood on the poop regarding the green shores near at hand and now and then the light smoke of the little town our destination  and as i was even then devising how to steal a march on my familiar enemy i was conscious of a shade of embarrassment when he approached me with his hand extended  i am now to bid you farewell said he and that for ever  for now you go among my enemies where all your former prejudices will revive  i never yet failed to charm a person when i wanted even you my good friend  to call you so for once  even you have now a very different portrait of me in your memory and one that you will never quite forget  the voyage has not lasted long enough or i should have wrote the impression deeper  but now all is at an end and we are again at war  judge by this little interlude how dangerous i am and tell those fools  pointing with his finger to the town  to think twice and thrice before they set me at defiance    chapter x  passages at new york    i have mentioned i was resolved to steal a march upon the master and this with the complicity of captain mcmurtrie was mighty easily effected  a boat being partly loaded on the one side of our ship and the master placed on board of it the while a skiff put off from the other carrying me alone  i had no more trouble in finding a direction to my lords house whither i went at top speed and which i found to be on the outskirts of the place a very suitable mansion in a fine garden with an extraordinary large barn byre and stable all in one  it was here my lord was walking when i arrived indeed it had become his chief place of frequentation and his mind was now filled with farming  i burst in upon him breathless and gave him my news  which was indeed no news at all several ships having outsailed the nonesuch in the interval  we have been expecting you long said my lord and indeed of late days ceased to expect you any more  i am glad to take your hand again mackellar  i thought you had been at the bottom of the sea  ah my lord would god i had cried i  things would have been better for yourself  not in the least says he grimly  i could not ask better there is a long score to pay and now  at last  i can begin to pay it  i cried out against his security  oh says he this is not durrisdeer and i have taken my precautions  his reputation awaits him i have prepared a welcome for my brother  indeed fortune has served me for i found here a merchant of albany who knew him after the 45 and had mighty convenient suspicions of a murder  some one of the name of chew it was another albanian  no one here will be surprised if i deny him my door he will not be suffered to address my children nor even to salute my wife  as for myself i make so much exception for a brother that he may speak to me  i should lose my pleasure else says my lord rubbing his palms  presently he bethought himself and set men off running with billets to summon the magnates of the province  i cannot recall what pretext he employed at least it was successful and when our ancient enemy appeared upon the scene he found my lord pacing in front of his house under some trees of shade with the governor upon one hand and various notables upon the other  my lady who was seated in the verandah rose with a very pinched expression and carried her children into the house  the master well dressed and with an elegant walkingsword bowed to the company in a handsome manner and nodded to my lord with familiarity  my lord did not accept the salutation but looked upon his brother with bended brows  well sir says he at last what ill wind brings you hither of all places where to our common disgrace your reputation has preceded you  your lordship is pleased to be civil said the master with a fine start  i am pleased to be very plain returned my lord because it is needful you should clearly understand your situation  at home where you were so little known it was still possible to keep appearances that would be quite vain in this province and i have to tell you that i am quite resolved to wash my hands of you  you have already ruined me almost to the door as you ruined my father before me  whose heart you also broke  your crimes escape the law but my friend the governor has promised protection to my family  have a care sir cries my lord shaking his cane at him if you are observed to utter two words to any of my innocent household the law shall be stretched to make you smart for it  ah says the master very slowly  and so this is the advantage of a foreign land  these gentlemen are unacquainted with our story i perceive  they do not know that i am the lord durrisdeer they do not know you are my younger brother sitting in my place under a sworn family compact they do not know or they would not be seen with you in familiar correspondence that every acre is mine before god almighty  and every doit of the money you withhold from me you do it as a thief a perjurer and a disloyal brother  general clinton i cried do not listen to his lies  i am the steward of the estate and there is not one word of truth in it the man is a forfeited rebel turned into a hired spy  there is his story in two words  it was thus that in the heat of the moment i let slip his infamy  fellow said the governor turning his face sternly on the master i know more of you than you think for  we have some broken ends of your adventures in the provinces which you will do very well not to drive me to investigate  there is the disappearance of mr jacob chew with all his merchandise there is the matter of where you came ashore from with so much money and jewels when you were picked up by a bermudan out of albany believe me if i let these matters lie it is in commiseration for your family and out of respect for my valued friend lord durrisdeer  there was a murmur of applause from the provincials  i should have remembered how a title would shine out in such a hole as this says the master white as a sheet  no matter how unjustly come by  it remains for me then to die at my lords door where my dead body will form a very cheerful ornament  away with your affectations cries my lord  you know very well i have no such meaning only to protect myself from calumny and my home from your intrusion  i offer you a choice  either i shall pay your passage home on the first ship when you may perhaps be able to resume your occupations under government although god knows i would rather see you on the highway  or if that likes you not stay here and welcome  i have inquired the least sum on which body and soul can be decently kept together in new york so much you shall have paid weekly and if you cannot labour with your hands to better it high time you should betake yourself to learn the condition is  that you speak with no member of my family except myself he added  i do not think i have ever seen any man so pale as was the master but he was erect and his mouth firm  i have been met here with some very unmerited insults said he from which i have certainly no idea to take refuge by flight give me your pittance i take it without shame for it is mine already  like the shirt upon your back and i choose to stay until these gentlemen shall understand me better  already they must spy the cloven hoof since with all your pretended eagerness for the family honour you take a pleasure to degrade it in my person  this is all very fine says my lord but to us who know you of old you must be sure it signifies nothing  you take that alternative out of which you think that you can make the most take it if you can in silence it will serve you better in the long run you may believe me than this ostentation of ingratitude  oh gratitude my lord cries the master with a mounting intonation and his forefinger very conspicuously lifted up  be at rest  it will not fail you  it now remains that i should salute these gentlemen whom we have wearied with our family affairs  and he bowed to each in succession settled his walkingsword and took himself off leaving every one amazed at his behaviour and me not less so at my lords   we were now to enter on a changed phase of this family division the master was by no manner of means so helpless as my lord supposed having at his hand and entirely devoted to his service an excellent artist in all sorts of goldsmith work  with my lords allowance which was not so scanty as he had described it the pair could support life and all the earnings of secundra dass might be laid upon one side for any future purpose  that this was done i have no doubt  it was in all likelihood the masters design to gather a sufficiency and then proceed in quest of that treasure which he had buried long before among the mountains to which if he had confined himself he would have been more happily inspired but unfortunately for himself and all of us he took counsel of his anger  the public disgrace of his arrival  which i sometimes wonder he could manage to survive  rankled in his bones he was in that humour when a man  in the words of the old adage  will cut off his nose to spite his face and he must make himself a public spectacle in the hopes that some of the disgrace might spatter on my lord  he chose in a poor quarter of the town a lonely small house of boards overhung with some acacias  it was furnished in front with a sort of hutch opening like that of a dogs kennel but about as high as a table from the ground in which the poor man that built it had formerly displayed some wares and it was this which took the masters fancy and possibly suggested his proceedings  it appears on board the pirate ship he had acquired some quickness with the needle  enough at least to play the part of tailor in the public eye which was all that was required by the nature of his vengeance  a placard was hung above the hutch bearing these words in something of the following disposition   james durie formerly master of ballantrae clothes neatly clouted      secundra dass decayed gentleman of india fine goldsmith work   underneath this when he had a job my gentleman sat withinside tailorwise and busily stitching  i say when he had a job but such customers as came were rather for secundra and the masters sewing would be more in the manner of penelopes  he could never have designed to gain even butter to his bread by such a means of livelihood  enough for him that there was the name of durie dragged in the dirt on the placard and the sometime heir of that proud family set up crosslegged in public for a reproach upon his brothers meanness  and in so far his device succeeded that there was murmuring in the town and a party formed highly inimical to my lord  my lords favour with the governor laid him more open on the other side my lady who was never so well received in the colony met with painful innuendoes in a party of women where it would be the topic most natural to introduce she was almost debarred from the naming of needlework and i have seen her return with a flushed countenance and vow that she would go abroad no more  in the meanwhile my lord dwelled in his decent mansion immersed in farming a popular man with his intimates and careless or unconscious of the rest  he laid on flesh had a bright busy face even the heat seemed to prosper with him and my lady  in despite of her own annoyances  daily blessed heaven her father should have left her such a paradise  she had looked on from a window upon the masters humiliation and from that hour appeared to feel at ease  i was not so sure myself as time went on there seemed to me a something not quite wholesome in my lords condition  happy he was beyond a doubt but the grounds of this felicity were wont even in the bosom of his family he brooded with manifest delight upon some private thought and i conceived at last the suspicion quite unworthy of us both that he kept a mistress somewhere in the town  yet he went little abroad and his day was very fully occupied indeed there was but a single period and that pretty early in the morning while mr alexander was at his lessonbook of which i was not certain of the disposition  it should be borne in mind in the defence of that which i now did that i was always in some fear my lord was not quite justly in his reason and with our enemy sitting so still in the same town with us i did well to be upon my guard  accordingly i made a pretext had the hour changed at which i taught mr alexander the foundation of cyphering and the mathematic and set myself instead to dog my masters footsteps  every morning fair or foul he took his goldheaded cane set his hat on the back of his head  a recent habitude which i thought to indicate a burning brow  and betook himself to make a certain circuit  at the first his way was among pleasant trees and beside a graveyard where he would sit awhile if the day were fine in meditation  presently the path turned down to the waterside and came back along the harbourfront and past the masters booth  as he approached this second part of his circuit my lord durrisdeer began to pace more leisurely like a man delighted with the air and scene and before the booth halfway between that and the waters edge would pause a little leaning on his staff  it was the hour when the master sate within upon his board and plied his needle so these two brothers would gaze upon each other with hard faces and then my lord move on again smiling to himself  it was but twice that i must stoop to that ungrateful necessity of playing spy  i was then certain of my lords purpose in his rambles and of the secret source of his delight  here was his mistress  it was hatred and not love that gave him healthful colours  some moralists might have been relieved by the discovery i confess that i was dismayed  i found this situation of two brethren not only odious in itself but big with possibilities of further evil and i made it my practice in so far as many occupations would allow to go by a shorter path and be secretly present at their meeting  coming down one day a little late after i had been near a week prevented i was struck with surprise to find a new development  i should say there was a bench against the masters house where customers might sit to parley with the shopman and here i found my lord seated nursing his cane and looking pleasantly forth upon the bay  not three feet from him sate the master stitching  neither spoke nor in this new situation did my lord so much as cut a glance upon his enemy  he tasted his neighbourhood i must suppose less indirectly in the bare proximity of person and without doubt drank deep of hateful pleasures  he had no sooner come away than i openly joined him  my lord my lord said i this is no manner of behaviour  i grow fat upon it he replied and not merely the words which were strange enough but the whole character of his expression shocked me  i warn you my lord against this indulgency of evil feeling said i  i know not to which it is more perilous the soul or the reason but you go the way to murder both  you cannot understand said he  you had never such mountains of bitterness upon your heart  and if it were no more i added you will surely goad the man to some extremity  to the contrary i am breaking his spirit says my lord   every morning for hard upon a week my lord took his same place upon the bench  it was a pleasant place under the green acacias with a sight upon the bay and shipping and a sound from some way off of marines singing at their employ  here the two sate without speech or any external movement beyond that of the needle or the master biting off a thread for he still clung to his pretence of industry and here i made a point to join them wondering at myself and my companions  if any of my lords friends went by he would hail them cheerfully and cry out he was there to give some good advice to his brother who was now to his delight grown quite industrious  and even this the master accepted with a steady countenance what was in his mind god knows or perhaps satan only  all of a sudden on a still day of what they call the indian summer when the woods were changed into gold and pink and scarlet the master laid down his needle and burst into a fit of merriment i think he must have been preparing it a long while in silence for the note in itself was pretty naturally pitched but breaking suddenly from so extreme a silence and in circumstances so averse from mirth it sounded ominously on my ear  henry said he i have for once made a false step and for once you have had the wit to profit by it  the farce of the cobbler ends today and i confess to you with my compliments that you have had the best of it  blood will out and you have certainly a choice idea of how to make yourself unpleasant  never a word said my lord it was just as though the master had not broken silence  come resumed the master do not be sulky it will spoil your attitude  you can now afford believe me to be a little gracious for i have not merely a defeat to accept  i had meant to continue this performance till i had gathered enough money for a certain purpose i confess ingenuously i have not the courage  you naturally desire my absence from this town i have come round by another way to the same idea  and i have a proposition to make or if your lordship prefers a favour to ask  ask it says my lord  you may have heard that i had once in this country a considerable treasure returned the master it matters not whether or no  such is the fact and i was obliged to bury it in a spot of which i have sufficient indications  to the recovery of this has my ambition now come down and as it is my own you will not grudge it me  go and get it says my lord  i make no opposition  yes said the master but to do so i must find men and carriage  the way is long and rough and the country infested with wild indians  advance me only so much as shall be needful  either as a lump sum in lieu of my allowance or if you prefer it as a loan which i shall repay on my return  and then if you so decide you may have seen the last of me  my lord stared him steadily in the eyes there was a hard smile upon his face but he uttered nothing  henry said the master with a formidable quietness and drawing at the same time somewhat back  henry i had the honour to address you  let us be stepping homeward says my lord to me who was plucking at his sleeve and with that he rose stretched himself settled his hat and still without a syllable of response began to walk steadily along the shore  i hesitated awhile between the two brothers so serious a climax did we seem to have reached  but the master had resumed his occupation his eyes lowered his hand seemingly as deft as ever and i decided to pursue my lord  are you mad i cried so soon as i had overtook him  would you cast away so fair an opportunity  is it possible you should still believe in him inquired my lord almost with a sneer  i wish him forth of this town i cried  i wish him anywhere and anyhow but as he is  i have said my say returned my lord and you have said yours there let it rest  but i was bent on dislodging the master  that sight of him patiently returning to his needlework was more than my imagination could digest  there was never a man made and the master the least of any that could accept so long a series of insults  the air smelt blood to me  and i vowed there should be no neglect of mine if through any chink of possibility crime could be yet turned aside  that same day therefore i came to my lord in his business room where he sat upon some trivial occupation  my lord said i i have found a suitable investment for my small economies  but these are unhappily in scotland it will take some time to lift them and the affair presses  could your lordship see his way to advance me the amount against my note  he read me awhile with keen eyes  i have never inquired into the state of your affairs mackellar says he  beyond the amount of your caution you may not be worth a farthing for what i know  i have been a long while in your service and never told a lie nor yet asked a favour for myself said i until today  a favour for the master he returned quietly  do you take me for a fool mackellar  understand it once and for all i treat this beast in my own way fear nor favour shall not move me and before i am hoodwinked it will require a trickster less transparent than yourself  i ask service loyal service not that you should make and mar behind my back and steal my own money to defeat me  my lord said i these are very unpardonable expressions  think once more mackellar he replied and you will see they fit the fact  it is your own subterfuge that is unpardonable deny if you can that you designed this money to evade my orders with and i will ask your pardon freely  if you cannot you must have the resolution to hear your conduct go by its own name  if you think i had any design but to save you   i began  oh my old friend said he you know very well what i think here is my hand to you with all my heart but of money not one rap  defeated upon this side i went straight to my room wrote a letter ran with it to the harbour for i knew a ship was on the point of sailing and came to the masters door a little before dusk  entering without the form of any knock i found him sitting with his indian at a simple meal of maize porridge with some milk the house within was clean and poor only a few books upon a shelf distinguished it and in one corner secundras little bench  mr bally said i i have near five hundred pounds laid by in scotland the economies of a hard life  a letter goes by yon ship to have it lifted  have so much patience till the return ship comes in and it is all yours upon the same condition you offered to my lord this morning  he rose from the table came forward took me by the shoulders and looked me in the face smiling  and yet you are very fond of money said he  and yet you love money beyond all things else except my brother  i fear old age and poverty said i which is another matter  i will never quarrel for a name  call it so he replied  ah mackellar mackellar if this were done from any love to me how gladly would i close upon your offer  and yet i eagerly answered  i say it to my shame but i cannot see you in this poor place without compunction  it is not my single thought nor my first and yet its there  i would gladly see you delivered  i do not offer it in love and far from that but as god judges me  and i wonder at it too  quite without enmity  ah says he still holding my shoulders and now gently shaking me you think of me more than you suppose  and i wonder at it too he added repeating my expression and i suppose something of my voice  you are an honest man and for that cause i spare you  spare me i cried  spare you he repeated letting me go and turning away  and then fronting me once more  you little know what i would do with it mackellar  did you think i had swallowed my defeat indeed listen  my life has been a series of unmerited castbacks  that fool prince charlie mismanaged a most promising affair  there fell my first fortune  in paris i had my foot once more high upon the ladder  that time it was an accident a letter came to the wrong hand and i was bare again  a third time i found my opportunity i built up a place for myself in india with an infinite patience and then clive came my rajah was swallowed up and i escaped out of the convulsion like another aeneas with secundra dass upon my back  three times i have had my hand upon the highest station  and i am not yet threeandforty  i know the world as few men know it when they come to die  court and camp the east and the west i know where to go i see a thousand openings  i am now at the height of my resources sound of health of inordinate ambition  well all this i resign i care not if i die and the world never hear of me i care only for one thing and that i will have  mind yourself lest when the roof falls you too should be crushed under the ruins   as i came out of his house all hope of intervention quite destroyed i was aware of a stir on the harbourside and raising my eyes there was a great ship newly come to anchor  it seems strange i could have looked upon her with so much indifference for she brought death to the brothers of durrisdeer  after all the desperate episodes of this contention the insults the opposing interests the fraternal duel in the shrubbery it was reserved for some poor devil in grub street scribbling for his dinner and not caring what he scribbled to cast a spell across four thousand miles of the salt sea and send forth both these brothers into savage and wintry deserts there to die  but such a thought was distant from my mind and while all the provincials were fluttered about me by the unusual animation of their port i passed throughout their midst on my return homeward quite absorbed in the recollection of my visit and the masters speech  the same night there was brought to us from the ship a little packet of pamphlets  the next day my lord was under engagement to go with the governor upon some party of pleasure the time was nearly due and i left him for a moment alone in his room and skimming through the pamphlets  when i returned his head had fallen upon the table his arms lying abroad amongst the crumpled papers  my lord my lord i cried as i ran forward for i supposed he was in some fit  he sprang up like a figure upon wires his countenance deformed with fury so that in a strange place i should scarce have known him  his hand at the same time flew above his head as though to strike me down  leave me alone he screeched and i fled as fast as my shaking legs would bear me for my lady  she too lost no time but when we returned he had the door locked within and only cried to us from the other side to leave him be  we looked in each others faces very white  each supposing the blow had come at last  i will write to the governor to excuse him says she  we must keep our strong friends  but when she took up the pen it flew out of her fingers  i cannot write said she  can you  i will make a shift my lady said i  she looked over me as i wrote  that will do she said when i had done  thank god mackellar i have you to lean upon  but what can it be now  what what can it be  in my own mind i believed there was no explanation possible and none required it was my fear that the mans madness had now simply burst forth its way like the longsmothered flames of a volcano but to this in mere mercy to my lady i durst not give expression  it is more to the purpose to consider our own behaviour said i must we leave him there alone  i do not dare disturb him she replied  nature may know best it may be nature that cries to be alone and we grope in the dark oh yes i would leave him as he is  i will then despatch this letter my lady and return here if you please to sit with you said i  pray do cries my lady  all afternoon we sat together mostly in silence watching my lords door  my own mind was busy with the scene that had just passed and its singular resemblance to my vision  i must say a word upon this for the story has gone abroad with great exaggeration and i have even seen it printed and my own name referred to for particulars  so much was the same  here was my lord in a room with his head upon the table and when he raised his face it wore such an expression as distressed me to the soul but the room was different my lords attitude at the table not at all the same and his face when he disclosed it expressed a painful degree of fury instead of that haunting despair which had always except once already referred to characterised it in the vision  there is the whole truth at last before the public and if the differences be great the coincidence was yet enough to fill me with uneasiness  all afternoon as i say i sat and pondered upon this quite to myself for my lady had trouble of her own and it was my last thought to vex her with fancies  about the midst of our time of waiting she conceived an ingenious scheme had mr alexander fetched and bid him knock at his fathers door  my lord sent the boy about his business but without the least violence whether of manner or expression so that i began to entertain a hope the fit was over  at last as the night fell and i was lighting a lamp that stood there trimmed the door opened and my lord stood within upon the threshold  the light was not so strong that we could read his countenance when he spoke methought his voice a little altered but yet perfectly steady  mackellar said he carry this note to its destination with your own hand  it is highly private  find the person alone when you deliver it  henry says my lady you are not ill  no no says be querulously i am occupied  not at all i am only occupied  it is a singular thing a man must be supposed to be ill when he has any business  send me supper to this room and a basket of wine  i expect the visit of a friend  otherwise i am not to be disturbed  and with that he once more shut himself in  the note was addressed to one captain harris at a tavern on the portside  i knew harris by reputation for a dangerous adventurer highly suspected of piracy in the past and now following the rude business of an indian trader  what my lord should have to say to him or he to my lord it passed my imagination to conceive  or yet how my lord had heard of him unless by a disgraceful trial from which the man was recently escaped  altogether i went upon the errand with reluctance and from the little i saw of the captain returned from it with sorrow i found him in a foulsmelling chamber sitting by a guttering candle and an empty bottle he had the remains of a military carriage or rather perhaps it was an affectation for his manners were low  tell my lord with my service that i will wait upon his lordship in the inside of half an hour says he when he had read the note and then had the servility pointing to his empty bottle to propose that i should buy him liquor  although i returned with my best speed the captain followed close upon my heels and he stayed late into the night  the cock was crowing a second time when i saw from my chamber window my lord lighting him to the gate both men very much affected with their potations and sometimes leaning one upon the other to confabulate yet the next morning my lord was abroad again early with a hundred pounds of money in his pocket  i never supposed that he returned with it and yet i was quite sure it did not find its way to the master for i lingered all morning within view of the booth  that was the last time my lord durrisdeer passed his own enclosure till we left new york he walked in his barn or sat and talked with his family all much as usual but the town saw nothing of him and his daily visits to the master seemed forgotten  nor yet did harris reappear or not until the end  i was now much oppressed with a sense of the mysteries in which we had begun to move  it was plain if only from his change of habitude my lord had something on his mind of a grave nature but what it was whence it sprang or why he should now keep the house and garden i could make no guess at  it was clear even to probation the pamphlets had some share in this revolution i read all i could find and they were all extremely insignificant and of the usual kind of party scurrility even to a high politician i could spy out no particular matter of offence and my lord was a man rather indifferent on public questions  the truth is the pamphlet which was the spring of this affair lay all the time on my lords bosom  there it was that i found it at last after he was dead in the midst of the north wilderness  in such a place in such dismal circumstances i was to read for the first time these idle lying words of a whig pamphleteer declaiming against indulgency to jacobites another notorious rebel the mr of be is to have his title restored the passage ran  this business has been long in hand since he rendered some very disgraceful services in scotland and france  his brother ld dr is known to be no better than himself in inclination and the supposed heir who is now to be set aside was bred up in the most detestable principles  in the old phrase it is six of the one and half a dozen of the other but the favour of such a reposition is too extreme to be passed over  a man in his right wits could not have cared two straws for a tale so manifestly false that government should ever entertain the notion was inconceivable to any reasoning creature unless possibly the fool that penned it and my lord though never brilliant was ever remarkable for sense  that he should credit such a rodomontade and carry the pamphlet on his bosom and the words in his heart is the clear proof of the mans lunacy  doubtless the mere mention of mr alexander and the threat directly held out against the childs succession precipitated that which had so long impended  or else my master had been truly mad for a long time and we were too dull or too much used to him and did not perceive the extent of his infirmity  about a week after the day of the pamphlets i was late upon the harbourside and took a turn towards the masters as i often did the door opened a flood of light came forth upon the road and i beheld a man taking his departure with friendly salutations  i cannot say how singularly i was shaken to recognise the adventurer harris  i could not but conclude it was the hand of my lord that had brought him there and prolonged my walk in very serious and apprehensive thought  it was late when i came home and there was my lord making up his portmanteau for a voyage  why do you come so late he cried  we leave tomorrow for albany you and i together and it is high time you were about your preparations  for albany my lord i cried  and for what earthly purpose  change of scene said he  and my lady who appeared to have been weeping gave me the signal to obey without more parley  she told me a little later when we found occasion to exchange some words that he had suddenly announced his intention after a visit from captain harris and her best endeavours whether to dissuade him from the journey or to elicit some explanation of its purpose had alike proved unavailing    chapter xi  the journey in the wilderness    we made a prosperous voyage up that fine river of the hudson the weather grateful the hills singularly beautified with the colours of the autumn  at albany we had our residence at an inn where i was not so blind and my lord not so cunning but what i could see he had some design to hold me prisoner  the work he found for me to do was not so pressing that we should transact it apart from necessary papers in the chamber of an inn nor was it of such importance that i should be set upon as many as four or five scrolls of the same document  i submitted in appearance but i took private measures on my own side and had the news of the town communicated to me daily by the politeness of our host  in this way i received at last a piece of intelligence for which i may say i had been waiting  captain harris i was told with mr mountain the trader had gone by up the river in a boat  i would have feared the landlords eye so strong the sense of some complicity upon my masters part oppressed me  but i made out to say i had some knowledge of the captain although none of mr mountain and to inquire who else was of the party  my informant knew not mr mountain had come ashore upon some needful purchases had gone round the town buying drinking and prating and it seemed the party went upon some likely venture for he had spoken much of great things he would do when he returned  no more was known for none of the rest had come ashore and it seemed they were pressed for time to reach a certain spot before the snow should fall  and sure enough the next day there fell a sprinkle even in albany but it passed as it came and was but a reminder of what lay before us  i thought of it lightly then knowing so little as i did of that inclement province  the retrospect is different and i wonder at times if some of the horror of there events which i must now rehearse flowed not from the foul skies and savage winds to which we were exposed and the agony of cold that we must suffer  the boat having passed by i thought at first we should have left the town  but no such matter  my lord continued his stay in albany where he had no ostensible affairs and kept me by him far from my due employment and making a pretence of occupation  it is upon this passage i expect and perhaps deserve censure  i was not so dull but what i had my own thoughts  i could not see the master entrust himself into the hands of harris and not suspect some underhand contrivance  harris bore a villainous reputation and he had been tampered with in private by my lord mountain the trader proved upon inquiry to be another of the same kidney the errand they were all gone upon being the recovery of illgotten treasures offered in itself a very strong incentive to foul play and the character of the country where they journeyed promised impunity to deeds of blood  well  it is true i had all these thoughts and fears and guesses of the masters fate  but you are to consider i was the same man that sought to dash him from the bulwarks of a ship in the midsea the same that a little before very impiously but sincerely offered god a bargain seeking to hire god to be my bravo  it is true again that i had a good deal melted towards our enemy  but this i always thought of as a weakness of the flesh and even culpable my mind remaining steady and quite bent against him  true yet again that it was one thing to assume on my own shoulders the guilt and danger of a criminal attempt and another to stand by and see my lord imperil and besmirch himself but this was the very ground of my inaction  for should i anyway stir in the business i might fail indeed to save the master but i could not miss to make a byword of my lord  thus it was that i did nothing and upon the same reasons i am still strong to justify my course  we lived meanwhile in albany but though alone together in a strange place had little traffic beyond formal salutations  my lord had carried with him several introductions to chief people of the town and neighbourhood others he had before encountered in new york  with this consequence that he went much abroad and i am sorry to say was altogether too convivial in his habits  i was often in bed but never asleep when he returned and there was scarce a night when he did not betray the influence of liquor  by day he would still lay upon me endless tasks which he showed considerable ingenuity to fish up and renew in the manner of penelopes web  i never refused as i say for i was hired to do his bidding but i took no pains to keep my penetration under a bushel and would sometimes smile in his face  i think i must be the devil and you michael scott i said to him one day  i have bridged tweed and split the eildons and now you set me to the rope of sand  he looked at me with shining eyes and looked away again his jaw chewing but without words  well well my lord said i your will is my pleasure  i will do this thing for the fourth time but i would beg of you to invent another task against tomorrow for by my troth i am weary of this one  you do not know what you are saying returned my lord putting on his hat and turning his back to me  it is a strange thing you should take a pleasure to annoy me  a friend  but that is a different affair  it is a strange thing  i am a man that has had illfortune all my life through  i am still surrounded by contrivances  i am always treading in plots he burst out  the whole world is banded against me  i would not talk wicked nonsense if i were you said i but i will tell you what i would do  i would put my head in cold water for you had more last night than you could carry  do ye think that said he with a manner of interest highly awakened  would that be good for me  its a thing i never tried  i mind the days when you had no call to try and i wish my lord that they were back again said i  but the plain truth is if you continue to exceed you will do yourself a mischief  i dont appear to carry drink the way i used to said my lord i get overtaken mackellar  but i will be more upon my guard  that is what i would ask of you i replied  you are to bear in mind that you are mr alexanders father  give the bairn a chance to carry his name with some responsibility  ay ay said he  yere a very sensible man mackellar and have been long in my employ  but i think if you have nothing more to say to me i will be stepping  if you have nothing more to say he added with that burning childish eagerness that was now so common with the man  no my lord i have nothing more said i dryly enough  then i think i will be stepping says my lord and stood and looked at me fidgeting with his hat which he had taken off again i suppose you will have no errands  no  i am to meet sir william johnson but i will be more upon my guard  he was silent for a time and then smiling  do you call to mind a place mackellar  its a little below engles  where the burn runs very deep under a wood of rowans  i mind being there when i was a lad  dear it comes over me like an old song  i was after the fishing and i made a bonny cast  eh but i was happy  i wonder mackellar why i am never happy now  my lord said i if you would drink with more moderation you would have the better chance  it is an old byword that the bottle is a false consoler  no doubt said he no doubt  well i think i will be going  goodmorning my lord said i  goodmorning goodmorning said he and so got himself at last from the apartment  i give that for a fair specimen of my lord in the morning and i must have described my patron very ill if the reader does not perceive a notable falling off  to behold the man thus fallen  to know him accepted among his companions for a poor muddled toper welcome if he were welcome at all for the bare consideration of his title and to recall the virtues he had once displayed against such odds of fortune was not this a thing at once to rage and to be humbled at  in his cups he was more expensive  i will give but the one scene close upon the end which is strongly marked upon my memory to this day and at the time affected me almost with horror  i was in bed lying there awake when i heard him stumbling on the stair and singing  my lord had no gift of music his brother had all the graces of the family so that when i say singing you are to understand a manner of high carolling utterance which was truly neither speech nor song  something not unlike is to be heard upon the lips of children ere they learn shame from those of a man grown elderly it had a strange effect  he opened the door with noisy precaution peered in shading his candle conceived me to slumber entered set his light upon the table and took off his hat  i saw him very plain a high feverish exultation appeared to boil in his veins and he stood and smiled and smirked upon the candle  presently he lifted up his arm snapped his fingers and fell to undress  as he did so having once more forgot my presence he took back to his singing and now i could hear the words which were those from the old song of the twa corbies endlessly repeated   and over his banes when they are bare the wind sall blaw for evermair   i have said there was no music in the man  his strains had no logical succession except in so far as they inclined a little to the minor mode but they exercised a rude potency upon the feelings and followed the words and signified the feelings of the singer with barbaric fitness  he took it first in the time and manner of a rant presently this illfavoured gleefulness abated he began to dwell upon the notes more feelingly and sank at last into a degree of maudlin pathos that was to me scarce bearable  by equal steps the original briskness of his acts declined and when he was stripped to his breeches he sat on the bedside and fell to whimpering  i know nothing less respectable than the tears of drunkenness and turned my back impatiently on this poor sight  but he had started himself i am to suppose on that slippery descent of selfpity on the which to a man unstrung by old sorrows and recent potations there is no arrest except exhaustion his tears continued to flow and the man to sit there three parts naked in the cold air of the chamber  i twitted myself alternately with inhumanity and sentimental weakness now half rising in my bed to interfere now reading myself lessons of indifference and courting slumber until upon a sudden the quantum mutatus ab illo shot into my mind and calling to remembrance his old wisdom constancy and patience i was overborne with a pity almost approaching the passionate not for my master alone but for the sons of man  at this i leaped from my place went over to his side and laid a hand on his bare shoulder which was cold as stone  he uncovered his face and showed it me all swollen and begrutten 10 like a childs and at the sight my impatience partially revived  think shame to yourself said i  this is bairnly conduct  i might have been snivelling myself if i had cared to swill my belly with wine  but i went to my bed sober like a man  come  get into yours and have done with this pitiable exhibition  oh mackellar said he my heart is wae  wae cried i  for a good cause i think  what words were these you sang as you came in  show pity to others we then can talk of pity to yourself  you can be the one thing or the other but i will be no party to halfway houses  if youre a striker strike and if youre a bleater bleat  cry cries he with a burst thats it  strike thats talking man ive stood it all too long  but when they laid a hand upon the child when the childs threatened  his momentary vigour whimpering off  my child my alexander  and he was at his tears again  i took him by the shoulders and shook him  alexander said i do you even think of him  not you  look yourself in the face like a brave man and youll find youre but a selfdeceiver  the wife the friend the child theyre all equally forgot and you sunk in a mere log of selfishness  mackellar said he with a wonderful return to his old manner and appearance you may say what you will of me but one thing i never was  i was never selfish  i will open your eyes in your despite said i  how long have we been here and how often have you written to your family  i think this is the first time you were ever separate  have you written at all  do they know if you are dead or living  i had caught him here too openly it braced his better nature there was no more weeping he thanked me very penitently got to bed and was soon fast asleep and the first thing he did the next morning was to sit down and begin a letter to my lady  a very tender letter it was too though it was never finished  indeed all communication with new york was transacted by myself and it will be judged i had a thankless task of it  what to tell my lady and in what words and how far to be false and how far cruel was a thing that kept me often from my slumber  all this while no doubt my lord waited with growing impatiency for news of his accomplices  harris it is to be thought had promised a high degree of expedition the time was already overpast when word was to be looked for and suspense was a very evil counsellor to a man of an impaired intelligence  my lords mind throughout this interval dwelled almost wholly in the wilderness following that party with whose deeds he had so much concern  he continually conjured up their camps and progresses the fashion of the country the perpetration in a thousand different manners of the same horrid fact and that consequent spectacle of the masters bones lying scattered in the wind  these private guilty considerations i would continually observe to peep forth in the mans talk like rabbits from a hill  and it is the less wonder if the scene of his meditations began to draw him bodily   it is well known what pretext he took  sir william johnson had a diplomatic errand in these parts and my lord and i from curiosity as was given out went in his company  sir william was well attended and liberally supplied  hunters brought us venison fish was taken for us daily in the streams and brandy ran like water  we proceeded by day and encamped by night in the military style sentinels were set and changed every man had his named duty and sir william was the spring of all  there was much in this that might at times have entertained me but for our misfortune the weather was extremely harsh the days were in the beginning open but the nights frosty from the first  a painful keen wind blew most of the time so that we sat in the boat with blue fingers and at night as we scorched our faces at the fire the clothes upon our back appeared to be of paper  a dreadful solitude surrounded our steps the land was quite dispeopled there was no smoke of fires and save for a single boat of merchants on the second day we met no travellers  the season was indeed late but this desertion of the waterways impressed sir william himself and i have heard him more than once express a sense of intimidation  i have come too late i fear they must have dug up the hatchet he said and the future proved how justly he had reasoned  i could never depict the blackness of my soul upon this journey  i have none of those minds that are in love with the unusual  to see the winter coming and to lie in the field so far from any house oppressed me like a nightmare it seemed indeed a kind of awful braving of gods power and this thought which i daresay only writes me down a coward was greatly exaggerated by my private knowledge of the errand we were come upon  i was besides encumbered by my duties to sir william whom it fell upon me to entertain for my lord was quite sunk into a state bordering on pervigilium watching the woods with a rapt eye sleeping scarce at all and speaking sometimes not twenty words in a whole day  that which he said was still coherent but it turned almost invariably upon the party for whom he kept his crazy lookout  he would tell sir william often and always as if it were a new communication that he had a brother somewhere in the woods and beg that the sentinels should be directed to inquire for him  i am anxious for news of my brother he would say  and sometimes when we were under way he would fancy he spied a canoe far off upon the water or a camp on the shore and exhibit painful agitation  it was impossible but sir william should be struck with these singularities and at last he led me aside and hinted his uneasiness  i touched my head and shook it quite rejoiced to prepare a little testimony against possible disclosures  but in that case cries sir william is it wise to let him go at large  those that know him best said i are persuaded that he should be humoured  well well replied sir william it is none of my affairs  but if i had understood you would never have been here  our advance into this savage country had thus uneventfully proceeded for about a week when we encamped for a night at a place where the river ran among considerable mountains clothed in wood the fires were lighted on a level space at the waters edge and we supped and lay down to sleep in the customary fashion  it chanced the night fell murderously cold the stringency of the frost seized and bit me through my coverings so that pain kept me wakeful and i was afoot again before the peep of day crouching by the fires or trotting to and for at the streams edge to combat the aching of my limbs  at last dawn began to break upon hoar woods and mountains the sleepers rolled in their robes and the boisterous river dashing among spears of ice  i stood looking about me swaddled in my stiff coat of a bulls fur and the breath smoking from my scorched nostrils when upon a sudden a singular eager cry rang from the borders of the wood  the sentries answered it the sleepers sprang to their feet one pointed the rest followed his direction with their eyes and there upon the edge of the forest and betwixt two trees we beheld the figure of a man reaching forth his hands like one in ecstasy  the next moment he ran forward fell on his knees at the side of the camp and burst in tears  this was john mountain the trader escaped from the most horrid perils and his fist word when he got speech was to ask if we had seen secundra dass  seen what cries sir william  no said i we have seen nothing of him  why  nothing says mountain  then i was right after all  with that he struck his palm upon his brow  but what takes him back he cried  what takes the man back among dead bodies  there is some damned mystery here  this was a word which highly aroused our curiosity but i shall be more perspicacious if i narrate these incidents in their true order  here follows a narrative which i have compiled out of three sources not very consistent in all points  first a written statement by mountain in which everything criminal is cleverly smuggled out of view  second two conversations with secundra dass and  third many conversations with mountain himself in which he was pleased to be entirely plain for the truth is he regarded me as an accomplice   narrative of the trader mountain   the crew that went up the river under the joint command of captain harris and the master numbered in all nine persons of whom if i except secundra dass there was not one that had not merited the gallows  from harris downward the voyagers were notorious in that colony for desperate bloodyminded miscreants some were reputed pirates the most hawkers of rum all ranters and drinkers all fit associates embarking together without remorse upon this treacherous and murderous design  i could not hear there was much discipline or any set captain in the gang but harris and four others mountain himself two scotchmen  pinkerton and hastie  and a man of the name of hicks a drunken shoemaker put their heads together and agreed upon the course  in a material sense they were well enough provided and the master in particular brought with him a tent where he might enjoy some privacy and shelter  even this small indulgence told against him in the minds of his companions  but indeed he was in a position so entirely false and even ridiculous that all his habit of command and arts of pleasing were here thrown away  in the eyes of all except secundra dass he figured as a common gull and designated victim going unconsciously to death yet he could not but suppose himself the contriver and the leader of the expedition he could scarce help but so conduct himself and at the least hint of authority or condescension his deceivers would be laughing in their sleeves  i was so used to see and to conceive him in a high authoritative attitude that when i had conceived his position on this journey i was pained and could have blushed  how soon he may have entertained a first surmise we cannot know but it was long and the party had advanced into the wilderness beyond the reach of any help ere he was fully awakened to the truth  it fell thus  harris and some others had drawn apart into the woods for consultation when they were startled by a rustling in the brush  they were all accustomed to the arts of indian warfare and mountain had not only lived and hunted but fought and earned some reputation with the savages  he could move in the woods without noise and follow a trail like a hound and upon the emergence of this alert he was deputed by the rest to plunge into the thicket for intelligence  he was soon convinced there was a man in his close neighbourhood moving with precaution but without art among the leaves and branches and coming shortly to a place of advantage he was able to observe secundra dass crawling briskly off with many backward glances  at this he knew not whether to laugh or cry and his accomplices when he had returned and reported were in much the same dubiety  there was now no danger of an indian onslaught but on the other hand since secundra dass was at the pains to spy upon them it was highly probable he knew english and if he knew english it was certain the whole of their design was in the masters knowledge  there was one singularity in the position  if secundra dass knew and concealed his knowledge of english harris was a proficient in several of the tongues of india and as his career in that part of the world had been a great deal worse than profligate he had not thought proper to remark upon the circumstance  each side had thus a spyhole on the counsels of the other  the plotters so soon as this advantage was explained returned to camp harris hearing the hindustani was once more closeted with his master crept to the side of the tent and the rest sitting about the fire with their tobacco awaited his report with impatience  when he came at last his face was very black  he had overheard enough to confirm the worst of his suspicions  secundra dass was a good english scholar he had been some days creeping and listening the master was now fully informed of the conspiracy and the pair proposed on the morrow to fall out of line at a carrying place and plunge at a venture in the woods preferring the full risk of famine savage beasts and savage men to their position in the midst of traitors  what then was to be done  some were for killing the master on the spot but harris assured them that would be a crime without profit since the secret of the treasure must die along with him that buried it  others were for desisting at once from the whole enterprise and making for new york but the appetising name of treasure and the thought of the long way they had already travelled dissuaded the majority  i imagine they were dull fellows for the most part  harris indeed had some acquirements mountain was no fool hastie was an educated man but even these had manifestly failed in life and the rest were the dregs of colonial rascality  the conclusion they reached at least was more the offspring of greed and hope than reason  it was to temporise to be wary and watch the master to be silent and supply no further aliment to his suspicions and to depend entirely as well as i make out on the chance that their victim was as greedy hopeful and irrational as themselves and might after all betray his life and treasure  twice in the course of the next day secundra and the master must have appeared to themselves to have escaped and twice they were circumvented  the master save that the second time he grew a little pale displayed no sign of disappointment apologised for the stupidity with which he had fallen aside thanked his recapturers as for a service and rejoined the caravan with all his usual gallantry and cheerfulness of mien and bearing  but it is certain he had smelled a rat for from thenceforth he and secundra spoke only in each others ear and harris listened and shivered by the tent in vain  the same night it was announced they were to leave the boats and proceed by foot a circumstance which as it put an end to the confusion of the portages greatly lessened the chances of escape  and now there began between the two sides a silent contest for life on the one hand for riches on the other  they were now near that quarter of the desert in which the master himself must begin to play the part of guide and using this for a pretext of persecution harris and his men sat with him every night about the fire and laboured to entrap him into some admission  if he let slip his secret he knew well it was the warrant for his death on the other hand he durst not refuse their questions and must appear to help them to the best of his capacity or he practically published his mistrust  and yet mountain assures me the mans brow was never ruffled  he sat in the midst of these jackals his life depending by a thread like some easy witty householder at home by his own fire an answer he had for everything  as often as not a jesting answer avoided threats evaded insults talked laughed and listened with an open countenance and in short conducted himself in such a manner as must have disarmed suspicion and went near to stagger knowledge  indeed mountain confessed to me they would soon have disbelieved the captains story and supposed their designated victim still quite innocent of their designs but for the fact that he continued however ingeniously to give the slip to questions and the yet stronger confirmation of his repeated efforts to escape  the last of these which brought things to a head i am now to relate  and first i should say that by this time the temper of harriss companions was utterly worn out civility was scarce pretended and for one very significant circumstance the master and secundra had been on some pretext deprived of weapons  on their side however the threatened pair kept up the parade of friendship handsomely secundra was all bows the master all smiles and on the last night of the truce he had even gone so far as to sing for the diversion of the company  it was observed that he had also eaten with unusual heartiness and drank deep doubtless from design  at least about three in the morning he came out of the tent into the open air audibly mourning and complaining with all the manner of a sufferer from surfeit  for some while secundra publicly attended on his patron who at last became more easy and fell asleep on the frosty ground behind the tent the indian returning within  some time after the sentry was changed had the master pointed out to him where he lay in what is called a robe of buffalo  and thenceforth kept an eye upon him he declared without remission  with the first of the dawn a draught of wind came suddenly and blew open one side the corner of the robe and with the same puff the masters hat whirled in the air and fell some yards away  the sentry thinking it remarkable the sleeper should not awaken thereupon drew near and the next moment with a great shout informed the camp their prisoner was escaped  he had left behind his indian who in the first vivacity of the surprise came near to pay the forfeit of his life and was in fact inhumanly mishandled but secundra in the midst of threats and cruelties stuck to it with extraordinary loyalty that he was quite ignorant of his masters plans which might indeed be true and of the manner of his escape which was demonstrably false nothing was therefore left to the conspirators but to rely entirely on the skill of mountain  the night had been frosty the ground quite hard and the sun was no sooner up than a strong thaw set in it was mountains boast that few men could have followed that trail and still fewer even of the native indians found it  the master had thus a long start before his pursuers had the scent and he must have travelled with surprising energy for a pedestrian so unused since it was near noon before mountain had a view of him at this conjuncture the trader was alone all his companions following at his own request several hundred yards in the rear he knew the master was unarmed his heart was besides heated with the exercise and lust of hunting and seeing the quarry so close so defenceless and seeming so fatigued he vaingloriously determined to effect the capture with his single hand  a step or two farther brought him to one margin of a little clearing on the other with his arms folded and his back to a huge stone the master sat  it is possible mountain may have made a rustle it is certain at least the master raised his head and gazed directly at that quarter of the thicket where his hunter lay i could not be sure he saw me mountain said he just looked my way like a man with his mind made up and all the courage ran out of me like rum out of a bottle  and presently when the master looked away again and appeared to resume those meditations in which he had sat immersed before the traders coming mountain slunk stealthily back and returned to seek the help of his companions  and now began the chapter of surprises for the scout had scarce informed the others of his discovery and they were yet preparing their weapons for a rush upon the fugitive when the man himself appeared in their midst walking openly and quietly with his hands behind his back  ah men says he on his beholding them  here is a fortunate encounter  let us get back to camp  mountain had not mentioned his own weakness or the masters disconcerting gaze upon the thicket so that with all the rest his return appeared spontaneous  for all that a hubbub arose oaths flew fists were shaken and guns pointed  let us get back to camp said the master  i have an explanation to make but it must be laid before you all  and in the meanwhile i would put up these weapons one of which might very easily go off and blow away your hopes of treasure  i would not kill says he smiling the goose with the golden eggs  the charm of his superiority once more triumphed and the party in no particular order set off on their return  by the way he found occasion to get a word or two apart with mountain  you are a clever fellow and a bold says he but i am not so sure that you are doing yourself justice  i would have you to consider whether you would not do better ay and safer to serve me instead of serving so commonplace a rascal as mr harris consider of it he concluded dealing the man a gentle tap upon the shoulder and dont be in haste  dead or alive you will find me an ill man to quarrel with  when they were come back to the camp where harris and pinkerton stood guard over secundra these two ran upon the master like viragoes and were amazed out of measure when they were bidden by their comrades to stand back and hear what the gentleman had to say  the master had not flinched before their onslaught nor at this proof of the ground he had gained did he betray the least sufficiency  do not let us be in haste says he  meat first and public speaking after  with that they made a hasty meal  and as soon as it was done the master leaning on one elbow began his speech  he spoke long addressing himself to each except harris finding for each with the same exception some particular flattery  he called them bold honest blades declared he had never seen a more jovial company work better done or pains more merrily supported  well then says he some one asks me why the devil i ran away  but that is scarce worth answer for i think you all know pretty well but you know only pretty well  that is a point i shall arrive at presently and be you ready to remark it when it comes  there is a traitor here  a double traitor  i will give you his name before i am done and let that suffice for now  but here comes some other gentleman and asks me why in the devil i came back  well before i answer that question i have one to put to you  it was this cur here this harris that speaks hindustani cries he rising on one knee and pointing fair at the mans face with a gesture indescribably menacing and when he had been answered in the affirmative ah says he then are all my suspicions verified and i did rightly to come back  now men hear the truth for the first time  thereupon he launched forth in a long story told with extraordinary skill how he had all along suspected harris how he had found the confirmation of his fears and how harris must have misrepresented what passed between secundra and himself  at this point he made a bold stroke with excellent effect  i suppose says he you think you are going shares with harris i suppose you think you will see to that yourselves you would naturally not think so flat a rogue could cozen you  but have a care  these half idiots have a sort of cunning as the skunk has its stench and it may be news to you that harris has taken care of himself already  yes for him the treasure is all money in the bargain  you must find it or go starve  but he has been paid beforehand my brother paid him to destroy me look at him if you doubt  look at him grinning and gulping a detected thief  thence having made this happy impression he explained how he had escaped and thought better of it and at last concluded to come back lay the truth before the company and take his chance with them once more  persuaded as he was they would instantly depose harris and elect some other leader  there is the whole truth said he  and with one exception i put myself entirely in your hands  what is the exception  there he sits he cried pointing once more to harris a man that has to die  weapons and conditions are all one to me put me face to face with him and if you give me nothing but a stick in five minutes i will show you a sop of broken carrion fit for dogs to roll in  it was dark night when he made an end they had listened in almost perfect silence but the firelight scarce permitted any one to judge from the look of his neighbours with what result of persuasion or conviction  indeed the master had set himself in the brightest place and kept his face there to be the centre of mens eyes  doubtless on a profound calculation  silence followed for awhile and presently the whole party became involved in disputation  the master lying on his back with his hands knit under his head and one knee flung across the other like a person unconcerned in the result  and here i daresay his bravado carried him too far and prejudiced his case  at least after a cast or two back and forward opinion settled finally against him its possible he hoped to repeat the business of the pirate ship and be himself perhaps on hard enough conditions elected leader and things went so far that way that mountain actually threw out the proposition  but the rock he split upon was hastie  this fellow was not well liked being sour and slow with an ugly glowering disposition but he had studied some time for the church at edinburgh college before ill conduct had destroyed his prospects and he now remembered and applied what he had learned indeed he had not proceeded very far when the master rolled carelessly upon one side which was done in mountains opinion to conceal the beginnings of despair upon his countenance  hastie dismissed the most of what they had heard as nothing to the matter what they wanted was the treasure  all that was said of harris might be true and they would have to see to that in time  but what had that to do with the treasure  they had heard a vast of words but the truth was just this that mr durie was damnably frightened and had several times run off  here he was  whether caught or come back was all one to hastie  the point was to make an end of the business  as for the talk of deposing and electing captains he hoped they were all free men and could attend their own affairs  that was dust flung in their eyes and so was the proposal to fight harris  he shall fight no one in this camp i can tell him that said hastie  we had trouble enough to get his arms away from him and we should look pretty fools to give them back again  but if its excitement the gentleman is after i can supply him with more than perhaps he cares about  for i have no intention to spend the remainder of my life in these mountains already i have been too long and i propose that he should immediately tell us where that treasure is or else immediately be shot  and there says he producing his weapon there is the pistol that i mean to use  come i call you a man cries the master sitting up and looking at the speaker with an air of admiration  i didnt ask you to call me anything returned hastie which is it to be  thats an idle question said the master  needs must when the devil drives  the truth is we are within easy walk of the place and i will show it you tomorrow  with that as if all were quite settled and settled exactly to his mind he walked off to his tent whither secundra had preceded him  i cannot think of these last turns and wriggles of my old enemy except with admiration scarce even pity is mingled with the sentiment so strongly the man supported so boldly resisted his misfortunes  even at that hour when he perceived himself quite lost when he saw he had but effected an exchange of enemies and overthrown harris to set hastie up no sign of weakness appeared in his behaviour and he withdrew to his tent already determined i must suppose upon affronting the incredible hazard of his last expedient with the same easy assured genteel expression and demeanour as he might have left a theatre withal to join a supper of the wits  but doubtless within if we could see there his soul trembled  early in the night word went about the camp that he was sick and the first thing the next morning he called hastie to his side and inquired most anxiously if he had any skill in medicine  as a matter of fact this was a vanity of that fallen divinity students to which he had cunningly addressed himself  hastie examined him and being flattered ignorant and highly auspicious knew not in the least whether the man was sick or malingering  in this state he went forth again to his companions and as the thing which would give himself most consequence either way announced that the patient was in a fair way to die  for all that he added with an oath and if he bursts by the wayside he must bring us this morning to the treasure  but there were several in the camp mountain among the number whom this brutality revolted  they would have seen the master pistolled or pistolled him themselves without the smallest sentiment of pity but they seemed to have been touched by his gallant fight and unequivocal defeat the night before perhaps too they were even already beginning to oppose themselves to their new leader  at least they now declared that if the man was sick he should have a days rest in spite of hasties teeth  the next morning he was manifestly worse and hastie himself began to display something of humane concern so easily does even the pretence of doctoring awaken sympathy  the third the master called mountain and hastie to the tent announced himself to be dying gave them full particulars as to the position of the cache and begged them to set out incontinently on the quest so that they might see if he deceived them and if they were at first unsuccessful he should be able to correct their error  but here arose a difficulty on which he doubtless counted  none of these men would trust another none would consent to stay behind on the other hand although the master seemed extremely low spoke scarce above a whisper and lay much of the time insensible it was still possible it was a fraudulent sickness and if all went treasurehunting it might prove they had gone upon a wildgoose chase and return to find their prisoner flown  they concluded therefore to hang idling round the camp alleging sympathy to their reason and certainly so mingled are our dispositions several were sincerely if not very deeply affected by the natural peril of the man whom they callously designed to murder  in the afternoon hastie was called to the bedside to pray  the which incredible as it must appear he did with unction about eight at night the wailing of secundra announced that all was over and before ten the indian with a link stuck in the ground was toiling at the grave  sunrise of next day beheld the masters burial all hands attending with great decency of demeanour and the body was laid in the earth wrapped in a fur robe with only the face uncovered which last was of a waxy whiteness and had the nostrils plugged according to some oriental habit of secundras no sooner was the grave filled than the lamentations of the indian once more struck concern to every heart and it appears this gang of murderers so far from resenting his outcries although both distressful and in such a country perilous to their own safety roughly but kindly endeavoured to console him  but if human nature is even in the worst of men occasionally kind it is still and before all things greedy and they soon turned from the mourner to their own concerns  the cache of the treasure being hard by although yet unidentified it was concluded not to break camp and the day passed on the part of the voyagers in unavailing exploration of the woods secundra the while lying on his masters grave  that night they placed no sentinel but lay altogether about the fire in the customary woodman fashion the heads outward like the spokes of a wheel  morning found them in the same disposition only pinkerton who lay on mountains right between him and hastie had in the hours of darkness been secretly butchered and there lay still wrapped as to his body in his mantle but offering above that ungodly and horrific spectacle of the scalped head  the gang were that morning as pale as a company of phantoms for the pertinacity of indian war or to speak more correctly indian murder was well known to all  but they laid the chief blame on their unsentinelled posture and fired with the neighbourhood of the treasure determined to continue where they were  pinkerton was buried hard by the master the survivors again passed the day in exploration and returned in a mingled humour of anxiety and hope being partly certain they were now close on the discovery of what they sought and on the other hand with the return of darkness were infected with the fear of indians  mountain was the first sentry he declares he neither slept nor yet sat down but kept his watch with a perpetual and straining vigilance and it was even with unconcern that when he saw by the stars his time was up he drew near the fire to awaken his successor  this man it was hicks the shoemaker slept on the lee side of the circle something farther off in consequence than those to windward and in a place darkened by the blowing smoke mountain stooped and took him by the shoulder his hand was at once smeared by some adhesive wetness and the wind at the moment veering the firelight shone upon the sleeper and showed him like pinkerton dead and scalped  it was clear they had fallen in the hands of one of those matchless indian bravos that will sometimes follow a party for days and in spite of indefatigable travel and unsleeping watch continue to keep up with their advance and steal a scalp at every resting place  upon this discovery the treasureseekers already reduced to a poor half dozen fell into mere dismay seized a few necessaries and deserting the remainder of their goods fled outright into the forest  their fire they left still burning and their dead comrade unburied  all day they ceased not to flee eating by the way from hand to mouth and since they feared to sleep continued to advance at random even in the hours of darkness  but the limit of mans endurance is soon reached when they rested at last it was to sleep profoundly and when they woke it was to find that the enemy was still upon their heels and death and mutilation had once more lessened and deformed their company  by this they had become lightheaded they had quite missed their path in the wilderness their stores were already running low with the further horrors it is superfluous that i should swell this narrative already too prolonged  suffice it to say that when at length a night passed by innocuous and they might breathe again in the hope that the murderer had at last desisted from pursuit mountain and secundra were alone  the trader is firmly persuaded their unseen enemy was some warrior of his own acquaintance and that he himself was spared by favour  the mercy extended to secundra he explains on the ground that the east indian was thought to be insane partly from the fact that through all the horrors of the flight and while others were casting away their very food and weapons secundra continued to stagger forward with a mattock on his shoulder and partly because in the last days and with a great degree of heat and fluency he perpetually spoke with himself in his own language  but he was sane enough when it came to english  you think he will be gone quite away he asked upon their blest awakening in safety  i pray god so i believe so i dare to believe so mountain had replied almost with incoherence as he described the scene to me  and indeed he was so much distempered that until he met us the next morning he could scarce be certain whether he had dreamed or whether it was a fact that secundra had thereupon turned directly about and returned without a word upon their footprints setting his face for these wintry and hungry solitudes along a path whose every stage was milestoned with a mutilated corpse    chapter xii  the journey in the wilderness continued    mountains story as it was laid before sir william johnson and my lord was shorn of course of all the earlier particulars and the expedition described to have proceeded uneventfully until the master sickened  but the latter part was very forcibly related the speaker visibly thrilling to his recollections and our then situation on the fringe of the same desert and the private interests of each gave him an audience prepared to share in his emotions  for mountains intelligence not only changed the world for my lord durrisdeer but materially affected the designs of sir william johnson  these i find i must lay more at length before the reader  word had reached albany of dubious import it had been rumoured some hostility was to be put in act and the indian diplomatist had thereupon sped into the wilderness even at the approach of winter to nip that mischief in the bud  here on the borders he learned that he was come too late and a difficult choice was thus presented to a man upon the whole not any more bold than prudent his standing with the painted braves may be compared to that of my lord president culloden among the chiefs of our own highlanders at the fortyfive that is as much as to say he was to these men reasons only speaking trumpet and counsels of peace and moderation if they were to prevail at all must prevail singly through his influence  if then he should return the province must lie open to all the abominable tragedies of indian war  the houses blaze the wayfarer be cut off and the men of the woods collect their usual disgusting spoil of human scalps  on the other side to go farther forth to risk so small a party deeper in the desert to carry words of peace among warlike savages already rejoicing to return to war  here was an extremity from which it was easy to perceive his mind revolted  i have come too late he said more than once and would fall into a deep consideration his head bowed in his hands his foot patting the ground  at length he raised his face and looked upon us that is to say upon my lord mountain and myself sitting close round a small fire which had been made for privacy in one corner of the camp  my lord to be quite frank with you i find myself in two minds said he  i think it very needful i should go on but not at all proper i should any longer enjoy the pleasure of your company  we are here still upon the water side and i think the risk to southward no great matter  will not yourself and mr mackellar take a single boats crew and return to albany  my lord i should say had listened to mountains narrative regarding him throughout with a painful intensity of gaze and since the tale concluded had sat as in a dream  there was something very daunting in his look something to my eyes not rightly human the face lean and dark and aged the mouth painful the teeth disclosed in a perpetual rictus the eyeball swimming clear of the lids upon a field of bloodshot white  i could not behold him myself without a jarring irritation such as i believe is too frequently the uppermost feeling on the sickness of those dear to us  others i could not but remark were scarce able to support his neighbourhood  sir william eviting to be near him mountain dodging his eye and when he met it blenching and halting in his story  at this appeal however my lord appeared to recover his command upon himself  to albany said he with a good voice  not short of it at least replied sir william  there is no safety nearer hand  i would be very sweir 11 to return says my lord  i am not afraid  of indians he added with a jerk  i wish that i could say so much returned sir william smiling although if any man durst say it it should be myself  but you are to keep in view my responsibility and that as the voyage has now become highly dangerous and your business  if you ever had any says he brought quite to a conclusion by the distressing family intelligence you have received i should be hardly justified if i even suffered you to proceed and run the risk of some obloquy if anything regrettable should follow  my lord turned to mountain  what did he pretend he died of he asked  i dont think i understand your honour said the trader pausing like a man very much affected in the dressing of some cruel frost bites  for a moment my lord seemed at a full stop and then with some irritation i ask you what he died of  surely thats a plain question said he  oh i dont know said mountain  hastie even never knew  he seemed to sicken natural and just pass away  there it is you see concluded my lord turning to sir william  your lordship is too deep for me replied sir william  why says my lord this in a matter of succession my sons title may be called in doubt and the man being supposed to be dead of nobody can tell what a great deal of suspicion would be naturally roused  but god damn me the mans buried cried sir william  i will never believe that returned my lord painfully trembling ill never believe it he cried again and jumped to his feet did he look dead he asked of mountain  look dead repeated the trader  he looked white  why what would he be at  i tell you i put the sods upon him  my lord caught sir william by the coat with a hooked hand  this man has the name of my brother says he but its well understood that he was never canny  canny says sir william  what is that  hes not of this world whispered my lord neither him nor the black deil that serves him  i have struck my sword throughout his vitals he cried i have felt the hilt dirl 12 on his breastbone and the hot blood spirt in my very face time and again time and again he repeated with a gesture indescribable but he was never dead for that said he and i sighed aloud why should i think he was dead now  no not till i see him rotting says he  sir william looked across at me with a long face  mountain forgot his wounds staring and gaping  my lord said i i wish you would collect your spirits  but my throat was so dry and my own wits so scattered i could add no more  no says my lord its not to be supposed that he would understand me  mackellar does for he kens all and has seen him buried before now  this is a very good servant to me sir william this man mackellar he buried him with his own hands  he and my father  by the light of two siller candlesticks  the other man is a familiar spirit he brought him from coromandel  i would have told ye this long syne sir william only it was in the family these last remarks he made with a kind of a melancholy composure and his time of aberration seemed to pass away  you can ask yourself what it all means he proceeded  my brother falls sick and dies and is buried as so they say and all seems very plain but why did the familiar go back  i think ye must see for yourself its a point that wants some clearing  i will be at your service my lord in half a minute said sir william rising  mr mackellar two words with you and he led me without the camp the frost crunching in our steps the trees standing at our elbow hoar with frost even as on that night in the long shrubbery  of course this is midsummer madness said sir william as soon as we were gotten out of bearing  why certainly said i  the man is mad  i think that manifest  shall i seize and bind him asked sir william  i will upon your authority  if these are all ravings that should certainly be done  i looked down upon the ground back at the camp with its bright fires and the folk watching us and about me on the woods and mountains there was just the one way that i could not look and that was in sir williams face  sir william said i at last i think my lord not sane and have long thought him so  but there are degrees in madness and whether he should be brought under restraint  sir william i am no fit judge i concluded  i will be the judge said he  i ask for facts  was there in all that jargon any word of truth or sanity  do you hesitate he asked  am i to understand you have buried this gentleman before  not buried said i and then taking up courage at last sir william said i unless i were to tell you a long story which much concerns a noble family and myself not in the least it would be impossible to make this matter clear to you  say the word and i will do it right or wrong  and at any rate i will say so much that my lord is not so crazy as he seems  this is a strange matter into the tail of which you are unhappily drifted  i desire none of your secrets replied sir william but i will be plain at the risk of incivility and confess that i take little pleasure in my present company  i would be the last to blame you said i for that  i have not asked either for your censure or your praise sir returned sir william  i desire simply to be quit of you and to that effect i put a boat and complement of men at your disposal  this is fairly offered said i after reflection  but you must suffer me to say a word upon the other side  we have a natural curiosity to learn the truth of this affair i have some of it myself my lord it is very plain has but too much  the matter of the indians return is enigmatical  i think so myself sir william interrupted and i propose since i go in that direction to probe it to the bottom  whether or not the man has gone like a dog to die upon his masters grave his life at least is in great danger and i propose if i can to save it  there is nothing against his character  nothing sir william i replied  and the other he said  i have heard my lord of course but from the circumstances of his servants loyalty i must suppose he had some noble qualities  you must not ask me that i cried  hell may have noble flames i have known him a score of years and always hated and always admired and always slavishly feared him  i appear to intrude again upon your secrets said sir william believe me inadvertently  enough that i will see the grave and if possible rescue the indian  upon these terms can you persuade your master to return to albany  sir william said i i will tell you how it is  you do not see my lord to advantage it will seem even strange to you that i should love him but i do and i am not alone  if he goes back to albany it must be by force and it will be the deathwarrant of his reason and perhaps his life  that is my sincere belief but i am in your hands and ready to obey if you will assume so much responsibility as to command  i will have no shred of responsibility it is my single endeavour to avoid the same cried sir william  you insist upon following this journey up and be it so  i wash my hands of the whole matter  with which word he turned upon his heel and gave the order to break camp and my lord who had been hovering near by came instantly to my side  which is it to be said he  you are to have your way i answered  you shall see the grave   the situation of the masters grave was between guides easily described it lay indeed beside a chief landmark of the wilderness a certain range of peaks conspicuous by their design and altitude and the source of many brawling tributaries to that inland sea lake champlain  it was therefore possible to strike for it direct instead of following back the bloodstained trail of the fugitives and to cover in some sixteen hours of march a distance which their perturbed wanderings had extended over more than sixty  our boats we left under a guard upon the river it was indeed probable we should return to find them frozen fast and the small equipment with which we set forth upon the expedition included not only an infinity of furs to protect us from the cold but an arsenal of snowshoes to render travel possible when the inevitable snow should fall  considerable alarm was manifested at our departure the march was conducted with soldierly precaution the camp at night sedulously chosen and patrolled and it was a consideration of this sort that arrested us the second day within not many hundred yards of our destination  the night being already imminent the spot in which we stood well qualified to be a strong camp for a party of our numbers and sir william therefore on a sudden thought arresting our advance  before us was the high range of mountains toward which we had been all day deviously drawing near  from the first light of the dawn their silver peaks had been the goal of our advance across a tumbled lowland forest thrid with rough streams and strewn with monstrous boulders the peaks as i say silver for already at the higher altitudes the snow fell nightly but the woods and the low ground only breathed upon with frost  all day heaven had been charged with ugly vapours in the which the sun swam and glimmered like a shilling piece all day the wind blew on our left cheek barbarous cold but very pure to breathe  with the end of the afternoon however the wind fell the clouds being no longer reinforced were scattered or drunk up the sun set behind us with some wintry splendour and the white brow of the mountains shared its dying glow  it was dark ere we had supper we ate in silence and the meal was scarce despatched before my lord slunk from the fireside to the margin of the camp whither i made haste to follow him  the camp was on high ground overlooking a frozen lake perhaps a mile in its longest measurement all about us the forest lay in heights and hollows above rose the white mountains and higher yet the moon rode in a fair sky  there was no breath of air nowhere a twig creaked and the sounds of our own camp were hushed and swallowed up in the surrounding stillness  now that the sun and the wind were both gone down it appeared almost warm like a night of july  a singular illusion of the sense when earth air and water were strained to bursting with the extremity of frost  my lord or what i still continued to call by his loved name stood with his elbow in one hand and his chin sunk in the other gazing before him on the surface of the wood  my eyes followed his and rested almost pleasantly upon the frosted contexture of the pines rising in moonlit hillocks or sinking in the shadow of small glens  hard by i told myself was the grave of our enemy now gone where the wicked cease from troubling the earth heaped for ever on his once so active limbs  i could not but think of him as somehow fortunate to be thus done with mans anxiety and weariness the daily expense of spirit and that daily river of circumstance to be swum through at any hazard under the penalty of shame or death  i could not but think how good was the end of that long travel and with that my mind swung at a tangent to my lord  for was not my lord dead also a maimed soldier looking vainly for discharge lingering derided in the line of battle  a kind man i remembered him wise with a decent pride a son perhaps too dutiful a husband only too loving one that could suffer and be silent one whose hand i loved to press  of a sudden pity caught in my windpipe with a sob i could have wept aloud to remember and behold him and standing thus by his elbow under the broad moon i prayed fervently either that he should be released or i strengthened to persist in my affection  oh god said i this was the best man to me and to himself and now i shrink from him  he did no wrong or not till he was broke with sorrows these are but his honourable wounds that we begin to shrink from  oh cover them up oh take him away before we hate him  i was still so engaged in my own bosom when a sound broke suddenly upon the night  it was neither very loud nor very near yet bursting as it did from so profound and so prolonged a silence it startled the camp like an alarm of trumpets  ere i had taken breath sir william was beside me the main part of the voyagers clustered at his back intently giving ear  methought as i glanced at them across my shoulder there was a whiteness other than moonlight on their cheeks and the rays of the moon reflected with a sparkle on the eyes of some and the shadows lying black under the brows of others according as they raised or bowed the head to listen gave to the group a strange air of animation and anxiety  my lord was to the front crouching a little forth his hand raised as for silence  a man turned to stone  and still the sounds continued breathlessly renewed with a precipitate rhythm  suddenly mountain spoke in a loud broken whisper as of a man relieved  i have it now he said and as we all turned to hear him the indian must have known the cache he added  that is he  he is digging out the treasure  why to be sure exclaimed sir william  we were geese not to have supposed so much  the only thing is mountain resumed the sound is very close to our old camp  and again i do not see how he is there before us unless the man had wings  greed and fear are wings remarked sir william  but this rogue has given us an alert and i have a notion to return the compliment  what say you gentlemen shall we have a moonlight hunt  it was so agreed dispositions were made to surround secundra at his task some of sir williams indians hastened in advance and a strong guard being left at our headquarters we set forth along the uneven bottom of the forest frost crackling ice sometimes loudly splitting under foot and overhead the blackness of pinewoods and the broken brightness of the moon  our way led down into a hollow of the land and as we descended the sounds diminished and had almost died away  upon the other slope it was more open only dotted with a few pines and several vast and scattered rocks that made inky shadows in the moonlight  here the sounds began to reach us more distinctly we could now perceive the ring of iron and more exactly estimate the furious degree of haste with which the digger plied his instrument  as we neared the top of the ascent a bird or two winged aloft and hovered darkly in the moonlight and the next moment we were gazing through a fringe of trees upon a singular picture  a narrow plateau overlooked by the white mountains and encompassed nearer hand by woods lay bare to the strong radiance of the moon  rough goods such as make the wealth of foresters were sprinkled here and there upon the ground in meaningless disarray  about the midst a tent stood silvered with frost  the door open gaping on the black interior  at the one end of this small stage lay what seemed the tattered remnants of a man without doubt we had arrived upon the scene of harriss encampment there were the goods scattered in the panic of flight it was in yon tent the master breathed his last and the frozen carrion that lay before us was the body of the drunken shoemaker  it was always moving to come upon the theatre of any tragic incident to come upon it after so many days and to find it in the seclusion of a desert still unchanged must have impressed the mind of the most careless  and yet it was not that which struck us into pillars of stone but the sight which yet we had been half expecting of secundra ankle deep in the grave of his late master  he had cast the main part of his raiment by yet his frail arms and shoulders glistered in the moonlight with a copious sweat his face was contracted with anxiety and expectation his blows resounded on the grave as thick as sobs and behind him strangely deformed and inkblack upon the frosty ground the creatures shadow repeated and parodied his swift gesticulations  some night birds arose from the boughs upon our coming and then settled back but secundra absorbed in his toil heard or heeded not at all  i heard mountain whisper to sir william good god its the grave hes digging him up  it was what we had all guessed and yet to hear it put in language thrilled me  sir william violently started  you damned sacrilegious hound he cried  whats this  secundra leaped in the air a little breathless cry escaped him the tool flew from his grasp and he stood one instant staring at the speaker  the next swift as an arrow he sped for the woods upon the farther side and the next again throwing up his hands with a violent gesture of resolution he had begun already to retrace his steps  well then you come you help   he was saying  but by now my lord had stepped beside sir william the moon shone fair upon his face and the words were still upon secundras lips when he beheld and recognised his masters enemy  him he screamed clasping his hands and shrinking on himself  come come said sir william  there is none here to do you harm if you be innocent and if you be guilty your escape is quite cut off  speak what do you here among the graves of the dead and the remains of the unburied  you no murderer inquired secundra  you true man you see me safe  i will see you safe if you be innocent returned sir william i have said the thing and i see not wherefore you should doubt it  there all murderers cried secundra that is why  he kill  murderer pointing to mountain there two hiremurderers pointing to my lord and myself  all gallows  murderers  ah i see you all swing in a rope  now i go save the sahib he see you swing in a rope  the sahib he continued pointing to the grave he not dead  he bury he not dead  my lord uttered a little noise moved nearer to the grave and stood and stared in it  buried and not dead exclaimed sir william  what kind of rant is this  see sahib said secundra  the sahib and i alone with murderers try all way to escape no way good  then try this way good way in warm climate good way in india here in this dam cold place who can tell  i tell you pretty good hurry  you help you light a fire help rub  what is the creature talking of cried sir william  my head goes round  i tell you i bury him alive said secundra i teach him swallow his tongue  now dig him up pretty good hurry and he not much worse  you light a fire  sir william turned to the nearest of his men  light a fire said he  my lot seems to be cast with the insane  you good man returned secundra  now i go dig the sahib up  he returned as he spoke to the grave and resumed his former toil my lord stood rooted and i at my lords side fearing i knew not what  the frost was not yet very deep and presently the indian threw aside his tool and began to scoop the dirt by handfuls  then he disengaged a corner of a buffalo robe and then i saw hair catch among his fingers  yet a moment more and the moon shone on something white  awhile secundra crouched upon his knees scraping with delicate fingers breathing with puffed lips and when he moved aside i beheld the face of the master wholly disengaged  it was deadly white the eyes closed the ears and nostrils plugged the cheeks fallen the nose sharp as if in death but for all he had lain so many days under the sod corruption had not approached him and what strangely affected all of us his lips and chin were mantled with a swarthy beard  my god cried mountain he was as smooth as a baby when we laid him there  they say hair grows upon the dead observed sir william but his voice was thick and weak  secundra paid no heed to our remarks digging swift as a terrier in the loose earth  every moment the form of the master swathed in his buffalo robe grew more distinct in the bottom of that shallow trough the moon shining strong and the shadows of the standers by as they drew forward and back falling and flitting over his emergent countenance  the sight held us with a horror not before experienced  i dared not look my lord in the face but for as long as it lasted i never observed him to draw breath and a little in the background one of the men i know not whom burst into a kind of sobbing  now said secundra you help me lift him out  of the flight of time i have no idea it may have been three hours and it may have been five that the indian laboured to reanimate his masters body  one thing only i know that it was still night and the moon was not yet set although it had sunk low and now barred the plateau with long shadows when secundra uttered a small cry of satisfaction and leaning swiftly forth i thought i could myself perceive a change upon that icy countenance of the unburied  the next moment i beheld his eyelids flutter the next they rose entirely and the weekold corpse looked me for a moment in the face  so much display of life i can myself swear to  i have heard from others that he visibly strove to speak that his teeth showed in his beard and that his brow was contorted as with an agony of pain and effort  and this may have been i know not i was otherwise engaged  for at that first disclosure of the dead mans eyes my lord durrisdeer fell to the ground and when i raised him up he was a corpse  day came and still secundra could not be persuaded to desist from his unavailing efforts  sir william leaving a small party under my command proceeded on his embassy with the first light and still the indian rubbed the limbs and breathed in the mouth of the dead body  you would think such labours might have vitalised a stone but except for that one moment which was my lords death the black spirit of the master held aloof from its discarded clay and by about the hour of noon even the faithful servant was at length convinced  he took it with unshaken quietude  too cold said he good way in india no good here  and asking for some food which he ravenously devoured as soon as it was set before him he drew near to the fire and took his place at my elbow  in the same spot as soon as he had eaten he stretched himself out and fell into a childlike slumber from which i must arouse him some hours afterwards to take his part as one of the mourners at the double funeral  it was the same throughout he seemed to have outlived at once and with the same effort his grief for his master and his terror of myself and mountain  one of the men left with me was skilled in stonecutting and before sir william returned to pick us up i had chiselled on a boulder this inscription with a copy of which i may fitly bring my narrative to a close   j d  heir to a scottish title  a master of the arts and graces  admired in europe asia america  in war and peace  in the tents of savage hunters and the  citadels of kings after
