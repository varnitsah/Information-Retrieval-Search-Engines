95540531	wildfire   by  zane grey     chapter i  for some reason the desert scene before lucy bostil awoke varying emotionsa sweet gratitude for the fullness of her life there at the ford yet a haunting remorse that she could not be wholly contenta vague loneliness of soula thrill and a fear for the strangely calling future glorious unknown  she longed for something to happen it might be terrible so long as it was wonderful this day when lucy had stolen away on a forbidden horse she was eighteen years old the thought of her mother who had died long ago on their way into this wilderness was the one drop of sadness in her joy lucy loved everybody at bostils ford and everybody loved her she loved all the horses except her fathers favorite racer that perverse devil of a horse the great sage king  lucy was glowing and rapt with love for all she beheld from her lofty perch the greenandpink blossoming hamlet beneath her set between the beauty of the gray sage expanse and the ghastliness of the barren heights the swift colorado sullenly thundering below in the abyss the indians in their bright colors riding up the river trail the eagle poised like a feather on the air and a beneath him the grazing cattle making black dots on the sage the deep velvet azure of the sky the golden lights on the bare peaks and the lilac veils in the far ravines the silky rustle of a canyon swallow as he shot downward in the sweep of the wind the fragrance of cedar the flowers of the spearpointed mescal the brooding silence the beckoning range the purple distance  whatever it was lucy longed for whatever was whispered by the wind and written in the mystery of the waste of sage and stone she wanted it to happen there at bostils ford she had no desire for civilization she flouted the idea of marrying the rich rancher of durango bostils sister that stern but lovable woman who had brought her up and taught her would never persuade her to marry against her will lucy imagined herself like a wild horsefree proud untamed meant for the desert and here she would live her life the desert and her life seemed as one yet in what did they resemble each otherin what of this scene could she read the nature of her future  shudderingly she rejected the red sullen thundering river with its swift changeful endless contending strifefor that was tragic and she rejected the frowning mass of red rock upreared riven and split and canyoned so grim and alooffor that was barren but she accepted the vast sloping valley of sage rolling gray and soft and beautiful down to the dim mountains and purple ramparts of the horizon lucy did not know what she yearned for she did not know why the desert called to her she did not know in what it resembled her spirit but she did know that these three feelings were as one deep in her heart for ten years every day of her life she had watched this desert scene and never had there been an hour that it was not different yet the same ten yearsand she grew up watching feelingtill from the deserts thousand moods she assimilated its nature loved her bonds and could never have been happy away from the open the color the freedom the wildness on this birthday when those who loved her said she had become her own mistress she acknowledged the claim of the desert forever and she experienced a deep rich strange happiness  hers always then the mutable and immutable desert the leagues and leagues of slope and sage and rolling ridge the great canyons and the giant cliffs the dark river with its mystic thunder of waters the pinefringed plateaus the endless stretch of horizon with its lofty isolated noble monuments and the bold ramparts with their beckoning beyond hers always the desert seasons the shrill icy blast the intense cold the steely skies the fading snows the gray old sage and the bleached grass under the pall of the spring sandstorms the hot furnace breath of summer with its magnificent cloud pageants in the sky with the black tempests hanging here and there over the peaks dark veils floating down and rainbows everywhere and the lacy waterfalls upon the glistening cliffs and the thunder of the red floods and the glorious golden autumn when it was always afternoon and time stood still hers always the rides in the open with the sun at her back and the wind in her face and hers surely sooner or later the nameless adventure which had its inception in the strange yearning of her heart and presaged its fulfilment somewhere down that trailless sageslope she loved so well  bostils house was a crude but picturesque structure of red stone and white clay and bleached cottonwoods and it stood at the outskirts of the cluster of greeninclosed cabins which composed the hamlet bostil was wont to say that in all the world there could hardly be a grander view than the outlook down that gray sea of rolling sage down to the blackfringed plateaus and the wild bluerimmed and goldspired horizon  one morning in early spring as was bostils custom he ordered the racers to be brought from the corrals and turned loose on the slope he loved to sit there and watch his horses graze but ever he saw that the riders were close at hand and that the horses did not get out on the slope of sage he sat back and gloried in the sight he owned bands of mustangs near by was a field of them fine and mettlesome and racy yet bostil had eyes only for the blooded favorites strange it was that not one of these was a mustang or a broken wild horse for many of the riders best mounts had been captured by them or the indians and it was bostils supreme ambition to own a great wild stallion there was plume a superb mare that got her name from the way her mane swept in the wind when she was on the ran and there was two face like a coquette sleek and glossy and running and the huge rangy bay dusty ben and the black stallion sarchedon and lastly sage king the color of the upland sage a racer in build a horse splendid and proud and beautiful  wheres lucy presently asked bostil  as he divided his love so he divided his anxiety  some rider had seen lucy riding off with her golden hair flying in the wind this was an old story  shes up on buckles bostil queried turning sharply to the speaker  reckon so was the calm reply  bostil swore he did not have a rider who could equal him in profanity  farlane youd orders lucys not to ride them hosses least of all buckles he aint safe even for a man  wal hes safe fer lucy  but didnt i say no  boss its likely you did fer you talk a lot replied farlane lucy pulled my hat down over my eyestold me to go to thunderan then zip she an buckles were dustin it fer the sage  shes got to keep out of the sage growled bostil it aint safe for her out there wheres my glass i want to take a look at the slope wheres my glass  the glass could not be found  whats makin them dustclouds on the sage antelope  holley you used to have eyes better n me use them will you  a grayhaired hawkeyed rider lean and worn approached with clinking spurs  down in there said bostil pointing  thets a bunch of hosses replied holley  wild hosses  i take em so seein how they throw thet dust  huh i dont like it lucy oughtnt be ridin round alone  wal boss who could catch her up on buckles lucy can ride an theres the king an sarch right under your nosethe only hosses on the sage thet could outrun buckles  farlane knew how to mollify his master and long habit had made him proficient bostils eyes flashed he was proud of lucys power over a horse the story bostil first told to any stranger happening by the ford was how lucy had been born during a wild ridealmost as it were on the back of a horse that at least was her fame and the riders swore she was a worthy daughter of such a mother then as farlane well knew a quick road to bostils good will was to praise one of his favorites  reckon you spoke sense for once farlane replied bostil with relief i wasnt thinkin so much of danger for lucy but she lets thet halfwitted creech go with her  no boss youre wrong put in holley earnestly i know the girl she has no use fer joel but he jest runs after her  an hes harmless added farlane  we aint agreed rejoined bostil quickly what do you say holley  the old rider looked thoughtful and did not speak for long  wal yes an no he answered finally i reckon lucy could make a man out of joel but she doesnt care fer him an thet settles thet an maybe joels leanin toward the bad  if she meets him again ill rope her in the house declared bostil  another cleareyed rider drew bostils attention from the gray waste of rolling sage  bostil look look at the king hes watchin fer somethin an sos sarch  the two horses named were facing a ridge some few hundred yards distant and their heads were aloft and ears straight forward sage king whistled shrilly and sarchedon began to prance  boys youd better drive them in said bostil theyd like nothin so well as gettin out on the sage hullo whats thet shootin up behind the ridge  no more n buckles with lucy makin him run some replied holley with a dry laugh  if it aint  lord look at him come  bostils anger and anxiety might never have been the light of the upland riders joy shone in his keen gaze the slope before him was open and almost level down to the ridge that had hidden the missing girl and horse buckles was running for the love of running as the girl low down over his neck was riding for the love of riding the sage king whistled again and shot off with graceful sweep to meet them sarchedon plunged after him two face and plume jealously trooped down too but dusty ben after a toss of his head went on grazing the gray and the black met buckles and could not turn in time to stay with him a girls gay scream pealed up the slope and buckles went lower and faster sarchedon was left behind then the gray king began to run as if before he had been loping he was beautiful in action this was playa gamea raceplainly dominated by the spirit of the girl lucys hair was a bright stream of gold in the wind she rode bareback it seemed that she was hunched low over buckles with her knees high on his backscarcely astride him at all yet her motion was one with the horse again that wild gay scream pealed outcall or laugh or challenge sage king with a fleetness that made the eyes of bostil and his riders glisten took the lead and then sheered off to slow down while buckles thundered past lucy was pulling him hard and had him plunging to a halt when the rider holley ran out to grasp his bridle buckles was snorting and his ears were laid back he pounded the ground and scattered the pebbles  no use lucy said bostil you cant beat the king at your own game even with a runnin start  lucy bostils eyes were blue as keen as her fathers and now they flashed like his she had a hand twisted in the horses long mane and as lithe and supple she slipped a knee across his broad back she shook a little gantleted fist at bostils gray racer  sage king i hate you she called as if the horse were human and ill beat you some day  bostil swore by the gods his sage king was the swiftest horse in all that wild upland country of wonderful horses he swore the great gray could look back over his shoulder and run away from any broken horse known to the riders  bostil himself was half horse and the half of him that was human he divided between love of his fleet racers and his daughter lucy he had seen years of hard riding on that wild utah border where in those days a horse meant all the world to a man a lucky strike of grassy upland and good water south of the rio colorado made him rich in all that he cared to own the indians yet unspoiled by white men were friendly bostil built a boat at the indian crossing of the colorado and the place became known as bostils ford from time to time his personality and his reputation and his need brought horsehunters riders sheepherders and men of pioneer spirit as well as wandering desert travelers to the ford and the lonely isolated hamlet slowly grew north of the river it was more than two hundred miles to the nearest little settlement with only a few lonely ranches on the road to the west were several villages equally distant but cut off for two months at a time by the raging colorado flooded by melting snow up in the mountains eastward from the ford stretched a ghastly broken unknown desert of canyons southward rolled the beautiful uplands with valleys of sage and grass and plateaus of pine and cedar until this rich rolling gray and green range broke sharply on a purple horizon line of upflung rocky ramparts and walls and monuments wild dim and mysterious  bostils cattle and horses were numberless and many as were his riders he always could use more but most riders did not abide long with bostil first because some of them were of a wandering breed wildhorse hunters themselves and secondly bostil had two great faults he seldom paid a rider in money and he never permitted one to own a fleet horse he wanted to own all the fast horses himself and in those days every rider especially a wildhorse hunter loved his steed as part of himself if there was a difference between bostil and any rider of the sage it was that as he had more horses so he had more love  whenever bostil could not get possession of a horse he coveted either by purchase or trade he invariably acquired a grievance toward the owner this happened often for riders were loath to part with their favorites and he had made more than one enemy by his persistent nagging it could not be said however that he sought to drive hard bargains bostil would pay any price asked for a horse  across the colorado in a high redwalled canyon opening upon the river lived a poor sheepherder and horsetrader named creech this man owned a number of thoroughbreds two of which he would not part with for all the gold in the uplands these racers blue roan and peg had been captured wild on the ranges by ute indians and broken to racing they were still young and getting faster every year bostil wanted them because he coveted them and because he feared them it would have been a terrible blow to him if any horse ever beat the gray but creech laughed at all offers and taunted bostil with a boast that in another summer he would see a horse out in front of the king  to complicate matters and lead rivalry into hatred young joel creech a great horseman but worthless in the eyes of all save his father had been heard to say that some day he would force a race between the king and blue roan and that threat had been taken in various ways it alienated bostil beyond all hope of reconciliation it made lucy bostil laugh and look sweetly mysterious she had no enemies and she liked everybody it was even gossiped by the women of bostils ford that she had more than liking for the idle joel but the husbands of these gossips said lucy was only tenderhearted among the riders when they sat around their lonely campfires or lounged at the corrals of the ford there was speculation in regard to this race hinted by joel creech there never had been a race between the king and blue roan and there never would be unless joel were to ride off with lucy in that case there would be the grandest race ever run on the uplands with the odds against blue roan only if he carried double if joel put lucy up on the roan and he rode peg there would be another story lucy bostil was a slip of a girl born on a horse as strong and supple as an indian and she could ride like a burr sticking in a horses mane with blue roan carrying her light weight she might run away from any one up on the kingwhich for bostil would be a double tragedy equally in the loss of his daughter and the beating of his bestbeloved racer but with joel on peg such a race would end in heartbreak for all concerned for the king would outrun peg and that would bring riders within gunshot  it had always been a fascinating subject this longlookedfor race it grew more so when joels infatuation for lucy became known there were fewer riders who believed lucy might elope with joel than there were who believed joel might steal his fathers horses but all the riders who loved horses and all the women who loved gossip were united in at least one thing and that was that something like a race or a romance would soon disrupt the peaceful sleepy tenor of bostils ford  in addition to bostils growing hatred for the creeches he had a great fear of cordts the horsethief a fear ever restless ever watchful cordts hid back in the untrodden ways he had secret friends among the riders of the ranges faithful followers back in the canyon camps gold for the digging cattle by the thousand and fast horses he had always gotten what he wantedexcept one thing that was a certain horse and the horse was sage king  cordts was a bad man a product of the early goldfields of california and idaho an outcast from that evil wave of wanderers retreating back over the trails so madly traveled westward he became a lord over the free ranges but more than all else he was a rider he knew a horse he was as much horse as bostil cordts rode into this wild freerange country where he had been heard to say that a horsethief was meaner than a poisoned coyote nevertheless he became a horsethief the passion he had conceived for the sage king was the passion of a man for an unattainable woman cordts swore that he would never rest that he would not die till he owned the king so there was reason for bostils great fear    chapter ii  bostil went toward the house with his daughter turning at the door to call a last word to his riders about the care of his horses  the house was a low flat wide structure with a corridor running through the middle from which doors led into the adobewalled rooms the windows were small openings high up evidently intended for defense as well as light and they had rude wooden shutters the floor was clay covered everywhere by indian blankets a pioneers home it was simple and crude yet comfortable and having the rare quality peculiar to desert homes it was cool in summer and warm in winter  as bostil entered with his arm round lucy a big hound rose from the hearth this room was immense running the length of the house and it contained a huge stone fireplace where a kettle smoked fragrantly and rude homemade chairs with blanket coverings and tables to match and walls covered with bridles guns pistols indian weapons and ornaments and trophies of the chase in a far corner stood a workbench with tools upon it and horse trappings under it in the opposite corner a door led into the kitchen this room was bostils famous livingroom in which many things had happened some of which had helped make desert history and were never mentioned by bostil  bostils sister came in from the kitchen she was a huge person with a severe yet motherly face she had her hands on her hips and she cast a rather disapproving glance at father and daughter  so youre back again she queried severely  sure auntie replied the girl complacently  you ran off to get out of seeing wetherby didnt you  lucy stared sweetly at her aunt  he was waiting for hours went on the worthy woman i never saw a man in such a stew no wonder playing fast and loose with him the way you do  i told him no flashed lucy  but wetherbys not the kind to take no and im not satisfied to let you mean it lucy bostil you dont know your mind an hour straight running youve fooled enough with these riders of your dads if youre not careful youll marry one of them one of these wild riders as bad as a ute indian  wetherby is young and he idolizes you in all common sense why dont you take him  i dont care for him replied lucy  you like him as well as anybody john bostil what do you say you approved of wetherby i heard you tell him lucy was like an unbroken colt and that youd  sure i like jim interrupted bostil and he avoided lucys swift look  well demanded his sister  evidently bostil found himself in a corner between two fires he looked sheepish then disgusted  dad exclaimed lucy reproachfully  see here jane said bostil with an air of finality the girl is of age todayan she can do what she damn pleases  thats a fine thing for you to say retorted aunt jane like as not shell be fetching that hangdog joel creech up here for you to support  auntie cried lucy her eyes blazing  oh child you torment meworry me so said the disappointed woman its all for your sake look at you lucy bostil a girl of eighteen who comes of a family and you riding around and going around as you are nowin a mans clothes  but you dear old goose i cant ride in a womans skirt expostulated lucy mind you auntie i can ride  lucy if i live here forever id never get reconciled to a bostil woman in leather pants we bostils were somebody once back in missouri  bostil laughed yes an if i hadnt hit the trail west wed be starvin yet jane youre a sentimental old fool let the girl alone an reconcile yourself to this wilderness  aunt janes eyes were wet with tears lucy seeing them ran to her and hugged and kissed her  auntie i will promisefrom todayto have some dignity ive been free as a boy in these rider clothes as i am now the men never seem to regard me as a girl somehow thats better i cant explain but i like it my dresses are what have caused all the trouble i know that but if im grown upif its so tremendousthen ill wear a dress all the time except just when i ride will that do auntie  maybe you will grow up after all replied aunt jane evidently surprised and pleased  then lucy with clinking spurs ran away to her room  jane whats this nonsense about young joel creech asked bostil gruffly  i dont know any more than is gossiped that i told you have you ever asked lucy about him  i sure havent said bostil bluntly  well ask her if she tells you at all shell tell the truth lucyd never sleep at night if she lied  aunt jane returned to her housewifely tasks leaving bostil thoughtfully stroking the hound and watching the fire presently lucy returneda different lucyone that did not rouse his riders pride but thrilled his fathers heart she had been a slim lithe supple disheveled boy breathing the wild spirit of the open and the horse she rode she was now a girl in the graceful roundness of her slender form with hair the gold of the sage at sunset and eyes the blue of the deep haze of distance and lips the sweet red of the upland rose and all about her seemed different  lucyyou looklikelike she used to be said bostil unsteadily  my mother murmured lucy  but these two so keen so strong so alive did not abide long with sad memories  lucy i want to ask you somethin said bostil presently what about this young joel creech  lucy started as if suddenly recalled then she laughed merrily dad you old fox did you see him ride out after me  no i was just askin onon general principles  what do you mean  lucy is there anythin between you an joel he asked gravely  no she replied with her clear eyes up to his  bostil thought of a bluebell im beggin your pardon he said hastily  dad you know how joel runs after me ive told you i let him till lately i liked him but that wasnt why i felt sorry for himpitied him  you did seems an awful waste replied bostil  dad i dont believe joel isperfectly right in his mind lucy said solemnly  haw haw fine compliments youre payin yourself  listen im serious i mean ive grown to seelooking backthat a slow gradual change has come over joel since he was kicked in the head by a mustang im sure no one else has noticed it  goin batty over you thats no unusual sign round this here camp look at  were talking about joel creech lately he has done some queer things today for instance i thought i gave him the slip but he must have been watching anyway to my surprise he showed up on peg he doesnt often get peg across the river he said the feed was getting scarce over there i was dying to race buckles against peg but i remembered you wouldnt like that  i should say not said bostil darkly  well joel caught up to meand he wasnt nice at all he was worse today we quarreled i said id bet hed never follow me again and he said hed bet he would then he got sulky and hung back i rode away glad to be rid of him and i climbed to a favorite place of mine on my way home i saw peg grazing on the rim of the creek near that big springhole where the waters so deep and clear and what do you think there was joels head above the water i remembered in our quarrel i had told him to go wash his dirty face he was doing it i had to laugh when he saw mehethenthen he lucy faltered blushing with anger and shame  well what then demanded bostil quietly  he called hey lucetake off your clothes and come in for a swim  bostil swore  i tell you i was mad continued lucy and just as surprised that was one of the queer things but never before had he dared toto  insult you then what d you do interrupted bostil curiously  i yelled ill fix you joel creech his clothes were in a pile on the bank at first i thought id throw them in the water but when i got to them i thought of something better i took up all but his shoes for i remembered the ten miles of rock and cactus between him and home and i climbed up on buckles joel screamed and swore something fearful but i didnt look back and peg you knowmaybe you dont knowbut peg is fond of me and he followed me straddling his bridle all the way in i dropped joels clothes down the ridge a ways right in the trail so he cant miss them and thats all dad was itwas it very bad  bad why you ought to have thrown your gun on him at least bounced a rock off his head but say lucy after all maybe youve done enough i guess you never thought of it  what  the sun is hot today hot an if joels as crazy an mad as you say hell not have sense enough to stay in the water or shade till the suns gone down an if he tackles that ten miles before hell sunburn himself within an inch of his life  sunburn oh dad im sorry burst out lucy contritely i never thought of that ill ride back with his clothes  you will not said bostil  let me send some one then she entreated  girl havent you the nerve to play your own game let creech get his lesson he deserves it an now lucy ive two more questions to ask  only two she queried archly dad dont scold me with questions  what shall i say to wetherby for good an all  lucys eyes shaded dreamily and she seemed to look beyond the room out over the ranges  tell him to go back to durango and forget the foolish girl who can care only for the desert and a horse  all right that is straight talk like an indians an now the last questionwhat do you want for a birthday present  oh of course she cried gleefully clapping her hands id forgotten that im eighteen  you get that old chest of your mothers but what from me  dad will you give me anything i ask for  yes my girl  anythingany horse  lucy knew his weakness for she had inherited it  sure any horse but the king  how about sarchedon  why lucy whatd you do with that big black devil hes too high seventeen hands high you couldnt mount him  pooh sarch kneels for me  child listen to reason sarch would pull your arms out of their sockets  he has got an iron jaw agreed lucy well thenhow about dusty ben she was tormenting her father and she did it with glee  nonot ben hes the faithfulest hoss i ever owned it wouldnt be fair to part with him even to you old associations  a riders loyalty  now lucy you know  dad youre afraid id train and love ben into beating the king some day ill ride some horse out in front of the gray remember dad  then give me two face  sure not her lucy thet mare cant be trusted look why we named her two face  buckles then dear generous daddy who longs to give his grownup girl anything  lucy cant you be satisfied an happy with your mustangs youve got a dozen you can have any others on the range buckles aint safe for you to ride  bostil was notably the most generous of men the kindest of fathers it was an indication of his strange obsession in regard to horses that he never would see that lucy was teasing him as far as horses were concerned he lacked a sense of humor anything connected with his horses was of intense interest  id dearly love to own plume said lucy demurely  bostil had grown red in the face and now he was on the rack the monstrous selfishness of a rider who had been supreme in his day could not be changed  girl ii thought you hadnt no use for plume he stammered  i haventthe jade she threw me once ive never forgiven her  dad im only teasing you dont i know you couldnt give one of those racers away you couldnt  lucy i reckon youre right bostil burst out in immense relief  dad ill bet if cordts gets me and holds me as ransom for the kingas hes threatenedyoull let him have me  lucy now thet aint funny complained the father  dear dad keep your old racers but remember im my fathers daughter i can love a horse too oh if i ever get the one i want to love a wild horsea desert stallionpure arabianbroken right by an indian if i ever get him dad you look out for ill run away from sarch and benand ill beat the king  the hamlet of bostils ford had a singular situation though considering the wonderful nature of that desert country it was not exceptional it lay under the protecting red bluff that only lucy bostil cared to climb a hardtrodden road wound down through rough breaks in the canyon wall to the river bostils house at the head of the village looked in the opposite direction down the sage slope that widened like a colossal fan there was one wide street bordered by cottonwoods and cabins and a number of gardens and orchards beginning to burst into green and pink and white a brook ran out of a ravine in the huge bluff and from this led irrigation ditches the red earth seemed to blossom at the touch of water  the place resembled an indian encampmentquiet sleepy colorful with the tinystreams of water running everywhere and lazy columns of blue woodsmoke rising bostils ford was the opposite of a busy village yet its few inhabitants as a whole were prosperous the wants of pioneers were few perhaps once a month the big clumsy flatboat was rowed across the river with horses or cattle or sheep and the season was now close at hand when for weeks sometimes months the river was unfordable there were a score of permanent families a host of merry sturdy children a number of idle young men and only one girllucy bostil but the village always had transient inhabitantsfriendly utes and navajos in to trade and sheepherders with a scraggy woolly flock and travelers of the strange religious sect identified with utah going on into the wilderness then there were always riders passing to and fro and sometimes unknown ones regarded with caution horsethieves sometimes boldly rode in and sometimes were able to sell or trade in the matter of horsedealing bostils ford was as bold as the thieves  old brackton a man of varied western experience kept the one store which was tavern tradingpost freighters headquarters blacksmiths shop and any thing else needful brackton employed riders teamsters sometimes indians to freight supplies in once a month from durango and that was over two hundred miles away sometimes the supplies did not arrive on timeoccasionally not at all news from the outside world except that elicited from the taciturn travelers marching into utah drifted in at intervals but it was not missed these wilderness spirits were the forerunners of a great movement and as such were big strong stern sufficient unto themselves life there was made possible by horses the distant future that looked bright to farseeing men must be and could only be fulfilled through the endurance and faithfulness of horses and then from these men horses received the meed due them and the love they were truly worth the navajo was a nomad horseman an arab of the painted desert and the ute indian was close to him it was they who developed the white riders of the uplands as well as the wildhorse wrangler or hunter  bracktons ramshackle establishment stood down at the end of the village street there was not a sawed board in all that structure and some of the pine logs showed how they had been dropped from the bluff brackton a little old gray man with scant beard and eyes like those of a bird came briskly out to meet an incoming freighter the wagon was minus a hind wheel but the teamster had come in on three wheels and a pole the sweaty dustcaked weary thinribbed mustangs and the grayandredstained wagon and the huge jumble of dusty packs showed something of what the journey had been  hi thar red wilson you air some late gettin in greeted old brackton  red wilson had red eyes from fighting the flying sand and red dust pasted in his scraggy beard and as he gave his belt an upward hitch little red clouds flew from his gunsheath  yep an i left a wheel an part of the load on the trail he said  with him were indians who began to unhitch the teams riders lounging in the shade greeted wilson and inquired for news the teamster replied that travel was dry the waterholes were dry and he was dry and his reply gave both concern and amusement  one more trip out an backthets all till it rains concluded wilson  brackton led him inside evidently to alleviate part of that dryness  water and grass next to horses were the stock subject of all riders  its got oncommon hot early said one  yes an them northeast windshard this spring said another  no snow on the uplands  holley seen a dry spell comin wal we can drift along without freighters theres grass an water enough here even if it doesnt rain  sure but there aint none across the river  never was in early season an if there was itd be sheeped off  creechll be fetchin his hosses across soon i reckon  you bet he will hes trainin for the races next month  an when air they comin off  you got me mebbe van knows  some one prodded a sleepy rider who lay all his splendid lithe length hat over his eyes then he sat up and blinked a leanfaced grayeyed fellow half goodnatured and half resentful  did somebody punch me  naw you got nightmare say van when will the races come off  huh an you woke me for thet  bostil says in a few weeks soon as he hears from the indians plans to have eight hundred indians here an the biggest purses an best races ever had at the ford  youll ride the king again  reckon so but bostil is kickin because im heavier than i was replied the rider  youre skin an bones at thet  mebbe youll need to work a little off van some one said creechs blue roan was comin fast this year  bill your mind aint operatin replied van scornfully didnt i beat creechs hosses last year without the king turnin a hair  not if i recollect you didnt the blue roan wasnt runnin  then they argued after the manner of friendly riders but all earnest an eloquent in their convictions the prevailing opinion was that creechs horse had a chance depending upon condition and luck  the argument shifted upon the arrival of two newcomers leading mustangs and apparently talking trade it was manifest that these arrivals were not loath to get the opinions of others  van theres a hoss exclaimed one  no he aint replied van  and that diverse judgment appeared to be characteristic throughout the strange thing was that macomber the rancher had already traded his mustang and money to boot for the sorrel the deal whether wise or not had been consummated brackton came out with red wilson and they had to have their say  wal durned if some of you fellers aint kind an complimentary remarked macomber scratching his head but then every feller cant have hoss sense then looking up to see lucy bostil coming along the road he brightened as if with inspiration  lucy was at home among them and the shy eyes of the younger riders especially van were nothing if not revealing she greeted them with a bright smile and when she saw brackton she burst out  oh mr brackton the wagons in and did my box come  todays my birthday  deed it did lucy an many more happy ones to you he replied delighted in her delight but its too heavy for you ill send it upor mebbe one of the boys  five riders in unison eagerly offered their services and looked as if each had spoken first then macomber addressed her  miss lucy you see this here sorrel  ah the same lazy crowd and the same old storya horse trade laughed lucy  theres a little difference of opinion said macomber politely indicating the riders now miss lucy weall know youre a judge of a hoss and as good as thet you tell the truth thet aint in some hosstraders i know what do you think of this mustang  macomber had eyes of enthusiasm for his latest acquisition but some of the cocksureness had been knocked out of him by the blunt riders  macomber arent you a great one to talk queried lucy severely didnt you get around dad and trade him an old blind knockkneed bag of bones for a perfectly good ponyone i liked to ride  the riders shouted with laughter while the rancher struggled with confusion  pon my word miss lucy im surprised you could think thet of such an old friend of yoursan your dads too im hopin he doesnt side altogether with you  dad and i never agree about a horse he thinks he got the best of you but you know macomber what a horsethief you are worse than cordts  wal if i got the best of bostil im willin to be thought bad im the first feller to take him in an now miss lucy look over my sorrel  lucy bostil did indeed have an eye for a horse she walked straight up to the wild shaggy mustang with a confidence born of intuition and experience and reached a hand for his head not slowly nor yet swiftly the mustang looked as if he was about to jump but he did not his eyes showed that he was not used to women  hes not well broken said lucy some navajo has beaten his head in breaking him  then she carefully studied the mustang point by point  hes deceiving at first because hes good to look at said lucy but i wouldnt own him a saddle will turn on him hes not vicious but hell never get over his scare hes narrow between the eyesa bad sign his ears are stiffand too close i dont see anything more wrong with him  you seen enough declared macomber an so you wouldnt own him  you couldnt make me a present of himeven on my birthday  wal now im sorry for i was thinkin of thet replied macomber ruefully it was plain that the sorrel had fallen irremediably in his estimation  macomber i often tell dad all you horsetraders get your deserts now and then its vanity and desire to beat the other man thats your downfall  lucy went away with van shouldering her box leaving macomber trying to return the banter of the riders the goodnatured raillery was interrupted by a sharp word from one of them  look darn me if thet aint a naked indian comin  the riders whirled to see an apparently nude savage approaching almost on a run  take a shot at thet bill said another rider miss lucy might seeno shes out of sight but mebbe some other woman is around  hold on bill called macomber you never saw an indian run like thet  some of the riders swore others laughed and all suddenly became keen with interest  sure his face is white if his bodys red  the strange figure neared them it was indeed red up to the face which seemed white in contrast yet only in general shape and action did it resemble a man  damned if it aint joel creech sang out bill stark  the other riders accorded their wondering assent  gone crazy sure  i always seen it comin  say but aint he wild foamin at the mouth like a winded hoss  young creech was headed down the road toward the ford across which he had to go to reach home he saw the curious group slowed his pace and halted his face seemed convulsed with rage and pain and fatigue his body even to his hands was incased in a thick heavy coating of red adobe that had caked hard  gods sakefellers he panted with eyes rolling take thisdobe mud off me  im dyin  then he staggered into bracktons place a howl went up from the riders and they surged after him  that evening after supper bostil stamped in the big room roaring with laughter red in the face and he astonished lucy and her aunt to the point of consternation  nowyouvedoneitlucy bostil he roared  oh dear oh dear exclaimed aunt jane  done what asked lucy blankly  bostil conquered his paroxysm and wiping his moist red face he eyed lucy in mock solemnity  joel whispered lucy who had a guilty conscience  lucy i never heard the beat of it joels smarter in some ways than we thought an crazier in others he had the sun figgered but whatd he want to run through town for why never in my life have i seen such tickled riders  dad almost screamed lucy what did joel do  wal i see it this way he couldnt or wouldnt wait for sundown an he wasnt hankerin to be burned so he wallows in a dobe mudhole an covers himself thick with mud you know that dobe mud then he starts home but he hadnt figgered on the dobe gettin hard which it didharder n rock an thet must have hurt more n sunburn late this afternoon he came runnin down the road yellin thet he was dyin the boys had conniption fits joel aint overliked you know an here they had one on him mebbe they didnt try hard to clean him off but the fact is not for hours did they get thet dobe off him they washed an scrubbed an curried him while he yelled an cussed finally they peeled it off with his skin i guess he was raw an they say the maddest feller ever seen in bostils ford  lucy was struggling between fear and mirth she did not look sorry oh oh oh dad  wasnt it great lucy  but whatwill hedo choked lucy  lord only knows thet worries me some because he never said a word about how he come to lose his clothes or why he had the dobe on him an sure i never told nobody knows but us  dad hell do something terrible to me cried lucy aghast at her premonition    chapter iii  the days did not pass swiftly at bostils ford and except in winter and during the spring sandstorms the lagging time passed pleasantly lucy rode every day sometimes with van and sometimes alone she was not overkeen about riding with vanfirst because he was in love with her and secondly in spite of that she could not beat him when he rode the king they were training bostils horses for the muchanticipated races  at last word arrived from the utes and navajos that they accepted bostils invitation and would come in force which meant according to holley and other old riders that the indians would attend about eight hundred strong  thet old chief hawk is comin holley informed bostil he hasnt been here fer several years recollect thet bunch of colts he had theyre bosses not mustangs so you look out bostil  no rider or rancher or sheepman in fact no one ever lost a chance to warn bostil some of it was in fun but most of it was earnest the nature of events was that sooner or later a horse would beat the king bostil knew that as well as anybody though he would not admit it holleys hint made bostil look worried most of bostils gray hairs might have been traced to his years of worry about horses  the day he received word from the indians he sent for brackton williams muncie and creech to come to his house that night these men with bostil had for years formed in a way a club which gave the ford distinction creech was no longer a friend of bostils but bostil had always been fairminded and now he did not allow his animosities to influence him holley the veteran rider made the sixth member of the club  bostil had a cedar log blazing cheerily in the wide fireplace for these early spring nights in the desert were cold  brackton was the last guest to arrive he shuffled in without answering the laconic greetings accorded him and his usually mild eyes seemed keen and hard  john i reckon you wont love me fer this here ive got to tell you tonight specially he said seriously  you old robber i couldnt love you anyhow retorted bostil but his humor did not harmonize with the sudden gravity of his look whats up  who do you suppose i jest sold whisky to  ive no idea replied bostil yet he looked as if he was perfectly sure  cordts  cordts an four of his outfit two of them i didnt know bad men judgin from appearances let alone company the others was hutchinson andick sears  dick sears exclaimed bostil  muncie and williams echoed bostil holley appeared suddenly interested creech alone showed no surprise  but sears is dead added bostil  he was deadwe thought replied brackton with a grim laugh but hes alive again he told me hed been in idaho fer two years in the goldfields said the work was too hard so hed come back here laughed when he said it the little devil ill bet he was thinkin of thet wagontrain of mine he stole  bostil gazed at his chief rider  wal i reckon we didnt kill sears after all replied holley i wasnt never sure  lord cordts an sears in camp ejaculated bostil and he began to pace the room  no theyre gone now said brackton  take it easy boss sit down drawled holley the king is safe an all the racers i swear to thet why cordts couldnt chop into thet loganwire corral if he an his gang chopped all night they hate work besides farlane is there an the boys  this reassured bostil and he resumed his chair but his hand shook a little  did cordts have anythin to say he asked  sure he was friendly an talkative replied brackton he came in just after dark left a man i didnt see out with the hosses he bought two big packs of supplies an some leather stuff an of course ammunition then some whisky had plenty of gold an wouldnt take no change then while his men except sears was carryin out the stuff he talked  go on tell me said bostil  wal hed been out north of durango an fetched news theres wild talk back there of a railroad goin to be built some day joinin east an west its interestin but no sense to it how could they build a railroad through thet country  north it aint so cut up an lumpy as here put in holley  grandest idea ever thought of for the west avowed bostil if thet railroad ever starts well all get rich  go on brack  then cordts said water an grass was peterin out back on the trail same as red wilson said last week finally he asked hows my friend bostil i told him you was well he looked kind of thoughtful then an i knew what was cominhows the king grand i told himgrand when is them races comin off i said we hadnt planned the time yet but it would be sooninside of a month or two brackton he said sharplike is bostil goin to pull a gun on me at sight reckon he is i told him wal im not powerful glad to know thet i hear creechs blue hoss will race the king this time how about it sure an certain this year ive creechs an bostils word for thet cordts put his hand on my shoulder you ought to ve seen his eyesi want to see thet race im goin to wal i said youll have to stop beinyoull need to change your bizness then bostil what do you think cordts was sort of eager an wild he said thet was a race he jest couldnt miss he swore he wouldnt turn a trick or let a man of his gang stir a hand till after thet race if youd let him come  a light flitted across bostils face  i know how cordts feels he said  wal its a queer deal went on brackton fer a long time youve meant to draw on cordts when you meet we all know thet  yes ill kill him the light left bostils face his voice sounded differently his mouth opened drooped strangely at the corners then shut in a grim tense line bostil had killed more than one man the memory no doubt was haunting and ghastly  cordts seemed to think his word was guarantee of his good faith he said hed send an indian in here to find out if he can come to the races i reckon bostil thet it wouldnt hurt none to let him come an hold your gun hand fer the time he swears hell be honest queer deal aint it men a hossthief turnin honest jest to see a race beats me bostil its a cheap way to get at least a little honesty from cordts an refusin might rile him bad when alls said cordts aint as bad as he could be  ill let him come replied bostil breathing deep but itll be hard to see him rememberin how hes robbed me an what hes threatened an i aint lettin him come to bribe a few weeks decency from him im doin it for only one reason because i know how he loves the kinghow he wants to see the king run away from the field thet day thets why  there was a moment of silence during which all turned to creech he was a stalwart man no longer young with a lined face deepset troubled eyes and white thin beard  bostil if cordts loves the king thet well hes in fer heartbreak said creech with a ring in his voice  down crashed bostils heavy boots and fire flamed in his gaze the other men laughed and brackton interposed  hold on you boy riders he yelled we aint agoin to have any arguments like thet now bostil its settled then youll let cordts come  glad to have him replied bostil  good an now mebbe wed better get down to the bizness of this here meetin  they seated themselves around the table upon which bostil laid an old and muchsoiled ledger and a stub of a leadpencil  first well set the time he said with animation an then pitch into details whats the date  no one answered and presently they all looked blankly from one to the other  its april aint it queried holley  that assurance was as close as they could get to the time of year  lucy called bostil in a loud voice  she came running in anxious almost alarmed  goodness you made us jump what on earth is the matter  lucy we want to know the date replied bostil  date did you have to scare auntie and me out of our wits just for that  who scared you this is important lucy whats the date  its a week today since last tuesday answered lucy sweetly  huh then its tuesday again said bostil laboriously writing it down now whats the date  dont you remember  remember i never knew  dad  last tuesday was my birthdaythe day you did not give me a horse  aw so it was rejoined bostil confused at her reproach an thet date waslets seeapril sixth then this is april thirteenth much obliged lucy run back to your aunt now this hoss talk wont interest you  lucy tossed her head ill bet ill have to straighten out the whole thing then with a laugh she disappeared  three days beginninsay june first june firstsecond an third how about thet for the races  everybody agreed and bostil laboriously wrote that down then they planned the details purses and prizes largely donated by bostil and muncie the rich members of the community were recorded the old rules were adhered to any rider or any indian could enter any horse in any race or as many horses as he liked in as many races but by winning one race he excluded himself from the others bostil argued for a certain weight in riders but the others ruled out this suggestion special races were arranged for the indians with saddles bridles blankets guns as prizes  all this appeared of absorbing interest to bostil he perspired freely there was a gleam in his eye betraying excitement when it came to arranging the details of the big race between the highclass racers then he grew intense and harder to deal with many points had to go by vote muncie and williams both had fleet horses to enter in this race holley had one creech had two there were sure to be several indians enter fast mustangs and bostil had the king and four others to choose from bostil held out stubbornly for a long race it was well known that sage king was unbeatable in a long race if there were any chance to beat him it must be at short distance the vote went against bostil much to his chagrin and the great race was set down for two miles  but two miles  two miles he kept repeating thets blue roans distance thets his distance an it aint fair to the king  his guests excepting creech argued with him explained reasoned showed him that it was fair to all concerned bostil finally acquiesced but he was not happy the plain fact was that he was frightened  when the men were departing bostil called creech back into the sittingroom creech appeared surprised yet it was evident that he would have been glad to make friends with bostil  whatll you take for the roan bostil asked tersely as if he had never asked that before  bostil didnt we thresh thet out beforean fell out over it queried creech with a deprecating spread of his hands  wal we can fall in again if youll sell or trade the hoss  im sorry but i cant  you need money an hosses dont you demanded bostil brutally he had no conscience in a matter of horsedealing  lord knows i do replied creech  wal then heres your chance ill give you five hundred in gold an sarchedon to boot  creech looked as if he had not heard aright bostil repeated the offer  no replied creech  ill make it a thousand an throw plume in with sarch flashed bostil  no creech turned pale and swallowed hard  two thousand an dusty ben along with the others this was an unheardof price to pay for any horse creech saw that bostil was desperate it was an almost overpowering temptation evidently creech resisted it only by applying all his mind to the thought of his cleanlimbed softeyed noble horse  bostil did not give creech time to speak twentyfive hundred an two face along with the rest  my god bostilstop it i cant part with blue roan youre rich an youve no heart thet i always knew at least to me you never had since i owned them two racers didnt i beg you a little time back to lend me a few hundred to meet thet debt an you wouldnt unless id sell the hosses an i had to lose my sheep now im a poor mangettin poorer all the time but i wont sell or trade blue roan not for all youve got  creech seemed to gain strength with his speech and passion with the strength his eyes glinted at the hard paling face of his rival he raised a clenching fist  an by gd im goin to win thet race  during that week lucy had heard many things about joel creech and some of them were disquieting  some rider had not only found joels clothes on the trail but he had recognized the track of the horse lucy rode and at once connected her with the singular discovery coupling that with joels appearance in the village incased in a heaving armor of adobe the riders guessed pretty close to the truth for them the joke was tremendous and joel creech was exceedingly sensitive to ridicule the riders made life unbearable for him they had fun out of it as long as joel showed signs of taking the joke manfully which was not long and then his resentment won their contempt that led to sarcasm on their part and bitter anger on his it came to lucys ears that joel began to act and talk strangely she found out that the rider van had knocked joel down in bracktons store and had kicked a gun out of his hand van laughed off the rumor and brackton gave her no satisfaction moreover she heard no other rumors the channels of gossip had suddenly closed to her bostil when questioned by lucy swore in a way that amazed her and all he told her was to leave creech alone finally when muncie discharged joel who worked now and then lucy realized that something was wrong with joel and that she was to blame for it  she grew worried and anxious and sorry but she held her peace and determined to find out for herself what was wrong every day when she rode out into the sage she expected to meet him or at least see him somewhere nevertheless days went by and there was no sign of him  one afternoon she saw some indians driving sheep down the river road toward the ford and acting upon impulse she turned her horse after them  lucy seldom went down the river road riding down and up was merely work and a horse has as little liking for it as she had usually it was a hot dusty trip and the great dark overhanging walls had a depressing effect upon her she always felt awe at the gloomy canyon and fear at the strange murmuring red river but she started down this afternoon in the hope of meeting joel she had a hazy idea of telling him she was sorry for what she had done and of asking him to forget it and pay no more heed to the riders  the sheep raised a dustcloud in the sandy wash where the road wound down and lucy hung back to let them get farther ahead gradually the tiny roar of pattering hoofs and the blended bleating and baaing died away the dustcloud however hung over the head of the ravine and lucy had to force sarchedon through it sarchedon did not mind sand and dust but he surely hated the smell of sheep lucy seldom put a spur to sarchedon still she gave him a lash with her quirt and then he went on obediently if disgustedly he carried his head like a horse that wondered why his mistress preferred to drive him down into an unpleasant hole when she might have been cutting the sweet cool sage wind up on the slope  the wash with its sand and clay walls dropped into a gulch and there was an end of green growths the road led down over solid rock gradually the rims of the gorge rose shutting out the light and the cliffs it was a winding road and one not safe to tarry on in a stormy season lucy had seen boulders weighing a ton go booming down that gorge during one of the sudden fierce desert storms when a torrent of water and mud and stone went plunging on to the river the ride through here was short though slow lucy always had time to adjust her faculties for the overpowering contrast these lower regions presented long before she reached the end of the gorge she heard the sullen thunder of the river the river was low too for otherwise there would have been a deafening roar  presently she came out upon a lower branch of the canyon into a great redwalled space with the river still a thousand feet below and the cliffs towering as high above her the road led down along this rim where to the left all was open across to the split and peaked wall opposite the river appeared to sweep round a bold bulging corner a mile above it was a wide swift muddy turbulent stream a great bar of sand stretched out from the shore beyond it through the mouth of an intersecting canyon could be seen a clump of cottonwoods and willows that marked the home of the creeches lucy could not see the shore nearest her as it was almost directly under her besides in this narrow road on a spirited horse she was not inclined to watch the scenery she hurried sarchedon down and down under the overhanging brows of rock to where the rim sloped out and failed here was a halfacre of sand with a few scant willows set down seemingly in a dent at the base of the giant beetling cliffs the place was light though the light seemed a kind of veiled red and to lucy always ghastly she could not have been joyous with that river moaning before her even if it had been up on a level in the clear and open day as a little girl eight years old she had conceived a terror and hatred of this huge jagged rent so full of red haze and purple smoke and the thunder of rushing waters and she had never wholly outgrown it the joy of the sun and wind the rapture in the boundless open the sweetness in the sagethese were not possible here something mighty and ponderous heavy as those colossal cliffs weighted down her spirit the voice of the river drove out any dream here was the incessant frowning presence of destructive forces of nature and the ford was associated with catastropheto sheep to horses and to men  lucy rode across the bar to the shore where the indians were loading the sheep into an immense rude flatboat as the sheep were frightened the loading was no easy task their bleating could be heard above the roar of the river bostils boatmen shugrue and somers stood kneedeep in the quicksand of the bar and their efforts to keep freefooted were as strenuous as their handling of the sheep presently the flock was all crowded on board the indians followed and then the boatmen slid the unwieldy craft off the sandbar then each manning a clumsy oar they pulled upstream along shore were whirling slow eddies and there rowing was possible out in that swift current it would have been folly to try to contend with it let alone make progress the method of crossing was to row up along the shore as far as a great cape of rock jutting out and there make into the current and while drifting down pull hard to reach the landing opposite heavily laden as the boat was the chances were not wholly in favor of a successful crossing  lucy watched the slow laborious struggle of the boatmen with the heavy oars until she suddenly remembered the object of her visit down to the ford she appeared to be alone on her side of the river at the landing opposite however were two men and presently lucy recognized joel creech and his father a second glance showed indians with burros evidently waiting for the boat joel creech jumped into a skiff and shoved off the elder man judging by his motions seemed to be trying to prevent his son from leaving the shore but joel began to row upstream keeping close to the shore lucy watched him no doubt he had seen her and was coming across either the prospect of meeting him or the idea of meeting him there in the place where she was never herself made her want to turn at once and ride back home but her stubborn sense of fairness overruled that she would hold her ground solely in the hope of persuading joel to be reasonable she saw the big flatboat sweep into line of sight at the same time joel turned into the current but while the larger craft drifted slowly the other way the smaller one came swiftly down and across joel swept out of the current into the eddy rowed across that and slid the skiff up on the sandbar then he stepped out he was bareheaded and barefooted but it was not that which made him seem a stranger to lucy  are you lookin fer me he shouted  lucy waved a hand for him to come up  then he approached he was a tall lean young man stoopshouldered and bowlegged from much riding with sallow freckled face a thin fuzz of beard weak mouth and chin and eyes remarkable for their small size and piercing quality and different color for one was gray and the other was hazel there was no scar on his face but the irregularity of his features reminded one who knew that he had once been kicked in the face by a horse  creech came up hurriedly in an eager wild way that made lucy suddenly pity him he did not seem to remember that the stallion had an antipathy for him but lucy if she had forgotten would have been reminded by sarchedons action  look out joel she called and she gave the blacks head a jerk sarchedon went up with a snort and came down pounding the sand quick as an indian lucy was out of the saddle  lemme your quirt said joel showing his teeth like a wolf  no i wouldnt let you hit sarch you beat him once and hes never forgotten replied lucy  the eye of the horse and the man met and clashed and there was a hostile tension in their attitudes then lucy dropped the bridle and drew joel over to a huge driftlog half buried in the sand here she sat down but joel remained standing his gaze was now all the stranger for its wistfulness lucy was quick to catch a subtle difference in him but she could not tell wherein it lay  whatd you want asked joel  ive heard a lot of things joel replied lucy trying to think of just what she wanted to say  reckon you have said joel dejectedly and then he sat down on the log and dug holes in the sand with his bare feet  lucy had never before seen him look tired and it seemed that some of the healthy brown of his cheeks had thinned out then lucy told him guardedly a few of the rumors she had heard  all thet you say is nothin to whats happened he replied bitterly them riders mocked the life an soul out of me  but joel you shouldnt be soso touchy said lucy earnestly after all the joke was on you why didnt you take it like a man  but they knew you stole my clothes he protested  suppose they did that wasnt much to care about if you hadnt taken it so hard theyd have let up on you  mebbe i might have stood that but they taunted me with beinloony about you  joel spoke huskily there was no doubt that he had been deeply hurt lucy saw tears in his eyes and her first impulse was to put a hand on his and tell him how sorry she was but she desisted she did not feel at her ease with joel  whatd you and van fight about she asked presently joel hung his head i reckon i aint agoin to tell you  youre ashamed of it  joels silence answered that  you said something about me lucy could not resist her curiosity back of which was a little heat it must have beenbadelse van wouldnt have struck you  he hit mehe knocked me flat passionately said joel  and you drew a gun on him  i did an like a fool i didnt wait till i got up then he kicked me  bostils ford will never be big enough fer me an van now  dont talk foolish you wont fight with van joel maybe you deserved what you got you say somesome rude things  i only said id pay you back burst out joel  how  i swore id lay fer youan steal your clothesso youd have to run home naked  there was indeed something lacking in joel but it was not sincerity his hurt had rankled deep and his voice trembled with indignation  but joel i dont go swimming in springholes protested lucy divided between amusement and annoyance  i meant it anyhow said joel doggedly  are you absolutely honest is that all you said to provoke van  its all lucy i swear  she believed him and saw the unfortunate circumstance more than ever her fault im sorry joel im much to blame i shouldnt have lost my temper and played that trick with your clothes if youd only had sense enough to stay out till after dark but no use crying over spilt milk now if youll do your share ill do mine ill tell the boys i was to blame ill persuade them to let you alone ill go to muncie  no you wont go cryin small fer me blurted out joel  lucy was surprised to see pride in him joel ill not make it appear  youll not say one word about me to any one he went on with the blood beginning to darken his face and now he faced her how strange the blaze in his differently colored eyes lucy bostil theres been thet done an said to me which ill never forgive im no good in bostils ford mebbe i never was much but i could get a job when i wanted it an credit when i needed it now i cant get nothin im no good  im no good an its your fault  oh joel what can i do cried lucy  i reckon theres only one way you can square me he replied suddenly growing pale but his eyes were like flint he certainly looked to be in possession of all his wits  how queried lucy sharply  you can marry me thetll show thet gang an itll square me then ill go back to work an ill stick thets all lucy bostil  manifestly he was laboring under strong suppressed agitation that moment was the last of real strength and dignity ever shown by joel creech  but joel i cant marry youeven if i am to blame for your ruin said lucy simply  why  because i dont love you  i reckon thet wont make any difference if you dont love some one else  lucy gazed blankly at him he began to shake and his eyes grew wild she rose from the log  do you love anybody else he asked passionately  none of your business retorted lucy then at a strange darkening of his face an aspect unfamiliar to her she grew suddenly frightened  its van he said thickly  joel youre a fool  that only infuriated him  so they all say an they got my old man believin it too mebbe i am but im agoin to kill van  no no joel what are you saying i dont love van i dont care any more for him than for any other rideroror you  thets a lie lucy bostil  how dare you say i lie demanded lucy ive a mind to turn my back on you im trying to make up for my blunder and youyou insult me  you talk sweet  but talk isnt enough you made me nogood  will you marry me  i will not and lucy with her blood up could not keep contempt out of voice and look and she did not care that was the first time she had ever shown anything approaching ridicule for joel the effect was remarkable like a lash upon a raw wound it made him writhe but more significant to lucy was the sudden convulsive working of his features and the wildness of his eyes then she turned her back not from contempt but to hurry away from him  he leaped after her and grasped her with rude hands  let me go cried lucy standing perfectly motionless the hard clutch of his fingers roused a fierce hot anger  joel did not heed her command he was forcing her back he talked incoherently one glimpse of his face added terror to lucys fury  joel youre out of your head she cried and she began to wrench and writhe out of his grasp then ensued a short sharp struggle joel could not hold lucy but he tore her blouse into shreds it seemed to lucy that he did that savagely she broke free from him and he lunged at her again with all her strength she lashed his face with the heavy leather quirt that staggered him he almost fell  lucy bounded to sarchedon in a rush she was up in the saddle joel was running toward her blood on his face blood on his hands he was not the joel creech she knew  stop cried lucy fiercely ill run you down  the big black plunged at a touch of spur and came down quivering ready to bolt  creech swerved to one side his face was lividly white except where the bloody welts crossed it his jaw seemed to hang loosely making speech difficult  jest ferthet he panted hoarsely ill lay fer youan ill strip youan ill tie you on a hossan ill drive you naked through bostils ford  lucy saw the utter futility of all her good intentions something had snapped in joel creechs mind and in hers kindness had given precedence to a fury she did not know was in her for the second time she touched a spur to sarchedon he leaped out flashed past creech and thundered up the road it was all lucy could do to break his gait at the first steep rise    chapter iv  three wildhorse hunters made camp one night beside a little stream in the sevier valley five hundred miles as a crow flies from bostils ford  these hunters had a poor outfit excepting of course their horses they were young men rangy in build lean and hard from life in the saddle bronzed like indians stillfaced and keeneyed two of them appeared to be tired out and lagged at the campfire duties when the meager meal was prepared they sat crosslegged before a ragged tarpaulin eating and drinking in silence  the sky in the west was rosy slowly darkening the valley floor billowed away ridged and cut growing gray and purple and dark walls of stone pink with the last rays of the setting sun inclosed the valley stretching away toward a long low black mountain range  the place was wild beautiful open with something nameless that made the desert different from any other country it was perhaps a loneliness of vast stretches of valley and stone clear to the eye even after sunset that black mountain range which looked close enough to ride to before dark was a hundred miles distant  the shades of night fell swiftly and it was dark by the time the hunters finished the meal then the campfire had burned low one of the three dragged branches of dead cedars and replenished the fire quickly it flared up with the white flame and crackle characteristic of dry cedar the night wind had risen moaning through the gnarled stunted cedars near by and it blew the fragrant woodsmoke into the faces of the two hunters who seemed too tired to move  i reckon a pipe would help me make up my mind said one  wal bill replied the other dryly your minds made up else youd not say smoke  why  because there aint three pipefuls of thet precious tobacco left  thets one apiece then lin come an smoke the last pipe with us  the tallest of the three he who had brought the firewood stood in the bright light of the blaze he looked the born rider light lithe powerful  sure ill smoke he replied  then presently he accepted the pipe tendered him and sitting down beside the fire he composed himself to the enjoyment which his companions evidently considered worthy of a decision they had reached  so this smokin means you both want to turn back queried lin his sharp gaze glancing darkly bright in the glow of the fire  yep well turn back an lordy the relief i feel replied one  weve been long comin to it lin an thet was for your sake replied the other  lin slowly pulled at his pipe and blew out the smoke as if reluctant to part with it lets go on he said quietly  no ive had all i want of chasin thet damn wild stallion returned bill shortly  the other spread wide his hands and bent an expostulating look upon the one called lin were two hundred miles out he said theres only a little flour left in the bag no coffee only a little salt all the hosses except your big nagger are played out were already in strange country an you know what weve heerd of this an all to the south its all canyons an somewheres down there is thet awful canyon none of our people ever seen but weve heerd of it an awful cutup country  he finished with a conviction that no one could say a word against the common sense of his argument lin was silent as if impressed  bill raised a strong lean brown hand in a forcible gesture we cant ketch wildfire  that seemed to him evidently a more convincing argument than his comrades  bill is sure right if im wrong which i aint went on the other lin weve trailed thet wild stallion for six weeks thets the longest chase he ever had hes left his old range hes cut out his band an left them one by one weve tried every trick we know on him an hes too smart for us theres a hoss why lin were all but gone to the dogs chasin wildfire an now im done an im glad of it  there was another short silence which presently bill opened his lips to break  lin it makes me sick to quit i aint denyin thet for a long time ive had hopes of ketchin wildfire hes the grandest hoss i ever laid eyes on i reckon no man onless he was an arab ever seen as good a one but now thets neither here nor there weve got to hit the back trail  boys i reckon ill stick to wildfires tracks said lin in the same quiet tone  bill swore at him and the other hunter grew excited and concerned  lin slone are you gone plumb crazy over thet red hoss  ireckon replied slone the working of his throat as he swallowed could be plainly seen by his companions  bill looked at his ally as if to confirm some sudden understanding between them they took slones attitude gravely and they wagged their heads doubtfully as they might have done had slone just acquainted them with a hopeless and deathless passion for a woman it was significant of the nature of riders that they accepted his attitude and had consideration for his feelings for them the situation subtly changed for weeks they had been three wildhorse wranglers on a hard chase after a valuable stallion they had failed to get even close to him they had gone to the limit of their endurance and of the outfit and it was time to turn back but slone had conceived that strange and rare longing for a horsea passion understood if not shared by all riders and they knew that he would catch wildfire or die in the attempt from that moment their attitude toward slone changed as subtly as had come the knowledge of his feeling the gravity and gloom left their faces it seemed they might have regretted what they had said about the futility of catching wildfire they did not want slone to see or feel the hopelessness of his task  i tell you lin said bill your hoss naggers as good as when we started  aw hes better vouchsafed the other rider nagger needed to lose some weight lin have you got an extra set of shoes for him  no full set only three left replied lin soberly  wal thets enough you can keep nagger shod an mebbe thet red stallion will get sore feet an go lame then youd stand a chance  but wildfire keeps travelin the valleysthe soft ground said slone  no matter hes leavin the country an hes bound to strike sandstone sooner or later then by gosh mebbe hell wear off them hoofs  say cant he ring bells offen the rocks exclaimed bill oh lordy what a hoss  boys do you think hes leavin the country inquired slone anxiously  sure he is replied bill he aint the first stallion ive chased off the sevier range an i know its a stallion thet makes for new country when you push him hard  yep lin hes sure leavin added the other comrade why hes traveled a beeline for days ill bet hes seen us many a time wildfires about as smart as any man he was born wild an his dam was born wild an there you have it the wildest of all wild creaturesa wild stallion with the intelligence of a man a grand hoss lin but one thetll be hell if you ever ketch him he has killed stallions all over the sevier range a wild stallion thets a killer i never liked him for thet could he be broke  ill break him said lin slone grimly its gettin him thets the job ive got patience to break a hoss but patience cant catch a streak of lightnin  nope youre right replied bill if you have some luck youll get himmebbe if he wears out his feet or if you crowd him into a narrow canyon or ran him into a bad place where he cant get by you thet might happen an then with nagger you stand a chance did you ever tire thet hoss  not yet  an how fur did you ever run him without a break why when we ketched thet sorrel last year i rode nagger myselfthirty miles most at a hard gallop an he never turned a hair  ive beat thet replied lin he could run hard fifty milesmebbe more honestly i never seen him tired yet if only he was fast  wal nagger aint so durned slow come to think of thet replied bill with a grunt hes good enough for you not to want another hoss  lin youre goin to wear out wildfire an then trap him somehowis thet the plan asked the other comrade  i havent any plan ill just trail him like a cougar trails a deer  lin if wildfire gives you the slip hell have to fly youve got the best eyes for tracks of any wrangler in utah  slone accepted the compliment with a fleeting doubtful smile on his dark face he did not reply and no more was said by his comrades they rolled with backs to the fire slone put on more wood for the keen wind was cold and cutting and then he lay down his head in his saddle with a goatskin under him and a saddleblanket over him  all three were soon asleep the wind whipped the sand and ashes and smoke over the sleepers coyotes barked from near in darkness and from the valley ridge came the faint mourn of a hunting wolf the desert night grew darker and colder  the stewart brothers were wildhorse hunters for the sake of trades and occasional sales but lin slone never traded nor sold a horse he had captured the excitement of the game and the lure of the desert and the love of a horse were what kept him at the profitless work his type was rare in the uplands  these were the early days of the settlement of utah and only a few of the hardiest and most adventurous pioneers had penetrated the desert in the southern part of that vast upland and with them came some of that wild breed of riders to which slone and the stewarts belonged horses were really more important and necessary than men and this singular fact gave these lonely riders a calling  before the spaniards came there were no horses in the west those explorers left or lost horses all over the southwest many of them were arabian horses of purest blood american explorers and travelers at the outset of the nineteenth century encountered countless droves of wild horses all over the plains across the grand canyon however wild horses were comparatively few in number in the early days and these had probably come in by way of california  the stewarts and slone had no established mode of catching wild horses the game had not developed fast enough for that every chase of horse or drove was different and once in many attempts they met with success  a favorite method originated by the stewarts was to find a waterhole frequented by the band of horses or the stallion wanted and to build round this hole a corral with an opening for the horses to get in then the hunters would watch the trap at night and if the horses went in to drink a gate was closed across the opening another method of the stewarts was to trail a coveted horse up on a mesa or highland places which seldom had more than one trail of ascent and descent and there block the escape and cut lines of cedars into which the quarry was ran till captured still another method discovered by accident was to shoot a horse lightly in the neck and sting him this last called creasing was seldom successful and for that matter in any method ten times as many horses were killed as captured  lin slone helped the stewarts in their own way but he had no especial liking for their tricks perhaps a few remarkable captures of remarkable horses had spoiled slone he was always trying what the brothers claimed to be impossible he was a fearless rider but he had the fault of saving his mount and to kill a wild horse was a tragedy for him he would much rather have hunted alone and he had been alone on the trail of the stallion wildfire when the stewarts had joined him  lin slone awoke next morning and rolled out of his blanket at his usual early hour but he was not early enough to say goodby to the stewarts they were gone  the fact surprised him and somehow relieved him they had left him more than his share of the outfit and perhaps that was why they had slipped off before dawn they knew him well enough to know that he would not have accepted it besides perhaps they felt a little humiliation at abandoning a chase which he chose to keep up anyway they were gone apparently without breakfast  the morning was clear cool with the air dark like that before a storm and in the east over the steely wall of stone shone a redness growing brighter  slone looked away to the west down the trail taken by his comrades but he saw nothing moving against that cedardotted waste  goodby he said and he spoke as if he was saying goodby to more than comrades  i reckon i wont see sevier village soon againan maybe never he soliloquized  there was no one to regret him unless it was old mother hall who had been kind to him on those rare occasions when he got out of the wilderness still it was with regret that he gazed away across the red valley to the west slone had no home his father and mother had been lost in the massacre of a wagontrain by indians and he had been one of the few saved and brought to salt lake that had happened when he was ten years old his life thereafter had been hard and but for his sturdy texas training he might not have survived the last five years he had been a horsehunter in the wild uplands of nevada and utah  slone turned his attention to the pack of supplies the stewarts had divided the flour and the parched corn equally and unless he was greatly mistaken they had left him most of the coffee and all of the salt  now i hold that decent of bill an abe said slone regretfully but i could have got along without it better n they could  then he swiftly set about kindling a fire and getting a meal in the midst of his task a sudden ruddy brightness fell around him lin slone paused in his work to look up  the sun had risen over the eastern wall  ah he said and drew a deep breath  the cold steely darkling sweep of desert had been transformed it was now a world of red earth and gold rocks and purple sage with everywhere the endless straggling green cedars a breeze whipped in making the fire roar softly the sun felt warm on his cheek and at the moment he heard the whistle of his horse  good old nagger he said i shore wont have to track you this mornin  presently he went off into the cedars to find nagger and the mustang that he used to carry a pack nagger was grazing in a little open patch among the trees but the packhorse was missing slone seemed to know in what direction to go to find the trail for he came upon it very soon the packhorse wore hobbles but he belonged to the class that could cover a great deal of ground when hobbled slone did not expect the horse to go far considering that the grass thereabouts was good but in a wildhorse country it was not safe to give any horse a chance the call of his wild brethren was irresistible slone however found the mustang standing quietly in a clump of cedars and removing the hobbles he mounted and rode back to camp nagger caught sight of him and came at his call  this horse nagger appeared as unique in his class as slone was rare among riders nagger seemed of several colors though black predominated his coat was shaggy almost woolly like that of a sheep he was huge rawboned knotty long of body and long of leg with the head of a war charger his build did not suggest speed there appeared to be something slow and ponderous about him similar to an elephant with the same suggestion of power and endurance   slone discarded the packsaddle and bags the latter were almost empty he roped the tarpaulin on the back of the mustang and making a small bundle of his few supplies he tied that to the tarpaulin his blanket he used for a saddleblanket on nagger of the utensils left by the stewarts he chose a couple of small iron pans with long handles the rest he left in his saddlebags he had a few extra horseshoes some nails bullets for his rifle and a knife with a heavy blade  not a rich outfit for a far country he mused slone did not talk very much and when he did he addressed nagger and himself simultaneously evidently he expected a long chase one from which he would not return and light as his outfit was it would grow too heavy  then he mounted and rode down the gradual slope facing the valley and the black bold flat mountain to the southeast some few hundred yards from camp he halted nagger and bent over in the saddle to scrutinize the ground  the cleancut track of a horse showed in the bare hard sand the hoofmarks were large almost oval perfect in shape and manifestly they were beautiful to lin slone he gazed at them for a long time and then he looked across the dotted red valley up the vast ridgy steps toward the black plateau and beyond it was the look that an indian gives to a strange country then slone slipped off the saddle and knelt to scrutinize the horse tracks a little sand had blown into the depressions and some of it was wet and some of it was dry he took his time about examining it and he even tried gently blowing other sand into the tracks to compare that with what was already there finally he stood up and addressed nagger  reckon we wont have to argue with abe an bill this mornin he said with satisfaction wildfire made that track yesterday before sunup  thereupon slone remounted and put nagger to a trot the packhorse followed with an alacrity that showed he had no desire for loneliness  as straight as a beeline wildfire had left a trail down into the floor of the valley he had not stopped to graze and he had not looked for water slone had hoped to find a waterhole in one of the deep washes in the red earth but if there had been any water there wildfire would have scented it he had not had a drink for three days that slone knew of and nagger had not drunk for forty hours slone had a canvas waterbag hanging over the pommel but it was a habit of his to deny himself as far as possible till his horse could drink also like an indian slone ate and drank but little  it took four hours of steady trotting to reach the middle and bottom of that wide flat valley a network of washes cut up the whole center of it and they were all as dry as bleached bone to cross these slone had only to keep wildfires trail and it was proof of naggers quality that he did not have to veer from the stallions course  it was hot down in the lowland the heat struck up reflected from the sand but it was a march sun and no more than pleasant to slone the wind rose however and blew dust and sand in the faces of horse and rider except lizards slone did not see any living things  miles of low greasewood and sparse yellow sage led to the first almost imperceptible rise of the valley floor on that side the distant cedars beckoned to slone he was not patient because he was on the trail of wildfire but nevertheless the hours seemed short  slone had no past to think about and the future held nothing except a horse and so his thoughts revolved the possibilities connected with this chase of wildfire the chase was hopeless in such country as he was traversing and if wildfire chose to roam around valleys like this one slone would fail utterly but the stallion had long ago left his band of horses and then one by one his favorite consorts and now he was alone headed with unerring instinct for wild untrammeled ranges he had been used to the pure cold water and the succulent grass of the cold desert uplands assuredly he would not tarry in such barren lands as these  for slone an everpresent and growing fascination lay in wildfires clear sharply defined tracks it was as if every hoofmark told him something once far up the interminable ascent he found on a ridgetop tracks showing where wildfire had halted and turned  ha nagger cried slone exultingly look there hes begun facin about hes wonderin if were still after him hes worried but well keep out of sighta day behind  when slone reached the cedars the sun was low down in the west he looked back across the fifty miles of valley to the colored cliffs and walls he seemed to be above them now and the cool air with tang of cedar and juniper strengthened the impression that he had climbed high  a mile or more ahead of him rose a gray cliff with breaks in it and a line of dark cedars or pinyons on the level rims he believed these breaks to be the mouths of canyons and so it turned out wildfires trail led into the mouth of a narrow canyon with very steep and high walls nagger snorted his perception of water and the mustang whistled wildfires tracks led to a point under the wall where a spring gushed forth there were mountainlion and deer tracks also as well as those of smaller game  slone made camp here the mustang was tired but nagger upon taking a long drink rolled in the grass as if he had just begun the trip after eating slone took his rifle and went out to look for deer but there appeared to be none at hand he came across many lion tracks and saw with apprehension where one had taken wildfires trail wildfire had grazed up the canyon keeping on and on and he was likely to go miles in a night slone reflected that as small as were his own chances of getting wildfire they were still better than those of a mountainlion wildfire was the most cunning of all animalsa wild stallion his speed and endurance were incomparable his scent as keen as those animals that relied wholly upon scent to warn them of danger and as for sight it was slones belief that no hoofed creature except the mountainsheep used to high altitudes could see as far as a wild horse  it bothered slone a little that he was getting into a lion country nagger showed nervousness something unusual for him slone tied both horses with long halters and stationed them on patches of thick grass then he put a cedar stump on the fire and went to sleep upon awakening and going to the spring he was somewhat chagrined to see that deer had come down to drink early evidently they were numerous a lion country was always a deer country for the lions followed the deer  slone was packed and saddled and on his way before the sun reddened the canyon wall he walked the horses from time to time he saw signs of wildfires consistent progress the canyon narrowed and the walls grew lower and the grass increased there was a decided ascent all the time slone could find no evidence that the canyon had ever been traveled by hunters or indians the day was pleasant and warm and still every once in a while a little breath of wind would bring a fragrance of cedar and pinyon and a sweet hint of pine and sage at every turn he looked ahead expecting to see the green of pine and the gray of sage toward the middle of the afternoon coming to a place where wildfire had taken to a trot he put nagger to that gait and by sundown had worked up to where the canyon was only a shallow ravine and finally it turned once more to lose itself in a level where straggling pines stood high above the cedars and great darkgreen silver spruces stood above the pines and here were patches of sage fresh and pungent and long reaches of bleached grass it was the edge of a forest wildfires trail went on slone came at length to a group of pines and here he found the remains of a campfire and some flint arrowheads indians had been in there probably having come from the opposite direction to slones this encouraged him for where indians could hunt so could he soon he was entering a forest where cedars and pinyons and pines began to grow thickly presently he came upon a faintly defined trail just a dim dark line even to an experienced eye but it was a trail and wildfire had taken it  slone halted for the night the air was cold and the dampness of it gave him an idea there were snowbanks somewhere not far distant the dew was already heavy on the grass he hobbled the horses and put a bell on nagger a bell might frighten lions that had never heard one then he built a fire and cooked his meal  it had been long since he had camped high up among the pines the sough of the wind pleased him like music there had begun to be prospects of pleasant experience along with the toil of chasing wildfire he was entering new and strange and beautiful country how far might the chase take him he did not care he was not sleepy but even if he had been it developed that he must wait till the coyotes ceased their barking round his campfire they came so close that he saw their gray shadows in the gloom but presently they wearied of yelping at him and went away after that the silence broken only by the wind as it roared and lulled seemed beautiful to slone he lost completely that sense of vague regret which had remained with him and he forgot the stewarts and suddenly he felt absolutely free alone with nothing behind to remember with wild thrilling nameless life before him just then the long mourn of a timber wolf wailed in with the wind seldom had he heard the cry of one of those night wanderers there was nothing like itno sound like it to fix in the lone campers heart the great solitude and the wild    chapter v  in the early morning when all was gray and the big dark pines were shadowy specters slone was awakened by the cold his hands were so numb that he had difficulty starting a fire he stood over the blaze warming them the air was nipping clear and thin and sweet with frosty fragrance  daylight came while he was in the midst of his morning meal a white frost covered the ground and crackled under his feet as he went out to bring in the horses he saw fresh deer tracks then he went back to camp for his rifle keeping a sharp lookout for game he continued his search for the horses  the forest was open and parklike there were no fallen trees or evidences of fire presently he came to a wide glade in the midst of which nagger and the packmustang were grazing with a herd of deer the size of the latter amazed slone the deer he had hunted back on the sevier range were much smaller than these evidently these were mule deer closely allied to the elk they were so tame they stood facing him curiously with long ears erect it was sheer murder to kill a deer standing and watching like that but slone was out of meat and hungry and facing a long hard trip he shot a buck which leaped spasmodically away trying to follow the herd and fell at the edge of the glade slone cut out a haunch and then catching the horses he returned to camp where he packed and saddled and at once rode out on the dim trail  the wildness of the country he was entering was evident in the fact that as he passed the glade where he had shot the deer a few minutes before there were coyotes quarreling over the carcass  stone could see ahead and on each side several hundred yards and presently he ascertained that the forest floor was not so level as he had supposed he had entered a valley or was traversing a wide gently sloping pass he went through thickets of juniper and had to go around clumps of quaking aspen the pines grew larger and farther apart cedars and pinyons had been left behind and he had met with no silver spruces after leaving camp probably that point was the height of a divide there were banks of snow in some of the hollows on the north side evidently the snow had very recently melted and it was evident also that the depth of snow through here had been fully ten feet judging from the mutilation of the junipertrees where the deer standing on the hard frozen crust had browsed upon the branches  the quiet of the forest thrilled slone and the only movement was the occasional gray flash of a deer or coyote across a glade no birds of any species crossed stones sight he came presently upon a lion track in the trail made probably a day before slone grew curious about it seeing how it held as he was holding to wildfires tracks after a mile or so he made sure the lion had been trailing the stallion and for a second he felt a cold contraction of his heart already he loved wildfire and by virtue of all this toil of travel considered the wild horse his property  no lion could ever get close to wildfire he soliloquized with a short laugh of that he was absolutely certain  the sun rose melting the frost and a breath of warm air laden with the scent of pine moved heavily under the huge yellow trees slone passed a point where the remains of an old campfire and a pile of deer antlers were further proof that indians visited this plateau to hunt from this camp broader more deeply defined trails led away to the south and east slone kept to the east trail in which wildfires tracks and those of the lion showed clearly it was about the middle of the forenoon when the tracks of the stallion and lion left the trail to lead up a little draw where grass grew thick slone followed reading the signs of wildfires progress and the action of his pursuer as well as if he had seen them here the stallion had plowed into a snowbank eating a hole two feet deep then he had grazed around a little then on and on there his splendid tracks were deep in the soft earth slone knew what to expect when the track of the lion veered from those of the horse and he followed the lion tracks the ground was soft from the late melting of snow and nagger sunk deep the lion left a plain track here he stole steadily along there he left many tracks at a point where he might have halted to make sure of his scent he was circling on the trail of the stallion with cunning intent of ambush the end of this slow careful stalk of the lion as told in his tracks came upon the edge of a knoll where he had crouched to watch and wait  from this perch he had made a magnificent springslone estimating it to be forty feetbut he had missed the stallion there were wildfires tracks again slow and short and then deep and sharp where in the impetus of fright he had sprung out of reach a second leap of the lion and then lessening bounds and finally an abrupt turn from wildfires trail told the futility of that stalk slone made certain that wildfire was so keen that as he grazed along he had kept to open ground  wildfire had run for a mile then slowed down to a trot and he had circled to get back to the trail he had left slone believed the horse was just so intelligent at any rate wildfire struck the trail again and turned at right angles to follow it  here the forest floor appeared perfectly level patches of snow became frequent and larger as slone went on at length the patches closed up and soon extended as far as he could see it was soft affording difficult travel slone crossed hundreds of deer tracks and the trail he was on eventually became a deer runway  presently far down one of the aisles between the great pines slone saw what appeared to be a yellow cliff far away it puzzled him and as he went on he received the impression that the forest dropped out of sight ahead then the trees grew thicker obstructing his view presently the trail became soggy and he had to help his horse the mustang floundered in the soft snow and earth cedars and pinyons appeared again making travel still more laborious  all at once there came to slone a strange consciousness of light and wind and space and void on the instant his horse halted with a snort slone quickly looked up had he come to the end of the world an abyss a canyon yawned beneath him beyond all comparison in its greatness his keen eye educated to desert distance and dimension swept down and across taking in the tremendous truth before it staggered his comprehension but a second sweeping glance slower becoming intoxicated with what it beheld saw gigantic cliffsteps and yellow slopes dotted with cedars leading down to clefts filled with purple smoke and these led on and on to a ragged red world of rock bare shining bold uplifted in mesa dome peak and crag clear and strange in the morning light still and sleeping like death  this then was the great canyon which had seemed like a hunters fable rather than truth slones sight dimmed blurring the spectacle and he found that his eyes had filled with tears he wiped them away and looked again and again until he was confounded by the vastness and the grandeur and the vague sadness of the scene nothing he had ever looked at had affected him like this canyon although the stewarts had tried to prepare him for it  it was the horsehunters passion that reminded him of his pursuit the deer trail led down through a break in the wall only a few rods of it could be seen this trail was passable even though choked with snow but the depth beyond this wall seemed to fascinate slone and hold him back used as he was to desert trails then the clean mark of wildfires hoof brought back the old thrill  this place fits you wildfire muttered slone dismounting  he started down leading nagger the mustang followed slone kept to the wall side of the trail fearing the horses might slip the snow held firmly at first and slone had no trouble the gap in the rimrock widened to a slope thickly grown over with cedars and pinyons and manzanita this growth made the descent more laborious yet afforded means at least for slone to go down with less danger there was no stopping once started the horses had to keep on slone saw the impossibility of ever climbing out while that snow was there the trail zigzagged down and down very soon the yellow wall hung tremendously over him straight up the snow became thinner and softer the horses began to slip they slid on their haunches fortunately the slope grew less steep and slone could see below where it reached out to comparatively level ground still a mishap might yet occur slone kept as close to nagger as possible helping him whenever he could do it the mustang slipped rolled over and then slipped past slone went down the slope to bring up in a cedar slone worked down to him and extricated him then the huge nagger began to slide snow and loose rock slid with him and so did slone the little avalanche stopped of its own accord and then slone dragged nagger on down and down presently to come to the end of the steep descent slone looked up to see that he had made short work of a thousandfoot slope here cedars and pinyons grew thickly enough to make a forest the snow thinned out to patches and then failed but the going remained bad for a while as the horses sank deep in a soft red earth this eventually grew more solid and finally dry slone worked out of the cedars to what appeared a grassy plateau inclosed by the great greenandwhite slope with its yellow wall over hanging and distant mesas and cliffs here his view was restricted he was down on the first bench of the great canyon and there was the deer trail a wellworn path keeping to the edge of the slope slone came to a deep cut in the earth and the trail headed it where it began at the last descent of the slope it was the source of a canyon he could look down to see the bare worn rock and a hundred yards from where he stood the earth was washed from its rims and it began to show depth and something of that ragged outline which told of violence of flood the trail headed many canyons like this all running down across this bench disappearing dropping invisibly the trail swung to the left under the great slope and then presently it climbed to a higher bench here were brush and grass and huge patches of sage so pungent that it stung slones nostrils then he went down again this time to come to a clear brook lined by willows here the horses drank long and slone refreshed himself the sun had grown hot there was fragrance of flowers he could not see and a low murmur of a waterfall that was likewise invisible for most of the time his view was shut off but occasionally he reached a point where through some break he saw towers gleaming red in the sun a strange place a place of silence and smoky veils in the distance time passed swiftly toward the waning of the afternoon he began to climb to what appeared to be a saddle of land connecting the canyon wall on the left with a great plateau goldrimmed and pinefringed rising more and more in his way as he advanced at sunset slone was more shut in than for several hours he could tell the time was sunset by the golden light on the cliff wall again overhanging him the slope was gradual up to this pass to the saddle and upon coming to a spring and the first pinetrees he decided to halt for a camp the mustang was almost exhausted  thereupon he hobbled the horses in the luxuriant grass round the spring and then unrolled his pack once as dusk came stealing down while he was eating his meal nagger whistled in fright slone saw a gray pantherish form gliding away into the shadows he took a quick shot at it but missed  its a lion country all right he said and then he set about building a big fire on the other side of the grassy plot so to have the horses between fires he cut all the venison into thin strips and spent an hour roasting them then he lay down to rest and he said wonder where wildfire is tonight am i closer to him wheres he headin for  the night was warm and still it was black near the huge cliff and overhead velvety blue with stars of white fire it seemed to him that he had become more thoughtful and observing of the aspects of his wild environment and he felt a welcome consciousness of loneliness then sleep came to him and the night seemed short in the gray dawn he arose refreshed  the horses were restive nagger snorted a welcome evidently they had passed an uneasy night slone found lion tracks at the spring and in sandy places presently he was on his way up to the notch between the great wall and the plateau a growth of thick scruboak made travel difficult it had not appeared far up to that saddle but it was far there were straggling pinetrees and huge rocks that obstructed his gaze but once up he saw that the saddle was only a narrow ridge curved to slope up on both sides  straight before slone and under him opened the canyon blazing and glorious along the peaks and ramparts where the rising sun struck misty and smoky and shadowy down in those mysterious depths  it took an effort not to keep on gazing but slone turned to the grim business of his pursuit the trail he saw leading down had been made by indians it was used probably once a year by them and also by wild animals and it was exceedingly steep and rough wildfire had paced to and fro along the narrow ridge of that saddle making many tracks before he had headed down again slone imagined that the great stallion had been daunted by the tremendous chasm but had finally faced it meaning to put this obstacle between him and his pursuers it never occurred to slone to attribute less intelligence to wildfire than that so dismounting slone took naggers bridle and started down the mustang with the pack was reluctant he snorted and whistled and pawed the earth but he would not be left alone so he followed  the trail led down under cedars that fringed a precipice slone was aware of this without looking he attended only to the trail and to his horse only an indian could have picked out that course and it was cruel to put a horse to it but nagger was powerful surefooted and he would go anywhere that slone led him gradually slone worked down and away from the bulging rimwall it was hard rough work and risky because it could not be accomplished slowly brush and rocks loose shale and weathered slope long dusty inclines of yellow earth and jumbles of stonethese made bad going for miles of slow zigzag trail down out of the cedars then the trail entered what appeared to be a ravine  that ravine became a canyon at its head it was a dry wash full of gravel and rocks it began to cut deep into the bowels of the earth it shut out sight of the surrounding walls and peaks water appeared from under a cliff and augmented by other springs became a brook hot dry and barren at its beginning this cleft became cool and shady and luxuriant with grass and flowers and amber moss with silver blossoms the rocks had changed color from yellow to deep red four hours of turning and twisting endlessly down and down over boulders and banks and every conceivable roughness of earth and rock finished the packmustang and slone mercifully left him in a long reach of canyon where grass and water never failed in this place slone halted for the noon hour letting nagger have his fill of the rich grazing naggers three days in grassy upland despite the continuous travel by day had improved him he looked fat and slone had not yet caught the horse resting nagger was iron to endure here slone left all the outfit except what was on his saddle and the sack containing the few pounds of meat and supplies and the two utensils this sack he tied on the back of his saddle and resumed his journey  presently he came to a place where wildfire had doubled on his trail and had turned up a side canyon the climb out was hard on slone if not on nagger once up slone found himself upon a wide barren plateau of glaring red rock and clumps of greasewood and cactus the plateau was miles wide shut in by great walls and mesas of colored rock the afternoon sun beat down fiercely a blast of wind as if from a furnace swept across the plateau and it was laden with red dust slone walked here where he could have ridden and he made several miles of upanddown progress over this rough plateau the great walls of the opposite side of the canyon loomed appreciably closer what slone wondered was at the bottom of this rent in the earth the great desert river was down there of course but he knew nothing of it would that turn back wildfire slone thought grimly how he had always claimed nagger to be part fish and part bird wildfire was not going to escape  by and by only isolated mescal plants with long yellowplumed spears broke the bare monotony of the plateau and slone passed from red sand and gravel to a red soft shale and from that to hard red rock here wildfires tracks were lost the first time in seven weeks but slone had his direction down that plateau with the cleavage lines of canyons to right and left at times slone found a vestige of the old indian trail and this made him doubly sure of being right he did not need to have wildfires tracks he let nagger pick the way and the horse made no mistake in finding the line of least resistance but that grew harder and harder this bare rock like a file would soon wear wildfires hoofs thin and slone rejoiced perhaps somewhere down in this awful chasm he and nagger would have it out with the stallion slone began to look far ahead beginning to believe that he might see wildfire twice he had seen wildfire but only at a distance then he had resembled a running streak of fire whence his name which slone had given him  this bare region of rock began to be cut up into gullies it was necessary to head them or to climb in and out miles of travel really meant little progress straight ahead but slone kept on he was hot and nagger was hot and that made hard work easier sometimes on the wind came a low thunder was it a storm or an avalanche slipping or falling water he could not tell the sound was significant and haunting  of one thing he was surethat he could not have found his backtrail but he divined he was never to retrace his steps on this journey the stretch of broken plateau before him grew wilder and bolder of outline darker in color weirder in aspect and progress across it grew slower more dangerous there were many places nagger should not have been put towhere a slip meant a broken leg but slone could not turn back and something besides an indomitable spirit kept him going again the sound resembling thunder assailed his ears louder this time the plateau appeared to be ending in a series of great capes or promontories slone feared he would soon come out upon a promontory from which he might see the impossibility of further travel he felt relieved down in the gullies where he could not see far he climbed out of one presently from which there extended a narrow ledge with a slant too perilous for any horse he stepped out upon that with far less confidence than nagger to the right was a bulge of low wall and a few feet to the left a dark precipice the trail here was faintly outlined and it was six inches wide and slanting as well it seemed endless to slone that ledge he looked only down at his feet and listened to naggers steps the big horse trod carefully but naturally and he did not slip that ledge extended in a long curve turning slowly away from the precipice and ascending a little at the further end slone drew a deep breath of relief when he led nagger up on level rock  suddenly a strange yet familiar sound halted slone as if he had been struck the wild shrill highpitched piercing whistle of a stallion nagger neighed a blast in reply and pounded the rock with his ironshod hoofs with a thrill slone looked ahead  there some few hundred yards distant on a promontory stood a red horse  my lord  its wildfire breathed slone tensely  he could not believe his sight he imagined he was dreaming but as nagger stamped and snorted defiance slone looked with fixed and keen gaze and knew that beautiful picture was no lie  wildfire was as red as fire his long mane wild in the wind was like a whipping blackstreaked flame silhouetted there against that canyon background he seemed gigantic a demon horse ready to plunge into fiery depths he was looking back over his shoulder his head very high and every line of him was instinct with wildness again he sent out that shrill airsplitting whistle slone understood it to be a clarion call to nagger if nagger had been alone wildfire would have killed him the red stallion was a killer of horses all over the utah ranges he had left the trail of a murderer nagger understood this too for he whistled back in rage and terror it took an iron arm to hold him then wildfire plunged apparently down and vanished from slones sight  slone hurried onward to be blocked by a huge crack in the rocky plateau this he had to head and then another and like obstacle checked his haste to reach that promontory he was forced to go more slowly wildfire had been close only as to sight and this was the great canyon that dwarfed distance and magnified proximity climbing down and up toiling on he at last learned patience he had seen wildfire at close range that was enough so he plodded on once more returning to careful regard of nagger it took an hour of work to reach the point where wildfire had disappeared  a promontory indeed it was overhanging a valley a thousand feet below a white torrent of a stream wound through it there were lines of green cottonwoods following the winding course then slone saw wildfire slowly crossing the flat toward the stream he had gone down that cliff which to slone looked perpendicular  wildfire appeared to be walking lame slone making sure of this suffered a pang then when the significance of such lameness dawned upon him he whooped his wild joy and waved his hat the red stallion must have heard for he looked up then he went on again and waded into the stream where he drank long when he started to cross the swift current drove him back in several places the water wreathed white around him but evidently it was not deep and finally he crossed from the other side he looked up again at nagger and slone and going on he soon was out of sight in the cottonwoods  how to get down muttered slone  there was a break in the cliff wall a bare stone slant where horses had gone down and come up that was enough for slone to know he would have attempted the descent if he were sure no other horse but wildfire had ever gone down there but slones hair began to rise stiff on his head a horse like wildfire and mountain sheep and indian ponies were all very different from nagger the chances were against nagger  come on old boy if i can do it you can he said  slone had never seen a trail as perilous as this he was afraid for his horse a slip there meant death the way nagger trembled in every muscle showed his feelings but he never flinched he would follow slone anywhere providing slone rode him or led him and here as riding was impossible slone went before if the horse slipped there would be a double tragedy for nagger would knock his master off the cliff slone set his teeth and stepped down he did not let nagger see his fear he was taking the greatest risk he had ever run  the break in the wall led to a ledge and the ledge dropped from step to step and these had bare slippery slants between nagger was splendid on a bad trail he had methods peculiar to his huge build and great weight he crashed down over the stone steps both front hoofs at once the slants he slid down on his haunches with his forelegs stiff and the iron shoes scraping he snorted and heaved and grew wet with sweat he tossed his head at some of the places but he never hesitated and it was impossible for him to go slowly whenever slone came to corrugated stretches in the trail he felt grateful but these were few the rock was like smooth red iron slone had never seen such hard rock it took him long to realize that it was marble his heart seemed a tense painful knot in his breast as if it could not beat holding back in the strained suspense but nagger never jerked on the bridle he never faltered many times he slipped often with both front feet but never with all four feet so he did not fall and the red wall began to loom above slone then suddenly he seemed brought to a point where it was impossible to descend it was a round bulge slanting fearfully with only a few little rough surfaces to hold a foot wildfire had left a broad clearswept mark at that place and red hairs on some of the sharp points he had slid down below was an offset that fortunately prevented further sliding slone started to walk down this place but when nagger began to slide slone had to let go the bridle and jump both he and the horse landed safely luck was with them and they went on down and down to reach the base of the great wall scraped and exhausted wet with sweat but unhurt as slone gazed upward he felt the impossibility of believing what he knew to be true he hugged and petted the horse then he led on to the roaring stream  it was green water white with foam slone waded in and found the water cool and shallow and very swift he had to hold to nagger to keep from being swept downstream they crossed in safety there in the sand showed wildfires tracks and here were signs of another indian camp half a year old  the shade of the cottonwoods was pleasant slone found this valley oppressively hot there was no wind and the sand blistered his feet through his boots wildfire held to the indian trail that had guided him down into this wilderness of worn rock and that trail crossed the stream at every turn of the twisting narrow valley slone enjoyed getting into the water he hung his gun over the pommel and let the water roll him a dozen times he and nagger forded the rushing torrent then they came to a boxlike closing of the valley to canyon walls and here the trail evidently followed the stream bed there was no other way slone waded in and stumbled rolled and floated ahead of the sturdy horse nagger was wet to his breast but he did not fall this gulch seemed full of a hollow rushing roar it opened out into a wide valley and wildfires tracks took to the left side and began to climb the slope  here the traveling was good considering what had been passed once up out of the valley floor slone saw wildfire far ahead high on the slope he did not appear to be limping but he was not going fast slone watched as he climbed what and where would be the end of this chase  sometimes wildfire was plain in his sight for a moment but usually he was hidden by rocks the slope was one great talus a jumble of weathered rock fallen from what appeared a mountain of red and yellow wall here the heat of the sun fell upon him like fire the rocks were so hot slone could not touch them with bare hand the close of the afternoon was approaching and this slope was interminably long still it was not steep and the trail was good  at last from the height of slope wildfire appeared looking back and down then he was gone slone plodded upward long before he reached that summit be heard the dull rumble of the river it grew to be a roar yet it seemed distant would the great desert river stop wildfire in his flight slone doubted it he surmounted the ridge to find the canyon opening in a tremendous gap and to see down far down a glittering sunblasted slope merging into a deep black gulch where a red river swept and chafed and roared  somehow the river was what he had expected to see a force that had cut and ground this canyon could have been nothing but a river like that the trail led down and slone had no doubt that it crossed the river and led up out of the canyon he wanted to stay there and gaze endlessly and listen at length he began the descent as he proceeded it seemed that the roar of the river lessened he could not understand why this was so it took half an hour to reach the last level a ghastly black and ironribbed canyon bed with the river splitting it he had not had a glimpse of wildfire on this side of the divide but he found his tracks and they led down off the last level through a notch in the black bank of marble to a sandbar and the river  wildfire had walked straight off the sand into the water slone studied the river and shore the water ran slow heavily in sluggish eddies from far up the canyon came the roar of a rapid and from below the roar of another heavier and closer the river appeared tremendous in ways slone felt rather than realized yet it was not swift studying the black rough wall of rock above him he saw marks where the river had been sixty feet higher than where he stood on the sand it was low then how lucky for him that he had gotten there before flood season he believed wildfire had crossed easily and he knew nagger could make it then he piled and tied his supplies and weapons high on the saddle to keep them dry and looked for a place to take to the water  wildfire had sunk deep before reaching the edge manifestly he had lunged the last few feet slone found a better place and waded in urging nagger the big horse plunged almost going under and began to swim slone kept upstream beside him he found presently that the water was thick and made him tired so it was necessary to grasp a stirrup and be towed the river appeared only a few hundred feet wide but probably it was wider than it looked nagger labored heavily near the opposite shore still he landed safely upon a rocky bank there were patches of sand in which wildfires tracks showed so fresh that the water had not yet dried out of them  slone rested his horse before attempting to climb out of that split in the rock however wildfire had found an easy ascent on this side of the canyon the bare rock did not predominate a clear trail led up a dusty gravelly slope upon which scant greasewood and cactus appeared half an hours climbing brought slone to where he could see that he was entering a vast valley sloping up and narrowing to a notch in the dark cliffs above which towered the great red wall and about that the slopes of cedar and the yellow rimrock  and scarcely a mile distant bright in the westering sunlight shone the red stallion moving slowly  slone pressed on steadily just before dark he came to an ideal spot to camp the valley had closed up so that the lofty walls cast shadows that met a clump of cottonwoods surrounding a spring abundance of rich grass willows and flowers lining the banks formed an oasis in the bare valley slone was tired out from the day of ceaseless toil down and up and he could scarcely keep his eyes open but he tried to stay awake the dead silence of the valley the dry fragrance the dreaming walls the advent of night low down when up on the ramparts the last red rays of the sun lingered the strange lonelinessthese were sweet and comforting to him  and that nights sleep was as a moment he opened his eyes to see the crags and towers and peaks and domes and the lofty walls of that vast broken chaos of canyons across the river they were now emerging from the misty gray of dawn growing pink and lilac and purple under the rising sun  he arose and set about his few tasks which being soon finished allowed him an early start  wildfire had grazed along no more than a mile in the lead slone looked eagerly up the narrowing canyon but he was not rewarded by a sight of the stallion as he progressed up a gradually ascending trail he became aware of the fact that the notch he had long looked up to was where the great red walls closed in and almost met and the trail zigzagged up this narrow vent so steep that only a few steps could be taken without rest slone toiled up for an houran agetill he was wet burning choked with a great weight on his chest yet still he was only halfway up that awful break between the walls sometimes he could have tossed a stone down upon a part of the trail only a few rods below yet many many weary steps of actual toil as he got farther up the notch widened what had been scarcely visible from the valley below was now colossal in actual dimensions the trail was like a twisted mile of thread between two bulging mountain walls leaning their ledges and fronts over this tilted pass  slone rested often nagger appreciated this and heaved gratefully at every halt in this monotonous toil slone forgot the zest of his pursuit and when nagger suddenly snorted in fright slone was not prepared for what he saw  above him ran a low red wall around which evidently the trail led at the curve which was a promontory scarcely a hundred feet in an airline above him he saw something red moving bobbing coming out into view it was a horse  wildfireno farther away than the length of three lassoes  there he stood looking down he fulfilled all of slones dreams only he was bigger but he was so magnificently proportioned that he did not seem heavy his coat was shaggy and red it was not glossy the color was what made him shine his mane was like a crest mounting then failing low slone had never seen so much muscle on a horse yet his outline was graceful beautiful the head was indeed that of the wildest of all wild creaturesa stallion born wildand it was beautiful savage splendid everything but noble whatever wildfire was he was a devil a murdererhe had no noble attributes slone thought that if a horse could express hate surely wildfire did then it was certain that he did express curiosity and fury  slone shook a gantleted fist at the stallion as if the horse were human that was a natural action for a rider of his kind wildfire turned away showed bright against the dark background and then disappeared    chapter vi  that was the last slone saw of wildfire for three days  it took all of this day to climb out of the canyon the second was a slow march of thirty miles into a scrub cedar and pinyon forest through which the great red and yellow walls of the canyon could be seen that night slone found a waterhole in a rocky pocket and a little grass for nagger the third days travel consisted of forty miles or more through level pine forest dry and odorous but lacking the freshness and beauty of the forest on the north side of the canyon on this south side a strange feature was that all the water when there was any ran away from the rim slone camped this night at a muddy pond in the woods where wildfires tracks showed plainly  on the following day slone rode out of the forest into a country of scanty cedars bleached and stunted and out of this to the edge of a plateau from which the shimmering desert flung its vast and desolate distances forbidding and menacing this was not the desert upland country of utah but a naked and bony world of colored rock and sanda painted desert of heat and wind and flying sand and waterless wastes and barren ranges but it did not daunt slone for far down on the bare billowing ridges moved a red speck at a snails pace a slowly moving dot of color which was wildfire  on open ground like this nagger carrying two hundred and fifty pounds showed his wonderful quality he did not mind the heat nor the sand nor the glare nor the distance nor his burden he did not tire he was an engine of tremendous power  slone gained upon wildfire and toward evening of that day he reached to within half a mile of the stallion and he chose to keep that far behind that night he camped where there was dry grass but no water  next day he followed wildfire down and down over the endless swell of rolling red ridges bare of all but bleached white grass and meager greasewood always descending in the face of that painted desert of bold and ragged steps slone made fifty miles that day and gained the valley bed where a slender stream ran thin and spread over a wide sandy bottom it was salty water but it was welcome to both man and beast  the following day he crossed and the tracks of wildfire were still wet on the sandbars the stallion was slowing down slone saw him limping along not far in advance there was a tenmile stretch of level ground blown hard as rock from which the sustenance had been bleached for not a spear of grass grew there and following that was a tortuous passage through a weird region of clay dunes blue and violet and heliotrope and lavender all worn smooth by rain and wind wildfire favored the soft ground now he had deviated from his straight course and he was partial to washes and dips in the earth where water might have lodged and he was not now scornful of a greenscummed waterhole with its white margin of alkali that night slone made camp with wildfire in plain sight the stallion stopped when his pursuers stopped and he began to graze on the same stretch with nagger how strange this seemed to slone  here at this camp was evidence of indians wildfire had swung round to the north in his course like any pursued wild animal he had began to circle and he had pointed his nose toward the utah he had left  next morning wildfire was not in sight but he had left his tracks in the sand slone trailed him with nagger at a trot toward the head of this sandy flat slone came upon old cornfields and a broken dam where the water had been stored and welldefined trails leading away to the right somewhere over there in the desert lived indians at this point wildfire abandoned the trail he had followed for many days and cut out more to the north it took all the morning hours to climb three great steps and benches that led up to the summit of a mesa vast in extent it turned out to be a sandy waste the wind rose and everywhere were moving sheets of sand and in the distance circular yellow dustdevils rising high like waterspouts and back down in the sunscorched valley a sandstorm moved along majestically burying the desert in its yellow pall  then two more days of sand and another day of a slowly rising ground growing from bare to gray and gray to green and then to the purple of sage and cedarthese three grinding days were toiled out with only one waterhole  and wildfire was lame and in distress and nagger was growing gaunt and showing strain and slone haggard and black and worn plodded miles and miles on foot to save his horse  slone felt that it would be futile to put the chase to a test of speed nagger could never head that stallion slone meant to go on and on always pushing wildfire keeping him tired wearied and worrying him till a section of the country was reached where he could drive wildfire into some kind of a natural trap the pursuit seemed endless wildfire kept to open country where he could not be surprised  there came a morning when slone climbed to a cedared plateau that rose for a whole days travel and then split into a labyrinthine maze of canyons there were trees grass water it was a high country cool and wild like the uplands he had left for days he camped on wildfires trail always relentlessly driving him always watching for the trap he hoped to find and the red stallion spent much of this time of flight in looking backward whenever slone came in sight of him he had his head over his shoulder watching and on the soft ground of these canyons he had begun to recover from his lameness but this did not worry slone sooner or later wildfire would go down into a highwalled wash from which there would be no outlet or he would wander into a boxcanyon or he would climb out on a mesa with no place to descend unless he passed slone or he would get cornered on a soft steep slope where his hoofs would sink deep and make him slow the nature of the desert had changed slone had entered a wonderful region the like of which he had not seena high plateau crisscrossed in every direction by narrow canyons with red walls a thousand feet high  and one of the strange turning canyons opened into a vast valley of monuments  the plateau had weathered and washed away leaving huge sections of stone walls all standing isolated different in size and shape but all cleancut bold with straight lines they stood up everywhere monumental towering manycolored lending a singular and beautiful aspect to the great greenandgray valley billowing away to the north where dim broken battlements mounted to the clouds  the only living thing in slones sight was wildfire he shone red down on the green slope  slones heart swelled this was the setting for that grand horsea perfect wild range but also it seemed the last place where there might be any chance to trap the stallion still that did not alter slones purpose though it lost to him the joy of former hopes he rode down the slope out upon the billowing floor of the valley wildfire looked back to see his pursuers and then the solemn stillness broke to a wild piercing whistle  day after day camping where night found him slone followed the stallion never losing sight of him till darkness had fallen the valley was immense and the monuments miles apart but they always seemed close together and near him the air magnified everything slone lost track of time the strange solemn lonely days and the silent lonely nights and the endless pursuit and the wild weird valleythese completed the work of years on slone and he became satisfied unthinking almost savage  the toil and privation had worn him down and he was like iron his garments hung in tatters his boots were ripped and soleless long since his flour had been used up and all his supplies except the salt he lived on the meat of rabbits but they were scarce and the time came when there were none some days he did not eat hunger did not make him suffer he killed a desert bird now and then and once a wildcat crossing the valley eventually he felt his strength diminishing and then he took to digging out the packrats and cooking them but these too were scarce at length starvation faced slone but he knew he would not starve many times he had been within rifleshot of wildfire and the grim forbidding thought grew upon him that he must kill the stallion the thought seemed involuntary but his mind rejected it nevertheless he knew that if he could not catch the stallion he would kill him that had been the end of many a desperate riders pursuit of a coveted horse  while slone kept on his merciless pursuit never letting wildfire rest by day time went on just as relentlessly spring gave way to early summer the hot sun bleached the grass waterholes failed out in the valley and water could be found only in the canyons and the dry winds began to blow the sand it was a sandy valley green and gray only at a distance and out toward the north there were no monuments and the slow heave of sand lifted toward the dim walls  wildfire worked away from this open valley back to the south end where the great monuments loomed and still farther back where they grew closer till at length some of them were joined by weathered ridges to the walls of the surrounding plateau for all that slone could see wildfire was in perfect condition but nagger was not the horse he had been slone realized that in one way or another the pursuit was narrowing down to the end  he found a waterhole at the head of a wash in a split in the walls and here he let nagger rest and graze one whole daythe first day for a long time that he had not kept the red stallion in sight that day was marked by the good fortune of killing a rabbit and while eating it his gloomy fixed mind admitted that he was starving he dreaded the next sunrise but he could not hold it back there behind the dark monuments standing sentinellike the sky lightened and reddened and burst into gold and pink till out of the golden glare the sun rose glorious and slone facing the leaguelong shadows of the monuments rode out again into the silent solemn day on his hopeless quest  for a change wildfire had climbed high up a slope of talus through a narrow pass rounded over with drifting sand and slone gazed down into a huge amphitheater full of monuments like all that strange country a basin three miles across lay beneath him walls and weathered slants of rock and steep slopes of reddishyellow sand inclosed this oval depression the floor was white and it seemed to move gently or radiate with heatwaves studying it slone made out that the motion was caused by wind in long bleached grass he had crossed small areas of this grass in different parts of the region  wildfires tracks led down into this basin and presently slone by straining his eyes made out the red spot that was the stallion  hes lookin to quit the country soliloquized slone as he surveyed the scene  with keen slow gaze slone studied the lay of wall and slope and when he had circled the huge depression he made sure that wildfire could not get out except by the narrow pass through which he had gone in slone sat astride nagger in the mouth of this passa wash a few yards wide walled by broken rough rock on one side and an insurmountable slope on the other  if this hole was only little now sighed slone as he gazed at the sweeping shimmering oval floor i might have a chance but down therewe couldnt get near him  there was no water in that dry bowl slone reflected on the uselessness of keeping wildfire down there because nagger could not go without water as long as wildfire for the first time slone hesitated it seemed merciless to nagger to drive him down into this hot windy hole the wind blew from the west and it swooped up the slope hot with the odor of dry dead grass  but that hot wind stirred slone with an idea and suddenly he was tense excited glowing yet grim and hard  wildfire ill make you run with your namesake in that high grass called slone the speech was full of bitter failure of regret of the hardness of a rider who could not give up the horse to freedom  slone meant to ride down there and fire the long grass in that wind there would indeed be wildfire to race with the red stallion it would perhaps mean his death at least it would chase him out of that hole where to follow him would be useless  id make you hump now to get away if i could get behind you muttered slone he saw that if he could fire the grass on the other side the wind of flame would drive wildfire straight toward him the slopes and walls narrowed up to the pass but high grass grew to within a few rods of where slone stood but it seemed impossible to get behind wildfire  at nighttheni could get round him said slone thinking hard and narrowing his gaze to scan the circle of wall and slope why not  no wind at night that grass would burn slow till mornintill the wind came upan its been west for days  suddenly slone began to pound the patient nagger and to cry out to him in wild exultance  old horse weve got him  weve got him  well put a rope on him before this time tomorrow  slone yielded to his strange wild joy but it did not last long soon succeeding to sober keen thought he rode down into the bowl a mile making absolutely certain that wildfire could not climb out on that side the far end beyond the monuments was a sheer wall of rock then he crossed to the left side here the sandy slope was almost too steep for even him to go up and there was grass that would burn he returned to the pass assured that wildfire had at last fallen into a trap the like slone had never dreamed of the great horse was doomed to run into living flame or the whirling noose of a lasso  then slone reflected nagger had that very morning had his fill of good waterthe first really satisfying drink for days if he was rested that day on the morrow he would be fit for the grueling work possibly in store for him slone unsaddled the horse and turned him loose and with a snort he made down the gentle slope for the grass then slone carried his saddle to a shady spot afforded by a slab of rock and a dwarf cedar and here he composed himself to rest and watch and think and wait  wildfire was plainly in sight no more than two miles away gradually he was grazing along toward the monuments and the far end of the great basin slone believed because the place was so large that wildfire thought there was a way out on the other side or over the slopes or through the walls never before had the farsighted stallion made a mistake slone suddenly felt the keen stabbing fear of an outlet somewhere but it left him quickly he had studied those slopes and walls wildfire could not get out except by the pass he had entered unless he could fly  slone lay in the shade his head propped on his saddle and while gazing down into the shimmering hollow he began to plan he calculated that he must be able to carry fire swiftly across the far end of the basin so that he would not be absent long from the mouth of the pass fire was always a difficult matter since he must depend only on flint and steel he decided to wait till dark build a fire with dead cedar sticks and carry a bundle of them with burning ends he felt assured that the wind caused by riding would keep them burning after he had lighted the grass all he had to do was to hurry back to his station and there await developments  the day passed slowly and it was hot the heatwaves rose in dark wavering lines and veils from the valley the wind blew almost a gale thin curling sheets of sand blew up over the crests of the slopes and the sound it made was a soft silken rustling very low the sky was a steely blue above and copper close over the distant walls  that afternoon toward the close slone ate the last of the meat at sunset the wind died away and the air cooled there was a strip of red along the wall of rock and on the tips of the monuments and it lingered there for long a strange bright crown nagger was not far away but wildfire had disappeared probably behind one of the monuments  when twilight fell slone went down after nagger and returning with him put on bridle and saddle then he began to search for suitable sticks of wood farther back in the pass he found stunted dead cedars and from these secured enough for his purpose he kindled a fire and burnt the ends of the sticks into red embers making a bundle of these he put them under his arm the dull glowing ends backward and then mounted his horse  it was just about dark when he faced down into the valley when he reached level ground he kept to the edge of the left slope and put nagger to a good trot the grass and brush were scant here and the color of the sand was light so he had no difficulty in traveling  from time to time his horse went through grass and its dry crackling rustle showing how it would burn was music to slone gradually the monuments began to loom up bold and black against the blue sky with stars seemingly hanging close over them slone had calculated that the basin was smaller than it really was in both length and breadth this worried him wildfire might see or hear or scent him and make a break back to the pass and thus escape slone was glad when the huge dark monuments were indistinguishable from the black frowning wall he had to go slower here because of the darkness but at last he reached the slow rise of jumbled rock that evidently marked the extent of weathering on that side here he turned to the right and rode out into the valley the floor was level and thickly overgrown with long dead grass and dead greasewood as dry as tinder it was easy to account for the dryness neither snow nor rain had visited that valley for many months slone whipped one of the sticks in the wind and soon had the smoldering end red and showering sparks then he dropped the stick in the grass with curious intent and a strange feeling of regret  instantly the grass blazed with a little sputtering roar nagger snorted wildfire exclaimed slone that word was a favorite one with riders and now slone used it both to call out his menace to the stallion and to express his feeling for that blaze already running wild  without looking back slone rode across the valley dropping a glowing stick every quarter of a mile when he reached the other side there were a dozen fires behind him burning slowly with white smoke rising lazily then he loped nagger along the side back to the sandy ascent and on up to the mouth of the pass there he searched for tracks wildfire had not gone out and slone experienced relief and exultation he took up a position in the middle of the narrowest part of the pass and there with nagger ready for anything he once more composed himself to watch and wait  far across the darkness of the valley low down twelve lines of fire widely separated crept toward one another they appeared thin and slow with only an occasional leaping flame and some of the black spaces must have been monuments blotting out the creeping snaillines of red slone watched strangely fascinated  what do you think of that he said aloud and he meant his query for wildfire  as he watched the lines perceptibly lengthened and brightened and pale shadows of smoke began to appear over at the left of the valley the two brightest fires the first he had started crept closer and closer together they seemed long in covering distance but not a breath of wind stirred and besides they really might move swiftly without looking so to slone when the two lines met a sudden and larger blaze rose  ah said the rider and then he watched the other lines creeping together how slowly fire moved he thought the red stallion would have every chance to run between those lines if he dared but a wild horse feared nothing like fire this one would not run the gantlet of flames nevertheless slone felt more and more relieved as the lines closed the hours of the night dragged past until at length one long continuous line of fire spread level across the valley its bright red line broken only where the monuments of stone were silhouetted against it  the darkness of the valley changed the light of the moon changed the radiance of the stars changed either the line of fire was finding denser fuel to consume or it was growing appreciably closer for the flames began to grow to leap and to flare  slone strained his ears for the thud of hoofs on sand  the time seemed endless in its futility of results but fleeting after it had passed and he could tell how the hours fled by the everrecurring need to replenish the little fire he kept burning in the pass  a broad belt of valley grew bright in the light and behind it loomed the monuments weird and dark with columns of yellow and white smoke wreathing them  suddenly slones sensitive ear vibrated to a thrilling sound he leaned down to place his ear to the sand rapid rhythmic beat of hoofs made him leap to his feet reaching for his lasso with right hand and a gun with his left  nagger lifted his head sniffed the air and snorted slone peered into the black belt of gloom that lay below him it would be hard to see a horse there unless he got high enough to be silhouetted against that line of fire now flaring to the sky but he heard the beat of hoofs swift sharp louderlouder the night shadows were deceptive that wonderful light confused him made the place unreal was he dreaming or had the long chase and his privations unhinged his mind he reached for nagger no the big black was real alive quivering pounding the sand he scented an enemy  once more slone peered down into the void or what seemed a void but it too had changed lightened the whole valley was brightening great palls of curling smoke rose white and yellow to turn back as the monuments met their crests and then to roll upward blotting out the stars it was such a light as he had never seen except in dreams pale moonlight and dimmed starlight and wan dawn all vague and strange and shadowy under the wild and vivid light of burning grass  in the pale path before slone that fanlike slope of sand which opened down into the valley appeared a swiftly moving black object like a fleeting phantom it was a phantom horse slone felt that his eyes deceived by his mind saw racing images many a wild chase he had lived in dreams on some far desert but what was that beating in his earssharp swift even rhythmic never had his ears played him false never had he heard things in his dreams that running object was a horse and he was coming like the wind slone felt something grip his heart all the time and endurance and pain and thirst and suspense and longing and hopelessnessthe agony of the whole endless chaseclosed tight on his heart in that instant  the running horse halted just in the belt of light cast by the burning grass there he stood sharply defined clear as a cameo not a hundred paces from slone it was wildfire  slone uttered an involuntary cry thrill on thrill shot through him delight and hope and fear and despair claimed him in swift successive flashes and then again the ruling passion of a rider held himthe sheer glory of a grand and unattainable horse for slone gave up wildfire in that splendid moment how had he ever dared to believe he could capture that wild stallion slone looked and looked filling his mind regretting nothing sure that the moment was reward for all he had endured  the weird lights magnified wildfire and showed him clearly he seemed gigantic he shone black against the fire his head was high his mane flying behind him the fire flared and the valleywide column of smoke rolled majestically upward and the great monuments seemed to retreat darkly and mysteriously as the flames advanced beyond them it was a beautiful unearthly spectacle with its silence the strangest feature  but suddenly wildfire broke that silence with a whistle which to slones overstrained faculties seemed a blast as piercing as the splitting sound of lightning and with the whistle wildfire plunged up toward the pass slone yelled at the top of his lungs and fired his gun before he could terrorize the stallion and drive him back down the slope soon wildfire became again a running black object and then he disappeared  the great line of fire had gotten beyond the monuments and now stretched unbroken across the valley from wall to slope wildfire could never pierce that line of flames and now slone saw in the paling sky to the east that dawn was at hand    chapter vii  slone looked grimly glad when simultaneously with the first red flash of sunrise a breeze fanned his cheek all that was needed now was a west wind and here came the assurance of it  the valley appeared hazy and smoky with slow rolling clouds low down where the line of fire moved the coming of daylight paled the blaze of the grass though here and there slone caught flickering glimpses of dull red flame the wild stallion kept to the center of the valley restlessly facing this way and that but never toward the smoke slone made sure that wildfire gradually gave ground as the line of smoke slowly worked toward him  every moment the breeze freshened grew steadier and stronger until slone saw that it began to clear the valley of the lowhanging smoke there came a time when once more the blazing line extended across from slope to slope  wildfire was cornered trapped many times slone nervously uncoiled and recoiled his lasso presently the great chance of his life would comethe hardest and most important throw he would ever have with a rope he did not miss often but then he missed sometimes and here he must be swift and sure it annoyed him that his hands perspired and trembled and that something weighty seemed to obstruct his breathing he muttered that he was pretty much worn out not in the best of condition for a hard fight with a wild horse still he would capture wildfire his mind was unalterably set there he anticipated that the stallion would make a final and desperate rush past him and he had his plan of action all outlined what worried him was the possibility of wildfire doing some unforeseen feat at the very last slone was prepared for hours of strained watching and then a desperate effort and then a shock that might kill wildfire and cripple nagger or a long race and fight  but he soon discovered that he was wrong about the long watch and wait the wind had grown strong and was driving the fire swiftly the flames fanned by the breeze leaped to a formidable barrier in less than an hour though the time seemed only a few moments to the excited slone wildfire had been driven down toward the narrowing neck of the valley and he had begun to run to and fro back and forth any moment then slone expected him to grow terrorized and to come tearing up toward the pass  wildfire showed evidence of terror but he did not attempt to make the pass instead he went at the righthand slope of the valley and began to climb the slope was steep and soft yet the stallion climbed up and up the dust flew in clouds the gravel rolled down and the sand followed in long streams wildfire showed his keenness by zigzagging up the slope  go ahead you red devil yelled slone he was much elated in that soft bank wildfire would tire out while not hurting himself  slone watched the stallion in admiration and pity and exultation wildfire did not make much headway for he slipped back almost as much as he gained he attempted one place after another where he failed there was a bank of clay some few feet high and he could not round it at either end or surmount it in the middle finally he literally pawed and cut a path much as if he were digging in the sand for water when he got over that he was not much better off the slope above was endless and grew steeper more difficult toward the top slone knew absolutely that no horse could climb over it he grew apprehensive however for wildfire might stick up there on the slope until the line of fire passed the horse apparently shunned any near proximity to the fire and performed prodigious efforts to escape  hell be ridin an avalanche pretty soon muttered slone  long sheets of sand and gravel slid down to spill thinly over the low bank wildfire now sinking to his knees worked steadily upward till he had reached a point halfway up the slope at the head of a long yellow bank of treacherouslooking sand here he was halted by a low bulge which he might have surmounted had his feet been free but he stood deep in the sand for the first time he looked down at the sweeping fire and then at slone  suddenly the bank of sand began to slide with him he snorted in fright the avalanche started slowly and was evidently no mere surface slide it was deep it stoppedthen started againand again stopped wildfire appeared to be sinking deeper and deeper his struggles only embedded him more firmly then the bank of sand with an ominous low roar began to move once more this time it slipped swiftly the dust rose in a cloud almost obscuring the horse long streams of gravel rattled down and waterfalls of sand waved over the steps of the slope  just as suddenly the avalanche stopped again slone saw from the great oval hole it had left above that it was indeed deep that was the reason it did not slide readily when the dust cleared away slone saw the stallion sunk to his flanks in the sand utterly helpless  with a wild whoop slone leaped off nagger and a lasso in each hand he ran down the long bank the fire was perhaps a quarter of a mile distant and since the grass was thinning out it was not coming so fast as it had been the position of the stallion was halfway between the fire and slone and a hundred yards up the slope  like a madman slone climbed up through the dragging loose sand he was beside himself with a fury of excitement he fancied his eyes were failing him that it was not possible the great horse really was up there helpless in the sand yet every huge stride slone took brought him closer to a fact he could not deny in his eagerness he slipped and fell and crawled and leaped until he reached the slide which held wildfire prisoner  the stallion might have been fast in quicksand up to his body for all the movement he could make he could move only his head he held that up his eyes wild showing the whites his foaming mouth wide open his teeth gleaming a sound like a scream rent the air terrible fear and hate were expressed in that piercing neigh and shaggy wet dusty red with all of brute savageness in the look and action of his head he appeared hideous  as slone leaped within roping distance the avalanche slipped a foot or two halted slipped once more and slowly started again with that low roar he did not care whether it slipped or stopped like a wolf he leaped closer whirling his rope the loop hissed round his head and whistled as he flung it and when fiercely he jerked back on the rope the noose closed tight round wildfires neck  by gdigota ropeon him cried slone in hoarse pants  he stared unbelieving it was unreal that sightunreal like the slow grinding movement of the avalanche under him wildfires head seemed a demon head of hate it reached out mouth agape to bite to rend that horrible scream could not be the scream of a horse  slone was a wildhorse hunter a rider and when that second of incredulity flashed by then came the moment of triumph no moment could ever equal that one when he realized he stood there with a rope around that grand stallions neck all the days and the miles and the toil and the endurance and the hopelessness and the hunger were paid for in that moment his heart seemed too large for his breast  i trackedyou he cried savagely i stayedwith you  an i got a ropeon you anill ride youyou red devil  the passion of the man was intense that endless racking pursuit had brought out all the hardness the desert had engendered in him almost hate instead of love spoke in slones words he hauled on the lasso pulling the stallions head down and down the action was the lust of capture as well as the riders instinctive motive to make the horse fear him life was unquenchably wild and strong in that stallion it showed in the terror which made him hideous and man and beast somehow resembled each other in that moment which was inimical to noble life  the avalanche slipped with little jerks as if treacherously loosing its hold for a long plunge the line of fire below ate at the bleached grass and the long column of smoke curled away on the wind  slone held the taut lasso with his left hand and with the right he swung the other rope catching the noose round wildfires nose then letting go of the first rope he hauled on the other pulling the head of the stallion far down hand over hand slone closed in on the horse he leaped on wildfires head pressed it down and holding it down on the sand with his knees with swift fingers he tied the noose in a hackamorean improvised halter then just as swiftly he bound his scarf tight round wildfires head blindfolding him  all so easy exclaimed slone under his breath lord who would believe it  is it a dream  he rose and let the stallion have a free head  wildfire i got a rope on youan a hackamorean a blinder said slone an if i had a bridle id put that on you whod ever believe youd catch yourself draggin in the sand  slone finding himself failing on the sand grew alive to the augmented movement of the avalanche it had begun to slide to heave and bulge and crack dust rose in clouds from all around the sand appeared to open and let him sink to his knees the rattle of gravel was drowned in a soft roar then he shot down swiftly holding the lassoes keeping himself erect and riding as if in a boat he felt the successive steps of the slope and then the long incline below and then the checking and rising and spreading of the avalanche as it slowed down on the level all movement then was checked violently he appeared to be half buried in sand while he struggled to extricate himself the thick dust blew away and settled so that he could see wildfire lay before him at the edge of the slide and now he was not so deeply embedded as he had been up on the slope he was struggling and probably soon would have been able to get out the line of fire was close now but slone did not fear that  at his shrill whistle nagger bounded toward him obedient but snorting with ears laid back he halted a second whistle started him again slone finally dug himself out of the sand pulled the lassoes out and ran the length of them toward nagger the black showed both fear and fight his eyes roiled and he half shied away  come on called slone harshly  he got a hand on the horse pulled him round and mounting in a flash wound both lassoes round the pommel of the saddle  haul him out nagger old boy cried slone and he dug spurs into the black  one plunge of naggers slid the stallion out of the sand snorting wild blinded wildfire got up shaking in every limb he could not see his enemies the blowing smoke right in his nose made scent impossible but in the taut lassoes he sensed the direction of his captors he plunged rearing at the end of the plunge and struck out viciously with his hoofs slone quick with spur and bridle swerved nagger aside and wildfire off his balance went down with a crash slone dragged him stretched him out pulled him over twice before he got forefeet planted once up he reared again screeching his rage striking wildly with his hoofs slone wheeled aside and toppled him over again  wildfire its no fair fight he called grimly but you led me a chase an you learn right now im boss  again he dragged the stallion he was ruthless he would have to be so stopping just short of maiming or killing the horse else he would never break him but wildfire was nimble he got to his feet and this time he lunged out nagger powerful as he was could not sustain the tremendous shock and went down slone saved himself with a riders supple skill falling clear of the horse and he leaped again into the saddle as nagger pounded up nagger braced his huge frame and held the plunging stallion but the saddle slipped a little the cinches cracked slone eased the strain by wheeling after wildfire  the horses had worked away from the fire and wildfire free of the stifling smoke began to break and lunge and pitch plunging round nagger in a circle running blindly but with unerring scent slone by masterly horsemanship easily avoided the rushes and made a pivot of nagger round which the wild horse dashed in his frenzy it seemed that he no longer tried to free himself he lunged to kill  steady nagger old boy slone kept calling hell never get at you if he slips that blinder ill kill him  the stallion was a fiend in his fury quicker than a panther wonderful on his feet and powerful as an ox but he was at a disadvantage he could not see and slone in his spoken intention to kill wildfire should the scarf slip acknowledged that he never would have a chance to master the stallion wildfire was bigger faster stronger than slone had believed and as for spirit that was a grand and fearful thing to see  the soft sand in the pass was plowed deep before wildfire paused in his mad plunges he was wet and heaving his red coat seemed to blaze his mane stood up and his ears lay flat  slone uncoiled the lassoes from the pommel and slacked them a little wildfire stood up striking at the air snorting fiercely slone tried to wheel nagger in close behind the stallion both horse and man narrowly escaped the vicious hoofs but slone had closed in he took a desperate chance and spurred nagger in a single leap as wildfire reared again the horses collided slone hauled the lassoes tight the impact threw wildfire off his balance just as slone had calculated and as the stallion plunged down on four feet slone spurred nagger close against him wildfire was a little in the lead he could only half rear now for the heaving moving nagger always against him jostled him down and slones iron arm hauled on the short ropes when wildfire turned to bite slone knocked the vicious nose back with a long swing of his fist  up the pass the horses plunged with a riders wild joy slone saw the long greenandgray valley and the isolated monuments in the distance there on that wide stretch he would break wildfire how marvelously luck had favored him at the last  run you red devil slone called drag us around now till youre done  they left the pass and swept out upon the waste of sage slone realized from the stinging of the sweet wind in his face that nagger was being pulled along at a tremendous pace the faithful black could never have made the wind cut so lower the wild stallion stretched and swifter he ran till it seemed to slone that death must end that thunderbolt race    chapter viii  lucy bostil had called twice to her father and he had not answered he was out at the hitchingrail with holley the rider and two other men if he heard lucy he gave no sign of it she had on her chaps and did not care to go any farther than the door where she stood  somers has gone to durango an shugrue is out huntin hosses lucy heard bostil say gruffly  wal now i reckon i could handle the boat an fetch creechs hosses over said holley  bostil raised an impatient hand as if to wave aside holleys assumption  then one of the other two men spoke up lucy had seen him before but did not know his name  sure there aint any need to rustle the job the river haint showed any signs of risin yet but creech is worryin he allus is worryin over them hosses no wonder thet blue roan is sure a hoss yesterday at two miles he showed creech he was a sight faster than last year the grass is gone over there creech is grainin his stock these last few days an thets expensive  how about the flat up the canyon queried bostil aint there any

special ought to be brought acrost the river said holley earnestly he loved horses and was thinking of them  the boats got to be patched up replied bostil shortly  it occurred to lucy that her father was also thinking of creechs thoroughbreds but not like holley she grew grave and listened intently  there was an awkward pause creechs rider whoever he was evidently tried to conceal his anxiety he flicked his boots with a quirt the boots were covered with wet mud probably he had crossed the river very recently  wal when will you have the hosses fetched over he asked deliberately creechll want to know  just as soon as the boats mended replied bostil ill put shugrue on the job tomorrow  thanks bostil sure thetll be all right creechll be satisfied said the rider as if relieved then he mounted and with his companion trotted down the lane  the lean gray holley bent a keen gaze upon bostil but bostil did not notice that he appeared preoccupied in thought  bostil the dry winter an spring here aint any guarantee thet there wasnt a lot of snow up in the mountains holleys remark startled bostil  noit aintsure he replied  an any mornin along now we might wake up to hear the colorado boomin went on holley significantly  bostil did not reply to that  creech haint lived over there so many years whats he know about the river an fer that matter who knows anythin sure about thet hellbent river  it aint my business thet creech lives over there riskin his stock every spring replied bostil darkly  holley opened his lips to speak hesitated looked away from bostil and finally said no it sure aint then he turned and walked away head bent in sober thought bostil came toward the open door where lucy stood he looked somber at her greeting he seemed startled  what he said  i just said hello dad she replied demurely yet she thoughtfully studied her fathers dark face  hello yourself did you know van got throwed an hurt  yes  bostil swore under his breath there aint any riders on the range thet can be trusted he said disgustedly theyre all the same they like to get in a bunch an jeer each other an bet they want mean hosses they make good hosses buck they havent any use for a hoss thet wont buck they all want to give a hoss a rakin over think of thet fool van gettin throwed by a twodollar ute mustang an hurt so he cant ride for days with them races comin soon it makes me sick  dad werent you a rider once asked lucy  i never was thet kind  van will be all right in a few days  no matter its bad business if i had any other rider who could handle the king id let van go  i can get just as much out of the king as van can said lucy spiritedly  you exclaimed bostil but there was pride in his glance  i know i can  you never had any use for sage king said bostil as if he had been wronged  i love the king a little and hate him a lot laughed lucy  wal i might let you ride at thet if van aint in shape rejoined her father  i wouldnt ride him in the race but ill keep him in fine fettle  ill bet youd like to see sarch beat him said bostil jealously  sure i would replied lucy teasingly but dad im afraid sarch never will beat him  bostil grunted see here i dont want any weight up on the king you take him out for a few days an ride him savvy thet  yes dad  give him miles an milesan then comin home on good trails ride him for all your worth now lucy keep your eye open dont let any one get near you on the sage  i wont dad do you still worry about poor joel creech  not joel but id rather lose all my stock then have cordts or dick sears get within a mile of you  a mile exclaimed lucy lightly though a fleeting shade crossed her face why id run away from him if i was on the king even if he got within ten yards of me  a mile is close enough my daughter replied bostil dont ever forget to keep your eye open cordts has sworn thet if he cant steal the king hell get you  oh he prefers the horse to me  wal lucy ive a sneakin idea thet cordts will never leave the uplands unless he gets you an the king both  and dadyou consented to let that horsethief come to our races exclaimed lucy with heat  why not he cant do any harm if he or his men get uppish the worse for them cordts gave his word not to turn a trick till after the races  do you trust him  yes but his men might break loose away from his sight especially thet dick sears hes a bad man so be watchful whenever you ride out  as lucy went down toward the corrals she was thinking deeply she could always tell womanlike when her father was excited or agitated she remembered the conversation between him and creechs rider she remembered the keen glance old holley had bent upon him and mostly she remembered the somber look upon his face she did not like that once when a little girl she had seen it and never forgotten it nor the thing that it was associated withsomething tragical which had happened in the big room there had been loud angry voices of menand shotsand then the men carried out a long form covered with a blanket she loved her father but there was a side to him she feared and somehow related to that side was his hardness toward creech and his intolerance of any rider owning a fast horse and his obsession in regard to his own racers lucy had often tantalized her father with the joke that if it ever came to a choice between her and his favorites they would come first but was it any longer a joke lucy felt that she had left childhood behind with its fun and fancies and she had begun to look at life thoughtfully  sight of the corrals however and of the king prancing around drove serious thoughts away there were riders there among them farlane and they all had pleasant greetings for her  farlane dad says im to take out sage king announced lucy  no ejaculated farlane as he pocketed his pipe  sure and im to ride him you know how dad means that  wal now im doggoned added farlane looking worried and pleased at once i reckon miss lucy youyou wouldnt fool me  why farlane returned lucy reproachfully did i ever do a single thing around horses that you didnt want me to  farlane rubbed his chin beard somewhat dubiously wal miss lucy not exactly while you was around the hosses but i reckon when you onct got up youve sorta forgot a few times  all the riders laughed and lucy joined them  im safe when im up you know that she replied  they brought out the gray and after the manner of riders who had the care of a great horse and loved him they curried and combed and rubbed him before saddling him  reckon youd better ride vans saddle suggested farlane them races is close now an a strange saddle  of course dont change anything hes used to except the stirrups replied lucy  despite her antipathy toward sage king lucy could not gaze at him without all a riders glory in a horse he was sleek so graceful so racy so near the soft gray of the sage so beautiful in build and action then he was the kind of a horse that did not have to be eternally watched he was spirited and full of life eager to run but when farlane called for him to stand still he obeyed he was the kind of a horse that a child could have played around in safety he never kicked he never bit he never bolted it was splendid to see him with farlane or with bostil he did not like lucy very well a fact that perhaps accounted for lucys antipathy for that matter he did not like any woman if he had a bad trait it came out when van rode him but all the riders and bostil too claimed that van was to blame for that  thar i reckon them stirrups is right declared farlane now miss lucy hold him tight till he wears off thet edge he needs work  sage king would not kneel for lucy as sarchedon did and he was too high for her to mount from the ground so she mounted from a rock she took to the road and then the first trail into the sage intending to trot him ten or fifteen miles down into the valley and give him some fast warm work on the return  the day was early in may and promised to grow hot there was not a cloud in the blue sky the wind laden with the breath of sage blew briskly from the west all before lucy lay the vast valley gray and dusky gray then blue then purple where the monuments stood and farther still dark ramparts of rock lucy had a habit of dreaming while on horseback a habit all the riders had tried to break but she did not give it rein while she rode sarchedon and assuredly now up on the king she never forgot him for an instant he shied at mockingbirds and packrats and blowing blossoms and even at butterflies and he did it lucy thought just because he was full of mischief sage king had been known to go steady when there had been reason to shy he did not like lucy and he chose to torment her finally he earned a good dig from a spur and then with swift pounding of hoofs he plunged and veered and danced in the sage lucy kept her temper which was what most riders did not do and by patience and firmness pulled sage king out of his prancing back into the trail he was not the least crossgrained and having had his little spurt he settled down into easy going  in an hour lucy was ten miles or more from home and farther down in the valley than she had ever been in fact she had never before been down the long slope to the valley floor how changed the horizon became the monuments loomed up now dark sentinellike and strange the first one a great red rock seemed to her some five miles away it was lofty straightsided with a green slope at its base and beyond that the other monuments stretched out down the valley lucy decided to ride as far as the first one before turning back always these monuments had fascinated her and this was her opportunity to ride near one how lofty they were how wonderfully colored and how comely  presently over the left where the monuments were thicker and gradually merged their slopes and lines and bulk into the yellow walls she saw low drifting clouds of smoke  well whats that i wonder she mused to see smoke on the horizon in that direction was unusual though out toward durango the grassy benches would often burn over and these low clouds of smoke resembled those she had seen before  its a long way off she added  so she kept on now and then gazing at the smoke as she grew nearer to the first monument she was surprised then amazed at its height and surpassing size it was mountainhigha grand towersmooth worn glistening yellow and red the trail she had followed petered out in a deep wash and beyond that she crossed no more trails the sage had grown meager and the greasewoods stunted and dead and cacti appeared on barren places the grass had not failed but it was not rich grass such as the horses and cattle grazed upon miles back on the slope the air was hot down here the breeze was heavy and smelled of fire and the sand was blowing here and there she had a sense of the bigness the openness of this valley and then she realized its wildness and strangeness these lonely isolated monuments made the place different from any she had visited they did not seem mere standing rocks they seemed to retreat all the time as she approached and they watched her they interested her made her curious what had formed all these strange monuments here the ground was level for miles and miles to slope gently up to the bases of these huge rocks in an old book she had seen pictures of the egyptian pyramids but these appeared vaster higher and stranger and they were sheerly perpendicular  suddenly sage king halted sharply shot up his ears and whistled lucy was startled that from the king meant something hastily with keen glance she swept the foreground a mile on near the monument was a small black spot it seemed motionless but the kings whistle had proved it to be a horse when lucy had covered a quarter of the intervening distance she could distinguish the horse and that there appeared some thing strange about his position lucy urged sage king into a lope and soon drew nearer the black horse had his head down yet he did not appear to be grazing he was as still as a statue he stood just outside a clump of greasewood and cactus  suddenly a sound pierced the stillness the king jumped and snorted in fright for an instant lucys blood ran cold for it was a horrible cry then she recognized it as the neigh of a horse in agony she had heard crippled and dying horses utter that longdrawn and bloodcurdling neigh the black horse had not moved so the sound could not have come from him lucy thought sage king acted more excited than the occasion called for then remembering her fathers warning she reined in on top of a little knoll perhaps a hundred yards from where the black horse stood and she bent her keen gaze forward  it was a huge gaunt shaggy black horse she saw with the saddle farther up on his shoulders than it should have been he stood motionless as if utterly exhausted his forelegs were braced so that he leaned slightly back then lucy saw a rope it was fast to the saddle and stretched down into the cactus there was no other horse in sight nor any living thing the immense monument dominated the scene it seemed stupendous to lucy sublime almost frightful  she hesitated she knew there was another horse very likely at the other end of that lasso probably a rider had been thrown perhaps killed certainly a horse had been hurt then on the moment rang out the same neigh of agony only weaker and shorter lucy no longer feared an ambush that was a cry which could not be imitated by a man or forced from a horse there was probably death certainly suffering near at hand she spurred the king on  there was a little slope to descend a wash to cross a bench to climband then she rode up to the black horse sage king needed harder treatment than lucy had ever given him  whats wrong with you she demanded pulling him down suddenly as she felt him tremble she realized that he was frightened thats funny then when she got him quiet she looked around  the black horse was indeed huge his mane his shaggy flanks were lathered as if he had been smeared with heavy soapsuds he raised his head to look at her lucy accustomed to horses all her life saw that this one welcomed her arrival but he was almost ready to drop  two taut lassoes stretched from the pommel of his saddle down a little into a depression full of brush and cactus and rocks then lucy saw a red horse he was down in a bad position she heard his low choking heaves probably he had broken legs or back she could not bear to see a horse in pain she would do what was possible even to the extent of putting him out of his misery if nothing else could be done yet she scanned the surroundings closely and peered into the bushes and behind the rocks before she tried to urge sage king closer he refused to go nearer and lucy dismounted  the red horse was partly hidden by overbending brush he had plunged into a hole full of cactus there was a hackamore round his nose and a tight noose round his neck the one round his neck was also round his forelegs and both lassoes were held taut by the black horse a torn and soiled riders scarf hung limp round the red horses nose kept from falling off by the hackamore  a wild horse a stallion being broken exclaimed lucy instantly grasping the situation oh wheres the rider  she gazed around ran to and fro glanced down the little slope and beyond but she did not see anything resembling the form of a man then she ran back  lucy took another quick look at the red stallion she did not believe either his legs or back were hurt he was just played out and tangled and tied in the ropes and could not get up the shaggy black horse stood there braced and indomitable but he likewise was almost ready to drop looking at the condition of both horses and the saddle and ropes lucy saw what a fight there had been and a race where was the rider thrown surely and back on the trail perhaps dead or maimed  lucy went closer to the stallion so that she could almost touch him he saw her he was nearly choked foam and blood wheezed out with his heaves she must do something quickly and in her haste she pricked her arms and shoulders on the cactus  she led the black horse closer in letting the ropes go slack the black seemed as glad of that release as she was what a faithful brute he looked lucy liked his eyes  then she edged down in among the cactus and brush the red horse no longer lay in a strained position he could lift his head lucy saw that the noose still held tight round his neck fearlessly she jerked it loose then she backed away but not quite out of his reach he coughed and breathed slowly with great heaves then he snorted  youre all right now said lucy soothingly slowly she reached a hand toward his head he drew it back as far as he could she stepped around closer and more back of him and put a hand on him gently for an instant then she slipped out of the brush and untying one lasso from the pommel she returned to the horse and pulled it from round his legs he was free now except the hackamore and that rope was slack lucy stood near him watching him talking to him waiting for him to get up she could not be sure he was not badly hurt till he stood up at first he made no efforts to rise he watched lucy less fearfully she imagined and she never made a move she wanted him to see to understand that she had not hurt him and would not hurt him it began to dawn upon her that he was magnificent  finally with a long slow heave he got to his feet lucy led him out of the hole to open ground she seemed somehow confident there occurred to her only one way to act  a little horse sense as dad would say she soliloquized and then when she got him out of the brush she stood thrilled and amazed  oh what a wild beautiful horse what a giant hes bigger than the king oh if dad could see him  the red stallion did not appear to be hurt the twitching of his muscles must have been caused by the cactus spikes embedded in him there were drops of blood all over one side lucy thought she dared to try to pull these thorns out she had never in her life been afraid of any horse farlane holley all the riders and her father too had tried to make her realize the danger in a horse sooner or later but lucy could not help it she was not afraid she believed that the meanest horse was actuated by natural fear of a man she was not a man and she had never handled a horse like a man this red stallion showed hate of the black horse and the rope that connected them he showed some spirit at the repeated blasts of sage king but he showed less fear of her  he has been a proud wild stallion mused lucy and hes now brokenterribly brokenall but ruined  then she walked up to him naturally and spoke softly and reached a hand for his shoulder  whoa reddy whoa now there thats a good fellow why i wouldnt rope you or hit you im only a girl  he drew up made a single effort to jump which she prevented and then he stood quivering eying her while she talked soothingly and patted him and looked at him in the way she had found infallible with most horses lucy believed horses were like people or easier to get along with presently she gently pulled out one of the cactus spikes the horse flinched but he stood lucy was slow careful patient and dexterous the cactus needles were loose and easily removed or brushed off at length she got him free of them and was almost as proud as she was glad the horse had gradually dropped his head he was tired and his spirit was broken  now what shall i do she queried ill take the back trail of these horses they certainly hadnt been here long before i saw them and the rider may be close if not ill take the horses home  she slipped the noose from the stallions head leaving the hackamore and coiling the loose lasso she hung it over the pommel of the blacks saddle then she took up his bridle  come on she called  the black followed her and the stallion still fast to him by the lasso lucy had left tied trooped behind with bowed head lucy was elated but sage king did not like the matter at all lucy had to drop the blacks bridle and catch the king and then ride back to lead the other again  a broad trail marked the way the two horses had come and it led off to the left toward where the monuments were thickest and where the great sections of wall stood broken and battlemented lucy was hard put to it to hold sage king but the horses behind plodded along the black horse struck lucy as being an ugly but a faithful and wonderful animal he understood everything presently she tied the bridle she was leading him by to the end of her own lasso and thus let him drop back a few yards which lessened the kings fretting  intent on the trail lucy failed to note time or distance till the looming and frowning monuments stood aloft before her what weird effect they had each might have been a colossal statue left there to mark the work of the ages lucy realized that the whole vast valley had once been solid rock just like the monuments and through the millions of years the softer parts had eroded and weathered and blown awaygone with the great sea that had once been there but the beauty the solemnity the majesty of these monuments fascinated her most she passed the first one a huge square butte and then the second a ragged thin double shaft and then went between two much alike reaching skyward in the shape of monstrous mittens she watched and watched them sparing a moment now and then to attend to the trail she noticed that she was coming into a region of grass and faint signs of water in the draws she was getting high again not many miles now from the wall of rock  all at once sage king shied and lucy looked down to see a man lying on the ground he lay inert but his eyes were opendark staring eyes they moved and he called but lucy could not understand him  in a flash she leaped off the king she ran to the prostrate mandropped to her knees  oh she cried his face was ghastly oh are youyou badly hurt  lift memy head he said faintly  she raised his head what a strained passionate terrible gaze he bent upon the horses  boy theyre minethe black an the red he cried  they surely must be replied lucy oh tell me are you hurt  boy did you catch themfetch them backlookin for me  i sure did  you caughtthat red devilan fetched himback to me went on the wondering faint voice boyohboy  he lifted a long ragged arm and pulled lucy down the action amazed her equally as his passion of gratitude he might have been injured but he had an arm of iron lucy was powerless she felt her face against hisand her breast against his the pounding of his heart was like blows the first instant she wanted to laugh despite her pity then the powerful armthe contact affected her as nothing ever before suppose this crippled rider had taken her for a boyshe was not a boy she could not help being herself and no man had ever put a hand on her consciousness of this brought shame and anger she struggled so violently that she freed herself and he lay back  see herethats no way to actto huga person she cried with flaming cheeks  boy i  im not a boy im a girl  what  lucy tore off her sombrero which had been pulled far forward and this revealed her face fully and her hair came tumbling down the rider gazed stupefied then a faint tinge of red colored his ghastly cheeks  a girl  whywhy scuse me miss ii took youfor a boy  he seemed so astounded he looked so ashamed so scared and withal so haggard and weak that lucy immediately recovered her equanimity  sure im a girl but thats no matter youve been thrown are you hurt  he smiled a weak assent  badly she queried she did not like the way he layso limp so motionless  im afraid so i cant move  oh  what shall i do  can youget me water he whispered with dry lips  lucy flew to her horse to get the small canteen she always carried but that had been left on her saddle and she had ridden vans then she gazed around the wash she had crossed several times ran near where the rider lay green grass and willows bordered it she ran down and hurrying along searched for water there was water in places yet she had to go a long way before she found water that was drinkable filling her sombrero she hurried back to the side of the rider it was difficult to give him a drink  thanks miss he said gratefully his voice was stronger and less hoarse  have you any broken bones asked lucy  i dont know i cant feel much  are you in pain  hardly i feel sort of thick  lucy being an intelligent girl born in the desert and used to its needs had not often encountered a situation with which she was unable to cope  let me feel if you have any broken bones that arm isnt broken im positive  the rider smiled faintly again how he stared with his strained dark eyes his face showed ghastly through the thin soft beard and the tan lucy found his right arm badly bruised but not broken she made sure his collarbones and shoulderblades were intact broken ribs were harder to locate still as he did not feel pain from pressure she concluded there were no fractures there with her assistance he moved his legs proving no broken bones there  im afraid its myspine he said  but you raised your head once she replied if your back waswas broken or injured you couldnt raise your head  so i couldnt i guess im just knocked out i waspretty weak before wildfire knocked meoff nagger  wildfire  thats the red stallions name  oh hes named already  i named himlong ago hes known on many a range  where  i think far north of here itrailed himdaysweeksmonths we crossed the great canyon  the grand canyon  it must be that  the grand canyon is down there said lucy pointing i live on it youve come a long way  hundreds of miles  oh the ground i covered that awful canyon country  but i stayed with wildfire an i put a rope on him an he got away an it was a boynoa girl whosaved him for mean maybe saved my life too  lucy looked away from the dark staring eyes a light in them confused her  never mind me you say you were weak have you been ill  no miss just starved i starved on wildfires trail  lucy ran to her saddle and got the biscuits out of the pockets of her coat and she ran back to the rider  here i never thought oh youve had a hard time of it i understand that wonderful flame of a horse id have stayed too my father was a rider once bostil did you ever hear of him  bostil the nameive heard then the rider lay thinking as he munched a biscuit yes i remember but it was long ago i spent a night with a wagontrain a camp of many men and women religious people working into utah bostil had a boat at the crossing of the fathers  yes they called the ferry that  i remember well now they said bostil couldnt count his horsesthat he was a rich man hard on ridersan hed used a gun more than once  lucy bowed her head yes thats my dad  the rider did not seem to see how he had hurt her  here we are talkingwasting time she said i must start home you cant be moved what shall i do  thats for you to say bostils daughter  my names lucy replied the girl blushing painfully i mean ill be glad to do anything you think best  youre very good  then he turned his face away lucy looked closely at him he was indeed a beggared rider his clothes and his boots hung in tatters he had no hat no coat no vest his gaunt face bore traces of what might have been a fine strong comeliness but now it was only thin worn wan pitiful with that look which always went to a womans heart he had the look of a homeless rider lucy had seen a few of his wandering type and his story was so plain but he seemed to have a touch of pride and this quickened her interest  then ill do what i think best for you said lucy  first she unsaddled the black nagger with the saddle she made a pillow for the riders head and she covered him with the saddle blanket before she had finished this task he turned his eyes upon her and lucy felt she would be haunted was he badly hurt after all it seemed probable how strange he was  ill water the horsesthen tie wildfire here on a double rope theres grass  but you cant lead him replied the rider  hell follow me  that red devil the rider shuddered as he spoke  lucy had some faint inkling of what a terrible fight that had been between man and horse yes when i found him he was broken look at him now  but the rider did not appear to want to see the stallion he gazed up at lucy and she saw something in his eyes that made her think of a child she left him had no trouble in watering the horses and haltered wildfire among the willows on a patch of grass then she returned  ill go now she said to the rider  where  home ill come back tomorrow early and bring some one to help you  girl if you want to help me morebring me some bread an meat dont tell any one look what a ragamuffin i am an theres wildfire i dont want him seen till imon my feet again i know riders thats all if you want to be so goodcome  ill come replied lucy simply  thank you i owe youa lot what did you say your name was  lucylucy bostil  oh i forgot are you sure you tied wildfire good an tight  yes im sure ill go now i hope youll be better tomorrow  lucy hesitated with her hand on the kings bridle she did not like to leave this young man lying there helpless on the desert but what else could she do what a strange adventure had befallen her at the following thought that it was not yet concluded she felt a little stir of excitement at her pulses she was so strangely preoccupied that she forgot it was necessary for her to have a step to mount sage king she realized it quickly enough when she attempted it then she led him off in the sage till she found a rock mounting she turned him straight across country meaning to cut out miles of travel that would have been necessary along her backtrail once she looked back the rider was not visible the black horse nagger was out of sight but wildfire blazing in the sun watched her depart    chapter ix  lucy bostil could not control the glow of strange excitement under which she labored but she could put her mind on the riding of sage king she did not realize however that she was riding him under the stress and spell of that excitement  she had headed out to make a short cut fairly sure of her direction yet she was not unaware of the fact that she would be lost till she ran across her trail that might be easy to miss and time was flying she put the king to a brisk trot winding through the aisles of the sage  soon she had left the monument region and was down on the valley floor again from time to time she conquered a desire to look back presently she was surprised and very glad to ride into a trail where she saw the tracks she had made coming out with much relief she turned sage king into this trail and then any anxiety she had felt left her entirely but that did not mitigate her excitement she eased the king into a long swinging lope and as he warmed to the work she was aroused also it was hard to hold him in once he got out of a trot and after miles and miles of this when she thought best to slow down he nearly pulled her arms off still she finally got him in hand then followed miles of soft and rough going which seemed long and tedious beyond that was the home stretch up the valley whose gradual slope could be seen only at a distance here was a straight broad trail not too soft nor too hard and for all the years she could remember riders had tried out and trained their favorites on that course  lucy reached down to assure herself that the cinch was tight then she pulled her sombrero down hard slackened the bridle and let the king go he simply broke his gait he was so surprised lucy saw him trying to look back at her as if he could not realize that this young woman rider had given him a free rein perhaps one reason he disliked her had been always and everlastingly that tight rein like the wary horse he was he took to a canter to try out what his new freedom meant  say whats the matter with you called lucy disdainfully are you lazy or dont you believe i can ride you  whereupon she dug him with her spurs sage king snorted his action shifted marvelously thunder rolled from under his hoofs and he broke out of that clattering roar into his fleet stride where his hoofbeats were swift regular rhythmic  lucy rode him with teeth and fists clenched bending low after all she thought it was no trick to ride him in that gait he was dangerous for a fall meant death but he ran so smoothly that riding him was easy and certainly glorious he went so fast that the wind blinded her the trail was only a white streak in blurred gray she could not get her breath the wind seemed to whip the air away from her and then she felt the lessening of the tremendous pace sage king had run himself out and the miles were behind her gradually her sight became clear and as the hot and wet horse slowed down satisfied with his wild run lucy realized that she was up on the slope only a few miles from home suddenly she thought she saw something dark stir behind a sagebush just ahead before she could move a hand at the bridle sage king leaped with a frantic snort it was a swerving nimble tremendous bound he went high lucy was unseated but somehow clung on and came down with him finding the saddle and it seemed while in the air she saw a long snaky whipping loop of rope shoot out and close just where sage kings legs had been  she screamed the horse broke and ran lucy righting herself looked back to see joel creech holding a limp lasso he had tried to rope the king  the blood of her father was aroused in lucy she thought of the horsenot herself if the king had not been so keensighted so swift he would have gone down with a broken leg lucy never in her life had been so furious  joel shook his fist at her and yelled id a got youon any other hoss  she did not reply though she had to fight herself to keep from pulling her gun and shooting at him she guided the running horse back into the trail rapidly leaving creech out of sight  hes gone crazy thats sure said lucy and he means me harm  she ran the king clear up to the corrals and he was still going hard when she turned down the lane to the barns then she pulled him in  farlane was there to meet her she saw no other riders and was glad  wal miss lucy the king sure looks good said farlane as she jumped off and flung him the bridle hes just had about right judgin say girl youre all pale oh say you wasnt scared of the king now  no replied lucy panting  wal whats up then the rider spoke in an entirely different voice and into his clear hazel eyes a little dark gleam shot  joel creech waylaid me out in the sageandand tried to catch me lucy checked herself it might not do to tell how joel had tried to catch her  he did an you on the king farlane laughed as if relieved wal hes tried thet before miss lucy but when you was up on the graythet shows joels crazy sure  he sure is farlane ii am mad  wal cool off miss lucy it aint nothin to git set up about an dont tell the old man  why not demanded lucy  wal because hes in a queer sort of bad mood lately it wouldnt be safe he hates them creeches so dont tell him  all right farlane i wont dont you tell either replied lucy soberly  sure ill keep mum but if joel doesnt watch out ill put a crimp in him myself  lucy hurried away down the lane and entered the house without meeting any one in her room she changed her clothes and lay down to rest and think  strangely enough lucy might never have encountered joel creech out in the sage for all the thought she gave him her mind was busy with the crippled rider who was he where was he from what strange passion he had shown over the recovery of that wonderful red horse lucy could not forget the feeling of his iron arm when he held her in a kind of frenzied gratitude a wild upland rider living only for a wild horse how like indians some of these riders yet this fellow had seemed different from most of the uncouth riders she had known he spoke better he appeared to have had some little schooling lucy did not realize that she was interested in him she thought she was sorry for him and interested in the stallion she began to compare wildfire with sage king and if she remembered rightly wildfire even in his disheveled state had appeared a worthy rival of the king what would bostil say at sight of that flamecolored stallion lucy thrilled  later she left her room to see if the hour was opportune for her plan to make up a pack of supplies for the rider her aunt was busy in the kitchen and bostil had not come in lucy took advantage of the moment to tie up a pack and carry it to her room somehow the task pleased her she recalled the lean face of the rider and that recalled his ragged appearance why not pack up an outfit of clothes bostil had a stockroom full of such accessories for his men then lucy glowing with the thought hurried to bostils stockroom and with deft hands and swift judgment selected an outfit for the rider even down to a comb and razor all this she carried quickly to her room where in her thoughtfulness she added a bit of glass from a broken mirror and soap and a towel then she tied up a second pack  bostil did not come home to supper a circumstance that made lucys aunt cross they ate alone and waiting awhile were rather late in clearing away the table after this lucy had her chance in the dusk of early evening and she carried both packs way out into the sage and left them near the trail  hope a coyote doesnt come along she said that possibility however did not worry her as much as getting those packs up on the king how in the world would she ever do it  she hurried back to the house stealthily keeping to the shadow of the cottonwoods for she would have faced an embarrassing situation if she had met her father even had he been in a good humor and she reached the sittingroom unobserved the lamps had been lighted and a log blazed on the hearth she was reading when bostil entered  hello lucy he said  he looked tired and lucy knew he had been drinking because when he had been he never offered to kiss her the strange somber shade was still on his face but it brightened somewhat at sight of her lucy greeted him as always  farlane tells me you handled the king greatbetter n van has worked him lately said bostil but dont tell him i told you  that was sweet praise from farlane oh dad it could hardly be true expostulated lucy both you and farlane are a little sore at van now  im a lot sore replied bostil gruffly  anyway how did farlane know how i handled sage king queried lucy  wal every hair on a hoss talks to farlane so holley says lucy you take the king out every day for a while ride him now an watch out joel creech was in the village today he sure sneaked when he seen me hes up to some mischief  lucy did not want to lie and she did not know what to say presently bostil bade her good night lucy endeavored to read but her mind continually wandered back to the adventure of the day  next morning she had difficulty in concealing her impatience but luck favored her bostil was not in evidence and farlane for once could spare no more time than it took to saddle sage king lucy rode out into the sage pretty sure that no one watched her  she had hidden the packs near the tallest bunch of greasewood along the trail and when she halted behind it she had no fear of being seen from the corrals she got the packs the light one was not hard to tie back of the saddle but the large one was a very different matter she decided to carry it in front there was a goodsized rock near upon which she stepped leading sage king alongside and after an exceedingly trying moment she got up holding the pack for a wonder sage king behaved well  then she started off holding the pack across her lap and she tried the kings several gaits to see which one would lend itself more comfortably to the task before her the trouble was that sage king had no slow gait even his walk was fast and lucy was compelled to hold him into that she wanted to hurry but that seemed out of the question she tried to keep from gazing out toward the monuments because they were so far away  how would she find the crippled rider it flashed into her mind that she might find him dead and this seemed horrible but her common sense persuaded her that she would find him alive and better the pack was hard to hold and sage king fretted at the monotonous walk the hours dragged the sun grew hot and it was noon almost when she reached the point where she cut off the trail to the left thereafter with the monuments standing ever higher and the distance perceptibly lessening the minutes passed less tediously  at length she reached the zone of lofty rocks and found them different how she could not tell she rode down among them and was glad when she saw the huge mittensher landmarks at last she espied the greenbordered wash and the few cedartrees then a horse blazed red against the sage and another shone black that sight made lucy thrill she rode on eager now but moved by the strangeness of the experience  before she got quite close to the cedars she saw a man he took a few slow steps out of the shade his back was bent lucy recognized the rider and in her gladness to see him on his feet she cried out then when sage king reached the spot lucy rolled the pack off to the ground  oh that was a job she cried  the rider looked up with eyes that seemed keener less staring than she remembered you came  i was afraid you wouldnt he said  sure i came youre betternot badly hurt she said gravely iim so glad  ive got a crimp in my back thats all  lucy was quick to see that after the first glance at her he was all eyes for sage king she laughed how like a rider she watched him knowing that presently he would realize what a horse she was riding she slipped off and threw the bridle and then swiftly untying the second pack she laid it down  the rider with slow painful steps and bent back approached sage king and put a lean strong brown hand on him and touched him as if he wished to feel if he were real then he whistled softly when he turned to lucy his eyes shone with a beautiful light  its sage king bostils favorite said lucy  sage king  he looks it but never a wild horse  no  a fine horse replied the rider of course he can run this last held a note of a riders jealousy  lucy laughed run  the king is bostils favorite he can run away from any horse in the uplands  ill bet you wildfire can beat him replied the rider with a dark glance  come on cried lucy daringly  then the rider and girl looked more earnestly at each other he smiled in a way that changed his facebrightened out the set hardness  i reckon ill have to crawl he said ruefully but maybe i can ride in a few daysif youll come back again  his remark brought to lucy the idea that of course she would hardly see this rider again after today even if he went to the ford which event was unlikely he would not remain there long the sensation of blankness puzzled her and she felt an unfamiliar confusion  iive brought yousome things she said pointing to the larger pack  grub you mean  no  that was all i asked you for miss he said somewhat stiffly  yes butii thought lucy became unaccountably embarrassed suppose this strange rider would be offended your clothes wereso torn and no wonder you were thrownin those boots  so i thought id  you thought i needed clothes as bad as grub he said bitterly i reckon thats so  his look more than his tone cut lucy and involuntarily she touched his arm oh you wont refuse to take them please dont  at her touch a warmth came into his face take them i should smile i will  he tried to reach down to lift the pack but as it was obviously painful for him to bend lucy intercepted him  but youve had no breakfast she protested why not eat before you open that pack  nope im not hungry maybe ill eat a little after i dress up he started to walk away then turned miss bostil have you been so good to every wanderin rider you happened to run across  good she exclaimed flushing she dropped her eyes before his nonsense  anyway youre the first wandering rider i ever metlike this  well youre good he replied with emotion then he walked away with slow stiff steps and disappeared behind the willows in the little hollow  lucy uncoiled the rope on her saddle and haltered sage king on the best grass near at hand then she opened the pack of supplies thinking the while that she must not tarry here long  but on the king i can run back like the wind she mused  the pack contained dried fruits and meat and staples also an assortment of good things to eat that were of a perishable nature already much the worse for the long ride she spread all this out in the shade of a cedar the utensils were fewtwo cups two pans and a tiny pot she gathered wood and arranged it for a fire so that the rider could start as soon as he came back he seemed long in coming lucy waited yet still he did not return finally she thought of the red stallion and started off down the wash to take a look at him he was grazing he had lost some of the dirt and dust and the bedraggled appearance when he caught sight of her he lifted his head high and whistled how wild he looked and his whistle was shrill clear strong both the other horses answered it lucy went on closer to wildfire she was fascinated now  if he doesnt know me she cried never had she been so pleased she had expected every sign of savageness on his part and certainly had not intended to go near him but wildfire did not show fear or hate in his recognition lucy went directly to him and got a hand on him wildfire reared a little and shook a little but this disappeared presently under her touch he held his head very high and watched her with wonderful eyes gradually she drew his head down standing before him she carefully and slowly changed the set of the hackamore which had made a welt on his nose it seemed to have been her good fortune that every significant move she had made around this stallion had been to mitigate his pain lucy believed he knew this as well as she knew it her theory an often disputed one was that horses were as intelligent as human beings and had just the same fears likes and dislikes lucy knew she was safe when she untied the lasso from the strong root where she had fastened it and led the stallion down the wash to a pool of water and she stood beside him with a hand on his shoulder while he bent his head to sniff at the water he tasted it plainly with disgust it was stagnant water full of vermin but finally he drank lucy led him up the wash to another likely place and tied him securely  when she got back to the camp in the cedars the rider was there on his knees kindling the fire his cleanshaved face and new apparel made him vastly different he was young and had he not been so gaunt he would have been finelooking lucy thought  wildfire remembered me lucy burst out he wasnt a bit scary let me handle him followed me to water  hes taken to you replied the rider seriously ive heard of the like but not so quick was he in a bad fix when you got to him yesterday  lucy explained briefly  aha  if that red devil has any love in him ill never get it i wish i could have done so much for him but always when he sees me hell remember  lucy saw that the rider was in difficulties he could not bend his back and evidently it pained him to try his brow was moist  let me do that she said  thanks it took about all my strength to get into this new outfit he said relinquishing his place to lucy  when she looked up from her task presently he was sitting in the shade of the cedar watching her he had the expression of a man who hardly believed what he saw  did you have any trouble gettin away without tellinabout me he asked  no but i sure had a job with those packs she replied  you must be a wonder with a horse  as far as vanity was concerned lucy had only one weaknessand he had touched upon it  well dad and holley and farlane argue much about me still i guess they all agree i can ride  holley an farlane are riders he questioned  yes dads righthand men  your dad hires many riders i supposed  sure i never heard of him turning any rider down at least not without a try  i wonder if he would give me a job  lucy glanced up quickly the idea surprised herpleased her in a minute she replied and hed be grand to you you see hed have an eye for wildfire  the rider nodded his head as if he understood how that would be  and of course youd never sell nor trade wildfire went on lucy  the riders smile was sad but it was conclusive  then youd better stay away from bostil returned lucy shortly  he remained silent and lucy busy about the campfire did not speak again till the simple fare was ready then she spread a tarpaulin in the shade  im pretty hungry myself she said but i dont suppose i know what hunger is  after a while a fellow loses the feelin of hunger he replied i reckon itll come back quick this all looks good  so they began to eat lucys excitement her sense of the unreality of this adventure in no wise impaired her appetite she seemed acutely sensitive to the perceptions of the moment the shade of the cedars was cool and out on the desert she could see the dark smoky veils of heat lifting the breeze carried a dry odor of sand and grass she heard bees humming by and all around the great isolated monuments stood up red tops against the blue sky it was a silent dreaming impressive place where she felt unlike herself  i mustnt stay long she said suddenly remembering  will you come backagain he asked  the question startled lucy whyii dont know wont you ride in to the ford just as soon as youre able  i reckon not  but its the only place where theres people in hundreds of miles surely you wont try to go back the way you came  when wildfire left that country i left it we cant back  then youve no peopleno one you care for she asked in sweet seriousness  theres no one im an orphan my people were lost in an indian massacrewith a wagontrain crossin wyomin a few escaped an i was one of the youngsters i had a tough time like a stray dog till i grew up an then i took to the desert  oh i see iim sorry replied lucy but thats not very different from my dads story of his early years what will you do now  ill stay here till my back straightens out will you ride out again  yes replied lucy without looking at him and she wondered if it were really she who was speaking  then he asked her about the ford and bostil and the ranches and villages north and the riders and horses lucy told him everything she knew and could think of and lastly after waxing eloquent on the horses of the uplands particularly bostils she gave him a graphic account of cordts and dick sears  horsethieves exclaimed the rider darkly there was a grimness as well as fear in his tone ive heard of sears but not cordts where does this band hang out  no one knows holley says they hide up in the canyon country none of the riders have ever tried to track them far it would be useless holley says there are plateaus of rich grass and great forests the ute indians say that much too but we know little about the wild country  arent there any hunters at bostils ford  wildhorse hunters you mean  no bear an deer hunters  theres none and i suppose thats why were not familiar with the wild canyon country id like to ride in there sometime and camp but our people dont go in for that they love the open ranges no one i know except a halfwitted boy ever rode down among these monuments and how wonderful a place it cant be more than twenty miles from home i must be going soon im forgetting sage king did i tell you i was training him for the races  no you didnt what races tell me he replied with keen interest  then lucy told him about the great passion of her fatherabout the long timehonored custom of freeforall races and the great races that had been run in the past about the creeches and their swift horses about the rivalry and speculation and betting and lastly about the races to be run in a few weeksraces so wonderful in prospect that even the horsethief cordts had begged to be allowed to attend  im going to see the king beat creechs roan shouted the rider with red in his cheeks and a flash in his eye  his enthusiasm warmed lucys interest yet it made her thoughtful ideas flashed into her mind if the rider attended the races he would have that fleet stallion with him he could not be separated from the horse that had cost him so dearly what would bostil and holley and farlane say at sight of wildfire suppose wildfire was to enter the races it was probable that he could run away from the whole fieldeven beat the king lucy thrilled and thrilled what a surprise it would be she had the riders true love of seeing the unheralded horse win over the favorite she had for years wanted to see a horseand ride a horseout in front of sage king then suddenly all these flashing ideas coruscated seemingly into a gleama leaping radiant wonderful thought irresistibly it burst from her  let me ride your wildfire in the great race she cried breathlessly  his response was instantaneousa smile that was keen and sweet and strong and a proffered hand impulsively lucy clasped that hand with both hers  you dont mean it she said oh its what auntie would call one of my wild dreams  and im growing upthey say but oh if i could ride wildfire against the field in that race if i only could  she was on fire with the hope flushing tingling she was unconscious of her effect upon the rider who gazed at her with a newborn light in his eyes  you can ride him i reckon id like to see that race just as much as bostil or cordts or any man an see here girl wildfire can beat this gray racer of your fathers  oh cried lucy  wildfire can beat the king repeated the rider intensely the tame horse doesnt step on this earth that can run with wildfire hes a stallion he has been a killer of horses its in him to kill if he ran a race it would be that instinct in him  how can we plan it went on lucy impulsively she had forgotten to withdraw her hands from his it must be a surprisea complete surprise if you came to the ford we couldnt keep it secret and dad or farlane would prevent me somehow  its easy ride out here as often as you can bring a light saddle an let me put you up on wildfire youll run him train him get him in shape then the day of the races or the night before ill go in an hide out in the sage till you come or send for wildfire  oh itll be glorious she cried with eyes like stars i know just where to have you hide a pile of rocks near the racecourse theres a spring and good grass i could ride out to you just before the big race and wed come back with me on wildfire the crowd always stays down at the end of the racecourse only the starters stay out there oh i can see bostil when that red stallion runs into sight  well is it settled queried the rider strangely  lucy was startled into selfconsciousness by his tone  how strangely he must have felt and his eyes were piercing  you meanthat i ride wildfire she replied shyly yes if youll let me  ill be proud  youre very good and do you think wildfire can beat the king  i know it  how do you  ive seen both horses  but it will be a grand race  i reckon so its likely to be the grandest ever seen but wildfire will win because hes run wild all his lifean run to kill other horses the only question iscan you ride him  yes i never saw the horse i couldnt ride bostil says there are some i cant ride farlane says not only two horses have thrown me the king and sarchedon but that was before they knew me and i was sort of wild i can make your wildfire love me  thats the last part of it id ever doubt replied the rider its settled then ill camp here ill be well in a few days then ill take wildfire in hand you will ride out whenever you have a chance without bein seen an the two of us will train the stallion to upset that race  yesthenits settled  lucys gaze was impelled and held by the riders why was he so pale but then he had been injuredweakened this compact between them had somehow changed their relation she seemed to have known him long  whats your name she asked  lin slone replied the rider  then she released her hands i must ride in now if this isnt a dream ill come back soon she led sage king to a rock and mounted him  its good to see you up there said slone an that splendid horse  he knows what he is itll break bostils heart to see that horse beat  dadll feel bad but itll do him good replied lucy  that was the old riders ruthless spirit speaking out of his daughters lips  slone went close to the king and putting a hand on the pommel he looked up at lucy maybeit isa dreaman you wont come back he said with unsteady voice  then ill come in dreams she flashed be careful of yourself goodby  and at a touch the impatient king was off from far up the slope near a monument lucy looked back slone was watching her she waved a gauntleted handand then looked back no more    chapter x  two weeks slipped by on the wings of time and opportunity and achievement all colored so wonderfully for lucy all spelling that adventure for which she had yearned  lucy was riding down into the sage toward the monuments with a whole day before her bostil kept more and more to himself a circumstance that worried her though she thought little about it van had taken up the training of the king and lucy had deliberately quarreled with him so that she would be free to ride where she listed farlane nagged her occasionally about her rides into the sage insisting that she must not go so far and stay so long and after vans return to work he made her ride sarchedon  things had happened at the ford which would have concerned lucy greatly had she not been overexcited about her own affairs some one had ambushed bostil in the cottonwoods near his house and had shot at him narrowly missing him bostil had sworn he recognized the shot as having come from a rifle and that he knew to whom it belonged the riders did not believe this and said some boy shooting at a rabbit or coyote had been afraid to confess he had nearly hit bostil the riders all said bostil was not wholly himself of late the river was still low the boat had not been repaired and creechs horses were still on the other side  these things concerned lucy yet they only came and went swiftly through her mind she was obsessed by things intimately concerning herself  oh i oughtnt to go she said aloud but she did not even check sarchedons long swing his rockingchair lope she had said a hundred times that she ought not go again out to the monuments for lin slone had fallen despairingly terribly in love with her  it was not this she averred but the monuments and the beautiful wildfire that had woven a spell round her she could not break she had ridden wildfire all through that strange region of monuments and now they claimed something of her just as wonderful was wildfires love for her the great stallion hated slone and loved lucy of all the remarkable circumstances she had seen or heard about a horse this fact was the most striking she could do anything with him all that savageness and wildness disappeared when she approached him he came at her call he whistled at sight of her he sent out a ringing blast of disapproval when she rode away every day he tried to bite or kick slone but he was meek under lucys touch  but this morning there came to lucy the first vague doubt of herself once entering her mind that doubt became clear and then she vowed she liked slone as she might a brother and something within her accused her own conviction the conviction was her real self and the accusation was some other girl lately born in her lucy did not like this new person she was afraid of her she would not think of her unless she had to  i never cared for himthat way she said aloud i donti couldnteveriilove lin slone  the spoken thoughtthe sound of the words played havoc with lucys selfconscious calmness she burned she trembled she was in a rage with herself she spurred sarchedon into a run and tore through the sage down into the valley running him harder than she should have run him then she checked him and penitent petted him out of all proportion to her thoughtlessness the violent exercise only heated her blood and if anything increased this sudden and new torment why had she discarded her boys rider outfit and chaps for a ridinghabit made by her aunt and one she had scorned to wear some awful accusing voice thundered in lucys burning ears that she had done this because she was ashamed to face lin slone any more in that costumeshe wanted to appear different in his eyes to look like a girl if that shameful suspicion was a fact why was itwhat did it mean she could not tell yet she was afraid of the truth  all of a sudden lin slone stood out clearer in her mental visionthe finest type of a rider she had ever knowna strong lithe magnificent horseman whose gentleness showed his love for horses whose roughness showed his powera strange intense lonely man in whom she had brought out pride gratitude kindness passion and despair she felt her heart swell at the realization that she had changed him made him kinder made him divide his love as did her father made him human hopeful longing for a future unfettered by the toils of desert allurement she could not control her pride she must like him very much she confessed that honestly without a qualm it was only bewildering moments of strange agitation and uncertainty that bothered her she had refused to be concerned by them until they had finally impinged upon her peace of mind then they accused her now she accused herself she ought not go to meet lin slone any more  but thenthe race she murmured i couldnt give that up and oh im afraid the harm is done what can i do  after the racewhat then to be sure all of bostils ford would know she had been meeting slone out in the sage training his horse what would people say  dad will simply be radiant if he can buy wildfireand a fiend if he cant she muttered  lucy saw that her own impulsiveness had amounted to daring she had gone too far she excused thatfor she had a riders bloodshe was bostils girl but she had in her wildness and joy and spirit spent many hours alone with a rider to his undoing she could not excuse that she was ashamed what would he say when she told him she could see him no more the thought made her weak he would accept and go his wayback to that lonely desert with only a horse  wildfire doesnt love him she said  and the scarlet fired her neck and cheek and temple that leap of blood seemed to release a riot of emotions what had been a torment became a torture she turned sarchedon homeward but scarcely had faced that way when she wheeled him again she rode slowly and she rode swiftly the former was hateful because it held her backfrom what she no longer dared think the latter was fearful because it hurried her on swiftly irresistibly to her fate  lin slone had changed his camp and had chosen a pass high up where the great walls had began to break into sections here there was intimacy with the sheer cliffs of red and yellow wide avenues between the walls opened on all points of the compass and that one to the north appeared to be a gateway down into the valley of monuments the monuments trooped down into the valley to spread out and grow isolated in the distance slones camp was in a clump of cedars surrounding a spring there was grass and white sage where rabbits darted in and out  lucy did not approach this camp from that roundabout trail which she had made upon the first occasion of her visiting slone he had found an opening in the wall and by riding this way into the pass lucy cut off miles in fact the camp was not over fifteen miles from bostils ford it was so close that lucy was worried lest some horsetracker should stumble on the trail and follow her up into the pass  this morning she espied slone at his outlook on a high rock that had fallen from the great walls she always looked to see if he was there and she always saw him the days she had not come which were few he had spent watching for her there his tasks were not many and he said he had nothing to do but wait for her lucy had a persistent and remorseful yet sweet memory of slone at his lonely lookout here was a fine strong splendid young man who had nothing to do but watch for hera waste of precious hours  she waved her hand from afar and he waved in reply then as she reached the cedared part of the pass slone was no longer visible she put sarchedon to a run up the hard windswept sand and reached the camp before slone had climbed down from his perch  lucy dismounted reluctantly what would he say about the ridinghabit that she wore she felt very curious to learn and shyer than ever before and altogether different the skirt made her more of a girl it seemed  hello lin she called there was nothing in her usual greeting to betray the state of her mind  good morninlucy he replied very slowly he was looking at her she thought with different eyes and he seemed changed too though he had long been well and his tall lithe riders form his lean strong face and his dark eyes were admirable in her sight only this morning all because she had worn a girls ridingskirt instead of boys chaps everything seemed different perhaps her aunt had been right after all and now things were natural  slone gazed so long at her that lucy could not keep silent she laughed  how do you likemein this  i like you much better slone said bluntly  auntie made thisand shes been trying to get me to ride in it  it changes you lucy but can you ride as well  im afraid not whats wildfire going to think of me  hell like you better too lucy hows the king comin on  lin ill tell you if i wasnt as crazy about wildfire as you are id say hell have to kill himself to beat the king replied lucy with gravity  sometimes i doubt too said slone but i only have to look at wildfire to get back my nerve lucy that will be the grandest race ever run  yes sighed lucy  whats wrong dont you want wildfire to win  yes and no but im going to beat the king anyway bring on your wildfire  lucy unsaddled sarchedon and turned him loose to graze while slone went out after wildfire and presently it appeared that lucy might have some little time to wait wildfire had lately been trusted to hobbles which fact made it likely that he had strayed  lucy gazed about her at the great looming red walls and out through the avenues to the gray desert beyond this adventure of hers would soon have an end for the day of the races was not far distant and after that it was obvious she would not have occasion to meet slone to think of never coming to the pass again gave lucy a pang unconsciously she meant that she would never ride up here again because slone would not be here a wind always blew through the pass and that was why the sand was so clean and hard today it was a pleasant wind not hot nor laden with dust and somehow musical in the cedars the blue smoke from slones fire curled away and floated out of sight it was lonely with the haunting presence of the broken walls ever manifest but the loneliness seemed full of content she no longer wondered at slones desert life that might be well for a young man during those years when adventure and daring called him but she doubted that it would be well for all of a mans life and only a little of it ought to be known by a woman she saw how the wildness and loneliness and brooding of such a life would prevent a womans development yet she loved it all and wanted to live near it so that when the need pressed her she could ride out into the great open stretches and see the dark monuments grow nearer and nearer till she was under them in the silent and colored shadows  slone returned presently with wildfire the stallion shone like a flame in the sunlight his fear and hatred of slone showed in the way he obeyed slone had mastered him and must always keep the upper hand of him it had from the first been a fight between man and beast and lucy believed it would always be so  but wildfire was a different horse when he saw lucy day by day evidently slone loved him more and tried harder to win a little of what wildfire showed at sight of lucy still slone was proud of lucys control over the stallion he was just as much heart and soul bent on winning the great race as lucy was she had ridden wildfire bareback at first and then they had broken him to the saddle  it was serious business that training of wildfire and slone had peculiar ideas regarding it lucy rode him up and down the pass until he was warm then slone got on sarchedon wildfire always snorted and showed fight at sight of sage king or nagger and the stallion sarchedon infuriated him because sarchedon showed fight too slone started out ahead of lucy and then they raced down the long pass the course was hardpacked sand fast as sarchedon was and matchless as a horseman as was slone the race was over almost as soon as it began wildfire ran indeed like fire before the wind he wanted to run and the other horse made him fierce like a burr lucy stuck low over his neck a part of the horse and so light he would not have known he was carrying her but for the repeated calls in his ears lucy never spurred him she absolutely refused to use spurs on him this day she ran away from slone and turning at the end of the twomile course they had marked out she loped wildfire back slone turned with her and they were soon in camp lucy did not jump off she was in a transport every race kindled a mounting fire in her she was scarlet of face out of breath her hair flying and she lay on wildfires neck and hugged him and caressed him and talked to him in low tones of love  slone dismounted and got sarchedon out of the way then crossed to where lucy still fondled wildfire he paused a moment to look at her but when she saw him he started again and came close up to her as she sat the saddle  you went past me like a bullet he said  oh cant he run murmured lucy  could he beat the king today  slone had asked that question every day more than once  yes he couldtoday i know it replied lucy ohi get soso excited ii make a fool of myselfover him but to ride himgoing like thatlin its just glorious  you sure can ride him replied slone i cant see a fault anywherein himor in your handling him he never breaks he goes hard but he saves something he gets madfierceall the time yet he wants to go your way lucy i never saw the like of it somehow you an wildfire make a combination you cant be beat  do i ride himwell she asked softly  i could never ride him so well  oh linyou just want to please me why van couldnt ride with you  i dont care lucy replied slone stoutly you rode this horse perfect ive found fault with you on the king on your mustangs an on this black horse sarch but on wildfire you grow there  what will dad say and farlane and holley and van oh ill crow over van said lucy im crazy to ride wildfire out before all the indians and ranchers and riders before the races just to show him off to make them stare  no lucy the best plan is to surprise them all enter your horse for the race but dont show up till all the riders are at the start  yes thatll be best and lin only five days morefive days  her words made slone thoughtful and lucy seeing that straightway grew thoughtful too  sureonly five days more repeated slone slowly  his tone convinced lucy that he meant to speak again as he had spoken once before precipitating the only quarrel they had ever had  does any one at bostils ford know you meet me out here he asked suddenly  only auntie i told her the other day she had been watching me she thought things so i told her  what did she say went on slone curiously  she was mad replied lucy she scolded me she said but anyway i coaxed her not to tell on me  i want to know what she said spoke up the rider deliberately  lucy blushed and it was a consciousness of confusion as well as slones tone that made her halfangry  she said when i was found out thered be aa great fuss at the ford there would be talk auntie said im now a grownup girl oh she carried on  bostil would likely shoot you and if he didnt some of the riders would oh lin it was perfectly ridiculous the way auntie talked  i reckon not replied slone im afraid ive done wrong to let you come out here but i never thought im not used to girls illill deserve what i get for lettin you came  its my own business declared lucy spiritedly and i guess theyd better let you alone  slone shook his head mournfully he was getting one of those gloomy spells that lucy hated nevertheless she felt a stir of her pulses  lucy there wont be any doubt about my standwhen i meet bostil said slone some thought had animated him  what do you mean lucy trembled a little  there was a sternness about slone a dignity that seemed new ill ask him toto let you marry me  lucy stared aghast slone appeared in dead earnest  nonsense she exclaimed shortly  i reckon the possibility isthat replied slone bitterly but my motive isnt  it is why youve known me only a few days dad would be mad like as not hed knock you down i tell you lin my dad isis pretty rough and just at this time of the races and if wildfire beats the king  whew  when wildfire beats the king not if corrected slone  dad will be dangerous warned lucy please dontdont ask him that then everybody would know iiyouyou  thats it i want everybody at your home to know  but its a little place flashed lucy every one knows me im the only girl there have beenother fellows who and oh i dont want you made fun of  why he asked  lucy turned away her head without answering something deep within her was softening her anger she must fight to keep angry and that was easy enough she thought if she could only keep in mind slones opposition to her strangely she discovered that it had been sweet to find him always governed by her desire or will  maybe you misunderstand he began presently and his voice was not steady i dont forget im onlya beggarly rider i couldnt have gone into the ford at alli was such a ragamuffin  dont talk like that interrupted lucy impatiently  listen he replied my askin bostil for you doesnt mean ive any hope  its just i want him an everybody to know that i asked  but dadeverybody will think that you think theres reasonwhyiwhy you ought to ask burst out lucy with scarlet face  sure thats it he replied  but theres no reason none not a reason under the sun retorted lucy hotly i found you out here i did you aa little service we planned to race wildfire and i came out to ride him thats all  slones dark steady gaze disconcerted lucy but no one knows me and weve been alone in secret  its not altogetherthat ii told auntie faltered lucy  yes just lately  lin slone ill never forgive you if you ask dad that declared lucy with startling force  i reckon thats not so important  ohso you dont care lucy felt herself indeed in a mood not comprehensible to her her blood raced she wanted to be furious with slone but somehow she could not wholly be so there was something about him that made her feel small and thoughtless and selfish slone had hurt her pride but the thing that she feared and resented and could not understand was the strange gladness slones declaration roused in her she tried to control her temper so she could think two emotions contended within herone of intense annoyance at the thought of embarrassment surely to follow slones action and the other a vague disturbing element all sweet and furious and inexplicable she must try to dissuade him from approaching her father  please dont go to dad she put a hand on slones arm as he stood close up to wildfire  i reckon i will he said  lin in that word there was the subtle nameless charm of an intimacy she had never granted him until that moment he seemed drawn as if by invisible wires he put a shaking hand on hers and crushed her gauntleted fingers and lucy in the current now of her womans need to be placated if not obeyed pressed her small hand to his how strange to what lengths a little submission to her feeling had carried her every spoken word every movement seemed to exact more from her she did not know herself  lin  promise not tospeak to dad  no his voice rang  dont give me awaydont tell my dad  what he queried incredulously  lucy did not understand what but his amazed voice his wideopen eyes of bewilderment seemed to aid her into piercing the maze of her own mind a hundred thoughts whirled together and all around them was wrapped the warm strong feeling of his hand on hers what did she mean that he would tell her father there seemed to be a deep hidden self in her up out of these depths came a whisper like a ray of light and it said to her that there was more hope for lin slone than he had ever had in one of his wildest dreams  lin if you tell dadthen hell knowand there wont be any hope for you cried lucy honestly  if slone caught the significance of her words he did not believe it  im goin to bostil after the race an ask him thats settled declared slone stubbornly  at this lucy utterly lost her temper oh youyou fool she cried  slone drew back suddenly as if struck and a spot of dark blood leaped to his lean face no it seems to me the right way  right or wrong theres no sense in itbecausebecause oh cant you see  i see more than i used to he replied i was a fool over a horse an now im a fool over a girl i wish youd never found me that day  lucy whirled in the saddle and made wildfire jump she quieted him and leaping off threw the bridle to slone i wont ride your horse in the race she declared with sudden passion she felt herself shaking all over  lucy bostil i wish i was as sure of heaven as i am youll be up on wildfire in that race he said  i wont ride your horse  my horse oh i see but youll ride wildfire  i wont  slone suddenly turned white and his eyes flashed dark fire you wont be able to help ridin him any more than i could help it  a lot you know about me lin slone returned lucy with scorn i can be asas bullheaded as you any day  slone evidently controlled his temper though his face remained white he even smiled at her  you are bostils daughter he said  yes  you are blood an bone heart an soul a rider if any girl ever was youre a wonder with a horseas good as any man i ever saw you love wildfire an lookhow strange that wild stallionthat killer of horses why he follows you he whistles for you he runs like lightnin for you he loves you  slone had attacked lucy in her one weak point she felt a force rending her she dared not look at wildfire yesall that was true slone had said how desperately hard to think of forfeiting the great race she knew she could win  never ill never ride your wildfire again she said very low  mine  so thats the trouble well wildfire wont be mine when you ride the race  what do you mean demanded lucy youll sell him to bostil bah you couldnt   sell wildfireafter what it cost me to catch an break him  not for all your fathers lands an horses an money  slones voice rolled out with deep ringing scorn and lucy her temper quelled began to feel the riders strength his mastery of the situation and something vague yet splendid about him that hurt her  slone strode toward her lucy backed against the cedartree and could go no farther how white he was now lucys heart gave a great fearful leap for she imagined slone intended to take her in his arms but he did not  when you ridewildfire in thatrace hell beyours said slone huskily  how can that be questioned lucy in astonishment  i give him to you  yougivewildfireto me gasped lucy  yes right now  the riders white face and dark eyes showed the strain of great and passionate sacrifice  lin slone  i cantunderstand you  youve got to ride wildfire in that race youve got to beat the king so i give wildfire to you an now you cant help but ride him  whywhy do you give himto me faltered lucy  all her pride and temper had vanished and she seemed lost in blankness  because you love wildfire an wildfire loves you if that isnt reason enoughthen  because i love himas no rider ever loved a horse an i love you as no man ever loved a girl  slone had never before spoken words of love to lucy she dropped her head she knew of his infatuation but he had always been shy except once when he had been bold and that had caused a quarrel with a strange pain at her breast lucy wondered why slone had not spoken that way before it made as great a change in her as if she had been born again it released something a bolt shot back in her heart she knew she was quivering like a leaf with no power to control her muscles she knew if she looked up then slone might see the depths of her soul even with her hands shutting out the light she thought the desert around had changed and become all mellow gold and blue and white radiant as the moonlight of dreamsand that the monuments soared above them grandly and were beautiful and noble like the revelations of love and joy to her and suddenly she found herself sitting at the foot of the cedar weeping with tearwet hands over her face  theres nothin toto cry about slone was saying but im sorry if i hurt you  willyoupleasefetch sarch asked lucy tremulously  while slone went for the horse and saddled him lucy composed herself outwardly and she had two very strong desiresone to tell slone something and the other to run she decided she would do both together  slone brought sarchedon lucy put on her gauntlets and mounting the horse she took a moment to arrange her skirts before she looked down at slone he was now pale rather than white and instead of fire in his eyes there was sadness lucy felt the swelling and pounding of her heartand a long delicious shuddering thrill that ran over her  lin i wont take wildfire she said  yes you will you cant refuse remember hes grown to look to you it wouldnt be right by the horse  but hes all you have in the world she protested yet she knew any protestations would be in vain  no i have good old faithful nagger  would you go try to hunt another wild stallionlike wildfire asked lucy curiously she was playing with the wonderful sweet consciousness of her power to render happiness when she chose  no more horsehuntin for me declared slone an as for findin one like wildfirethatd never be  suppose i wont accept him  how could you refuse not for me but for wildfires sake  but if you could be mean an refuse why wildfire can go back to the desert  no exclaimed lucy  i reckon so  lucy paused a moment how dry her tongue seemed and her breathing was labored an unreal shimmering gleam shone on all about her even the red stallion appeared enveloped in a glow and the looming monuments looked down upon her paternal old and wise bright with the color of happiness  wildfire ought to have several more days trainingthen a day of restand then the race said lucy turning again to look at slone  a smile was beginning to change the hardness of his face yes lucy he said  and ill have to ride him  you sure willif hes ever to beat the king  lucys eyes flashed blue she saw the crowdthe curious friendly indiansthe eager ridersthe spirited horsesthe face of her fatherand last the race itself such a race as had never been ran so swift so fierce so wonderful  then lin began lucy with a slowly heaving breast if i accept wildfire will you keep him for meuntil  and if i accept him and tell you why will you promise to say  dont ask me again interrupted slone hastily i will speak to bostil  wait will you  promise not to say a worda single word to metill after the race  a wordto you what about he queried wonderingly something in his eyes made lucy think of the dawn  aboutthebecausewhy imill accept your horse  yes he replied swiftly  lucy settled herself in the saddle and shortening the bridle she got ready to spur sarchedon into a bolt  lin ill accept wildfire because i love you  sarchedon leaped forward lucy did not see slones face nor hear him speak then she was tearing through the sage out past the whistling wildfire with the wind sweet in her face she did not look back    chapter xi  all through may there was an idea dark and sinister growing in bostils mind fiercely at first he had rejected it as utterly unworthy of the man he was but it returned it would not be denied it was fostered by singular and unforeseen circumstances the meetings with creech the strange sneaking actions of young joel creech and especially the gossip of riders about the improvement in creechs swift horsethese things appeared to loom larger and larger and to augment in bostils mind the monstrous idea which he could not shake off so he became brooding and gloomy  it appeared to be an indication of his intense preoccupation of mind that he seemed unaware of lucys long trips down into the sage but bostil had observed them long before holley and other riders had approached him with the information  let her alone he growled to his men i gave her orders to train the king an after van got well mebbe lucy just had a habit of ridin down there she can take care of herself  to himself when alone bostil muttered wonder what the kid has looked up now some mischief ill bet  nevertheless he did not speak to her on the subject deep in his heart he knew he feared his keeneyed daughter and during these days he was glad she was not in evidence at the hours when he could not very well keep entirely to himself bostil was afraid lucy might divine what he had on his mind there was no one else he cared for holley that old hawkeyed rider might see through him but bostil knew holley would be loyal whatever he saw  toward the end of the month when somers returned from horsehunting bostil put him and shugrue to work upon the big flatboat down at the crossing bostil himself went down and he walkeda fact apt to be considered unusual if it had been noticed  put in new planks was his order to the men an pour hot tar in the cracks then when the tar dries shove her in  but ill tell you when  every morning young creech rowed over to see if the boat was ready to take the trip across to bring his fathers horses back the third morning of work on the boat bostil met joel down there joel seemed eager to speak to bostil he certainly was a wildlooking youth  bostil my ole man is losin sleep waitin to git the hosses over he said frankly feeds almost gone  thatll be all right joel replied bostil you see the river aint begun to raise yet howre the hosses comin on  grand sirgrand exclaimed the simple joel peg is runnin faster than last year but blue roan is leavin her a mile dads goin to bet all he has the roan cant lose this year  bostil felt like a bull bayed at by a hound blue roan was a young horse and every season he had grown bigger and faster the king had reached the limit of his speed that was great bostil knew and enough to win over any horse in the uplands providing the luck of the race fell even luck however was a fickle thing  i was advisin dad to swim the hosses over declared joel deliberately  ahuh you was  an why rejoined bostil  joels simplicity and frankness vanished and with them his rationality he looked queer his contrasting eyes shot little malignant gleams he muttered incoherently and moved back toward the skiff making violent gestures and his muttering grew to shouting though still incoherent he got in the boat and started to row back over the river  sure hes got a screw loose observed somers shugrue tapped his grizzled head significantly  bostil made no comment he strode away from his men down to the river shore and finding a seat on a stone he studied the slow eddying red current of the river and he listened if any man knew the strange and remorseless colorado that man was bostil he never made any mistakes in anticipating what the river was going to do  and now he listened as if indeed the sullen low roar the murmuring hollow gurgle the sudden strange splash were spoken words meant for his ears alone the river was low it seemed tired out it was a dirty red in color and it swirled and flowed along lingeringly at times the current was almost imperceptible and then again it moved at varying speed it seemed a petulant waiting yet inevitable stream with some remorseless end before it it had a thousand voices but not the one bostil listened to hear  he plodded gloomily up the trail resting in the quiet dark places of the canyon loath to climb out into the clear light of day and once in the village bostil shook himself as if to cast off an evil everpresent pressing spell  the races were now only a few days off piutes and navajos were camped out on the sage and hourly the number grew as more came in they were building cedar sunshades columns of blue smoke curled up here and there mustangs and ponies grazed everywhere and a line of indians extended along the racecourse where trials were being held the village was full of riders horsetraders and hunters and ranchers work on the ranges had practically stopped for the time being and in another day or so every inhabitant of the country would be in bostils ford  bostil walked into the village grimly conscious that the presence of the indians and riders and horses the action and color and bustle the near approach of the great racedaythese things that in former years had brought him keen delight and speculationhad somehow lost their tang he had changed something was wrong in him but he must go among these visitors and welcome them as of old he who had always been the life of these racingdays must be outwardly the same and the task was all the harder because of the pleasure shown by old friends among the indians and the riders at meeting him bostil knew he had been a cunning horsetrader but he had likewise been a good friend many were the riders and indians who owed much to him so everywhere he was hailed and besieged until finally the old excitement of betting and bantering took hold of him and he forgot his brooding  bracktons place as always was a headquarters for all visitors macomber had just come in full of enthusiasm and pride over the horse he had entered and he had money to wager two navajo chiefs called by white men old horse and silver were there for the first time in years they were ready to gamble horse against horse cal blinn and his riders of durango had arrived likewise colson sticks and burthwait old friends and rivals of bostils  for a while bracktons was merry there was some drinking and much betting it was characteristic of bostil that he would give any odds asked on the king in a race and furthermore he would take any end of wagers on other horses as far as his own horses were concerned he bet shrewdly but in races where his horses did not figure he seemed to find fun in the betting whether or not he won  the fact remained however that there were only two wagers against the king and both were put up by indians macomber was betting on second or third place for his horse in the big race no odds of bostils tempted him  say wheres wetherby rolled out bostil hell back his hoss  wetherbys ridin over tomorrow replied macomber but you gotta bet him two to one  see hyar bostil spoke up old cal blinn you jest wait till i git an eye on the kings runnin mebbe ill go you even money  an as fer me bostil said colson i aint set up yit which hoss ill race  burthwait an old rider came forward to bracktons desk and entered a wager against the field that made all the men gasp  by george pard you aint alimpin along ejaculated bostil admiringly and he put a hand on the others shoulder  bostil ive a grand hoss replied burthwait hes four years old i guess fer he was born wild an you never seen him  wild hoss  huh growled bostil you must think he can run  why bostil a streak of lightnin aint anywheres with him  wal im glad to hear it said bostil gruffly brack how many hosses entered now for the big race  the lean gray brackton bent earnestly over his soiled ledger while the riders and horsemen round him grew silent to listen  thars the sage king by bostil replied brackton blue roan an peg by creech whitefoot by macomber rocks by holley hossshoes by blinn bay charley by burthwait then thars the two mustangs entered by old

and he laughed then thet makes ten hosses entered so far  right an theres sure to be one more i guess the tracks wide enough for twelve  wal brack therell likely be one hoss out in front an some stretched out behind replied bostil dryly the tracks sure wide enough  wont thet be a grand race exclaimed an enthusiastic rider wisht i had about a million to bet  bostil i most forgot went on brackton cordts sent word by the piutes who come today thet hed be here sure  bostils face subtly changed the light seemed to leave it he did not reply to bracktondid not show that he heard the comment on all sides public opinion was against bostils permission to allow cordts and his horsethieves to attend the races bostil appeared grave regretful yet it was known by all that in the strangeness and perversity of his riders nature he wanted cordts to see the king win that race it was his riders vanity and defiance in the teeth of a great horsethief but no good would come of cordtss presencethat much was manifest  there was a moment of silence all these men if they did not fear bostil were sometimes uneasy when near him some who were more reckless than discreet liked to irritate him that too was a riders weakness  whens creechs hosses comin over asked colson with sudden interest  wal i reckonsoon replied bostil constrainedly and he turned away  by the time he got home all the excitement of the past hour had left him and gloom again abided in his mind he avoided his daughter and forgot the fact of her entering a horse in the race he ate supper alone without speaking to his sister then in the dusk he went out to the corrals and called the king to the fence there was love between master and horse bostil talked low like a woman to sage king and the hard old riders heart was full and a lump swelled in his throat for contact with the king reminded him that other men loved other horses  bostil returned to the house and went to his room where he sat thinking in the dark by and by all was quiet then seemingly with a wrench he bestirred himself and did what for him was a strange action removing his boots he put on a pair of moccasins he slipped out of the house he kept to the flagstone of the walk he took to the sage till out of the village and then he sheered round to the river trail with the step and sureness and the eyes of an indian he went down through that pitchblack canyon to the river and the ford  the river seemed absolutely the same as during the day he peered through the dark opaqueness of gloom it moved there the river he knew shadowy mysterious murmuring bostil went down to the edge of the water and sitting there he listened yesthe voices of the stream were the same but after a long time he imagined there was among them an infinitely low voice as if from a great distance he imagined this he doubted he made sure and then all seemed fancy again his mind held only one idea and was riveted round it he strained his hearing so long so intently that at last he knew he had heard what he was longing for then in the gloom he took to the trail and returned home as he had left stealthily like an indian  but bostil did not sleep nor rest  next morning early he rode down to the river somers and shugrue had finished the boat and were waiting other men were there curious and eager joel creech barefooted and ragged with hollow eyes and strange actions paced the sands  the boat was lying bottom up bostil examined the new planking and the seams then he straightened his form  turn her over he ordered shove her in an let her soak up today  the men seemed glad and relieved joel creech heard and he came near to bostil  youllyoull fetch dads hosses over he queried  sure tomorrow replied bostil cheerily  joel smiled and that smile showed what might have been possible for him under kinder conditions of life now bostil im sorry fer what i said blurted joel  shut up go tell your old man  joel ran down to his skiff and leaping in began to row vigorously across bostil watched while the workmen turned the boat over and slid it off the sandbar and tied it securely to the mooring bostil observed that not a man there saw anything unusual about the river but for that matter there was nothing to see the river was the same  that night when all was quiet in and around the village bostil emerged from his house and took to his stealthy stalk down toward the river  the moment he got out into the night oppression left him how interminable the hours had been suspense doubt anxiety fear no longer burdened him the night was dark with only a few stars and the air was cool a soft wind blew across his heated face a neighbors dog baying dismally startled bostil he halted to listen then stole on under the cottonwoods through the sage down the trail into the jetblack canyon yet he found his way as if it had been light in the darkness of his room he had been a slave to his indecision now in the darkness of the looming cliffs he was free resolved immutable  the distance seemed short he passed out of the narrow canyon skirted the gorge over the river and hurried down into the shadowy amphitheater under the looming walls  the boat lay at the mooring one end resting lightly the sandbar with strong nervous clutch bostil felt the knots of the cables then he peered into the opaque gloom of that strange and huge vshaped split between the great canyon walls bostils mind had begun to relax from the single idea was he alone except for the low murmur of the river there was dead silencea silence like no othera silence which seemed held under imprisoning walls yet bostil peered long into the shadows then he looked up the ragged ramparts far above frowned bold and black at a few cold stars and the blue of its sky was without the usual velvety brightness how far it was up to that corrugated rim all of a sudden bostil hated this vast ebony pit  he strode down to the water and sitting upon the stone he had occupied so often he listened he turned his ear upstream then downstream and to the side and again upstream and listened  the river seemed the same  it was slow heavy listless eddying lingering movingthe same apparently as for days past it splashed very softly and murmured low and gurgled faintly it gave forth fitful little swishes and musical tinkles and lapping sounds it was flowing water yet the proof was there of tardiness now it was almost still and then again it moved on it was a river of mystery telling a lie with its low music as bostil listened all those soft watery sounds merged into what seemed a moaning and that moaning held a roar so low as to be only distinguishable to the ear trained by years  nothe river was not the same for the voice of its soft moaning showed to bostil its meaning it called from the far norththe north of great iceclad peaks beginning to glisten under the nearing sun of vast snowfilled canyons dripping and melting of the crystal brooks suddenly colored and roiled and filled bankfull along the mountain meadows of many brooks plunging down and down rolling the rocks to pour their volume into the growing turbid streams on the slopes it was the voice of all that widely separated water spilled suddenly with magical power into the desert river to make it a mighty thundering torrent red and defiled terrible in its increasing onslaught into the canyon deep ponderous but swiftthe colorado in flood  and as bostil heard that voice he trembled what was the thing he meant to do a thousand thoughts assailed him in answer and none were clear a chill passed over him suddenly he felt that the cold stole up from his feet they were both in the water he pulled them out and bending down watched the dim dark line of water it moved up and up inch by inch swiftly the river was on the rise  bostil leaped up he seemed possessed of devils a rippling hot gash of blood fired his every vein and tremor after tremor shook him  by gd i had it rightshes risin he exclaimed hoarsely  he stared in fascinated certainty at the river all about it and pertaining to it had changed the murmur and moan changed to a low sullen roar the music was gone the current chafed at its rockbound confines here was an uneasy tormented driven river the light from the stars shone on dark glancing restless waters uneven and strange and while bostil watched whether it was a short time or long the remorseless destructive nature of the river showed itself  bostil began to pace the sands he thought of those beautiful racehorses across the river  its not too late he muttered i can get the boat over an backyet  he knew that on the morrow the colorado in flood would bar those horses imprison them in a barren canyon shut them in to starve  itd be hellish  bostil you cant do it you aint thet kind of a man bostil poison a waterhole where hosses loved to drink or burn over grass  what would lucy think of you  no bostil youve let spite rule bad hurry now and save them hosses  he strode down to the boat it swung clear now and there was water between it and the shore bostil laid hold of the cables as he did so he thought of creech and a blackness enfolded him he forgot creechs horses something gripped him burned himsome hard and bitter feeling which he thought was hate of creech again the wave of fire ran over him and his huge hands strained on the cables the fiend of that fiendish river had entered his soul he meant ruin to a man he meant more than ruin he meant to destroy what his enemy his rival loved the darkness all about him the gloom and sinister shadow of the canyon the sullen increasing roar of the riverthese lent their influence to the deed encouraged him drove him onward fought and strangled the resistance in his heart as he brooded all the motives for the deed grew like that remorseless river had not his enemys son shot at him from ambush was not his very life at stake a terrible blow must be dealt creech one that would crush him or else lend him manhood enough to come forth with a gun bostil in his torment divined that creech would know who had ruined him they would meet then as bostil had tried more than once to bring about a meeting bostil saw into his soul and it was a gulf like this canyon pit where the dark and sullen river raged he shrank at what he saw but the furies of passion held him fast his hands tore at the cables then he fell to pacing to and fro in the gloom every moment the river changed its voice in an hour flood would be down too late then bostil again remembered the sleek slim racy thoroughbredsblue roan a wild horse he had longed to own and peg a mare that had no equal in the uplands where did bostils hate of a man stand in comparison with love of a horse he began to sweat and the sweat burned him  how soonll creech hear the river an know whats comin muttered bostil darkly and that question showed him how he was lost all this strife of doubt and fear and horror were of no use he meant to doom creechs horses the thing had been unalterable from the inception of the insidious hateful idea it was irresistible he grew strong hard fierce and implacable he found himself he strode back to the cables the knots having dragged in the water were soaking wet and swollen he could not untie them then he cut one strand after another the boat swung out beyond his reach  instinctively bostil reached to pull it back  my god  its goin he whispered what have i done  hebostilwho had made this crossing of the fathers more famous as bostils fordheto cut the boat adrift the thing was inconceivable  the roar of the river rose weird and mournful and incessant with few breaks and these were marked by strange ripping and splashing sounds made as the bulges of water broke on the surface twenty feet out the boat floated turning a little as it drifted it seemed loath to leave it held on the shore eddy hungrily spitefully the little heavy waves lapped it bostil watched it with dilating eyes there the current caught one end and the water rose in a hollow splash over the corner an invisible hand like a mighty giants seemed to swing the boat out it had been dark now it was opaque now shadowy now dim how swift this cursed river was there any way in which bostil could recover his boat the river answered him with hollow deep mockery despair seized upon him and the vague shape of the boat spectral and instinct with meaning passed from bostils strained gaze  so help me god ive done it he groaned hoarsely and he staggered back and sat down mind and heart and soul were suddenly and exquisitely acute to the shame of his act remorse seized upon his vitals he suffered physical agony as if a wolf gnawed him internally  to hell with creech an his hosses but where do i come in as a man he whispered and he sat there arms tight around his knees locked both mentally and physically into inaction  the rising water broke the spell and drove him back the river was creeping no longer it swelled and the roar likewise swelled bostil hurried across the flat to get to the rocky trail before he was cut off and the last few rods he waded in water up to his knees  ill leave no trail there he muttered with a hard laugh it sounded ghastly to him like the laugh of the river  and there at the foot of the rocky trail he halted to watch and listen the old memorable boom came to his ears the flood was coming for twentythree years he had heard the vanguard boom of the colorado in flood but never like this for in the sound he heard the strife and passion of his blood and realized himself a human counterpart of that remorseless river the moments passed and each one saw a swelling of the volume of sound the sullen roar just below him was gradually lost in a distant roar a steady wind now blew through the canyon the great walls seemed to gape wider to prepare for the torrent bostil backed slowly up the trail as foot by foot the water rose the floor of the amphitheater was now a lake of choppy angry waves the willows bent and seethed in the edge of the current beyond ran an uneven bulging mass that resembled some gray heavy moving monster in the gloom bostil could see how the river turned a corner of wall and slanted away from it toward the center where it rose higher black objects that must have been driftwood appeared on this crest they showed an instant then flashed out of sight the boom grew steadier closer louder and the reverberations like low detonations of thunder were less noticeable because all sounds were being swallowed up  a harder breeze puffed into bostils face it brought a tremendous thunder as if all the colossal walls were falling in avalanche bostil knew the crest of the flood had turned the corner above and would soon reach him he watched he listened but sound had ceased his ears seemed ringing and they hurt all his body felt cold and he backed up and up with dead feet  the shadows of the canyon lightened a riverwide froth like a curtain moved down spreading mushroomwise before it a rolling heaving maelstrom bostil ran to escape the great wave that surged into the amphitheater up and up the rocky trail when he turned again he seemed to look down into hell murky depths streaked by pale gleams and black sinister changing forms yawned beneath them he watched with fixed eyes until once more the feeling of filled ears left him and an awful thundering boom assured him of actualities it was only the colorado in flood    chapter xii  bostil slept that night but his sleep was troubled and a strange dreadful roar seemed to run through it like a mournful wind over a dark desert he was awakened early by a voice at his window  he listened there came a rap on the wood  bostil  bostil it was holleys voice  bostil rolled off the bed he had slept without removing any apparel except his boots  wal hawk what dye mean wakin a man at this unholy hour growled bostil  holleys face appeared above the rude sill it was pale and grave with the hawk eyes like glass it aint so awful early he said listen boss  bostil halted in the act of pulling on a boot he looked at his man while he listened the still air outside seemed filled with low boom like thunder at a distance bostil tried to look astounded  hell  its the colorado shes boomin  reckon its hell all rightfor creech replied holley boss why didnt you fetch them hosses over  bostils face darkened he was a bad man to opposeto question at times holley youre sure powerful anxious about creech are you his friend  naw ive little use fer creech replied holley an you know thet but i hold for his hosses as i would any mans  ahuh an whats your kick  nothinexcept you could have fetched them over before the flood come down thats all  the old horsetrader and his righthand rider looked at each other for a moment in silence they understood each other then bostil returned to the task of pulling on wet boots and holley went away  bostil opened his door and stepped outside the eastern ramparts of the desert were bright red with the rising sun with the night behind him and the morning cool and bright and beautiful bostil did not suffer a pang nor feel a regret he walked around under the cottonwoods where the mockingbirds were singing the shrill screeching bray of a burro split the morning stillness and with that the sounds of the awakening village drowned that sullen dreadful boom of the river bostil went in to breakfast  he encountered lucy in the kitchen and he did not avoid her he could tell from her smiling greeting that he seemed to her his old self again lucy wore an apron and she had her sleeves rolled up showing round strong brown arms somehow to bostil she seemed different she had been pretty but now she was more than that she was radiant her blue eyes danced she looked excited she had been telling her aunt something and that worthy woman appeared at once shocked and delighted but bostils entrance had caused a mysterious break in everything that had been going on except the preparation of the morning meal  now i rode in on some confab or other thats sure said bostil goodnaturedly  you sure did dad replied lucy with a bright smile  wal let me sit in the game he rejoined  dad you cant even ante said lucy  jane whats this kid up to asked bostil turning to his sister  the good lord only knows replied aunt jane with a sigh  kid  see here dad im eighteen long ago im grown up i can do as i please go where i like and anything why dad i could getmarried  haw haw laughed bostil jane hear the girl  i hear her bostil sighed aunt jane  wal lucy id just like to see you fetch some fool lovesick rider around when im feelin good said bostil  lucy laughed but there was a roguish daring flash in her eyes dad you do seem to have all the young fellows scared some day maybe one will ride alonga rider like you used to bethat nobody could bluff and he can have me  ahuh  lucy are you in fun  lucy tossed her bright head but did not answer  jane whats got into her asked bostil appealing to his sister  bostil shes in fun of course declared aunt jane still at that theres some sense in what she says come to your breakfast now  bostil took his seat at the table glad that he could once more be amiable with his womenfolk lucy tomorrowll be the biggest day bostils ford ever seen he said  it sure will be dad the biggest surprising day the ford ever had replied lucy  surprisin  yes dad  whos goin to get surprised  everybody  bostil said to himself that he had been used to lucys banter but during his moody spell of days past he had forgotten how to take her or else she was different  brackton tells me youve entered a hoss against the field  its an open race isnt it  open as the desert lucy he replied whats this hoss wildfire youve entered  wouldnt you like to know taunted lucy  if hes as good as his name you might be in at the finish but lucy my dear talkin good sense nowyou aint agoin to go up on some unbroken mustang in this big race  dad im going to ride a horse  but lucy aint it a risk youll be takinall for fun  fun  im in dead earnest  bostil liked the look of her then she had paled a little her eyes blazed she was intense his question had brought out her earnestness and straightway bostil became thoughtful if lucy had been a boy she would have been the greatest rider on the uplands and even girl as she was superbly mounted she would have been dangerous in any race  wal i aint afraid of your handlin of a hoss he said soberly an as long as youre in earnest i wont stop you but lucy no bettin i wont let you gamble  not even with you she coaxed  bostil stared at the girl what had gotten into her whatll you bet he queried with blunt curiosity  dad ill go you a hundred dollars in gold that i finish onetwothree  bostil threw back his head to laugh heartily what a chip of the old block she was child theres some fast hosses thatll be back of the king youd be throwin away money  blue fire shone in his daughters eyes she meant business all right and bostil thrilled with pride in her  dad ill bet you two hundred even that i beat the king she flashed  wal of all the nerve ejaculated bostil no i wont take you up reckon i never before turned down an even bet understand lucy ridin in the race is enough for you  all right dad replied lucy obediently  at that juncture bostil suddenly shoved back his plate and turned his face to the open door dont i hear a runnin hoss  aunt jane stopped the noise she was making and lucy darted to the door then bostil heard the sharp rhythmic hoofbeats he recognized they shortened to clatter and poundthen ceased somewhere out in front of the house  its the king with van up said lucy from the door dad vans jumped offhes coming in  hes running something has happened there are other horses comingridersindians  bostil knew what was coming and prepared himself rapid footsteps sounded without  hello miss lucy wheres bostil  a lean supple rider appeared before the door it was van greatly excited  come in boy said bostil whatre you flustered about  van strode in spurs jangling cap in hand boss theresa sixtyfoot raisein the river van panted  oh cried lucy wheeling toward her father  wal van i reckon i knowed thet replied bostil  mebbe im gettin old but i can still hear listen  lucy tiptoed to the door and turned her head sidewise and slowly bowed it till she stiffened outside were sounds of birds and horses and men but when a lull came it quickly filled with a sullen low boom  highest flood weever seen said van  youve been down queried bostil sharply  not to the river replied van i went as far aswhere the gulch openson the bluff there was a string of navajos goin down an some comin up i stayed there watchin the flood an pretty soon somers come up the trail with blakesley an brack an some riders an somers hollered out the boats gone  gone exclaimed bostil his loud cry showing consternation  oh dad oh van cried lucy with eyes wide and lips parted  sure shes gone an the whole place down therewhere the willows was an the sandbarit was deep under water  what will become of creechs horses asked lucy breathlessly  my god aint it a shame went on bostil and he could have laughed aloud at his hypocrisy he felt lucys blue eyes riveted upon his face  thets what we all was sayin went on van while we was watchin the awful flood an listenin to the deep bumbumbum of rollin rocks some one seen creech an two piutes leadin the hosses up thet trail where the slide was we counted the hossesnine an we saw the roan shine blue in the sunlight  piutes with creech exclaimed bostil the deep gloom in his eyes lighting by all thets lucky mebbe them indians can climb the hosses out of thet hole an find water an grass enough  mebbe replied van doubtfully sure them piutes could if theres a chance but there aint any grass  it wont take much grass travelin by night  so lots of the boys say but the navajos they shook their heads an farlane an holley why they jest held up their hands  with them indians creech has a chance to get his hosses out declared bostil he was sure of his sincerity but he was not certain that his sincerity was not the birth of a strange sudden hope and then he was able to meet the eyes of his daughter that was his supreme test  oh dad why why didnt you hurry creechs horses over said lucy with her tears falling  something tight within bostils breast seemed to ease and lessen why didnt i  wal lucy i reckon i wasnt in no hurry to oblige creech im sorry now  it wont be so terrible if he doesnt lose the horses murmured lucy  wheres young joel creech asked bostil  he stayed on this side last night replied van fact is joels the one who first knew the flood was on some one said he said he slept in the canyon last night anyway hes ravin crazy now an if he doesnt do harm to some one or hisself ill miss my guess  ahuh grunted bostil right you are  dad cant anything be done to help creech now appealed lucy going close to her father  bostil put his arm around her and felt immeasurably relieved to have the golden head press close to his shoulder child we cant fly acrost the river now dont you cry about creechs hosses they aint starved yet its hard luck but mebbe itll turn out so creechll lose only the race an lucy it was a dead sure bet hed have lost thet anyway  bostil fondled his daughter a moment the first time in many a day and then he turned to his rider at the door van hows the king  wild to run bostil jest plumb wild there wont be any hoss with the ghost of a show tomorrow  lucy raised her drooping head is that so van sickle  listen here if you and sage king dont get more wild running tomorrow than you ever had ill never ride again with this retort lucy left the room  van stared at the door and then at bostil whatd i say bostil he asked plaintively im always rilin her  cheer up van you didnt say much lucy is fiery these days shes got a hoss somewhere an shes goin to ride him in the race she offered to bet on himagainst the king it certainly beat me all hollow but see here van ive a hunch theres a dark hoss goin to show up in this race so dont underrate lucy an her mount whatever he is she calls him wildfire ever see him  i sure havent fact is i havent seen lucy for days an days as for the hunch you gave ill say i was figurin lucy for some real race bostil she doesnt make a hoss run hell run jest to please her an lucys lighter n a feather why bostil if she happened to ride out there on blue roan or some other hoss as fast idid jest wilt  bostil uttered a laugh full of pride in his daughter wal she wont show up on blue roan he replied with grim gruffness thets sure as death come on out now i want a look at the king  bostil went into the village all day long he was so busy with a thousand and one things referred to him put on him undertaken by him that he had no time to think back in his mind however there was a burden of which he was vaguely conscious all the time he worked late into the night and slept late the next morning  never in his life had bostil been gloomy or retrospective on the day of a race in the press of matters he had only a word for lucy but that earned a saucy dauntless look he was glad when he was able to join the procession of villagers visitors and indians moving out toward the sage  the racecourse lay at the foot of the slope and now the gray and purple sage was dotted with more horses and indians more moving things and colors than bostil had ever seen there before it was a spectacle that stirred him many fires sent up blue columns of smoke from before the hastily built brush huts where the indians cooked and ate blankets shone bright in the sun burros grazed and brayed horses whistled piercingly across the slope indians lolled before the huts or talked in groups sitting and lounging on their ponies down in the valley here and there were indians racing and others were chasing the wiry mustangs beyond this gay and colorful spectacle stretched the valley merging into the desert marked so strikingly and beautifully by the monuments  bostil was among the last to ride down to the high bench that overlooked the home end of the racecourse he calculated that there were a thousand indians and whites congregated at that point which was the best vantageground to see the finish of a race and the occasion of his arrival for all the gaiety was one of dignity and importance if bostil reveled in anything it was in an hour like this his liberality made this event a great raceday the thoroughbreds were all there blanketed in charge of watchful riders in the center of the brow of this long bench lay a huge flat rock which had been bostils seat in the watching of many a race here were assembled his neighbors and visitors actively interested in the races and also the important indians of both tribes all waiting for him  as bostil dismounted throwing the bridle to a rider he saw a face that suddenly froze the thrilling delight of the moment a tall gaunt man with cavernous black eyes and huge drooping black mustache fronted him and seemed waiting cordts bostil had forgotten instinctively bostil stood on guard for years he had prepared himself for the moment when he would come face to face with this noted horsethief  bostil how are you said cordts he appeared pleasant and certainly grateful for being permitted to come there from his left hand hung a belt containing two heavy guns  hello cordts replied bostil slowly unbending then he met the others proffered hand  ive bet heavy on the king said cordts  for the moment there could have been no other way to bostils good graces and this remark made the gruff old riders hard face relax  wal i was hopin youd back some other hoss so i could take your money replied bostil  cordts held out the belt and guns to bostil i want to enjoy this race he said with a smile that somehow hinted of the years he had packed those guns day and night  cordts i dont want to take your guns replied bostil bluntly ive taken your word an thats enough  thanks bostil all the same as im your guest i wont pack them returned cordts and he hung the belt on the horn of bostils saddle some of my men are with me they were all right till they got outside of bracktons whisky but now i wont answer for them  wal youre square to say thet replied bostil an ill run this race an answer for everybody  bostil recognized hutchinson and dick sears but the others of cordtss gang he did not know they were a hardlooking lot hutchinson was a spare stoopshouldered redfaced squintyeyed rider branded all over with the marks of a bad man and dick sears looked his notoriety he was a little knot of muscle short and bowlegged rough in appearance as cactus he wore a ragged slouchhat pulled low down his face and stubby beard were dustcolored and his eyes seemed sullen watchful he made bostil think of a dusty scaly hard desert rattlesnake bostil eyed this righthand man of cordtss and certainly felt no fear of him though sears had the fame of swift and deadly skill with a gun bostil felt that he was neither afraid nor loath to face sears in gunplay and he gazed at the little horsethief in a manner that no one could mistake sears was not drunk neither was he wholly free from the unsteadiness caused by the bottle assuredly he had no fear of bostil and eyed him insolently bostil turned away to the group of his riders and friends and he asked for his daughter  lucys over there said farlane pointing to a merry crowd  bostil waved a hand to her and lucy evidently mistaking his action came forward leading one of her ponies she wore a gray blouse with a red scarf and a skirt over overalls and boots she looked pale but she was smiling and there was a dark gleam of excitement in her blue eyes she did not have on her sombrero she wore her hair in a braid and had a red band tight above her forehead bostil took her in all at a glance she meant business and she looked dangerous bostil knew once she slipped out of that skirt she could ride with any rider there he saw that she had become the center toward which all eyes shifted it pleased him she was his like her mother and as beautiful and thoroughbred as any rider could wish his daughter  lucy wheres your hoss he asked curiously  never you mind dad ill be there at the finish she replied  reds your color for today then he questioned as he put a big hand on the brightbanded head  she nodded archly  lucy i never thought youd flaunt red in your old dads face red when the color of the king is like the sage out yonder youve gone back on the king  no dad i never was for sage king else i wouldnt wear red today  child you sure mean to run in this racethe big one  sure and certain  wal the only bitter drop in my cup today will be seein you get beat but if you ran second ill give you a present thetll make the purse look sick  even the indian chiefs were smiling old horse the navajo beamed benignly upon this daughter of the friend of the indians silver his brother chieftain nodded as if he understood bostils pride and regret some of the young riders showed their hearts in their eyes farlane tried to look mysterious to pretend he was in lucys confidence  lucy if you are really goin to race ill withdraw my hoss so you can win said wetherby gallantly  bostils sonorous laugh rolled down the slope  miss lucy i sure hate to run a hoss against yours said old cal blinn then colson sticks burthwait the other principals paid laughing compliments to the brighthaired girl  bostil enjoyed this hugely until he caught the strange intensity of regard in the cavernous eyes of cordts that gave him a shock cordts had long wanted this girl as much probably as he wanted sage king there were dark and terrible stories that stained the name of cordts bostil regretted his impulse in granting the horsethief permission to attend the races sight of lucys fair sweet face might inflame this cordtsthis kentuckian who had boasted of his love of horses and women behind cordts hung the little dustcolored sears like a coiled snake ready to strike bostil felt stir in him a longdormant firea stealing along his veins a passion he hated  lucy go back to the women till youre ready to come out on your hoss he said an mind you be careful today  he gave her a meaning glance which she understood perfectly he saw and then he turned to start the days sport  the indian races run in twos and threes and on up to a number that crowded the racecourse the betting and yelling and running the wild and plunging mustangs the heat and dust and pounding of hoofs the excited betting the surprises and defeats and victories the trial tests of the principals jealously keeping off to themselves in the sage the endless moving colorful procession gaudy and swift and thrillingall these bostil loved tremendously  but they were as nothing to what they gradually worked up tothe climaxthe great race  it was afternoon when all was ready for this race and the sage was bright gray in the westering sun everybody was resting waiting the tense quiet of the riders seemed to settle upon the whole assemblage only the thoroughbreds were restless they quivered and stamped and tossed their small fine heads they knew what was going to happen they wanted to run blacks bays and whites were the predominating colors and the horses and mustangs were alike in those points of race and speed and spirit that proclaimed them thoroughbreds  bostil himself took the covering off his favorite sage king was on edge he stood out strikingly in contrast with the other horses his sagegray body was as sleek and shiny as satin he had been trained to the hour he tossed his head as he champed the bit and every moment his muscles rippled under his fine skin proud mettlesome beautiful  sage king was the favorite in the betting the indians who were ardent gamblers plunging heavily on him  bostil saddled the horse and was long at the task  van stood watching he was pale and nervous bostil saw this  van he said its your race  the rider reached a quick hand for bridle and horn and when his foot touched the stirrup sage king was in the air he came down springyquick graceful and then he pranced into line with the other horses  bostil waved his hand then the troop of riders and racers headed for the startingpoint two miles up the valley macomber and blinn with a rider and a navajo were up there as the official starters of the day  bostils eyes glistened he put a friendly hand on cordtss shoulder an action which showed the stress of the moment most of the men crowded around bostil sears and hutchinson hung close to cordts and holley keeping near his employer had keen eyes for other things than horses  suddenly he touched bostil and pointed down the slope theres lucy he said shes ridin out to join the bunch  lucy where id forgotten my girl  where  there repeated holly and he pointed others of the group spoke up having seen lucy riding down  shes on a red hoss said one  pears allfired big to meher hoss said another whos got a glass  bostil had the only fieldglass there and he was using it across the round magnified field of vision moved a giant red horse his mane waving like a flame lucy rode him they were moving from a jumble of broken rocks a mile down the slope she had kept her horse hidden there bostil felt an added stir in his pulsebeat certainly he had never seen a horse like this one but the distance was long the glass not perfect he could not trust his sight suddenly that sight dimmed  holley i cant make out nothin he complained take the glass give me a line on lucys mount  boss i dont need the glass to see that shes up on a hoss replied holley as he took the glass he leveled it adjusted it to his eyes and then looked long bostil grew impatient lucy was rapidly overhauling the troop of racers on her way to the post nothing ever hurried or excited holley  wal cant you see any better n me queried bostil eagerly  come on holl give us a tip before she gits to the post spoke up a rider  cordts showed intense eagerness and all the group were excited lucys advent on an unknown horse that even her father could not disparage was the last and unexpected addition to the suspense they all knew that if the horse was fast lucy would be dangerous  holley at last spoke shes up on a wild stallion hes red like fire hes mighty bigstrong looks as if he didnt want to go near the bunch lord what action  bostil id saya great hoss  there was a moments intense silence in the group round bostil holley was never known to mistake a horse or to be extravagant in judgment or praise  a wild stallion echoed bostil ahuh an she calls him wildfire whered she get him  gimme thet glass  but all bostil could make out was a blur his eyes were wet he realized now that his first sight of lucy on the strange horse had been clear and strong and it was that which had dimmed his eyes  holley you use the glassan tell me what comes off said bostil as he wiped his eyes with his scarf he was relieved to find that his sight was clearing my god if i couldnt see this finish  then everybody watched the close dark mass of horses and riders down the valley and all waited for holley to speak theyre linin up began the rider havin some muss too it pears bostil thet red hoss is raisin hell he wants to fight there hes up in the air boys hes a devila hosskiller like all them wild stallions hes plungin at the kingstrikin there

before the rest know the races on them indian mustangs are behavin scandalous guess the red stallion scared em now theyre all lined up back of the post ah gunsmoke they move it looks like a go  then holley was silent strained in watching so were all the watchers silent bostil saw far down the valley a moving dark line of horses  theyre off theyre off called holley thrillingly  bostil uttered a deep and booming yell which rose above the shouts of the men round him and was heard even in the din of indian cries then as quickly as the yells had risen they ceased  holley stood up on the rock with leveled glass  macs dropped the flag its a sure go now  vans out there frontinside the kings got his stride boss the kings stretchin out  look look see thet red hoss leap  bostil hes runnin down the king i knowed it hes like lightnin hes pushin the king overoff the course see him plunge lord lucy cant pull him she goes updowntossedbut she sticks like a burr good lucy hang on  my gawd bostil the kings thrown hes down  he comes up off the course the others flash by vans out of the race  an bostilan gentlemen there aint anythin more to this race but a red hoss  bostils heart gave a great leap and then seemed to stand still he was half cold half hot  what a horrible sickening disappointment bostil rolled out a cursing query holleys answer was short and sharp the king was out bostil raved he could not see he could not believe after all the weeks of preparation of excitement of suspenseonly this there was no race the king was out the thing did not seem possible a thousand thoughts flitted through bostils mind rage impotent rage possessed him he cursed van he swore he would kill that red stallion and some one shook him hard some ones incisive words cut into his thick throbbing ears luck of the game the king aint beat hes only out  then the riders habit of mind asserted itself and bostil began to recover for the king to fall was hard luck but he had not lost the race anguish and pride battled for mastery over him even if the king were out it was a bostil who would win the great race  he aint beat muttered bostil it aint fair hes run off the track by a wild stallion  his dimmed sight grew clear and sharp and with a gasp he saw the moving dark line take shape as horses a bright horse was in the lead brighter and larger he grew swiftly and more swiftly he came on the bright color changed to red bostil heard holley calling and cordts callingand other voices but he did not distinguish what was said the line of horses began to bob to bunch the race looked close despite what holley had said the indians were beginning to lean forward here and there uttering a short sharp yell everything within bostil grew together in one great throbbing tingling mass his riders eye keen once more caught a gleam of gold above the red and that gold was lucys hair bostil forgot the king  then holley bawled into his ear theyre halfway  the race was beautiful bostil strained his eyes he gloried in what he sawlucy low over the neck of that red stallion he could see plainer now they were coming closer how swiftly what a splendid race but it was too swiftit would not last the indians began to yell drowning the hoarse shouts of the riders out of the tail of his eye bostil saw cordts and sears and hutchinson they were acting like crazy men strange that horsethieves should care the million thrills within bostil coalesced into one great shudder of rapture he grew wet with sweat his stentorian voice took up the call for lucy to win  threequarters bowled holley into bostils ear an lucys give thet wild hoss free rein look bostil you never in your life seen a hoss ran like thet  bostil never had his heart swelled something shook him was that his girlthat tight little gray burr half hidden in the huge stallions flaming mane the distance had been close between lucy and the bunched riders  but it lengthened how it widened that flame of a horse was running away from the others and now they were closecoming into the home stretch a deafening roar from the onlookers engulfed all other sounds a straining stamping armflinging horde surrounded bostil  bostil saw lucys golden hair whipping out from the flamestreaked mane and then he could only see that red brute of a horse wildfire before the wind bostil thought of the leaping prairie flame stormdriven  on came the red stalliononon what a tremendous stride what a marvelous recovery what ease what savage action  he flashed past low pointed long going faster every magnificent stridewinner by a dozen lengths    chapter xiii  wildfire ran on down the valley far beyond the yelling crowd lined along the slope bostil was deaf to the throng he watched the stallion till lucy forced him to stop and turn  then bostil whirled to see where van was with the king most of the crowd surged down to surround the racers and the yells gave way to the buzz of many voices some of the ranchers and riders remained near bostil all apparently talking at once bostil gathered that holleys whitefoot had ran second and the navajos mustang third it was holley himself who verified what bostil had heard the old riders hawk eyes were warm with delight  boss he run second holley kept repeating  bostil had the heart to shake hands with holley and say he was glad when it was on his lips to blurt out there had been no race then bostils nerves tingled at sight of van trotting the king up the course toward the slope bostil watched with searching eyes sage king did not appear to be injured van rode straight up the slope and leaped off he was white and shaking  the kings glossy hide was dirty with dust and bits of cactus and brush he was not even hot there did not appear to be a bruise or mark on him he whinnied and rubbed his face against bostil and then flinching he swept up his head ears high both fear and fire shone in his eyes  wal van get it out of your system said bostil kindly he was a harder loser before a race was run than after he had lost it  thet red hoss run in on the king before the start an scared the race out of him replied van swiftly we had a hunch you know but at thet lucys hoss was a surprise ill say sir thet lucy rode her wild hoss an handled him twice she pulled him off the king he meant to kill the king  ask any of the boys we got started i took the lead sir the king was in the lead i never looked back till i heard lucy scream she couldnt pull wildfire he was rushin the kingmeant to kill him an sage king wanted to fight if i could only have kept him runnin thet would have been a race  but wildfire got in closer an closer he crowded us he bit at the kings flank an shoulder an neck lucy pulled till i yelled shed throw the hoss an kill us both then wildfire jumped for us runnin an strikin with both feet at once bostil thet hosss hell then he hit us an down we went i had a bad spill but the kings not hurt an thets a blessed wonder  no race van it was hard luck take him home said bostil  vans story of the accident vindicated bostils doubts a new horse had appeared on the scene wild and swift and grand but sage king was still unbeaten in a fair race there would come a reckoning bostil grimly muttered who owned this wildfire  holley might as well have read his mind reckon this feller ridin up will take down the prize money remarked holley and he pointed to a man who rode a huge shaggy black horse and was leading lucys pony  ahuh exclaimed bostil a strange rider  an here comes lucy coaxin the stallion back added holley  a wild stallion never clear broke ejaculated cordts  all the men looked and all had some remark of praise for lucy and her mount  bostil gazed with a strange irresistible attraction never had he expected to live to see a wild stallion like this one to say nothing of his daughter mounted on him with the record of having put sage king out of the race  a thousand pairs of eyes watched wildfire he pranced out there beyond the crowd of men and horses he did not want to come closer yet he did not seem to fight his rider lucy hung low over his neck apparently exhausted and she was patting him and caressing him there were horses and indians on each side of the race track and between these lines lucy appeared reluctant to come  bostil strode down and waving and yelling for everybody to move back to the slope he cleared the way and then stood out in front alone  ride up now he called to lucy  it was then bostil discovered that lucy did not wear a spur and she had neither quirt nor whip she turned wildfire and he came prancing on head and mane and tail erect his action was beautiful springy and every few steps as lucy touched him he jumped with marvelous ease and swiftness  bostil became all eyes he did not see his daughter as she paraded the winner before the applauding throng and bostil recorded in his mind that which he would never forgeta wild stallion with unbroken spirit a giant of a horse glistening red with mane like darkstriped windblown flame all muscle all grace all power a neck long and slender and arching to the small savagely beautiful head the jaws open and the thinskinned pinkcolored nostrils that proved the arabian blood the slanting shoulders and the deep broad chest the powerful legs and knees not too high nor too low the symmetrical dark hoofs that rang on the little stonesall these marks so significant of speed and endurance a stallion with a wonderful physical perfection that matched the savage ruthless spirit of the desert killer of horses  lucy waved her hand and the strange rider to whom holley had called attention strode out of the crowd toward wildfire  bostils gaze took in the splendid build of this lithe rider the cleancut face the dark eye this fellow had a shiny coiled lasso in hand he advanced toward wildfire the stallion snorted and plunged if ever bostil saw hate expressed by a horse he saw it then but he seemed to be tractable to the control of the girl bostil swiftly grasped the strange situation lucy had won the love of the savage stallion that always had been the secret of her power and she had hated sage king because he alone had somehow taken a dislike to her horses were as queer as people thought bostil  the rider walked straight up to the trembling wildfire when wildfire plunged and reared up and up the rider leaped for the bridle and with an iron arm pulled the horse down wildfire tried again almost lifting the rider but a stinging cut from the lasso made him come to a stand plainly the rider held the mastery  dad called lucy faintly  bostil went forward close while the rider held wildfire lucy was as wanfaced as a flower by moonlight her eyes were dark with emotions fear predominating then for bostil the half of his heart that was human reasserted itself lucy was only a girl now and weakening her fear her pitiful little smile as if she dared not hope for her fathers approval yet could not help it touched bostil to the quick and he opened his arms lucy slid down into them  lucy girl youve won the kings race an doublecrossed your poor old dad  oh dad i never knewi never dreamed wildfirewould jump the king lucy faltered i couldnt hold him he was terrible it made me sick daddy tell me van wasnt hurtor the king  the hosss all right an sos van replied bostil dont cry lucy it was a fool trick you pulled off but you did it great by gad you sure was ridin thet red devil an say its all right with me  lucy did not faint then but she came near it bostil put her down and led her through the lines of admiring indians and applauding riders and left her with the women  when he turned again he was in time to see the strange rider mount wildfire it was a swift and hazardous mount the stallion being in the air when he came down he tore the turf and sent it flying and when he shot up again he was doubled in a red knot bristling with fiery hair a furious wild beast mad to throw the rider bostil never heard as wild a scream uttered by a horse likewise he had never seen so incomparable a horseman as this stranger indians and riders alike thrilled at a sight which was after their own hearts the rider had hooked his long spurs under the horse and now appeared a part of him he could not be dislodged this was not a bucking mustang but a fierce powerful fighting stallion no doubt thought bostil this fight took place every time the rider mounted his horse it was the sort of thing riders loved most of them would not own a horse that would not pitch bostil presently decided however that in the case of this red stallion no rider in his right senses would care for such a fight simply because of the extraordinary strengths activity and ferocity of the stallion  the riders were all betting the horse would throw the stranger and bostil seeing the gathering might of wildfires momentum agreed with them no horseman could stick on that horse suddenly wildfire tripped in the sage and went sprawling in the dust throwing his rider ahead both man and beast were quick to rise but the rider had a foot in the stirrup before wildfire was under way then the horse plunged ran free came circling back and slowly gave way to the riders control those few moments of frenzied activity had brought out the foam and the sweatwildfire was wet the man pulled him in before bostil and dismounted  sometimes i ride him then sometimes i dont he said with a smile  bostil held out his hand he liked this rider he would have liked the frank face less hard than that of most riders and the fine dark eyes straight and steady even if their possessor had not come with the open sesame to bostils regarda grand wild horse and the nerve to ride him  wal you rode him longer n any of us figgered said bostil heartily shaking the mans hand im bostil glad to meet you  my names slonelin slone replied the rider frankly im a wildhorse hunter an hail from utah  utah howd you ever get over wal youve got a grand hossan you put a grand rider up on him in the race my girl lucy  bostil hesitated his mind was running swiftly back of his thoughts gathered the desire and the determination to get possession of this horse wildfire he had forgotten what he might have said to this stranger under different circumstances he looked keenly into slones face and saw no fear no subterfuge the young man was honest  bostil i chased this wild horse days an weeks an months hundreds of milesacross the canyon an the river  no interrupted bostil blankly  yes ill tell you how later out here somewhere i caught wildfire broke him as much as hell ever be broken he played me out an got away your girl rode alongsaved my horsean saved my life too i was in bad shape for days but i got wellanan then she wanted me to let her run wildfire in the big race i couldnt refuse an it would have been a great race but for the unlucky accident to sage king im sorry sir  slone it jarred me some thet disappointment but its over replied bostil an so thets how lucy found her hoss she sure was mysterious wal wal bostil became aware of others behind him holley shake hands with slone hosswrangler out of utah you too cal blinn an macomberan wetherby meet my friend hereyoung slone an cordts shake hands with a feller thet owns a grand hoss  bostil laughed as he introduced the horsethief to slone the others laughed too even cordts joining in there was much of the old rider daredevil spirit left in bostil and it interested and amused him to see cordts and slone meet assuredly slone had heard of the noted stealer of horses the advantage was certainly on cordtss side for he was goodnatured and pleasant while slone stiffened paling slightly as he faced about to acknowledge the introduction  howdy slone drawled cordts with hand outstretched i sure am glad to meet yuh id like to trade the sage king for this red stallion  a roar of laughter greeted this sally all but bostil and slone joining in the joke was on bostil and he showed it slone did not even smile  howdy cordts he replied im glad to meet youso ill know you when i see you again  wal were all good fellers today interposed bostil an now lets ride home an eat slone you come with me  the group slowly mounted the slope where the horses waited macomber wetherby burthwait blinnall bostils friends proffered their felicitations to the young rider and all were evidently prepossessed with him  the sun was low in the west purple shades were blotting out the gold lights down the valley the day of the great races was almost done indians were still scattered here and there in groups others were turning out the mustangs and the majority were riding and walking with the crowd toward the village  bostil observed that cordts had hurried ahead of the group and now appeared to be saying something emphatic to dick sears and hutchinson bostil heard cordts curse probably he was arraigning the sullen sears cordts had acted first ratehad lived up to his word as bostil thought he would do cordts and hutchinson mounted their horses and rode off somewhat to the left of the scattered crowd but sears remained behind bostil thought this strange and put it down to the surliness of the fellow who had lost on the races bostil wishing sears would get out of his sight resolved never to make another blunder like inviting horsethieves to a race  all the horses except wildfire stood in a bunch back on the bench sears appeared to be fussing with the straps on his saddle and bostil could not keep his glance from wandering back to gloat over wildfires savage grace and striking size  suddenly there came a halt in the conversation of the men a curse in holleys deep voice a violent split in the group bostil wheeled to see sears in a menacing position with two guns leveled low  dont holler he called an dont move  what n the hl now sears demanded bostil  ill bore you if you movethets what replied sears his eyes bold steely with a glint that bostil knew vibrated as he held in sight all points before him a vicious little sandrattlesnake about to strike  holley turn yer back ordered sears  the old rider who stood foremost of the group instantly obeyed with hands up he took no chances here for he alone packed a gun with swift steps sears moved pulled holleys gun flung it aside into the sage  sears it aint a holdup expostulated bostil the act seemed too bold too wild even for dick sears  aint it scoffed sears malignantly bostil i was after the king but i reckon ill git the hoss thet beat him  bostils face turned darkblood color and his neck swelled by gawd sears you aint agoin to steal this boys hoss  shut up hissed the horsethief he pushed a gun close to bostil ive always laid fer you im achin to bore you now i would but fer scarin this hoss if you yap again ill kill you anyhow an take a chance  all the terrible hate and evil and cruelty and deadliness of his kind burned in his eyes and stung in his voice  sears if its my horse you want you neednt kill bostil spoke up slone the contrast of his cool quiet voice eased the terrible strain  lead him round hyar snapped sears  wildfire appeared more shy of the horses back of him than of the men slone was able to lead him however to within several paces of sears then slone dropped the reins he still held a lasso which was loosely coiled and the loop dropped in front of him as he backed away  sears sheathed the lefthand gun keeping the group covered with the other he moved backward reaching for the hanging reins wildfire snorted appeared about to jump but sears got the reins bostil standing like a stone his companions also motionless could not help but admire the daring of this upland horsethief how was he to mount that wild stallion sears was noted for two qualitieshis nerve before men and his skill with horses assuredly he would not risk an ordinary mount wildfire began to suspect searsto look at him instead of the other horses then quick as a cat sears vaulted into the saddle wildfire snorted and lifted his forefeet in a lunge that meant he would bolt  sears in vaulting up had swung the gun aloft he swept it down but waveringly for wildfire had begun to rear  bostil saw how fatal that single instant would have been for sears if he or holley had a gun  something whistled bostil saw the leap of slones lassothe curling snaky dart of the noose which flew up to snap around sears the rope sung taut sears was swept bodily clean from the saddle to hit the ground in sodden impact  almost swifter than bostils sight was the action of sloneflashing byin the airhimself on the plunging horse sears shot once twice then wildfire bolted as his rider whipped the lasso round the horn sears half rising was jerked ten feet an awful shriek was throttled in his throat  a streak of dust on the slopea tearing parting line in the sage  bostil stood amazed the red stallion made short plunges slone reached low for the tripping reins when he straightened up in the saddle wildfire broke wildly into a run  it was characteristic of holley that at this thrilling tragic instant he walked over into the sage to pick up his gun  throwed a gun on me got the drop an pitched mine away muttered holley in disgust the way he spoke meant that he was disgraced  my gawd i was scared thet sears would get the hoss rolled out bostil  holley thought of his gun bostil thought of the splendid horse the thoughts were characteristic of these riders the other men however recovering from a horrorbroken silence burst out in acclaim of slones feat  dick searss finish roped by a boy rider exclaimed cal blinn fervidly  bostil that rider is worthy of his horse said wetherby i think sears would have bored you i saw his finger pressingpressing on the trigger men like sears cant help but pull at that stage  thet was the quickest trick i ever seen declared macomber  they watched wildfire run down the slope out into the valley with a streak of rising dust out behind they all saw when there ceased to be that peculiar rising of dust wildfire appeared to shoot ahead at greater speed then he slowed up the rider turned him and faced back toward the group coming at a stiff gallop soon wildfire breasted the slope and halted snorting shaking before the men the lasso was still trailing out behind limp and sagging there was no weight upon it now  bostil strode slowly ahead he sympathized with the tension that held slone he knew why the riders face was gray why his lips only moved mutely why there was horror in the dark strained eyes why the lean strong hands slowly taking up the lasso now shook like leaves in the wind  there was only dust on the lasso but bostil knewthey all knew that none the less it had dealt a terrible death to the horsethief  somehow bostil could not find words for what he wanted to say he put a hand on the red stallionpatted his shoulder then he gripped slone close and hard he was thinking how he would have gloried in a son like this young wild rider then he again faced his comrades  fellers do you think cordts was in on thet trick he queried  nope cordts was on the square replied holley but he must have seen it comin an left sears to his fate it sure was a fittin last ride for a hossthief  bostil sent holley and farlane on ahead to find cordts and hutchinson with their comrades to tell them the fate of sears and to warn them to leave before the news got to the riders  the sun was setting golden and red over the broken battlements of the canyons to the west the heat of the day blew away on a breeze that bent the tips of the sagebrush a wild song drifted back from the riders to the fore and the procession of indians moved along their gay trappings and bright colors beautiful in the fading sunset light  when bostil and his guests arrived at the corrals holley with farlane and other riders were waiting  boss said holley cordts an his outfit never rid in they was last seen by some navajos headin for the canyon  thets good ejaculated bostil in relief wal boys look after the hosses  slone just turn wildfire over to the boys with instructions an feel safe  farlane scratched his head and looked dubious im wonderin how safe itll be fer us  ill look after him said slone  bostil nodded as if he had expected slone to refuse to let any rider put the stallion away for the night wildfire would not go into the barn and slone led him into one of the highbarred corrals bostil waited talking with his friends until slone returned and then they went toward the house  i reckon we couldnt get inside bracks place now remarked bostil but in a case like this i can scare up a drink lights from the windows shone bright through the darkness under the cottonwoods bostil halted at the door as if suddenly remembering and he whispered huskily lets keep the women from learnin about searstonight anyway  then he led the way through the big door into the huge livingroom there were hanginglights on the walls and blazing sticks on the hearth lucy came running in to meet them it did not escape bostils keen eyes that she was dressed in her best white dress he had never seen her look so sweet and pretty and for that matter so strange the flush the darkness of her eyes the added something in her face tender thoughtful strongthese were new bostil pondered while she welcomed his guests slone who had hung back was last in turn lucy greeted him as she had the others slone met her with awkward constraint the gray had not left his face lucy looked up at him again and differently  whatwhat has happened she asked  it annoyed bostil that slone and all the men suddenly looked blank  why nothin replied slone slowly cept im fagged out  lucy or any other girl could have seen that he was evading the truth she flashed a look from slone to her father  until today we never had a big race that something dreadful didnt happen said lucy this was my daymy race and oh i wanted it to pass withoutwithout  wal lucy dear replied bostil as she faltered nothin came off thetd make you feel bad young slone had a scare about his hoss wildfires safe out there in the corral an hell be guarded like the king an sarch slone needs a drink an somethin to eat same as all of us  lucys color returned and her smile but bostil noted that while she was serving them and brightly responsive to compliments she gave more than one steady glance at slone she was deep thought bostil and it angered him a little that she showed interest in what concerned this strange rider  then they had dinner with twelve at table the wives of bostils three friends had been helping aunt jane prepare the feast and they added to the merriment bostil was not much given to social intercoursehe would have preferred to be with his horses and ridersbut this night he outdid himself as host amazed his sister jane who evidently thought he drank too much and delighted lucy bostils outward appearance and his speech and action never reflected all the workings of his mind no one would ever know the depth of his bitter disappointment at the outcome of the race with creechs blue roan out of the way another horse swifter and more dangerous had come along to spoil the kings chance bostil felt a subtly increasing covetousness in regard to wildfire and this colored all his talk and action the upland country vast and rangy was for bostil too small to hold sage king and wildfire unless they both belonged to him and when old cal blinn gave a ringing toast to lucy hoping to live to see her up on wildfire in the grand race that must be run with the king bostil felt stir in him the birth of a subtle bitter fear at first he mocked it hebostilafraid to race it was a lie of the excited mind he repudiated it insidiously it returned he drowned it downsmothered it with passion then the ghost of it remained hauntingly  after dinner bostil with the men went down to bracktons where slone and the winners of the day received their prizes  why its more money than i ever had in my whole life exclaimed slone gazing incredulously at the gold  bostil was amused and pleased and back of both amusement and pleasure was the old inventive driving passion to gain his own ends  bostil was abnormally generous in many ways monstrously selfish in one way  slone i seen you didnt drink none he said curiously  no i dont like liquor  do you gamble  i like a little beton a race replied slone frankly  wal thet aint gamblin these fool riders of mine will bet on the switchin of a hosss tail he drew slone a little aside from the others who were interested in bracktons delivery of the different prizes slone howd you like to ride for me  slone appeared surprised why i never rode for any one he replied slowly i cant stand to be tied down im a horsehunter you know  bostil eyed the young man wondering what he knew about the difficulties of the job offered it was no news to bostil that he was at once the best and the worst man to ride for in all the uplands  sure i know but thet doesnt make no difference went on bostil persuasively if we got alongwal youd save some of thet yellow coin youre jinglin a roamin rider never builds no corral  thank you bostil replied slone earnestly ill think it over it would seem kind of tame now to go back to wildhorse wranglin after ive caught wildfire ill think it over maybe ill do it if youre sure im good enough with rope an horse  wal by gawd blurted out bostil holley says hed rather you throwed a gun on him than a rope so would i an as for your handlin a hoss i never seen no better  slone appeared embarrassed and kept studying the gold coins in his palm some one touched bostil who turning saw brackton at his elbow the other men were now bantering with the indians  come now while ive got a minnit said brackton taking up a lantern ive somethin to show you  bostil followed brackton and slone came along the old man opened a door into a small room half full of stores and track the lantern only dimly lighted the place  look thar and brackton flashed the light upon a man lying prostrate  bostil recognized the pale face of joel creech brack  whats this is he dead bostil sustained a strange incomprehensible shock sight of a dead man had never before shocked him  nope he aint dead which if he was might be good for this community replied brackton hes only fallen in a fit fust off i reckoned he was drunk but it aint thet  wal what do you want to show him to me for demanded bostil gruffly  i reckoned you oughter see him  an why brackton  brackton set down the lantern and pushing slone outside said jest a minnit son and then he closed the door joels been on my hands since the flood cut him off from home said brackton an hes been some trial but nobody else would have done nothin for him so i had to i reckon i felt sorry for him he cried like a baby thet had lost its mother then he gets wildlookin an raved around when i wasnt busy i kept an eye on him but some of the time i couldnt an he stole drinks which made him wuss an when i seen he was tryin to sneak one of my guns i up an gets suspicious once he said my dads hosses are goin to starve an im goin to kill somebody he was out of his head an dangerous wal i was worried some but all i could do was lock up my guns last night i caught him confabin with some men out in the dark behind the store they all skedaddled except joel but i recognized cordts i didnt like this nuther joel was surly an ugly an when one of the riders called him he said thet boat never drifted off fer the night of the flood i went down there myself an tied the ropes they never come untied somebody cut themjest before the floodto make sure my dads hosses couldnt be crossed somebody figgered the river an the flood an if my dads hosses starve im goin to kill somebody  brackton took up the lantern and placed a hand on the door ready to go out  then a rider punched joeli never seen whoan joel had a fit i dragged him in here an as you see he aint come to yet  wal brackton the boys crazy said bostil  so i reckon an im afeared hell burn us outhes crazy on fires anywayor do somethin like  hes sure a problem wal well see replied bostil soberly  and they went out to find slone waiting then bostil called his guests and with slone also accompanying him went home  bostil threw off the recurring gloom and he was goodnatured when lucy came to his room to say good night he knew she had come to say more than that  hello daughter he said arent you ashamed to come facin your poor old dad  lucy eyed him dubiously no im not ashamed but im still a littleafraid  im harmless child im a broken man when you put sage king out of the race you broke me  dad that isnt funny you make me anangry when you hint i did something underhand  wal you didnt consult me  i thought it would be fun to surprise you all why youre always delighted with a surprise in a race unless it beats you then it was my great and only chance to get out in front of the king oh how grand itd have been dad id have run away from him the same as the others  no you wouldnt declared bostil  dad wildfire can beat the king  never girl knockin a goodtempered hoss off his pins aint beatin him in a runninrace  then father and daughter fought over the old score the one doggedly imperturbably the other spiritedly with flashing eyes it was different this time however for it ended in lucy saying bostil would never risk another race that stung bostil and it cost him an effort to control his temper  let thet go now tell me all about how you saved wildfire an slone too  lucy readily began the narrative and she had scarcely started before bostil found himself intensely interested soon he became absorbed that was the most thrilling and moving kind of romance to him like his riders dreams  lucy youre sure a game kid he said fervidly when she had ended i reckon i dont blame slone for fallin in love with you  who said that inquired lucy  nobody but its trueaint it  she looked up with eyes as true as ever they were yet a little sad he thought a little wistful and wondering as if a strange and grave thing confronted her  yes daditsits true she answered haltingly  wal you didnt need to tell me but im glad you did  bostil meant to ask her then if she in any sense returned the riders love but unaccountably he could not put the question the girl was as true as everas good as gold bostil feared a secret that might hurt him just as sure as life was there and death but a step away some rider sooner or later would win this girls love bostil knew that hated it feared it yet he would never give his girl to a beggarly rider such a man as wetherby ought to win lucys hand and bostil did not want to know too much at present he did not want his swiftmounting animosity roused so soon still he was curious and wanting to get the drift of lucys mind he took to his old habit of teasing  another moonstruck rider he said your eyes are sure full moons lucy id be ashamed to trifle with these poor fellers  dad  youre a heartless flirtsame as your mother was before she met me  im not and i dont believe mother was either replied lucy it was easy to strike fire from her  wal you did dead wrong to ride out there day after day meetin slone becauseyoung womanif he ever has the nerve to ask me for you ill beat him up bad  then youd be a brute retorted lucy  wal mebbe returned bostil secretly delighted and surprised at lucys failure to see through him but she was looking inward he wondered what hid there deep in her but i cant stand for the nerve of thet  hehe means toto ask you  the h ahuh  lucy did not catch the slip of tongue she was flushing now he said hed never have let me meet him out there aloneunlesshehe loved meand as our neighbors and the riders would learn of itand talkhe wanted you and them to know hed asked toto marry me  wal hes a square young man ejaculated bostil involuntarily it was hard for bostil to hide his sincerity and impulsiveness much harder than to hide unworthy attributes then he got back on the other track thatll make me treat him decent so when he rides up to ask for you ill let him off with no  lucy dropped her head bostil would have given all he had except his horses to feel sure she did not care for slone  dadi saidnofor myself she murmured  this time bostil did not withhold the profane word of surprise  so hes asked you then wal wal when  todayout there in the rocks where he waited with wildfire for me hehe  lucy slipped into her fathers arms and her slender form shook bostil instinctively felt what she then needed was her mother her mother was dead and he was only a rough old hard rider he did not know what to doto say his heart softened and he clasped her close it hurt him keenly to realize that he might have been a better kinder father if it were not for the fear that she would find him out but that proved he loved her craved her respect and affection  wal little girl tell me he said  hehe broke his word to me  ahuh thets too bad an how did he  hehe lucy seemed to catch her tongue  bostil was positive she had meant to tell him something and suddenly changed her mind subtly the child vanisheda woman remained lucy sat up selfpossessed once more some powerfully impelling thought had transformed her bostils keen sense gathered that what she would not tell was not hers to reveal for herself she was the soul of simplicity and frankness  days ago i told him i cared for him she went on but i forbade him to speak of it to me he promised i wanted to wait till after the racetill after i had found courage to confess to you he broke his word today when he put me up on wildfire hehe suddenly lost his head  the slow scarlet welled into lucys face and her eyes grew shamed but bravely she kept facing her father  hehe pulled me offhe hugged mehe kkissed me oh it was dreadfulshameful  then i gave him backsomesomething he had given me and i told him ii hated himand i told him no  but you rode his hoss in the race said bostil  lucy bowed her head at that ii couldnt resist  bostil stroked the bright head what a quandary for a thickskulled old horseman wal it seems to me slone didnt act so bad considerin youd told him you cared for him if it wasnt for thet  i remember i did much the same to your mother she raised the devil but i never seen as she cared any less for me  ill never forgive him lucy cried passionately i hate him a man who breaks his word in one thing will do it in another  bostil sadly realized that his little girl had reached womanhood and love and with them the sweet bitter pangs of life he realized also that here was a crisis when a wordan unjust or lying word from him would forever ruin any hope that might still exist for slone bostil realized this acutely but the realization was not even a temptation  wal listen im bound to confess your new rider is sure swift an lucy today if he hadnt been as swift with a rope as he is in lovewal your old daddy might be dead  she grew as white as her dress oh dad i knew something had happened she cried reaching for him  then bostil told her how dick sears had menaced himhow slone had foiled the horsethief he told the story bluntly but eloquently with all a riders praise lucy rose with hands pressed against her breast when had bostil seen eyes like thosedark shining wonderful ah he remembered her mothers onceonly once as a girl  then lucy kissed him and without a word fled from the room  bostil stared after her dn me he swore as he threw a boot against the wall i reckon ill never let her marry slone but i just had to tell her what i think of him    chapter xiv  slone lay wide awake under an open window watching the stars glimmer through the rustling foliage of the cottonwoods somewhere a lonesome hound bayed very faintly came the silvery tinkle of running water  for five days slone had been a guest of bostils and the whole five days had been torment  on the morning of the day after the races lucy had confronted him would he ever forget her eyesher voice bless you for saving my dad she had said it was brave but dont let dad fool you dont believe in his kindness above all dont ride for him he only wants wildfire and if he doesnt get him hell hate you  that speech of lucys had made the succeeding days hard for slone bostil loaded him with gifts and kindnesses and never ceased importuning him to accept his offers but for lucy slone would have accepted it was she who cast the first doubt of bostil into his mind lucy averred that her father was splendid and good in every way except in what pertained to fast horses there he was impossible  the great stallion that slone had nearly sacrificed his life to catch was like a thorn in the riders flesh slone lay there in the darkness restless hot rolling from side to side or staring out at the starstudded skymiserably unhappy all on account of that horse almost he hated him what pride he had felt in wildfire how he had gloried in the gift of the stallion to lucy then on the morning of the race had come that unexpected incomprehensible and wild act of which he had been guilty yet not to save his life his soul could he regret it was it he who had been responsible or an unknown savage within him he had kept his word to lucy when day after day he had burned with love until that fatal moment when the touch of her as he lifted her to wildfires saddle had made a madman out of him he had swept her into his arms and held her breast to his her face before him and he had kissed the sweet parting lips till he was blind  then he had learned what a little fury she was then he learned how he had fallen what he had forfeited in his amaze at himself in his humility and shame he had not been able to say a word in his own defense she did not know yet that his act had been ungovernable and that he had not known what he was doing till too late and she had finished with ill ride wildfire in the racebut i wont have himand i wont have you no  she had the steel and hardness of her father  for slone the watching of that race was a blend of rapture and despair he lived over in mind all the time between the race and this hour when he lay there sleepless and full of remorse his mind was like a racecourse with many races and predominating in it was that swift strange stinging race of his memory of lucy bostils looks and actions  what an utter fool he was to believe she had meant those tender words when out there under the looming monuments she had accepted wildfire she had been an impulsive child her scorn and fury that morning of the race had left nothing for him except footless fancies she had mistaken love of wildfire for love of him no his case was hopeless with lucy and if it had not been so bostil would have made it hopeless yet there were things slone could not fathomthe wilful contradictory proud and cold and unaccountably sweet looks and actions of the girl they haunted slone they made him conscious he had a mind and tortured him with his development but he had no experience with girls to compare with what was happening now it seemed that accepted fact and remembered scorn and cold certainty were somehow at variance with hitherto unknown intuitions and instincts lucy avoided him if by chance she encountered him alone when bostil or aunt jane or any one else was present lucy was kind pleasant agreeable what made her flush red at sight of him and then pale why did she often at table or in the big livingroom softly brush against him when it seemed she could have avoided that many times he had felt some inconceivable drawing power and looked up to find her eyes upon him strange eyes full of mystery that were suddenly averted was there any meaning attachable to the fact that his room was kept so tidy and neat that every day something was added to its comfort or color that he found fresh flowers whenever he returned or a book or fruit or a dainty morsel to eat and once a bunch of indian paintbrush wild flowers of the desert that lucy knew he loved most of all it was lucys eyes which haunted sloneeyes that had changed darkened lost their audacious flash and yet seemed all the sweeter the glances he caught which he fancied were stolenand then derided his fancythrilled him to his heart thus slone had spent waking hours by day and night mad with love and remorse tormented one hour by imagined grounds for hope and resigned to despair the next  upon the sixth morning of his stay at bostils slone rose with something of his former will reasserting itself he could not remain in bostils home any longer unless he accepted bostils offer and this was not to be thought of with a wrench slone threw off the softening indecision and hurried out to find bostil while the determination was hot  bostil was in the corral with wildfire this was the second time slone had found him there wildfire appeared to regard bostil with a much better favor than he did his master as slone noted this a little heat stole along his veins that was gall to a rider  i like your hoss said bostil with gruff frankness but a tinge of red showed under his beard  bostil im sorry i cant take you up on the job rejoined slone swiftly its been hard for me to decide youve been good to me im grateful but its time i was tellin you  why cant you demanded bostil straightening up with a glint in his big eyes it was the first time he had asked slone that  i cant ride for you replied slone briefly  anythin to do with lucy queried bostil  how so returned slone conscious of more heat  wal you was sweet on her an she wouldnt have you replied bostil  slone felt the blood swell and boil in his veins this bostil could say as harsh and hard things as repute gave him credit for  yes i am sweet on lucy an she wont have me said slone steadily i asked her to let me come to you an tell you i wanted to marry her but she wouldnt  wal its just as good you didnt come because i might bostil broke off his speech and began again you dont lack nerve  slone whatd you have to offer lucy  nothin exceptbut that doesnt matter replied slone cut to the quick by bostils scorn im glad you know an so much for that  bostil turned to look at wildfire once more and he looked long when he faced around again he was another man slone felt the powerful driving passion of this old horsetrader  slone ill give you pick of a hundred mustangs an a thousand dollars for wildfire  so he unmasked his power in the face of a beggarly rider though it struck slone like a thunderbolt he felt amused but he did not show that bostil had only one possession among all his uncounted wealth that could win wildfire from his owner  no said slone briefly  ill double it returned bostil just as briefly  no  ill  save your breath bostil flashed slone you dont know me but let me tell youyou cant buy my horse  the great veins swelled and churned in bostils bull neck a thick and ugly contortion worked in his face his eyes reflected a sick rage  slone saw that two passions shook bostilone a bitter terrible disappointment and the other the passion of a man who could not brook being crossed it appeared to slone that the best thing he could do was to get away quickly and to this end he led wildfire out of the corral to the stable courtyard and there quickly saddled him then he went into another corral for his other horse nagger and bringing him out returned to find bostil had followed as far as the court the old mans rage apparently had passed or had been smothered  see here he began in thick voice dont be a d fool an ruin your chance in life ill  bostil my one chance was ruinedan you know who did it replied slone as he gathered naggers rope and wildfires bridle together ive no hard feelins but i cant sell you my horse an i cant ride for youbecausewell because it would breed trouble  an what kind queried bostil  holley and farlane and van with several other riders had come up and were standing openmouthed slone gathered from their manner and expression that anything might happen with bostil in such a mood  wed be racin the king an wildfire wouldnt we replied slone  an supposin we would returned bostil ominously his huge frame vibrated with a slight start  wildfire would run off with your favoritean you wouldnt like that answered slone it was his riders hot blood that prompted him to launch this taunt he could not help it  you wildhoss chaser roared bostil your wildfire may be a bloody killer but he cant beat the king in a race  excuse me bostil but wildfire did beat the king  this was only adding fuel to the fire slone saw holley making signs that must have meant silence would be best but slones blood was up bostil had rubbed him the wrong way  youre a lair declared bostil with a tremendous stride forward slone saw then how dangerous the man really was it was no race your wild hoss knocked the king off the track  sage king had the lead didnt he why didnt he keep it  bostil was like a furious intractable child whose favorite precious treasure had been broken and he burst out into a torrent of incoherent speech apparently reasons why this and that were so slone did not make out what bostil meant and he did not care when bostil got out of breath slone said  were both wastin talk an im not wantin you to call me a liar twice  put your rider up on the king an come on right now ill  slone shut up an chase yourself interrupted holley  you go to hl returned slone coolly  there was a moments silence in which slone took holleys measure the hawkeyed old rider may have been square but he was then thinking only of bostil  what am i up against here demanded slone am i goin to be shot because im takin my own part holley you an the rest of your pards are all afraid of this old devil but im notan you stay out of this  wal son you neednt git riled replied holley placatingly i was only tryin to stave off talk you might be sorry for  sorry for nothin im goin to make this great horsetrader this rich an mighty rancher this judge of grand horses this bostil  im goin to make him race the king or take water then slone turned to bostil that worthy evidently had been stunned by the rider who dared call him to his face come on fetch the king let your own riders judge the race  bostil struggled both to control himself and to speak naw i aint goin to see thet red hosskiller jump the king again  bah youre afraid you know thered be no girl on his back you know he can outrun the king an thats why you want to buy him  slone caught his breath then he realized suddenly at bostils paling face that perhaps he had dared too much yet maybe the truth flung into this hard old riders teeth was what he needed more than anything else slone divined rather than saw that he had done an unprecedented thing  ill go now bostil  slone nodded a goodby to the riders and turning away he led the two horses down the lane toward the house it scarcely needed sight of lucy under the cottonwoods to still his anger and rouse his regret lucy saw him coming and as usual started to avoid meeting him when sight of the horses or something else caused her to come toward him instead  slone halted both wildfire and nagger whinnied at sight of the girl lucy took one flashing glance at them at slone and then she evidently guessed what was amiss  lucy ive done it nowplayed hob sure said slone  what she cried  i called your dadcalled him good an hardan hehe  lin oh dont say dad lucys face whitened and she put a swift hand upon his arma touch that thrilled him lin theres bloodon your face dontdont tell me dad hit you  i should say not declared slone quickly lifting his hand to his face must be from my cut that blood i barked my hand holdin wildfire  oh ii was sick withwith lucy faltered and broke off and then drew back quickly as if suddenly conscious of her actions and words  then slone began to relate everything that had been said and before he concluded his story his heart gave a wild throb at the telltale face and eyes of the girl  you said that to dad she cried in amaze and fear and admiration oh dad richly deserved it but i wish you hadnt oh i wish you hadnt  why asked slone  but she did not answer that where are you going she questioned  come to think of that i dont know replied slone blankly i started back to fetch my things out of my room thats as far as my muddled thoughts got  your things  oh suddenly she grew intensely white the little freckles that had been so indistinct stood out markedly and it was as if she had never had any tan one brown hand went to her breast the other fluttered to his arm again you mean toto go awayfor good  sure what else can i do  lin  oh there comes dad he mustnt see me i must run lin dont leave bostils forddont godont  then she flew round the corner of the house to disappear slone stood there transfixed and thrilling even bostils heavy tread did not break the trance and a meeting would have been unavoidable had not bostil turned down the path that led to the back of the house slone with a start collecting his thoughts hurried into the little room that had been his and gathered up his few belongings he was careful to leave behind the gifts of guns blankets gloves and other riders belongings which bostil had presented to him thus laden he went outside and tingling with emotions utterly sweet and bewildering he led the horses down into the village  slone went down to bracktons and put the horses into a large highfenced pasture adjoining bracktons house slone felt reasonably sure his horses would be safe there but he meant to keep a mighty close watch on them and old brackton as if he read slones mind said this keep your eye on thet daffy boy joel creech he hangs round my place sleeps out somewheres an hes crazy about hosses  slone did not need any warning like that nor any information to make him curious regarding young creech lucy had seen to that and in fact slone was anxious to meet this halfwitted fellow who had so grievously offended and threatened lucy that morning however creech did not put in an appearance the village had nearly returned to its normal state now and the sleepy tenor of its way the indians had been the last to go but now none remained the days were hot while the sun stayed high and only the riders braved its heat  the morning however did not pass without an interesting incident brackton approached slone with an offer that he take charge of the freighting between the ford and durango what would i do with wildfire was slones questioning reply and brackton held up his hands a later incident earned more of slones attention he had observed a man in bracktons store and it chanced that this man heard slones reply to bracktons offer and he said youll sure need to corral thet red stallion grandest hoss i ever seen  that praise won slone and he engaged in conversation with the man who said his name was vorhees it developed soon that vorhees owned a little house a corral and a patch of ground on a likely site up under the bluff and he was anxious to sell cheap because he had a fine opportunity at durango where his people lived what interested slone most was the mans remark that he had a corral which could not be broken into the price he asked was ridiculously low if the property was worth anything an idea flashed across slones mind he went up to vorheess place and was much pleased with everything especially the corral which had been built by a man who feared horsethieves as much as bostil the view from the door of the little cabin was magnificent beyond compare slone remembered lucys last words they rang like bells in his ears dont godont they were enough to chain him to bostils ford until the crack of doom he dared not dream of what they meant he only listened to their music as they pealed over and over in his ears  vorhees are you serious he asked the money you ask is little enough  its enough an to spare replied the man an id take it as a favor of you  well ill go you said slone and he laughed a little irrationally only you neednt tell right away that i bought you out  the deal was consummated leaving slone still with half of the money that had been his prize in the race he felt elated he was rich he owned two horsesone the grandest in all the uplands the other the faithfulestand he owned a neat little cabin where it was a joy to sit and look out and a corral which would let him sleep at night and he had money to put into supplies and furnishings and a garden after he drank out of the spring that bubbled from under the bluff he told himself it alone was worth the money  looks right down on bostils place slone soliloquized with glee wont he just be mad an lucy  whatevers she goin to think  the more slone looked around and thought the more he became convinced that good fortune had knocked at his door at last and when he returned to bracktons he was in an exultant mood the old storekeeper gave him a nudge and pointed underhand to a young man of ragged aspect sitting gloomily on a box slone recognized joel creech the fellow surely made a pathetic sight and slone pitied him he looked needy and hungry  say said slone impulsively want to help me carry some grub an stuff  howdy replied creech raising his head sure do  slone sustained the queerest shock of his life when he met the gaze of those contrasting eyes yet he did not believe that his strange feeling came from sight of differentcolored eyes there was an instinct or portent in that meeting  he purchased a bill of goods from brackton and with creech helping carried it up to the cabin under the bluff three trips were needed to pack up all the supplies and meanwhile creech had but few words to say and these of no moment slone offered him money which he refused  ill help you fix up an eat a bite he said nice up hyar  he seemed rational enough and certainly responded to kindness slone found that vorhees had left the cabin so clean there was little cleaning to do an open fireplace of stone required some repair and there was wood to cut  joel you start a fire while i go down after my horses said slone  young creech nodded and slone left him there it was not easy to catch wildfire nor any easier to get him into the new corral but at last slone saw him safely there and the bars and locks on the gate might have defied any effort to open or break them quickly creech was standing in the doorway watching the horses and somehow slone saw or imagined he saw that creech wore a different aspect  grand wild hoss he did what blue was agoin to dobeat thet there dd bostils king  creech wagged his head he was gloomy and strange his eyes were unpleasant to look into his face changed and he mumbled slone pitied him the more but wished to see the last of him creech stayed on however and grew stranger and more talkative during the meal he repeated things oftentalked disconnectedly and gave other indications that he was not wholly right in his mind yet slone suspected that creechs want of balance consisted only in what concerned horses and the bostils and slone wanting to learn all he could encouraged creech to talk about his father and the racers and the river and boat and finally bostil  slone became convinced that whether young creech was half crazy or not he knew his fathers horses were doomed and that the boat at the ferry had been cut adrift slone could not understand why he was convinced but he was finally creech told how he had gone down to the river only a day before how he had found the flood still raging but much lower how he had worked round the cliffs and had pulled up the rope cables to find they had been cut  you see bostil cut them when he didnt need to continued creech shrewdly but he didnt know the flood was comin down so quick he was afeared wed come across an git the boat thet night an he meant to take away them cut cables but he hadnt no time  bostil queried slone as he gazed hard at creech the fellow had told that rationally enough slone wondered if bostil could have been so base no and yetwhen it came to horses bostil was scarcely human  slones query served to send creech off on another tangent which wound up in dark mysterious threats then slone caught the name of lucy it abruptly killed his sympathy for creech  whats the girl got to do with it he demanded angrily if you want to talk to me dont use her name  ill use her name when i want shouted creech  not to me  yes to you mister i aint carin a dn fer you  you crazy loon exclaimed slone with impatience and disgust added to anger whats the use of being decent to you  creech crouched low his hands digging like claws into the table as if he were making ready to spring at that instant he was hideous  crazy am i he yelled mebbe not dn crazy i kin tell youre gone on lucy bostil i seen you with her out there in the rocks the mornin of the race i seen what you did to her an im agoin to tell it  an im agoin to ketch lucy bostil an strip her naked an when i git through with her ill tie her on a hoss an fire the grass by gawd i am livid and wild he breathed hard as he got up facing slone malignantly  crazy or not here goes muttered slone grimly and leaping up with one blow he knocked creech half out of the door and then kicked him the rest of the way go on and have a fit cried slone im liable to kill you if you dont have one  creech got up and ran down the path turning twice on the way then he disappeared among the trees  slone sat down lost my temper again he said this has been a day guess id better cool off right now an stay here that poor devil maybe hes not so crazy but hes wilder than an indian i must warn lucy lord i wonder if bostil could have held back repairin that boat an then cut it loose i wonder yesterday id have sworn never today  slone drove the conclusion of that thought out of his consciousness before he wholly admitted it then he set to work cutting the long grass from the wet and shady nooks under the bluff where the spring made the ground rich he carried an armful down to the corral nagger was roaming around outside picking grass for himself wildfire snorted as always when he saw slone and slone as always when time permitted tried to coax the stallion to him he had never succeeded nor did he this time when he left the bundle of grass on the ground and went outside wildfire readily came for it  youre that tame anyhow you hungry red devil said slone jealously wildfire would take a bunch of grass from lucy bostils hand slones feelings had undergone some reaction though he still loved the horse but it was love mixed with bitterness more than ever he made up his mind that lucy should have wildfire then he walked around his place planning the work he meant to start at once  several days slipped by with slone scarcely realizing how they flew unaccustomed labor tired him so that he went to bed early and slept like a log if it had not been for the everpresent worry and suspense and longing in regard to lucy he would have been happier than ever he could remember almost at once he had become attached to his little home and the more he labored to make it productive and comfortable the stronger grew his attachment practical toil was not conducive to daydreaming so slone felt a loss of something vague and sweet many times he caught himself watching with eager eyes for a glimpse of lucy bostil down there among the cottonwoods still he never saw her and in fact he saw so few villagers that the place began to have a loneliness which endeared it to him the more then the view down the gray valley to the purple monuments was always thrillingly memorable to slone it was out there lucy had saved his horse and his life his keen desert gaze could make out even at that distance the great dark monument goldcrowned in the shadow of which he had heard lucy speak words that had transformed life for him he would ride out there some day the spell of those looming grand shafts of colored rock was still strong upon him  one morning slone had a visitorold brackton slones cordiality died on his lips before it was half uttered bracktons former friendliness was not in evidence indeed he looked at slone with curiosity and disfavor  howdy slone i jest wanted to see what you was doin up hyar he said  slone spread his hands and explained in few words  so you took over the place hey we all figgered thet but vorhees was mum fact is he was sure mysterious brackton sat down and eyed slone with interest folks are talkin a lot about you he said bluntly  is that so  you pear to be a pretty mysterious kind of a feller slone i kind of took a shine to you at first an thets why i come up hyar to tell you itd be wise fer you to vamoose  what exclaimed slone  brackton repeated substantially what he had said then pausing an instant continued ive no call to give you a hunch but ill do it jest because i did like you fust off  the old man seemed fussy and nervous and patronizing and disparaging all at once  whatd you beat up thet poor joel creech fer demanded brackton  he got what he deserved replied slone and the memory coming on the head of this strange attitude of bracktons roused slones temper  wal joel tells some queer things about youfer instance how you took advantage of little lucy bostil grabbin her an maulin her the way joel seen you  dn the loon muttered slone rising to pace the path  wal joels a bit off but hes not loony all the time hes seen you an hes tellin it when bostil hears it youd better be acrost the canyon  slone felt the hot sick rush of blood to his face and humiliation and rage overtook him  joels down at my house he had fits after you beat him an he aint got over them yet but he could blab to the riders van sickles lookin fer you an today when i was alone with joel he told me some more queer things about you i shut him up quick but i aint guaranteein i can keep him shut up  ill bet you i shut him up declared slone what more did the fool say  slone hev you been round these hyar partsdown among the monumentsfer any considerable time queried brackton  yes i haveseveral weeks out there an about ten days or so around the ford  where was you the night of the flood  the shrewd scrutiny of the old man the suspicion angered slone  if its any of your mix i was out on the slope among the rocks i heard that flood comin down long before it got here replied slone deliberately  brackton averted his gaze and abruptly rose as if the occasion was ended wal take my hunch an leave he said turning away  brackton if you mean well im much obliged returned slone slowly ponderingly but ill not take the hunch  suit yourself added brackton coldly and he went away  slone watched him go down the path and disappear in the lane of cottonwoods  ill be darned muttered slone funny old man maybe creechs not the only loony one hereabouts  slone tried to laugh off the effect of the interview but it persisted and worried him all day after supper he decided to walk down into the village and would have done so but for the fact that he saw a man climbing his path when he recognized the rider holley he sensed trouble and straightway he became gloomy bostils righthand man could not call on him for any friendly reason holley came up slowly awkwardly after the manner of a rider unused to walking slone had built a little porch on the front of his cabin and a bench which he had covered with goatskins it struck him a little strangely that he should bend over to rearrange these skins just as holley approached the porch  howdy son was the riders drawled remark sure makesmepuff to climbup this mountain  slone turned instantly surprised at the friendly tone doubting his own ears and wanting to verify them he was the more surprised to see holley unmistakably amiable  hello holley how are you he replied have a seat  wal im right spry fer an old bird but i cant climb wuth a dn  say this here beats bostils view  yes its fine replied slone rather awkwardly as he sat down on the porch step what could holley want with him this old rider was above curiosity or gossip  slone you aint holdin it agin methet i tried to shut you up the other day he drawled with dry frankness  why no holley im not i saw your point you were right but bostil made me mad  sure hed make anybody mad ive seen riders bite themselves they was so mad at bostil you called him an you sure tickled all the boys but you hurt yourself fer bostil owns an runs this here ford  so ive discovered replied slone  you got yourself in bad right off fer bostil has turned the riders agin you an this here punchin of creech has turned the village folks agin you whatd pitch into him fer  slone caught the kindly interest and intent of the rider and it warmed him as bracktons disapproval had alienated him  wal i

slone you see you havent been around an you dont know whats comin off  brackton was here today an he told me a good deal im worried too said slone dejectedly  thet hoss of yours wildfire hes enough to make you hated in bostils camp even if you hadnt made a fool of yourself which you sure have  slone dropped his head as admission  what creech swears he seen you do to miss lucy out there among the rocks where you was hid with wildfireis there any truth in thet asked holley earnestly tell me slone folks believe it an its hurt you at the ford bostil hasnt heard it yet an lucy she doesnt know but im figgerin thet you punched joel because he throwed it in your face  he did an i lambasted him replied slone with force  you did right but what i want to know is it true what joel seen  its true holley but what i did isnt so badso bad as hed make it look  wal i knowed thet i knowed fer a long time how lucy cares fer you returned the old rider kindly  slone raised his head swiftly incredulously holley you cant be serious  wal i am ive been sort of a big brother to lucy bostil for eighteen years i carried her in these here hands when she weighed no more n my spurs i taught her how to ridewhat she knows about hosses an she knows more n her dad i taught her to shoot i know her better n anybody an lately shes been different shes worried an unhappy  but holley all thatit doesnt

replied slone unsteadily he thrilled under the iron grasp of the riders hard hand  youve got another friend you can gamble on said holley significantly  another who  lucy bostil an dont you fergit thet ill bet shell raise more trouble than bostil when she hears what joel creech is tellin fer shes bound to hear it van sickle swears hes agoin to tell her an then beat you up with a quirt  he is is

an me take my word fer thet ill prepare lucy an shes as good a scrapper as bostil any day  it all scares me replied slone he did feel panicky and that was from thoughts of what shame might befall lucy the cold sweat oozed out of every pore what might not bostil do holley i love the girl so ii didnt insult her bostil will never understand an whats he goin to do when he finds out  wal lets hope you wont git any wussn you give joel  let bostil beat me ejaculated slone i think im willinnowtheway i feel but ive a temper and bostil rubs me the wrong way  wall leave your gun home an fight bostil youre pretty husky sure hell lick you but mebbe you could give the old cuss a black eye holley laughed as if the idea gave him infinite pleasure  fight bostil  lucy would hate me cried slone  nix you dont know thet kid if the old man goes after you lucyll care more fer you shes jest like him in some ways holley pulled out a stubby black pipe and filling and lighting it he appeared to grow more thoughtful it wasnt only lucy thet sent me up here to see you bostil had been pesterin me fer days but i kept fightin shy of it till lucy got hold of me  bostil sent you why  reckon you can guess he cant sleep thinkin about your red hoss none of us ever seen bostil have sich a bad case he raised sage king but hes always been crazy fer a great wild stallion an here you come alongan your hoss jumps the kingan theres trouble generally  holley do you think wildfire can beat sage king asked slone eagerly  reckon i do lucy says so an ill back her any day but son i aint paradin what i think id git in bad myself farlane an the other boys theyre with bostil van hes to blame fer thet hes takin a dislike to you right off an what he tells bostil an the boys about thet race dont agree with what lucy tells me lucy says wildfire ran fiery an cranky at the start he wanted to run round an kill the king instead of racin so he was three lengths behind when macomber dropped the flag lucy says the king got into his stride she knows an there wildfire comes from behind an climbs all over the king  van tells a different story  it came off just as lucy told you declared slone i saw every move  wal thets neither here nor there what youre up agin is this bostil is sore since you called him but he holds himself in because he hasnt given up hope of gittin wildfire an slone youre sure wise aint you thet if bostil doesnt buy him you cant stay on here  im wise but i wont sell wildfire replied slone doggedly  wal id never wasted my breath tellin you all this if i hadnt figgered about lucy youve got her to think of  slone turned on holley passionately you keep hintin theres a hope for me when i know theres none  youre only a boy replied holley son where theres life theres hope i aint agoin to tell you agin thet i know lucy bostil  slone could not stand nor walk nor keep still he was shaking from head to foot  wildfires not mine to sell hes lucys confessed slone  the devil you say ejaculated holley and he nearly dropped his pipe  i gave wildfire to her she accepted him it was done thenthen i lost my head an made her mad anshe said shed ride him in the race but wouldnt keep him but he is hers  oho i see slone i was goin to advise you to sell wildfireall on account of lucy youre young an youd have a big start in life if you would but lucys your girl an you give her the hoss thet settles thet  if i go away from here an leave wildfire for lucydo you think she could keep him wouldnt bostil take him from her  wal son if he tried thet on lucy shed jump wildfire an hit your trail an hang on to it till she found you  whatll you tell bostil asked slone half beside himself  im consarned if i know replied holley mebbe ill think of some idee ill go back now an say son i reckon youd better hang close to home if you meet bostil down in the village you twod clash sure ill come up soon but itll be after dark  holley all this isis good of you said slone iill  shut up son interrupted the rider dryly thets your only weakness so far as i can see you say too much  holley started down then his long clinking spurs digging into the steep path he left slone a prey to deep thoughts at once anxious and dreamy  next day slone worked hard all day looking forward to nightfall expecting that holley would come up he tried to resist the sweet and tantalizing anticipation of a message from lucy but in vain the rider had immeasurably uplifted slones hope that lucy at least cared for him not for a moment all day could slone drive away the hope at twilight he was too eager to eattoo obsessed to see the magnificent sunset but holley did not come and slone went to bed late half sick with disappointment  the next day was worse slone found work irksome yet he held to it on the third day he rested and dreamed and grew doubtful again and then moody on the fourth day slone found he needed supplies that he must obtain from the store he did not forget holleys warning but he disregarded it thinking there would scarcely be a chance of meeting bostil at midday  there were horses standing bridles down before bracktons place and riders lounging at the rail and step some of these men had been pleasant to slone on earlier occasions this day they seemed not to see him slone was tingling all over when he went into the store some deviltry was afoot he had an angry thought that these riders could not have minds of their own just inside the door slone encountered wetherby the young rancher from durango slone spoke but wetherby only replied with an insolent stare slone did not glance at the man to whom wetherby was talking only a few people were inside the store and brackton was waiting upon them slone stood back a little in the shadow brackton had observed his entrance but did not greet him then slone absolutely knew that for him the good will of bostils ford was a thing of the past  presently brackton was at leisure but he showed no disposition to attend to slones wants then slone walked up to the counter and asked for supplies  have you got the money asked brackton as if addressing one he would not trust  yes replied slone growing red under an insult that he knew wetherby had heard  brackton handed out the supplies and received the money without a word he held his head down it was a singular action for a man used to dealing fairly with every one slone felt outraged he hurried out of the place with shame burning him with his own eyes downcast and in his hurry he bumped square into a burly form slone recoiledlooked up bostil the old rider was eying him with cool speculation  wal are you drunk he queried without any particular expression  yet the query was to slone like a blow it brought his head up with a jerk his glance steady and keen on bostils  bostil you know i dont drink he said  ahuh i know a lot about you slone i heard you bought vorheess place up on the bench  yes  did he tell you it was mortgaged to me for moren its worth  no he didnt  did he make over any papers to you  no  wal if it interests you ill show you papers thet proves the propertys mine  slone suffered a pang the little home had grown dearer and dearer to him  all right bostil if its yoursits yours he said calmly enough  i reckon id drove you out before this if i hadnt felt we could make a deal  we cant agree on any deal bostil replied slone steadily it was not what bostil said but the way he said it the subtle meaning and power behind it that gave slone a sense of menace and peril these he had been used to for years he could meet them but he was handicapped here because it seemed that though he could meet bostil face to face he could not fight him for he was lucys father slones position the impotence of it rendered him less able to control his temper  why cant we demanded bostil if you wasnt so touchy we could an let me say young feller thet theres more reason now thet you do make a deal with me  deal what about  about your red hoss  wildfire  no deals bostil returned slone and made as if to pass him  the big hand that forced slone back was far from gentle and again he felt the quick rush of blood  mebbe i can tell you somethin thetll make you sell wildfire said bostil  not if you talked yourself dumb flashed slone there was no use to try to keep cool with this bostil if he talked horses ill race wildfire against the king but no more  race wal we dont run races around here without stakes replied bostil with deep scorn an what can you bet thet little dab of prize money is gone an wouldnt be enough to meet me youre a strange one in these parts ive pride an reputation to uphold you brag of racin with mean you a beggarly rider  you wouldnt have them clothes an boots if my girl hadnt fetched them to you  the riders behind bostil laughed wetherbys face was there in the door not amused but hard with scorn and something else slone felt a sickening terrible gust of passion it fairly shook him and as the wave subsided the quick cooling of skin and body pained him like a burn made with ice  yes bostil im what you say responded slone and his voice seemed to fill his ears but youre dead wrong when you say ive nothin to bet on a race  an whatll you bet  my life an my horse  the riders suddenly grew silent and intense bostil vibrated to that he turned white he more than any rider on the uplands must have felt the nature of that offer  agin what he demanded hoarsely  your daughter lucy  one instant the surprise held bostil mute and motionless then he seemed to expand his huge bulk jerked into motion and he bellowed like a mad bull  slone saw the blow coming made no move to avoid it the big fist took him square on the mouth and chin and laid him flat on the ground sight failed slone for a little and likewise ability to move but he did not lose consciousness his head seemed to have been burst into rays and red mist that blurred his eyes then these cleared away leaving intense pain he started to get up his brain in a whirl where was his gun he had left it at home but for that he would have killed bostil he had already killed one man the thing was a burning flashthen all over he could do it again but bostil was lucys father  slone gathered up the packages of supplies and without looking at the men he hurried away he seemed possessed of a fury to turn and run back some force like an invisible hand withheld him when he reached the cabin he shut himself in and lay on his bunk forgetting that the place did not belong to him alive only to the mystery of his trouble smarting with the shame of the assault upon him it was dark before he composed himself and went out and then he had not the desire to eat he made no move to open the supplies of food did not even make a light but he went out to take grass and water to the horses when he returned to the cabin a man was standing at the porch slone recognized holleys shape and then his voice  son you raised the devil today  holley dont you go back on me cried slone i was driven  dont talk so loud whispered the rider in return ive only a minnit  herea letter from lucy an son dont git the idee thet ill go back on you  slone took the letter with trembling fingers all the fury and gloom instantly fled lucy had written him he could not speak  son im doublecrossin the boss right this minnit whispered holley hoarsely an the same time im playin lucys game if bostil finds out hell kill me i mustnt be ketched up here but i wont lose track of youwherever you go  holley slipped away stealthily in the dusk leaving slone with a throbbing heart  wherever you go he echoed ah i forgot i cant stay here  lucys letter made his fingers tinglemade them so hasty and awkward that he had difficulty in kindling blaze enough to see to read the letter was short written in leadpencil on the torn leaf of a ledger slone could not read rapidlythose years on the desert had seen to thatand his haste to learn what lucy said bewildered him at first all the words blurred  come at once to the bench in the cottonwoods ill meet you  there my heart is breaking its a liea liewhat they say  ill swear you were with me the night the boat was cut adrift  i know you didnt do that i know who oh come i will stick to you i will run off with you i love you    chapter xv  slones heart leaped to his throat and its beating choked his utterances of rapture and amaze and dread but rapture dominated the other emotions he could scarcely control the impulse to run to meet lucy without a single cautious thought  he put the precious letter inside his blouse where it seemed to warm his breast he buckled on his gunbelt and extinguishing the light he hurried out  a crescent moon had just tipped the bluff the village lanes and cabins and trees lay silver in the moonlight a lonesome coyote barked in the distance all else was still the air was cool sweet fragrant there appeared to be a glamour of light of silence of beauty over the desert  slone kept under the dark lee of the bluff and worked around so that he could be above the village where there was little danger of meeting any one yet presently he had to go out of the shadow into the moonblanched lane swift and silent as an indian he went along keeping in the shade of what trees there were until he came to the grove of cottonwoods the grove was a black mystery lanced by silver rays he slipped in among the trees halting every few steps to listen the action the realization had helped to make him cool to steel him though never before in his life had he been so exalted the pursuit and capture of wildfire at one time the desire of his heart were as nothing to this love had called himand lifeand he knew death hung in the balance if bostil found him seeking lucy there would be blood spilled slone quaked at the thought for the cold and ghastly oppression following the death he had meted out to sears came to him at times but such thoughts were fleeting only one thought really held his mindand the one was that lucy loved him had sent strange wild passionate words to him  he found the narrow path its white crossed by slowly moving black bars of shadow and stealthily he followed this keen of eye and ear stopping at every rustle he well knew the bench lucy had mentioned it was in a remote corner of the grove under big trees near the spring once slone thought he had a glimpse of white perhaps it was only moonlight he slipped on and on and when beyond the branching paths that led toward the house he breathed freer the grove appeared deserted at last he crossed the runway from the spring smelled the cool wet moss and watercress and saw the big cottonwood looming dark above the other trees a patch of moonlight brightened a little glade just at the edge of dense shade cast by the cottonwood here the bench stood it was empty  slones rapture vanished he was suddenly chilled she was not there she might have been intercepted he would not see her the disappointment the sudden relaxation was horrible then a white slender shape flashed from beside the black treetrunk and flew toward him it was noiseless like a specter and swift as the wind was he dreaming he felt so strange thenthe white shape reached him and he knew  lucy leaped into his arms  lin lin oh im soso glad to see you she whispered she seemed breathless keen new to him not in the least afraid nor shy slone could only hold her he could not have spoken even if she had given him a chance i know everythingwhat they accuse you ofhow the riders treated youhow my dad struck you oh  hes a brute i hate him for that why didnt you keep out of his way  van saw it all oh i hate him too he said you lay stillwhere you fell  dear lin that blow may have hurt you dreadfullyshamed you because you couldnt strike back at my dadbut it reached me too it hurt me it woke my heart wherewhere did he hit you oh ive seen him hit men his terrible fists  lucy never mind whispered slone id stood to be shot just for this  he felt her hands softly on his face feeling around tenderly till they found the swollen bruise on mouth and chin  ah  he struck you and iill kiss you she whispered if kisses will make it wellitll be well  she seemed strange wild passionate in her tenderness she lifted her face and kissed him softly again and again and again till the touch that had been exquisitely painful to his bruised lips became rapture then she leaned back in his arms her hands on his shoulders whitefaced darkeyed and laughed up in his face lovingly daringly as if she defied the world to change what she had done  lucy lucy  he can beat meagain said slone low and hoarsely  if you love me youll keep out of his way replied the girl  if i love you  my god  ive felt my heart die a thousand times since that morninwhenwhen you  lin i didnt know she interrupted with sweet grave earnestness i know now  and slone could not but know too looking at her and the sweetness the eloquence the noble abandon of her avowal sounded to the depths of him his dread his resignation his shame all sped forever in the deep full breath of relief with which he cast off that burden he tasted the nectar of happiness the first time in his life he lifted his headnever he knew to lower it again he would be true to what she had made him  come in the shade he whispered and with his arm round her he led her to the great treetrunk is it safe for you here an how long can you stay  i had it out with dadleft him licked once in his life she replied then i went to my room fastened the door and slipped out of my window i can stay out as long as i want no one will know  slones heart throbbed she was his the clasp of her hands on his the gleam of her eyes the white daring flash of her face in the shadow of the moonthese told him she was his how it had come about was beyond him but he realized the truth what a girl this was the same nerve which she showed when she had run wildfire out in front of the fleetest horses in the uplands  tell me then he began quietly with keen gaze roving under the trees and eyes strained tight tell me whats come off  dont you know she queried in amaze  only that for some reason im done in bostils ford it cant be because i punched joel creech i felt it before i met bostil at the store he taunted me we had bitter words he told before all of them how the outfit i wore you gave me an then i dared him to race the king my horse an my life against you  yes i know she whispered softly its all over town oh lin it was a grand bet and bostil fourflushed as the riders say for days a race between wildfire and the king had been in the air therell never be peace in bostils ford again till that race is run  but lucy could bostils wantin wildfire an hatin me because i wont sellcould that ruin me here at the ford  it could but lin theres more oh i hate to tell you she whispered passionately i thought youd know joel creech swore you cut the ropes on the ferryboat and sent it adrift  the loon ejaculated slone and he laughed low in both anger and ridicule lucy thats only a fools talk  hes crazy oh if i ever get him in front of me again when im on sarchillill she ended with a little gasp and leaned a moment against slone he felt her heart beatfelt the strong clasp of her hands she was indeed bostils flesh and blood and there was that in her dangerous to arouse  lin the folks here are queer she resumed more calmly for long years dad has ruled them they see with his eyes and talk with his voice joel creech swore you cut those cables swore he trailed you brackton believed him van believed him they told my father and hemy dadgod forgive him he jumped at that the village as one person now believes you sent the boat adrift so creechs horses could not cross and you could win the race  lucy if it wasnt soso funny id be mad asas burst out slone  it isnt funny its terrible i know who cut those cables   holley knows dad knowsan oh linihatei hate my own father  my god gasped slone as the full signification burst upon him then his next thought was for lucy listen dearyou mustnt say that he entreated hes your father hes a good man every way except when hes after horses then hes half horse i understand him i feel sorry for him an if hes throwed the blame on me all right ill stand it what do i care i was queered anyhow because i wouldnt part with my horse it cant matter so much if people think i did that just to help win a race but if they knew youryour father did it an if creechs horses starve why itd be a disgrace for himan you  lin sloneyoull accept the blame she whispered with wide dark eyes on him hands at his shoulders  sure i will replied slone i cant be any worse off  youre better than all of themmy rider she cried fullvoiced and tremulous lin you make me love you soitit hurts and she seemed about to fling herself into his arms again there was a strangeness about hera glory but youll not take the shame of that act for i wont let you ill tell my father i was with you when the boat was cut loose hell believe me  yes an hell kill me groaned slone good lord lucy dont do that  i will an hell not kill you lin dad took a great fancy to you i know that he thinks he hates you but in his heart he doesnt if he got hold of wildfirewhy hed never be able to do enough for you he never could make it up what do you think i told him you hugged and kissed me shamefully that day  oh lucy you didnt implored slone  i sure did and what do you think he said he once did the same to my mother  no lin dadd never kill you for anything except a fury about horses all the fights he ever had were over horse deals the two menhehe lucy faltered and her shudder was illuminating to slone both of themfights over horse trades  lucy if im ever unlucky enough to meet bostil again ill be deaf an dumb an now you promise me you wont tell him you were with me that night  lin if the occasion comes i willi couldnt help it replied lucy  then fight shy of the occasion he rejoined earnestly for that would be the end of lin slone  thenwhat on earth canwe do lucy said with sudden break of spirit  i think we must wait you wrote in your letter youd stick to meyoud he could not get the words out the thought so overcame him  if it comes to a finish ill go with you lucy returned with passion rising again  oh to ride off with you lucyto have you all to myselfi darent think of it but thats only selfish  maybe its not so selfish as you believe if you left the fordnowitd break my heart id never get over it  lucy you love methat well  then their lips met again and their hands locked and they stood silent straining toward each other he held the slight form so pliant so responsive so alive close to him and her face lay hidden on his breast and he looked out over her head into the quivering moonlit shadows the night was as still as one away on the desert far from the abode of men it was more beautiful than any dream of a night in which he had wandered far into strange lands where wild horses were and forests lay black under moonsilvered peaks  well runthenif it comes to a finish said slone huskily but ill wait ill stick it out here ill take what comes somaybe ill not disgrace you more  i told van ii gloried in being hugged by you that day she replied and her little defiant laugh told what she thought of the alleged disgrace  you torment him remonstrated slone you set him against us it would be better to keep still  but my blood is up she said and she pounded his shoulder with her fist ill fightill fight  i couldnt avoid van it was holley who told me van was threatening you and when i met van he told me how everybody said you insulted mehad been worse than a drunken riderand that hed beat you half to death so i told van joel creech might have seen usi didnt doubt thatbut he didnt see that i liked being hugged  what did van say then asked slone all aglow with his wonderful joy  he wilted he slunk away and so ill tell them all  but lucy youve always been soso truthful  what do you mean  well to say you liked being hugged that day waswas a story wasnt it  that was what made me so furious she admitted shyly i was surprised when you grabbed me off wildfire and my heart beatbeatbeat so when you hugged me and when you kissed me ii was petrified i knew i liked it thenand i was furious with myself  slone drew a long deep breath of utter enchantment youll take back wildfire  oh lindontaskme she implored  take him backan me with him  then i will but no one must know that yet  they drew apart then  an now you must go said slone reluctantly listen i forgot to warn you about joel creech dont ever let him near you hes crazy an he means evil  oh i know lin ill watch but im not afraid of him  hes strong lucy i saw him lift bags that were hefty for me lucy do you ride these days  every day if i couldnt ride i couldnt live  im afraid said slone nervously theres creech an cordtsboth have threatened you  im afraid of cordts replied lucy with a shiver you should have seen him look at me raceday it made me hot with anger yet weak too somehow but dad says im never in any danger if i watch out and i do who could catch me on sarch  any horse can be tripped in the sage you told me how joel tried to rope sage king did you ever tell your dad that  i forgot but then im glad i didnt dad would shoot for that quicker than if joel tried to rope him dont worry lin i always pack a gun  but can you use it  lucy laughed do you think i can only ride  slone remembered that holley had said he had taught lucy how to shoot as well as ride youll be watchfulcareful he said earnestly  oh lin you need to be that more than i what will you do  ill stay up at the little cabin i thought i owned till today  didnt you buy it asked lucy quickly  i thought i did but  never mind maybe i wont get put out just yet an when will i see you again  here every night wait till i come she replied good night lin  illwait he exclaimed with a catch in his voice oh my luck  ill wait lucy every dayhopin an prayin that this trouble will lighten an ill wait at nightfor you  he kissed her goodby and watched the slight form glide away flit to and fro white in the dark patches grow indistinct and vanish he was left alone in the silent grove  slone stole back to the cabin and lay sleepless and tranced watching the stars till late that night  all the next day he did scarcely anything but watch and look after his horses and watch and drag the hours out and dream despite his dread but no one visited him the cabin was left to him that day  it had been a hot day with great thunderhead black and creamy white clouds rolling down from the canyon country no rain had fallen at the ford though storms near by had cooled the air at sunset slone saw a rainbow bending down ruddy and gold connecting the purple of cloud with the purple of horizon  out beyond the valley the clouds were broken showing rifts of blue and they rolled low burying the heads of the monuments creating a wild and strange spectacle twilight followed and appeared to rise to meet the darkening clouds and at last the gold on the shafts faded the monuments faded and the valley grew dark  slone took advantage of the hour before moonrise to steal down into the grove there to wait for lucy she came so quickly he scarcely felt that he waited at all and then the time spent with her sweet fleeting precious left him stronger to wait for her again to hold himself in to cease his brooding to learn faith in something deeper than he could fathom  the next day he tried to work but found idle waiting made the time fly swifter because in it he could dream in the dark of the rustling cottonwoods he met lucy as eager to see him as he was to see her tender loving remorsefula hundred sweet and bewildering things all so new so unbelievable to slone  that night he learned that bostil had started for durango with some of his riders this trip surprised slone and relieved him likewise for durango was over two hundred miles distant and a journey there even for the hard riders was a matter of days  he left no orders for me lucy said except to behave myself is this behaving she whispered and nestled close to slone audacious tormenting as she had been before this dark cloud of trouble but he left orders for holley to ride with me and look after me isnt that funny poor old holley he hates to doublecross dad he says  im glad holleys to look after you replied slone yesterday i saw you tearin down into the sage on sarch i wondered what youd do lucy if cordts or that loon creech should get hold of you  id fight  but child thats nonsense you couldnt fight either of them  couldnt i well i just could idid shoot cordts and id whip joel creech with my quirt and if he kept after me id let sarch run him down sarch hates him  youre a brave sweetheart mused slone suppose you were caught an couldnt get away would you leave a trail somehow  i sure would  lucy im a wildhorse hunter he went on thoughtfully as if speaking to himself i never failed on a trail i could track you over bare rock  lin ill leave a trail so never fear she replied but dont borrow trouble youre always afraid for me look at the bright side dad seems to have forgotten you maybe it all isnt so bad as we thought oh i hope so  how is my horse wildfire i want to ride him again i can hardly keep from going after him  and so they whispered while the moments swiftly passed  it was early during the afternoon of the next day that slone hearing the clipclop of unshod ponies went outside to look one part of the lane he could see plainly and into it stalked joel creech leading the leanest and gauntest ponies slone had ever seen a man as lean and gaunt as the ponies stalked behind  the sight shocked slone joel creech and his father slone had no proof because he had never seen the elder creech yet strangely he felt convinced of it and grim ideas began to flash into his mind creech would hear who was accused of cutting the boat adrift what would he say if he believed as all the villagers believed then bostils ford would become an unhealthy place for lin slone where were the great racehorsesblue roan and pegand the other thoroughbreds a pang shot through slone  oh not lostnot starved he muttered that would be hell  yet he believed just this had happened how strange he had never considered such an event as the return of creech  id better look him up before he looks me said slone  it took but an instant to strap on his belt and gun then slone strode down his path out into the lane toward bracktons whatever before boded ill to slone had been nothing to what menaced him now he would have a man to facea man whom repute called just but stern  before slone reached the vicinity of the store he saw riders come out to meet the creech party it so happened there were more riders than usually frequented bracktons at that hour the old storekeeper came stumbling out and raised his hands the riders could be heard loudvoiced and excited slone drew nearer and the nearer he got the swifter he strode instinct told him that he was making the right move he would face this man whom he was accused of ruining the poor mustangs hung their heads dejectedly  bags of bones some rider loudly said  and then slone drew dose to the excited group brackton held the center he was gesticulating his thin voice rose piercingly  creech whars peg an the roan gawd almighty man you aint meanin them cayuses thar are all youve got left of thet grand bunch of hosses  there was scarcely a sound all the riders were still slone fastened his eyes on creech he saw a gaunt haggard face almost black with dustworn and sadwith big eyes of terrible gloom he saw an unkempt ragged form that had been wet and muddy and was now dustcaked  creech stood silent in a dignity of despair that wrung slones heart his silence was an answer it was joel creech who broke the suspense  didnt i tell youall whatd happen he shrilled parched an starved  aw no chorused the riders  brackton shook all over tears dimmed his eyestears that he had no shame for so help me gawdim sorry was his broken exclamation  slone had forgotten himself and possible revelation concerning him but when holley appeared close to him with a significant warning look slone grew keen once more on his own account he felt a hot flame inside hima deep and burning anger at the man who might have saved creechs horses and he like brackton felt sorrow for creech and a riders sense of loss of pain these horsesthese dumb brutesfaithful and sometimes devoted had to suffer an agonizing death because of the selfishness of men  i reckon wed all like to hear what come off creech if you dont feel too bad to tell us said brackton  gimme a drink replied creech  wal dn my old head exclaimed brackton im gittin old come on in all of you were glad to see creech home  the riders filed in after brackton and the creeches holley stayed close beside slone both of them in the background  i heerd the flood comin thet night said creech to his silent and tensefaced listeners i heerd it miles up the canyon peared a bigger roar than any flood before as it happened i was alone an it took time to git the hosses up if thered been an indian with meor even joelmebbe his voice quavered slightly broke and then he resumed even when i got the hosses over to the landin it wasnt too lateif only some one had heerd me an come down i yelled an shot nobody heerd the river was risin fast an thet roar had begun to make my hair raise it seemed like years the time i waited there then the flood came downblack an windy an awful i had hell gittin the hosses back  next mornin two piutes come down they had lost mustangs up on the rocks all the feed on my place was gone there wasnt nothin to do but try to git out the piutes said there wasnt no chance northno waterno grassan so i decided to go south if we could climb over thet last slide peg broke her leg there anii had to shoot her but we climbed out with the rest of the bunch i left it then to the piutes we traveled five days west to head the canyons no grass an only a little water salt at thet blue roan was game if ever i seen a game hoss then the piutes took to workin in an out an around not to git out but to find a little grazin i never knowed the earth was so barren one by one them hosses went down an at last i couldnti couldnt see blue roan starvindyin right before my eyesan i shot him too an what hurts me most now is thet i didnt have the nerve to kill him fust off  there was a long pause in creechs narrative  them piutes will git paid if ever i can pay them id parched myself but for them we circled an crossed them red cliffs an then the strip of red sand an worked down into the canyon under the wall was a long stretch of beachsandyan at the head of this we found bostils boat  wal burst out the profane brackton bostils boat  say aint joel told you yet about thet boat  no joel aint said a word about the boat replied creech what about it  it was cut loose jest before the flood  manifestly brackton expected this to be staggering to creech but he did not even show surprise  theres a rider here named slonea wildhoss wrangler went on brackton an joel swears this slone cut the boat loose sos hed have a better chance to win the race joel swears he tracked this feller slone  for slone the moment was fraught with many emotions but not one of them was fear he did not need the sudden force of holleys strong hand pushing him forward slone broke into the group and faced creech  its not true i never cut that boat loose he declared ringingly  whore you queried creech  my names slone i rode in here with a wild horse an he won a race then i was blamed for this trick  creechs steady gloomy eyes seemed to pierce slone through they were terrible eyes to look into yet they held no menace for him an joel accused you  so they say i fought with himstruck him for an insult to a girl  come round hyar joel called creech sternly his big scaly black hand closed on the boys shoulder joel cringed under it son youve lied what for  joel showed abject fear of his father hes gone on lucyan i seen him with her muttered the boy  an you lied to hurt slone  joel would not reply to this in speech though that was scarcely needed to show he had lied he seemed to have no sense of guilt creech eyed him pityingly and then pushed him back  men my son has done this rider dirt said creech youall see thet slone never cut the boat loose an say youall seem to think cuttin thet boat loose was the crime no thet wasnt the crime the crime was keepin the boat out of the water fer days when my hosses could have been crossed  slone stepped back forgotten it seemed to him both joy and sorrow swayed him he had been exonerated but this hard and gloomy creechhe knew things and slone thought of lucy  who did cut thet thar boat loose demanded brackton incredulously  creech gave him a strange glance as i was sayin we come on the boat fast at the head of the long stretch i seen the cables had been cut an i seen moren thet wal the river was high an swift but this was a long stretch with good landin way below on the other side we got the boat in an by rowin hard an driftin we got acrost leadin the hosses we had five when we took to the river two went down on the way over we climbed out then the piutes went to find some navajos an get hosses an i headed fer the fordmade camp twice an joel seen me comin out a ways  creech was there anythin left in thet boat began brackton with intense but pondering curiosity anythin on the ropesor sothet might give an idee who cut her loose  creech made no reply to that the gloom burned darker in his eyes he seemed a man with a secret he trusted no one there these men were all friends of his but friends under strange conditions his silence was tragic and all about the man breathed vengeance    chapter xvi  no moon showed that night and few stars twinkled between the slowmoving clouds the air was thick and oppressive full of the days heat that had not blown away a dry storm moved in dry majesty across the horizon and the sheets and ropes of lightning blazing white behind the black monuments gave weird and beautiful grandeur to the desert  lucy bostil had to evade her aunt to get out of the house and the window that had not been the means of exit since bostil left once more came into use aunt jane had grown suspicious of late and lucy much as she wanted to trust her with her secret dared not do it for some reason unknown to lucy holley had also been hard to manage particularly today lucy certainly did not want holley to accompany her on her nightly rendezvous with slone she changed her light gown to the darker and thicker ridinghabit  there was a longedfor allsatisfying flavor in this night adventuresomething that had not all to do with love the stealth the outwitting of guardians the darkness the silence the riskall these called to some deep undeveloped instinct in her and thrilled along her veins cool keen exciting she had the blood in her of the greatest adventurer of his day  lucy feared she was a little late allaying the suspicions of aunt jane and changing her dress had taken time lucy burned with less cautious steps still she had only used caution in the grove because she had promised slone to do so this night she forgot or disregarded it and the shadows were thickdarker than at any other time when she had undertaken this venture she had always been a little afraid of the darka fact that made her contemptuous of herself nevertheless she did not peer into the deeper pits of gloom she knew her way and could slip swiftly along with only a rustle of leaves she touched  suddenly she imagined she heard a step and she halted still as a treetrunk there was no reason to be afraid of a step it had been a surprise to her that she had never encountered a rider walking and smoking under the trees listening she assured herself she had been mistaken and then went on but she looked back did she see a shadowdarker than othersmoving it was only her imagination yet she sustained a slight chill the air seemed more oppressive or else there was some intangible and strange thing hovering in it she went onreached the lane that divided the grove but she did not cross at once it was lighter in this lane she could see quite far  as she stood there listening keenly responsive to all the influences of the night she received an impression that did not have its origin in sight nor sound and only the leaves touched herand only their dry fragrance came to her but she felt a presencea strange indefinable presence  but lucy was brave and this feeling whatever it might be angered her she entered the lane and stole swiftly along toward the end of the grove paths crossed the lane at right angles and at these points she went swifter it would be something to tell sloneshe had been frightened but thought of him drove away her fear and nervousness and her anger with herself  then she came to a wider path she scarcely noted it and passed on then came a quick rustlea swift shadow between two stepsas her heart leapedviolent arms swept her off the ground a hard hand was clapped over her mouth she was being carried swiftly through the gloom  lucy tried to struggle she could scarcely move a muscle iron arms wrapped her in coils that crushed her she tried to scream but her lips were tightpressed her nostrils were almost closed between two hard fingers that smelled of horse  whoever had her she was helpless lucys fury admitted of reason then both succumbed to a paralyzing horror cordts had got her she knew it she grew limp as a rag and her senses dulled she almost fainted the sickening paralysis of her faculties lingered but she felt her body releasedshe was placed upon her feetshe was shaken by a rough hand she swayed and but for that hand might have fallen she could see a tall dark form over her and horses and the gloomy gray open of the sage slope the hand left her face  dont yap girl this command in a hard low voice pierced her ears she saw the glint of a gun held before her instinctive fear revived her old faculties the horrible sick weakness the dimness the shaking internal collapse all left her  illbequiet she faltered she knew what her father had always feared had come to pass and though she had been told to put no value on her life in that event she could not run all in an instantwhen life had been so sweetshe could not face pain or death  the man moved back a step he was tall gaunt ragged but not like cordts never would she forget cordts she peered up at him in the dim light of the few stars she recognized joel creechs father  oh thank god she whispered in the shock of blessed relief i thoughtyou werecordts  keep quiet he whispered back sternly and with rough hand he shook her  lucy awoke to realities something evil menaced her even though this man was not cordts her mind could not grasp it she was amazedstunned she struggled to speak yet to keep within that warning command  whaton earthdoes thismean she gasped very low she had no sense of fear of creech once when he and her father had been friends she had been a favorite of creechs when a little girl she had ridden his knee many times between creech and cordts there was immeasurable distance yet she had been violently seized and carried out into the sage and menaced  creech leaned down his gaunt face lighted by terrible eyes made her recoil bostil ruined mean killed my hosses he whispered grimly an im takin you away an ill hold you in ransom for the king an sarchedonan all his racers  oh cried lucy in startling surprise that yet held a pang oh creech  then you mean me no harm  the man straightened up and stood a moment darkly silent as if her query had presented a new aspect of the case lucy bostil im a broken man an wild an full of hate but god knows i never thought of thetof harm to you no child i wont harm you but you must obey an go quietly for theres a devil in me  where will you take me she asked  down in the canyons where no one can track me he said itll be hard goin fer you child an hard fare but im strikin at bostils heart as he has broken mine ill send him word an ill tell him if he wont give his hosses thet ill sell you to cordts  oh creechbut you wouldnt she whispered and her hand went to his brawny arm  lucy in thet case id make as poor a blackguard as anythin else ive been he said forlornly but im figgerin bostil will give up his hosses fer you  creech im afraid he wont youd better give me up let me go back ill never tell i dont blame you i think youre square my dad is but oh dont make me suffer you used toto care for me when i was little  thet aint no use he replied dont talk no more git up hyar now an ride in front of me  he led her to a lean mustang lucy swung into the saddle she thought how singular a coincidence it was that she had worn a ridinghabit it was dark and thick and comfortable for riding suppose she had worn the flimsy dress in which she had met slone every night save this one thought of slone gave her a pang he would wait and wait and wait he would go back to his cabin not knowing what had befallen her  suddenly lucy noticed another man near at hand holding two mustangs he mounted rode before her and then she recognized joel creech assurance of this brought back something of the dread but the father could control the son  ride on said creech hitting her horse from behind  and lucy found herself riding single file with two men and a packhorse out upon the windy dark sage slope they faced the direction of the monuments looming now and then so weirdly black and grand against the broad flare of lightningblazed sky  ever since lucy had reached her teens there had been predictions that she would be kidnapped and now the thing had come to pass she was in danger she knew but in infinitely less than had any other wild character of the uplands been her captor she believed if she went quietly and obediently with creech that she would be at least safe from harm it was hard luck for bostil she thought but no worse than he deserved retribution had overtaken him how terribly hard he would take the loss of his horses lucy wondered if he really ever would part with the king even to save her from privation and peril bostil was more likely to trail her with his riders and to kill the creeches than to concede their demands perhaps though that threat to sell her to cordts would frighten the hard old man  the horses trotted and swung up over the slope turning gradually evidently to make a wide detour round the ford until lucys back was toward the monuments before her stretched the bleak barren dark desert and through the opaque gloom she could see nothing lucy knew she was headed for the north toward the wild canyons unknown to the riders cordts and his gang hid in there what might not happen if the creeches fell in with cordts lucys confidence sustained a check still she remembered the creeches were like indians and what would slone do he would ride out on her trail lucy shivered for the creeches if slone ever caught up with them and remembering his wildhorsehunters skill at tracking and the fleet and tireless wildfire she grew convinced that creech could not long hold her captive for slone would be wary he would give no sign of his pursuit he would steal upon the creeches in the dark and lucy shivered again what an awful fate had been that of dick sears  so as she rode on lucys mind was full she was used to riding and in the motion of a horse there was something in harmony with her blood even now with worry and dread and plotting strong upon her habit had such power over her that riding made the hours fleet she was surprised to be halted to see dimly low dark mounds of rock ahead  git off said creech  where are we asked lucy  reckon hyars the rocks an you sleep some fer youll need it he spread a blanket laid her saddle at the head of it and dropped another blanket what i want to know isshall i tie you up or not asked creech if i do youll git sore an thisll be the toughest trip you ever made  you mean will i try to get away from youor not queried lucy  jest thet  lucy pondered she divined some fineness of feeling in this coarse man he wanted to spare her not only pain but the necessity of watchful eyes on her every moment lucy did not like to promise not to try to escape if opportunity presented still she reasoned that once deep in the canyons where she would be in another day she would be worse off if she did get away the memory of cordtss cavernous hungry eyes upon her was not a small factor in lucys decision  creech if i give my word not to try to get away would you believe me she asked  creech was slow in replying reckon i would he said finally  all right ill give it  an thets sense now you lay down  lucy did as she was bidden and pulled the blanket over her the place was gloomy and still she heard the sound of mustangs teeth on grass and the soft footfalls of the men presently these sounds ceased a cold wind blew over her face and rustled in the sage near her gradually the chill passed away and a stealing warmth took its place her eyes grew tired what had happened to her with eyes closed she thought it was all a dream then the feeling of the hard saddle as a pillow under her head told her she was indeed far from her comfortable little room what would poor aunt jane do in the morning when she discovered who was missing what would holley do when would bostil return it might be soon and it might be days and slonelucy felt sorriest for him for he loved her best she thrilled at thought of slone on that grand horseon her wildfire and with her mind running on and on seemingly making sleep impossible the thoughts at last became dreams lucy awakened at dawn one hand ached with cold for it had been outside the blanket her hard bed had cramped her muscles she heard the crackling of fire and smelled cedar smoke in the gray of morning she saw the creeches round a campfire  lucy got up then both men saw her but made no comment in that cold gray dawn she felt her predicament more gravely her hair was damp she had ridden nearly all night without a hat she had absolutely nothing of her own except what was on her body but lucy thanked her lucky stars that she had worn the thick ridingsuit and her boots for otherwise in a summer dress her condition would soon have been miserable  come an eat said creech you have sensean eat if it sticks in your throat  bostil had always contended in his arguments with riders that a man should eat heartily on the start of a trip so that the finish might find him strong and lucy ate though the coarse fare sickened her once she looked curiously at joel creech she felt his eyes upon her but instantly he averted them he had grown more haggard and sullen than ever before  the creeches did not loiter over the camp tasks lucy was left to herself the place appeared to be a kind of depression from which the desert rolled away to a bulge against the rosy east and the rocks behind rose broken and yellow fringed with cedars  git the hosses in if you want to creech called to her and then as lucy started off to where the mustangs grazed she heard him curse his son come back hyar leave the girl alone or ill rap you one  lucy drove three of the mustangs into camp where creech began to saddle them the remaining one the pack animal lucy found among the scrub cedars at the base of the low cliffs when she drove him in creech was talking hard to joel who had mounted  when you come back work up this canyon till you git up it heads on the pine plateau i cant miss seein you or any one long before you git up on top an you neednt come without bostils hosses you know what to tell bostil if he threatens you or refuses to send his hosses or turns his riders on my trail thets all now git  joel creech rode away toward the rise in the rolling barren desert  an now well go on said creech to lucy  when he had gotten all in readiness he ordered lucy to follow closely in his tracks he entered a narrow cleft in the low cliffs which wound in and out and was thick with sage and cedars lucy riding close to the cedars conceived the idea of plucking the little green berries and dropping them on parts of the trail where their tracks would not show warily she filled the pockets of her jacket  creech led the way without looking back and did not seem to care where the horses stepped the time had not yet come lucy concluded when he was ready to hide his trail presently the narrow cleft opened into a lowwalled canyon full of debris from the rotting cliffs and this in turn opened into a main canyon with mounting yellow crags it appeared to lead north far in the distance above rims and crags rose in a long black line like a horizon of dark cloud  creech crossed this wide canyon and entered one of the many breaks in the wall this one was full of splintered rock and weathered shalethe hardest kind of travel for both man and beast lucy was nothing if not considerate of a horse and here she began to help her animal in all the ways a good rider knows much as this taxed her attention she remembered to drop some of the cedar berries upon hard ground or rocks and she knew she was leaving a trail for slones keen eyes  that day was the swiftest and the most strenuous in all lucy bostils experience in the open at sunset when creech halted in a niche in a gorge between lowering cliffs lucy fell off her horse and lay still and spent on the grass  creech had a glance of sympathy and admiration for her but he did not say anything about the long days ride lucy never in her life before appreciated rest nor the softness of grass nor the relief at the end of a ride she lay still with a throbbing burning ache in all her body creech after he had turned the horses loose brought her a drink of cold water from the brook she heard somewhere near by  howfardidwecome she whispered  by the way round i reckon nigh on to sixty miles he replied but we aint half thet far from where we camped last night  then he set to work at camp tasks lucy shook her head when he brought her food but he insisted and she had to force it down creech appeared rough but kind after she had become used to the hard gaunt black face she saw sadness and thought in it one thing lucy had noticed was that creech never failed to spare a horse if it was possible he would climb on foot over bad places  night soon mantled the gorge in blackness thick as pitch lucy could not tell whether her eyes were open or shut so far as what she saw was concerned her eyes seemed filled however with a thousand pictures of the wild and tortuous canyons and gorges through which she had ridden that day the ache in her limbs and the fever in her blood would not let her sleep it seemed that these were forever to be a part of her for twelve hours she had ridden and walked with scarce a thought of the nature of the wild country yet once she lay down to rest her mind was an endless hurrying procession of picturesnarrow red clefts choked with green growthsyellow gorges and weathered slidesdusty treacherous divides connecting canyonsjumbles of ruined cliffs and piles of shalemiles and miles and endless winding miles yellow low beetling walls and through it all she had left a trail  next day creech climbed out of that lowwalled canyon and lucy saw a wild rocky country cut by gorges green and bare or yellow and cedared the long blackfringed line she had noticed the day before loomed closer overhanging this crisscrossed region of canyons every halfhour creech would lead them downward and presently climb out again there were sand and hard ground and thick turf and acres and acres of bare rock where even a shod horse would not leave a track  but the going was not so hardthere was not so much travel on foot for lucyand she finished that day in better condition than the first one  next day creech proceeded with care and caution many times he left the direct route bidding lucy wait for him and he would ride to the rims of canyons or the tops of ridges of cedar forests and from these vantagepoints he would survey the country lucy gathered after a while that he was apprehensive of what might be encountered and particularly so of what might be feared in pursuit lucy thought this strange because it was out of the question for any one to be so soon on creechs trail  these peculiar actions of creech were more noticeable on the third day and lucy grew apprehensive herself she could not divine why but when creech halted on a high crest that gave a sweeping vision of the broken tableland they had traversed lucy made out for herself faint moving specks miles behind  i reckon you see thet said creech  horses replied lucy  he nodded his head gloomily and seemed pondering a serious question  is some one trailing us asked lucy and she could not keep the tremor out of her voice  wal i should smile fer two daysan it sure beats me theyve never had a sight of us but they keep comin  they who she asked swiftly  i hate to tell you but i reckon i ought thets cordts an two of his gang  ohdont tell me so cried lucy suddenly terrified mention of cordts had not always had power to frighten her but this time she had a return of that shaking fear which had overcome her in the grove the night she was captured  cordts all right replied creech i knowed thet before i seen him fer two mornins back i seen his hoss grazin in thet wide canyon but i thought id slipped by some one seen us or they seen our trail anyway hes after us what beats me is how he sticks to thet trail cordts never was no tracker an since dick sears is dead there aint a tracker in cordtss outfit an i always could hide my tracks beats me  creech ive been leaving a trail confessed lucy  what  then she told him how she had been dropping cedar berries and bits of cedar leaves along the bare and stony course they had traversed  wal im creech stifled an oath then he laughed but gruffly you air a cute one but i reckon you didnt promise not to do thet an now if cordts gits you therell be only yourself to blame  oh cried lucy frantically looking back the moving specks were plainly in sight how can he know hes trailing me  thet i cant say mebbe he doesnt know his hosses air fresh though an if i cant shake him hell find out soon enough who hes trailin  go on we must shake him ill never do that again  for gods sake creech dont let him get me  and creech led down off the high open land into canyons again  the day ended and the night seemed a black blank to lucy another sunrise found creech leading on sparing neither lucy nor the horses he kept on a steady walk or trot and he picked out ground less likely to leave any tracks like an old deer he doubled on his trail he traveled down streambeds where the water left no trail that day the mustangs began to fail the others were wearing out  the canyons ran like the ribs of a washboard and they grew deep and verdant with looming towered walls that night lucy felt lost in an abyss the dreaming silence kept her awake many moments while sleep had already seized upon her eyelids and then she dreamed of cordts capturing her of carrying her miles deeper into these wild and purple cliffs of slone in pursuit on the stallion wildfire and of a savage fight and she awoke terrified and cold in the blackness of the night  on the next day creech traveled west this seemed to lucy to be far to the left of the direction taken before and lucy in spite of her utter weariness and the necessity of caring for herself and her horse could not but wonder at the wild and frowning canyon it was only a tributary of the great canyon she supposed but it was different strange impressive yet intimate because all about it was overpowering near at hand even the beetling crags and at every turn it seemed impossible to go farther over that narrow and rockbestrewn floor yet creech found a way on  then came hours of climbing such slopes and benches and ledges as lucy had not yet encountered the grasping spikes of dead cedar tore her dress to shreds and many a scratch burned her flesh about the middle of the afternoon creech led up over the last declivity a yellow slope of cedar to a flat upland covered with pine and high bleached grass they rested  weve fooled cordts you can be sure of thet said creech youre a game kid an by gawd if i had this job to do over id never tackle it again  oh youre sure weve lost him implored lucy  sure as i am of death an well make surer in crossin this bench its miles to the other side where im to keep watch fer joel an we wont leave a track all the way  but this grass questioned lucy itll show our tracks  look at the lanes an trails between all pine mats thick an soft an springy only an indian could follow us hyar on wild hoss bench  lucy gazed before her under the pines it was a beautiful forest with trees standing far apart yet not so far but that their foliage intermingled a dry fragrance thick as a heavy perfume blew into her face she could not help but think of firehow it would race through here and that recalled joel creechs horrible threat lucy shuddered and put away the memory i cant goany farthertoday she said  creech looked at her compassionately then lucy became conscious that of late he had softened  youll have to come he said theres no water on this side short of thet canyonbed an acrost theres water close under the wall  so they set out into the forest and lucy found that after all she could go on the horses walked and on the soft springy ground did not jar her deer and wild turkey abounded there and showed little alarm at sight of the travelers and before long lucy felt that she would become intoxicated by the dry odor it was so strong so thick so penetrating yet though she felt she would reel under its influence it revived her  the afternoon passed the sun set off through the pines a blackstreaked golden flare twilight shortly changed to night the trees looked spectral in the gloom and the forest appeared to grow thicker wolves murmured and there were wild cries of cat and owl lucy fell asleep on her horse at last sometime late in the night when creech lifted her from the saddle and laid her down she stretched out on the soft mat of pine needles and knew no more  she did not awaken until the afternoon of the next day the site where creech had made his final camp overlooked the wildest of all that wild upland country the pines had scattered and trooped around a beautiful park of grass that ended abruptly upon bare rock yellow crags towered above the rim and under them a yawning narrow gorge overshadowed from above blue in its depths split the end of the great plateau and opened out sheer into the head of the canyon which according to creech stretched away through that wilderness of red stone and green clefts when lucys fascinated gaze looked afar she was stunned at the vast billowy bare surfaces every green cleft was a short canyon running parallel with this central and longer one the dips and breaks showed how all these canyons were connected they led the gaze away descending gradually to the dim purple of distancethe bare rolling desert upland  lucy did nothing but gaze she was unable to walk or eat that day creech hung around her with a remorse he apparently felt yet could not put into words  do you expect joel to come up this big canyon  i reckon i dosome day replied creech an i wish hed hurry  does he know the way  nope but hes good at findin places an i told him to stick to the main canyon would you believe you could ride offer this rim straight down thar fer fifty miles an never git off your hoss  no i wouldnt believe it possible  wal its so ive done it an i didnt want to come up thet way because id had to leave tracks  do you think were safefrom cordts now she asked  i reckon so hes no tracker  but suppose he does trail us  wal i reckon ive a shade the best of cordts at gunplay any day  lucy regarded the man in surprise oh its sostrange she said youd fight for me yet you dragged me for days over these awful rocks  look at me creech do i look much like lucy bostil  creech hung his head wal i reckoned i wasnt a blackguard but i am  you used to care for me when i was little i remember how i used to take rides on your knee  lucy i never thought of thet when i ketched you you was only a means to an end bostil hated me he ruined me i give up to revenge an i could only git thet through you  creech im not defending dad heshes no good where horses are concerned i know he wronged you then why didnt you wait and meet him like a man instead of dragging me to this misery  wal i never thought of thet either i wished i had he grew gloomier then and relapsed into silent watching  lucy felt better next day and offered to help creech at the few camp duties he would not let her there was nothing to do but rest and wait and the idleness appeared to be harder on creech than on lucy he had always been exceedingly active lucy divined that every hour his remorse grew keener and she did all she could think of to make it so creech made her a rude brush by gathering small roots and binding them tightly and cutting the ends square and lucy after the manner of an indian got the tangles out of her hair that day creech seemed to want to hear lucys voice and so they often fell into conversation once he said thoughtfully  im tryin to remember somethin i heerd at the ford i meant to ask you suddenly he turned to her with animation he who had been so gloomy and lusterless and dead showed a bright eagerness i heerd you beat the king on a red hossa wild hoss  thet must have been a jokelike one of joels  no its true an dad nearly had a fit  wal creech simply blazed with excitement i aint wonderin if he did his own girl lucy come to remember you always said youd beat thet gray racer fer the lords sake tell me all about it  lucy warmed to him because broken as he was he could be genuinely glad some horse but his own had won a race bostil could never have been like that so lucy told him about the raceand then she had to tell about wildfire and then about slone but at first all of creechs interest centered round wildfire and the race that had not really been run he asked a hundred questions he was as pleased as a boy listening to a good story he praised lucy again and again he crowed over bostils discomfiture and when lucy told him that slone had dared her father to race had offered to bet wildfire and his own life against her hand then creech was beside himself  this hyar slonehe called bostils hand  hes a wildhorse hunter and he can trail us  trail us slone say lucy are you in love with him  lucy uttered a strange little broken sound half laugh half sob love him ah  an your dads agin him sure bostilll hate any rider with a fast hoss why didnt the darn fool sell his stallion to your father  he gave wildfire to me  id have done the same wal now when you git back home whats comin of it all  lucy shook her head sorrowfully god only knows dad will never own wildfire and hell never let me marry slone and when you take the king away from him to ransom methen my life will be hell for if dad sacrifices sage king afterward hell hate me as the cause of his loss  i can sure see the sense of all that replied creech soberly and he pondered  lucy saw through this man as if he had been an inch of crystal water he was no villain and just now in his simplicity in his plodding thought of sympathy for her he was lovable  its one hell of a muss if youll excuse my talk said creech an i dont like the looks of what i pear to be throwin in your way but see hyar lucy if bostil didnt give upor say he gits the king back thet wouldnt make your chance with slone any brighter  i dont know  thet race will have to be ran  what good will that do cried lucy with tears in her eyes i dont want to lose dad iilove himmean as he is and itll kill me to lose lin because wildfire can beat sage king and that means dad will be forever against him  couldnt this wildhorse feller let the king win thet race  oh he could but he wouldnt  cant you be sweet round himfetch him over to thet  oh i could but i wont  creech might have been plotting the happiness of his own daughter he was so deeply in earnest  wal mebbe you dont love each other so much after all fast hosses mean much to a man in this hyar country i know fer i lost mine  but they aint all i reckon you young folks dont love so much after all  butwedo cried lucy with a passionate sob all this talk had unnerved her  then the only way is fer slone to lie to bostil  lie exclaimed lucy  thets it fetch about a race somehowone bostil cant seean then lie an say the king run wildfire off his legs  suddenly it occurred to lucy that one significance of this idea of creechs had not dawned upon him you forget that soon my father will no longer own sage king or sarchedon or dusty benor any racer he loses them or me i thought thats what i am here for  creechs aspect changed the eagerness and sympathy fled from his face leaving it once more hard and stern he got up and stood a tall dark and gloomy man brooding over his loss as he watched the canyon still there was in him then a struggle that lucy felt presently he bent over and put his big hand on her head it seemed gentle and tender compared with former contacts and it made lucy thrill she could not see his face what did he mean she divined something startling and sat there trembling in suspense  bostil wont lose his only girlor his favorite hoss  lucy i never had no girl but it seems im rememberin them rides you used to have on my knee when you was little  then he strode away toward the forest lucy watched him with a full heart and as she thought of his overcoming the evil in him when her father had yielded to it she suffered poignant shame this creech was not a bad man he was going to let her go and he was going to return bostils horses when they came lucy resolved with a passionate determination that her father must make ample restitution for the loss creech had endured she meant to tell creech so  upon his return however he seemed so strange and forbidding again that her heart failed her had he reconsidered his generous thought lucy almost believed so these old horsetraders were incomprehensible in any relation concerning horses recalling creechs intense interest in wildfire and in the inevitable race to be run between him and sage king lucy almost believed that creech would sacrifice his vengeance just to see the red stallion beat the gray if creech kept the king in ransom for lucy he would have to stay deeply hidden in the wild breaks of the canyon country or leave the uplands for bostil would never let that deed go unreckoned with like bostil old creech was half horse and half human the human side had warmed to remorse he had regretted lucys plight he wanted her to be safe at home again and to find happiness he remembered what she had been to him when she was a little girl creechs other side was more complex  before the evening meal ended lucy divined that creech was dark and troubled because he had resigned himself to a sacrifice harder than it had seemed in the first flush of noble feeling but she doubted him no more she was safe the king would be returned she would compel her father to pay creech horse for horse and perhaps the lesson to bostil would be worth all the pain of effort and distress of mind that it had cost her  that night as she lay awake listening to the roar of the wind in the pines a strange premonitionlike a mysterious voicecame to her with the assurance that slone was on her trail  on the following day creech appeared to have cast off the brooding mood still he was not talkative he applied himself to constant watching from the rim  lucy began to feel rested that long trip with creech had made her thin and hard and strong she spent the hours under the shade of a cedar on the rim that protected her from sun and wind the wind particularly was hard to stand it blew a gale out of the west a dry odorous steady rush that roared through the pinetops and flattened the long white grass this day creech had to build up a barrier of rock round his campfire to keep it from blowing away and there was a constant danger of firing the grass  once lucy asked creech what would happen in that case  wal i reckon the grass would burn back even agin thet wind replied creech id hate to see fire in the woods now before the rains come its been the longest dryest spell i ever lived through but fer thet my hosses this hyars a west wind an its blowin harder every day itll fetch the rains  next day about noon when both wind and heat were high lucy was awakened from a doze creech was standing near her when he turned his long gaze away from the canyon he was smiling it was a smile at once triumphant and sad  joels comin with the hosses  lucy jumped up trembling and agitated oh  where where  creech pointed carefully with bent hand like an indian and lucy either could not get the direction or see far enough  right down along the base of thet red wall a line of hosses jest like a few crawlin ants  an now theyre creepin out of sight  oh i cant see them cried lucy are you sure  positive an sartin he replied joels comin hell be up hyar before long i reckon wed jest as well let him come fer theres water an grass hyar an down below grass is scarce  it seemed an age to lucy waiting there until she did see horses zigzagging the ridges below they disappeared and then it was another age before they reappeared close under the bulge of wall she thrilled at sight of sage king and sarchedon she got only a glimpse of them they must pass round under her to climb a split in the wall and up a long draw that reached level ground back in the forest but they were near and lucy tried to wait creech showed eagerness at first and then went on with his campfire duties while in camp he always cooked a midday meal  lucy saw the horses first she screamed out creech jumped up in alarm  joel creech mounted on sage king and leading sarchedon was coming at a gallop the other horses were following  whats his hurry demanded lucy after climbing out of that canyon joel ought not to push the horses  hell git it from me if theres no reason growled creech them hosses is wet  look at sarch hes wild he always hated joel  wal lucy i reckon i aint likin this hyar look at joel muttered creech and he strode out to meet his son  lucy ran out too and beyond him she saw only sage king he saw her recognized her and whistled even while joel was pulling him in for once the king showed he was glad to see lucy he had been having rough treatment but he was not windedonly hot and wet she assured herself of that then ran to quiet the plunging sarch he came down at once and pushed his big nose almost into her face she hugged his great hot neck he was quivering all over lucy heard the other horses pounding up she recognized two faces high whinny like a squeal and in her delight she was about to run to them when creechs harsh voice arrested her and sight of joels face suddenly made her weak  whatd you say demanded creech  id a good reason to run the hosses uphillthets what snapped joel he was frothing at the mouth  out with it  cordts an hutch  what roared creech grasping the pale joel and shaking him  cordts an hutch rode in behind me down at thet cross canyon they seen me an theyre after me hard  creech gave close and keen scrutiny to the strange face of his son then he wheeled away  help me pack an you too lucy weve got to rustle out of hyar  lucy fought a sick faintness that threatened to make her useless but she tried to help and presently action made her stronger  the creeches made short work of that breaking of camp but when it came to getting the horses there appeared danger of delay sarchedon had led dusty ben and two face off in the grass when joel went for them they galloped away toward the woods joel ran back  son youre a smart hossman exclaimed creech in disgust  shall i git on the king an ketch them  no hold the king creech went out after plume but the excited and wary horse eluded him then creech gave up caught his own mustangs and hurried into camp  lucy if cordts gits after sarch an the others itll be as well fer us he said  soon they were riding into the forest creech leading lucy in the center and joel coming behind on the king two unsaddled mustangs carrying the packs were driven in front creech limited the gait to the best that the packhorses could do they made fast time the level forest floor hard and springy afforded the best kind of going  a cold dread had once more clutched lucys heart what would be the end of this flight the way creech looked back increased her dread how horrible it would be if cordts accomplished what he had always threatenedto run off with both her and the king lucy lost her confidence in creech she did not glance again at joel once had been enough she rode on with heavy heart anxiety and dread and conjecture and a gradual sinking of spirit weighed her down yet she never had a clearer perception of outside things the forest loomed thicker and darker the sky was seen only through a green crisscross of foliage waving in the roaring gale this strong wind was like a blast in lucys face and its keen dryness cracked her lips  when they rode out of the forest down a gentle slope of windswept grass to an opening into a canyon lucy was surprised to recognize the place how quickly the ride through the forest had been made  creech dismounted git off lucy you joel hurry an hand me the little pack now ill take lucy an the king down in hyar you go thet way with the hosses an make as if you was hidin your trail but dont do you savvy  joel shook his head he looked sullen somber strange his father repeated what he had said  youre wantin cordts to split on the trail asked joel  sure hell ketch up with you sometime but you neednt be afeared if he does  i aint agoin to do thet  why not creech demanded slowly with a rising voice  im agoin with you what dye mean dad by this move youll be headin back fer the ford an wed git safer if we go the other way  creech evidently controlled his temper by an effort im takin lucy an the king back to bostil  joel echoed those words slowly divining them takin them both the girl an givin up the king  yes both of them ive changed my mind joel nowyou  but creech never finished what he meant to say joel creech was suddenly seized by a horrible madness it was then perhaps that the final thread which linked his mind to rationality stretched and snapped his face turned green his strange eyes protruded his jaw worked he frothed at the mouth he leaped apparently to get near his father but he missed his direction then as if sight had come back he wheeled and made strange gestures all the while cursing incoherently the fathers shocked face began to show disgust then part of joels ranting became intelligible  shut up suddenly roared creech  no i wont shrieked joel wagging his head in spent passion an you aint agoin to take thet girl home ill take her with me an you take the hosses home  youre crazy hoarsely shouted creech his face going black they allus said so but i never believed thet  an if im crazy thet girl made me you know what im agoin to do  ill strip her nakedan ill  lucy saw old creech lunge and strike she heard the sodden blow joel went down but he scrambled up with his eyes and mouth resembling those of a mad hound lucy once had seen the fact that he reached twice for his gun and could not find it proved the breaking connection of nerve and sense creech jumped and grappled with joel there was a wrestling strained struggle creechs hair stood up and his face had a kind of sick fury and he continued to curse and command they fought for the possession of the gun but joel seemed to have superhuman strength his hold on the gun could not be broken moreover he kept straining to point the gun at his father lucy screamed creech yelled hoarsely but the boy was beyond reason or help and he was beyond over powering lucy saw him bend his arm in spite of the desperate hold upon it and fire the gun creechs hoarse entreaties ceased as his hold on joel broke he staggered his arms went up with a tragic terrible gesture he fell joel stood over him shaking and livid but he showed only the vaguest realization of the deed his actions were instinctive he was the animal that had clawed himself free further proof of his aberration stood out in the action of sheathing his gun he made the motion to do so but he only dropped it in the grass  sight of that dropped gun broke lucys spell of horror which had kept her silent but for one scream suddenly her blood leaped like fire in her veins she measured the distance to sage king joel was turning then lucy darted at the king reached him and leaping was half up on him when he snorted and jumped not breaking her hold but keeping her from getting up then iron hands clutched her and threw her like an empty sack to the grass  joel creech did not say a word his distorted face had the deriding scorn of a superior being lucy lay flat on her back watching him her mind worked swiftly she would have to fight for her body and her life her terror had fled with her horror she was not now afraid of this demented boy she meant to fight calculating like a cunning indian wild as a trapped wildcat  lucy lay perfectly still for she knew she had been thrown near the spot where the gun lay if she got her hands on that gun she would kill joel it would be the action of an instant she watched joel while he watched her and she saw that he had his foot on the rope round sage kings neck the king never liked a rope he was nervous he tossed his head to get rid of it creech watching lucy all the while reached for the rope pulled the king closer and closer and untied the knot the king stood then bridle down and quiet instead of a saddle he wore a blanket strapped round him  it seemed that lucy located the gun without turning her eyes away from joels she gathered all her forcerolled over swiftlyagaingot her hands on the gun just as creech leaped like a panther upon her his weight crushed her flathis strength made her handhold like that of a child he threw the gun aside lucy lay face down unable to move her body while he stood over her then he struck her not a stunning blow but just the hard rap a cruel rider gives to a horse that wants its own way under that blow lucys spirit rose to a height of terrible passion still she did not lose her cunning the blow increased it that blow showed joel to be crazy she might outwit a crazy man where a man merely wicked might master her  creech tried to turn her lucy resisted and she was strong resistance infuriated creech he cuffed her sharply this action only made him worse then with hands like steel claws he tore away her blouse  the shock of his hands on her bare flesh momentarily weakened lucy and creech dragged at her until she lay seemingly helpless before him  and lucy saw that at the sight of her like this something had come between joel creechs mad motives and their execution once he had loved herdesired her he looked vague he stroked her shoulder his strange eyes softened then blazed with a different light lucy divined that she was lost unless she could recall his insane fury she must begin that terrible fight in which now the best she could hope for was to make him kill her quickly  swift and vicious as a cat she fastened her teeth in his arm she bit deep and held on creech howled like a dog he beat her he jerked and wrestled then he lifted her and the swing of her body tore the flesh loose from his arm and broke her hold lucy half rose crawled plunged for the gun she got it too only to have creech kick it out of her hand the pain of that brutal kick was severe but when he cut her across the bare back with the rope she shrieked out supple and quick she leaped up and ran in vain with a few bounds he had her again tripped her up lucy fell over the dead body of the father yet even that did not shake her desperate nerve all the ferocity of a desertbred savage culminated in her fighting for death  creech leaned down swinging the coiled rope he meant to do more than lash her with it lucys hands flashed up closed tight in his long hair then with a bellow he jerked up and lifted her sheer off the ground there was an instant in which lucy felt herself swung and torn she saw everything as a whirling blur she felt an agony in her wrists at which creech was clawing when he broke her hold there were handfuls of hair in lucys fists  she fell again and had not the strength to rise but creech was raging and little of his broken speech was intelligible he knelt with a sharp knee pressing her down he cut the rope nimbly like a rider in moments of needful swiftness he noosed one end of the rope round her ankle then the end of the other piece round her wrist he might have been tying up an unbroken mustang rising he retained hold on both ropes he moved back sliding them through his hands then with a quick move he caught up sage kings bridle  creech paused a moment darkly triumphant a hideous success showed in his strange eyes a longcherished mad vengeance had reached its fruition then he led the horse near to lucy  warily he reached down he did not know lucys strength was spent he feared she might yet escape with hard quick grasp he caught her lifted her threw her over the kings back he forced her down  lucys resistance was her only salvation because it kept him on the track of his old threat she resisted all she could he pulled her arms down round the kings neck and tied them close then he pulled hard on the rope on her ankle and tied that to her other ankle  lucy realized that she was bound fast creech had made good most of his threat and now in her mind the hope of the death she had sought changed to the hope of life that was possible whatever power she had ever had over the king was in her voice if only creech would slip the bridle or cut the reinsif only sage king could be free to run  lucy could turn her face far enough to see creech like a fiend he was reveling in his work suddenly he picked up the gun  look ahyar he called hoarsely  with eyes on her grinning horribly he walked a few paces to where the long grass had not been trampled or pressed down the wind whipping up out of the canyon was still blowing hard creech put the gun down in the grass and fired  sage king plunged but he was not gunshy he steadied down with a pounding of heavy hoofs then lucy could see again a thin streak of yellow smoke rosea little snaky flamea slight crackling hiss then as the wind caught the blaze there came a rushing low roar fire like magic raced and spread before the wind toward the forest  lucy had forgotten that creech had meant to drive her into fire the sudden horror of it almost caused collapse commotion withincold and quake and nausea and agonydeadened her hearing and darkened her sight but creechs hard hands quickened her she could see him then though not clearly his face seemed inhuman misshapen gray his hands pulled at her armsa last precaution to see that she was tightly bound then with the deft fingers of a rider he slipped sage kings bridle  lucy could not trust her sight what made the king stand so still his ears went upstiffpointed  creech stepped back and laid a violent hand on lucys garments she benttwisted her neck to watch him but her sight grew no clearer still she saw he meant to strip her naked he braced himself for a strong ripping pull his yellow teeth showed deep in his lip his contrasting eyes were alight with insane joy  but he never pulled something attracted his attention he looked he saw something the beast in him became humanthe madness changed to rationalitythe devil to a craven his ashen lips uttered a low terrible cry  lucy felt the king trembling in every muscle she knew that was flight she expected his loud snort and was prepared for it when it rang out in a second he would bolt she knew that she thrilled she tried to call to him but her lips were weak creech seemed paralyzed the king shifted his position and lucys last glimpse of creech was one she would never forget it was as if creech faced burning hell  then the king whistled and reared lucy heard swift dull throbbing beats beats of a fast horses hoofs on the run she felt a surging thrill of joy she could not think all of her blood and bone and muscle seemed to throb suddenly the air split to a highpitched wild whistling blast it pierced to lucys mind she knew that whistle  wildfire she screamed with bursting heart  the king gave a mighty convulsive bound of terror he too knew that whistle and in that one great bound he launched out into a run straight across the line of burning grass lucy felt the sting of flame smoke blinded and choked her then clear dry keen wind sung in her ears and whipped her hair the light about her darkened the king had headed into the pines the heavy roar of the gale overhead struck lucy with new and torturing dread sage king once in his life was running away bridleless and behind him there was fire on the wings of the wind    chapter xvii  for the first time in his experience bostil found that horsetrading palled upon him this trip to durango was a failure something was wrong there was a voice constantly calling into his inner eara voice to which he refused to listen and during the five days of the return trip the strange mood grew upon him  the last day he and his riders covered over fifty miles and reached the ford late at night no one expected them and only the men on duty at the corrals knew of the return bostil much relieved to get home went to bed and at once fell asleep  he awakened at a late hour for him when he dressed and went out to the kitchen he found that his sister had learned of his return and had breakfast waiting  wheres the girl asked bostil  not up yet replied aunt jane  what  lucy and i had a tiff last night and she went to her room in a temper  nothin new about thet  holley and i have had our troubles holding her in dont you forget that  bostil laughed wal call her an tell her im home  aunt jane did as she was bidden bostil finished his breakfast but lucy did not come  bostil began to feel something strange and going to lucys door he knocked there was no reply bostil pushed open the door lucy was not in evidence and her room was not as tidy as usual he saw her white dress thrown upon the bed she had not slept in bostil gazed around with a queer contraction of the heart that sense of something amiss grew stronger then he saw a chair before the open window that window was rather high and lucy had placed a chair before it so that she could look out or get out bostil stretched his neck looked out and in the red earth beneath the window he saw fresh tracks of lucys boots then he roared for jane  she came running and between bostils furious questions and her own excited answers there was nothing arrived at but presently she spied the white dress and then she ran to lucys closet from there she turned a white face to bostil  she put on her ridingclothes gasped aunt jane  supposin she did where is she demanded bostil  shes run off with slone  bostil could not have been shocked or hurt any more acutely by a knifethrust he glared at his sister  ahuh so thets the way you watch her  watch her it wasnt possible sheswell shes as smart as you are oh i knew shed do it she was wild in love with him  bostil strode out of the room and the house he went through the grove and directly up the path to slones cabin it was empty just as bostil expected to find it  the bars of the corral were down both slones horses were gone presently bostil saw the black horse nagger down in bracktons pasture  there were riders in front of bracktons all spoke at once to bostil and he only yelled for brackton the old man came hurriedly out alarmed  wheres this slone demanded bostil  slone ejaculated brackton im blessed if i know aint he home  no an hes left his black hoss in your field  wal by golly thets news to me bostil theres been strange doins lately brackton seemed at a loss for words mebbe slone got out because of somethin thet come off last night now joel creech anan  bostil waited to hear no more what did he care about the idiot creech he strode down the lane to the corrals farlane van and other riders were there leisurely as usual then holley appeared coming out of the barn he too was easy cool natural lazy none of these riders knew what was amiss but instantly a change passed over them it came because bostil pulled a gun holley ive a mind to bore you  the old hawkeyed rider did not flinch or turn a shade off color what fer he queried but his customary drawl was wanting  i left you to watch lucy an shes gone  holley showed genuine surprise and distress the other riders echoed bostils last word bostil lowered the gun  i reckon what saves you is youre the only tracker thetd have a show to find this cussed slone  holley now showed no sign of surprise but the other riders were astounded  lucys run off with slone added bostil  wal if shes gone an if hes gone its a cinch replied holley throwing up his hands boss she doublecrossed me same as you  she promised faithful to stay in the house  promises nothin roared bostil shes in love with this wildhoss wrangler she met him last night  i couldnt help thet retorted holley an i trusted the girl  bostil tossed his hands he struggled with his rage he had no fear that lucy would not soon be found but the opposition to his will made him furious  van left the group of riders and came close to bostil it aint an hour back thet i seen slone ride off alone on his red hoss  what of thet demanded bostil sure she was waitin somewheres theyd have too much sense to go together saddle up you boys an well  say bostil i happen to know slone didnt see lucy last night interrupted holley  ahuh wal youd better talk out  i trusted lucy said holley but all the same knowin she was in love i jest wanted to see if any girl in love could keep her word so about dark i went down the grove an watched fer slone pretty soon i seen him he sneaked along the upper end an i follered he went to thet bench up by the biggest cottonwood an he waited a long time but lucy didnt come he must have waited till midnight then he left i watched him go backseen him go up to his cabin  wal if she didnt meet him where was she she wasnt in her room  bostil gazed at holley and the other riders then back to holley what was the matter with this old rider bostil had never seen holley seem so strange the whole affair began to loom strangely darkly some portent quickened bostils lumbering pulse it seemed that holleys mind must have found an obstacle to thought suddenly the old riders face changedthe bronze was blotted outa grayness came and then a dead white  bostil mebbe you aint been told yet thetthet creech rode in yesterday he lost all his racers he had to shoot both peg an roan  bostils thought suffered a sudden blank halt then with realization came the shock for which he had long been prepared  ahuh is thet so  wal an what did he say  holley laughed a grim significant laugh that curdled bostils blood creech said a lot but let thet go now come with me  holley started with rapid strides down the lane bostil followed and he heard the riders coming behind a dark and gloomy thought settled upon bostil he could not check that but he held back impatience and passion  holley went straight to lucys window he got down on his knees to scrutinize the tracks  made more n twelve hours ago he said swiftly she had on her boots but no spurs now lets see where she went  holley began to trail lucys progress through the grove silently pointing now and then to a track he went swifter till bostil had to hurry the other men came whispering after them  holley was as keen as a hound on scent  she stopped there he said mebbe to listen looks like she wanted to cross the lane but she didnt here she got to goin faster  holley reached an intersecting path and suddenly halted stockstill pointing at a big track in the dust  my god  bostil look at thet  one riving pang tore through bostiland then he was suddenly his old self facing the truth of danger to one he loved he saw beside the big track a faint imprint of lucys small foot that was the last sign of her progress and it told a story  bostil thet aint slones track said holley ringingly  sure it aint thets the track of a big man replied bostil  the other riders circling round with bent heads all said one way or another that slone could not have made the trail  an whoever he was grabbed lucy upmade off with her asked bostil  plain as if we seen it done exclaimed holley there was fire in the clear hawk eyes  cordts cried bostil hoarsely  mebbemebbe but thet aint my idee come on  holley went so fast he almost ran and he got ahead of bostil finally several hundred yards out in the sage he halted and again dropped to his knees bostil and the riders hurried on  keep back dont stamp round so close ordered holley then like a man searching for lost gold in sand and grass he searched the ground to bostil it seemed a long time before he got through when he arose there was a dark and deadly certainty in his face by which bostil knew the worst had befallen lucy  four mustangs an two men last night said holley rapidly heres where lucy was set down on her feet heres where she mounted an heres the tracks of a third mantracks made this mornin  bostil straightened up and faced holley as if ready to take a deathblow im reckonin them last is slones tracks  yes i know them replied holley  anthemother tracks who made them  creech an his son  bostil felt swept away by a dark whirling flame and when it passed he lay in his barn in the shade of the loft prostrate on the fragrant hay his strength with his passion was spent a dull ache remained the fight was gone from him his spirit was broken and he looked down into that dark abyss which was his own soul  by and by the riders came for him got him up and led him out he shook them off and stood breathing slowly the air felt refreshing it cooled his hot tired brain it did not surprise him to see joel creech there cringing behind holley  bostil lifted a hand for some one to speak and holley came a step forward his face was haggard but its white tenseness was gone he seemed as if he were reluctant to speak to inflict more pain  bostil he began huskily youre to send the kingan sarchan ben an two face an plume to ransom lucy  if you wontthen creechll sell her to cordts  what a strange look came into the faces of the riders did they think he cared more for horseflesh than for his own flesh and blood  send the kingan all he wants an send word fer creech to come back to the ford tell him i saidmy sin found me out  bostil watched joel creech ride the king out upon the slope driving the others ahead sage king wanted to run sarchedon was wild and unruly they passed out of sight then bostil turned to his silent riders  boys seein the king go thet way wasnt nothin but what crucifies me iswill thet fetch her back  god only knows replied holley mebbe noti reckon not  but bostil you forget slone is out there on lucys trail out there ahead of joel slone hes a wildhoss hunterthe keenest i ever seen do you think creech can shake him on a trail hell kill creech an hell lay fer joel goin backan hell kill him an ill bet my all hell ride in here with lucy an the king  holley you aint figurin on thet red hoss of slones ridin down the king  holley laughed as if bostils query was the strangest thing of all that poignant day naw slonell lay fer joel an rope him like he roped dick sears  holley i reckon you seeclearer n me said bostil plaintively pears as if i never had a hard knock before fer my nerves broke i cant hope lucys gone  aint there anythin to do but wait  thets all jest wait if we went out on joels trail wed queer the chance of creechs bein honest an wed queer slones game id hate to have him trailin me    chapter xviii  on the day that old creech repudiated his son slone with immeasurable relief left bracktons without even a word to the rejoicing holley and plodded up the path to his cabin  after the first flush of elation had passed he found a peculiar mood settling down upon him it was as if all was not so well as he had impulsively conceived he began to ponder over this strange depression to think back what had happened to dash the cup from his lips did he regret being freed from guilt in the simple minds of the villagersregret it because suspicion would fall upon lucys father no he was sorry for the girl but not for bostil it was not this new aspect of the situation at the ford that oppressed him  he trailed his vague feelings back to a subtle shock he had sustained in a last look at creechs dark somber face it had been the face of a nemesis all about creech breathed silent revengeful force slone worked out in his plodding thought why that fact should oppress him and it was because in striking bostil old creech must strike through bostils horses and his daughter  slone divined itdivined it by the subtle intuitive power of his love for lucy he did not reconsider what had been his supposition before creechs returnthat creech would kill bostil death would be no revenge creech had it in him to steal the king and starve him or to do the same and worse with lucy so slone imagined remembering creechs face  before twilight set in slone saw the creeches riding out of the lane into the sage evidently leaving the ford this occasioned slone great relief but only for a moment what the creeches appeared to be doing might not be significant and he knew if they had stayed in the village that he would have watched them as closely as if he thought they were trying to steal wildfire  he got his evening meal cared for his horses and just as darkness came on he slipped down into the grove for his rendezvous with lucy always this made his heart beat and his nerves thrill but tonight he was excited the grove seemed full of moving shadows all of which he fancied were lucy reaching the big cottonwood he tried to compose himself on the bench to wait but composure seemed unattainable the night was still only the crickets and the soft rustle of leaves breaking a dead silence slone had the ears of a wild horse in that he imagined sounds he did not really hear many a lonely night while he lay watching and waiting in the dark ambushing a waterhole where wild horses drank he had heard soft treads that were only the substance of dreams that was why on this night when he was overstrained he fancied he saw lucy coming a silent moving shadow when in reality she did not come that was why he thought he heard very stealthy steps  he waited lucy did not come she had never failed before and he knew she would come waiting became hard he wanted to go back toward the houseto intercept her on the way still he kept to his post watchful listening his heart full and he tried to reason away his strange dread his sense of a need of hurry for a time he succeeded by dreaming of lucys sweetness of her courage of what a wonderful girl she was hours and hours he had passed in such dreams one dream in particular always fascinated him and it was one in which he saw the girl riding wildfire winning a great race for her life another just as fascinating but so haunting that he always dispelled it was a dream where lucy alone and in peril fought with cordts or joel creech for more than her life these vague dreams were slones acceptance of the blood and spirit in lucy she was bostils daughter she had no sense of fear she would fight and though slone always thrilled with pride he also trembled with dread  at length even wilder dreams of lucys rare moments when she let herself go like a desert whirlwind to envelop him in all her sweetness could not avail to keep slone patient he began to pace to and fro under the big tree he waited and waited what could have detained her slone inwardly laughed at the idea that either holley or aunt jane could keep his girl indoors when she wanted to come out to meet him yet lucy had always said something might prevent there was no reason for slone to be concerned he was mistaking his thrills and excitement and love and disappointment for something in which there was no reality yet he could not help it the longer he waited the more shadows glided beneath the cottonwoods the more faint nameless sounds he heard  he waited long after he became convinced she would not come upon his return through the grove he reached a point where the unreal and imaginative perceptions were suddenly and stunningly broken he did hear a step he kept on as before and in the deep shadow he turned he saw a man just faintly outlined one of the riders had been watching himhad followed him slone had always expected this so had lucy and now it had happened but lucy had been too clever she had not come she had found out or suspected the spy and she had outwitted him slone had reason to be prouder of lucy and he went back to his cabin free from further anxiety  before he went to sleep however he heard the clatter of a number of horses in the lane he could tell they were tired horses riders returning he thought and instantly corrected that for riders seldom came in at night and then it occurred to him that it might be bostils return but then it might be the creeches slone had an uneasy return of puzzling thoughts these however did not hinder drowsiness and deciding that the first thing in the morning he would trail the creeches just to see where they had gone he fell asleep  in the morning the bright broad day with its dispelling reality made slone regard himself differently things that oppressed him in the dark of night vanished in the light of the sun still he was curious about the creeches and after he had done his mornings work he strolled out to take up their trail it was not hard to follow in the lane for no other horses had gone in that direction since the creeches had left  once up on the wide windy slope the reach and color and fragrance seemed to call to slone irresistibly and he fell to trailing these tracks just for the love of a skill long unused half a mile out the road turned toward durango but the creeches did not continue on that road they entered the sage instantly slone became curious  he followed the tracks to a pile of rocks where the creeches had made a greasewood fire and had cooked a meal this was strangewithin a mile of the ford where brackton and others would have housed them what was stranger was the fact that the trail started south from there and swung round toward the village  slones heart began to thump but he forced himself to think only of these tracks and not any significance they might have he trailed the men down to a bench on the slope a few hundred yards from bostils grove and here a trampled space marked where a halt had been made and a wait  and here slone could no longer restrain conjecture and dread he searched and searched he got on his knees he crawled through the sage all around the trampled space suddenly his heart seemed to receive a stab he had found prints of lucys boots in the soft earth and he leaped up wild and fierce needing to know no more  he ran back to his cabin he never thought of bostil of holley of anything except the story revealed in those little boottracks he packed a saddlebag with meat and biscuits filled a canvas waterbottle and taking them and his rifle he hurried out to the corral first he took nagger down to bracktons pasture and let him in then returning he went at the fiery stallion as he had not gone in many a day roped him saddled him mounted him and rode off with a hard grim certainty that in wildfire was lucys salvation  four hours later slone halted on the crest of a ridge in the cover of sparse cedars and surveyed a vast gray barren basin yawning and reaching out to a rugged broken plateau  he expected to find joel creech returning on the backtrail and he had taken the precaution to ride on one side of the tracks he was following he did not want joel to cross his trail slone had long ago solved the meaning of the creeches flight they would use lucy to ransom bostils horses and more than likely they would not let her go back that they had her was enough for slone he was grim and implacable  the eyes of the wildhorse hunter had not searched that basin long before they picked out a dot which was not a rock or a cedar but a horse slone watched it grow and hidden himself he held his post until he knew the rider was joel creech slone drew his own horse back and tied him to a sagebush amidst some scant grass then he returned to watch it appeared creech was climbing the ridge below slone and some distance away it was a desperate chance joel ran then for slone had set out to kill him it was certain that if joel had happened to ride near instead of far slone could not have helped but kill him as it was he desisted because he realized that joel would acquaint bostil with the abducting of lucy and it might be that this would be well  slone was shaking when young creech passed up and out of sight over the ridgeshaking with the deadly grip of passion such as he had never known he waited slowly gaining control and at length went back for wildfire  then he rode boldly forth on the trail he calculated that old creech would take lucy to some wild retreat in the canyons and there wait for joel and the horses creech had almost certainly gone on and would be unaware of a pursuer so closely on his trail slone took the direction of the trail and he saw a low dark notch in the rocky wall in the distance after that he paid no more attention to choosing good ground for wildfire than he did to the trail the stallion was more tractable than slone had ever found him he loved the open he smelled the sage and the wild he settled down into his long easy swinging lope which seemed to eat up the miles slone was obsessed with thoughts centering round lucy and time and distance were scarcely significant  the sun had dipped full red in a golden west when slone reached the wall of rocks and the cleft where creechs tracks and lucys too marked the camp slone did not even dismount riding on into the cleft he wound at length into a canyon and out of that into a larger one where he found that lucy had remembered to leave a trail and down this to a break in a high wall and through it to another winding canyon the sun set but slone kept on as long as he could see the trail and after that until an intersecting canyon made it wise for him to halt  there were rich grass and sweet water for his horse he himself was not hungry but he ate he was not sleepy but he slept and daylight found him urging wildfire in pursuit on the rocky places slone found the cedar berries lucy had dropped he welcomed sight of them but he did not need them this man creech could never hide a trail from him slone thought grimly and it suited him to follow that trail at a rapid trot if he lost the tracks for a distance he went right on and he knew where to look for them ahead there was a vast difference between the cunning of creech and the cunning of a wild horse and there was an equal difference between the going and staying powers of creechs mustangs and wildfire yes slone divined that lucys salvation would be wildfire her horse the trail grew rougher steeper harder but the stallion kept his eagerness and his pace on many an open length of canyon or height of wild upland slone gazed ahead hoping to see creechs mustangs he hoped for that even when he knew he was still too far behind and then suddenly in the open sandy flat of an intersecting canyon he came abruptly on a fresh trail of three horses one of them shod  the surprise stunned him for a moment he gazed stupidly at these strange tracks who had made them had creech met allies was that likely when the man had no friends pondering the thing slone went slowly on realizing that a new and disturbing feature confronted him then when these new tracks met the trail that creech had left slone found that these strangers were as interested in creechs tracks as he was slone found their bootmarks in the sandthe handprints where some one had knelt to scrutinize creechs trail  slone led his horse and walked on more and more disturbed in mind when he came to a larger bare flat canyon bottom where the rock had been washed clear of sand he found no more cedar berries they had been picked up at the other extreme edge of this stony ground he found crumpled bits of cedar and cedar berries scattered in one spot as if thrown there by some one who read their meaning  this discovery unnerved slone it meant so much and if slone had any hope or reason to doubt that these strangers had taken up the trail for good the next few miles dispelled it they were trailing creech  suddenly slone gave a wild start which made wildfire plunge  cordts whispered slone and the cold sweat oozed out of every pore  these canyons were the hidingplaces of the horsethief he and two of his men had chanced upon creechs trail and perhaps their guess at its meaning was like slones if they had not guessed they would soon learn it magnified slones task a thousandfold he had a moment of bitter almost hopeless realization before a more desperate spirit awoke in him he had only more men to killthat was all these upland riders did not pack rifles of that slone was sure and the sooner he came up with cordts the better it was then he let wildfire choose his gait and the trail sunset twilight dusk and darkness came with slone keeping on and on as long as there were no intersecting canyons or clefts or slopes by which creech might have swerved from his course just so long slone would travel and it was late in the night when he had to halt  early next day the trail led up out of the red and broken gulches to the cedared uplands slone saw a blackrimmed looming plateau in the distance all these winding canyons and the necks of the high ridges between must run up to that great tableland  that day he lost two of the horse tracks he did not mark the change for a long time after there had been a split in the party that had been trailing creech then it was too late for him to go back to investigate even if that had been wise he kept on pondering trying to decide whether or not he had been discovered and was now in danger of ambush ahead and pursuit from behind he thought that possibly cordts had split his party one to trail along after creech the others to work around to head him off undoubtedly cordts knew this broken canyon country and could tell where creech was going and knew how to intercept him  the uncertainty wore heavily upon slone he grew desperate he had no time to steal along cautiously he must be the first to get to creech so he held to the trail and went as rapidly as the nature of the ground would permit expecting to be shot at from any clump of cedars the trail led down again into a narrow canyon with low walls slone put all his keenness on what lay before him  wildfires sudden break and upflinging of head and his snort preceded the crack of a rifle slone knew he had been shot at although he neither felt nor heard the bullet he had no chance to see where the shot came from for wildfire bolted and needed as much holding and guiding as slone could give he ran a mile then slone was able to look about him had he been shot at from above or behind he could not tell it did not matter so long as the danger was not in front he kept a sharp lookout and presently along the right canyon rim five hundred feet above him he saw a bay horse and a rider with a rifle he had been wrong then about these riders and their weapons slone did not see any wisdom in halting to shoot up at this pursuer and he spurred wildfire just as a sharp crack sounded above the bullet thudded into the earth a few feet behind him and then over bad ground with the stallion almost unmanageable slone ran a gantlet of shots evidently the man on the rim had smooth ground to ride over for he easily kept abreast of slone but he could not get the range fortunately for slone broken ramparts above checked the tricks of that pursuer and slone saw no more of him  it afforded him great relief to find that creechs trail turned into a canyon on the left and here with the sun already low slone began to watch the clumps of cedars and the jumbles of rock but he was not ambushed darkness set in and being tired out he was about to halt for the night when he caught the flicker of a campfire the stallion saw it too but did not snort slone dismounted and leading him went cautiously forward on foot rifle in hand  the canyon widened at a point where two breaks occurred and the lessrestricted space was thick with cedar and pinyon slone could tell by the presence of these trees and also by a keener atmosphere that he was slowly getting to a higher attitude this campfire must belong to cordts or the one man who had gone on ahead and slone advanced boldly he did not have to make up his mind what to do  but he was amazed to see several dark forms moving to and fro before the bright campfire and he checked himself abruptly considering a moment slone thought he had better have a look at these fellows so he tied wildfire and taking to the darker side of the canyon he stole cautiously forward  the distance was considerable as he had calculated soon however he made out the shadowy outlines of horses feeding in the open he hugged the canyon wall for fear they might see him as luck would have it the night breeze was in his favor stealthily he stole on in the deep shadow of the wall and under the cedars until he came to a point opposite the campfire and then he turned toward it he went slowly carefully noiselessly and at last he crawled through the narrow aisles between thick sagebrush another clump of cedars loomed up and he saw the flickering of firelight upon the palegreen foliage  he heard gruff voices before he raised himself to look and by this he gauged his distance he was close enoughalmost too close but as he crouched in dark shade and there were no horses near he did not fear discovery  when he peered out from his covert the first thing to strike and hold his rapid glance was the slight figure of a girl slone stifled a gasp in his throat he thought he recognized lucy stunned he crouched down again with his hands clenched round his rifle and there he remained for a long moment of agony before reason asserted itself over emotion had he really seen lucy he had heard of a girl now and then in the camps of these men especially cordts maybe creech had fallen in with comrades no he could not have had any comrades there but horsethieves and creech was above that if creech was there he had been held up by cordts if lucy only was with the gang creech had been killed  slone had to force himself to look again the girl had changed her position but the light shone upon the men creech was not one of the three nor cordts nor any man slone had seen before they were not honest men judging from their hard evil looks slone was nonplussed and he was losing selfcontrol again he lowered himself and waited he caught the word durango and hosses and fer enough in the meaning of which was vague then the girl laughed and slone found himself trembling with joy beyond any doubt that laugh could not have been lucys  slone stole back as he had come reached the shadow of the wall and drew away until he felt it safe to walk quickly when he reached the place where he expected to find wildfire he did not see him slone looked and looked perhaps he had misjudged distance and place in the gloom still he never made mistakes of that nature he searched around till he found the cedar stump to which he had tied the lasso in the gloom he could not see it and when he reached out he did not feel it wildfire was gone slone sank down overcome he cursed what must have been carelessness though he knew he never was careless with a horse what had happened he did not know but wildfire was goneand that meant lucys doom and his slone shook with cold  then as he leaned against the stump wet and shaking familiar sound met his ears it was made by the teeth of a grazing horsea slight keen tearing cut wildfire was close at hand with a sweep slone circled the stump and he found the knot of the lasso he had missed it he began to gather in the long rope and soon felt the horse in the black gloom against the wall slone could not distinguish wildfire  whew he muttered wiping the sweat off his face good lord  all for nothin  it did not take slone long to decide to lead the horse and work up the canyon past the campers he must get ahead of them and once there he had no fear of them either by night or day he really had no hopes of getting by undiscovered and all he wished for was to get far enough so that he could not be intercepted the grazing horses would scent wildfire or he would scent them  for a wonder wildfire allowed himself to be led as well as if he had been old faithful nagger slone could not keep close in to the wall for very long on account of the cedars but he managed to stay in the outer edge of shadow cast by the wall wildfire winded the horses halted threw up his head but for some reason beyond slone the horse did not snort or whistle as he knew wildfire he could have believed him intelligent enough and hateful enough to betray his master  it was one of the other horses that whistled an alarm this came at a point almost even with the campfire slone holding wildfire down had no time to get into a stirrup but leaped to the saddle and let the horse go there were hoarse yells and then streaks of fire and shots slone heard the whizz of heavy bullets and he feared for wildfire but the horse drew swiftly away into the darkness slone could not see whether the ground was smooth or broken and he left that to wildfire luck favored them and presently slone pulled him in to a safe gait and regretted only that he had not had a chance to take a shot at that camp  slone walked the horse for an hour and then decided that he could well risk a halt for the night  before dawn he was up warming his chilled body by violent movements and forcing himself to eat  the rim of the west wall changed from gray to pink a mockingbird burst into song a coyote sneaked away from the light of day out in the open slone found the trail made by creechs mustangs and by the horse of cordtss man the latter could not be very far ahead in less than an hour slone came to a clump of cedars where this man had camped an hour behind him  this canyon was open with a level and narrow floor divided by a deep wash slone put wildfire to a gallop the narrow wash was no obstacle to wildfire he did not have to be urged or checked it was not long before slone saw a horseman a quarter of a mile ahead and he was discovered almost at the same time this fellow showed both surprise and fear he ran his horse but in comparison with wildfire that horse seemed sluggish slone would have caught up with him very soon but for a change in the lay of the land the canyon split up and all of its gorges and ravines and washes headed upon the pinefringed plateau now only a few miles distant the gait of the horses had to be reduced to a trot and then a walk the man slone was after left creechs trail and took to a side cleft slone convinced he would soon overhaul him and then return to take up creechs trail kept on in pursuit then slone was compelled to climb wildfire was so superior to the others horse and slone was so keen at choosing ground and short cuts that he would have been right upon him but for a split in the rock which suddenly yawned across his path it was impassable after a quick glance slone abandoned the direct pursuit and turning along this gulch he gained a point where the horsethief would pass under the base of the rimwall and here slone would have him within easy rifle shot  and the man intent on getting out of the canyon rode into the trap approaching to within a hundred yards of slone who suddenly showed himself on foot rifle in hand the deep gulch was a barrier to slones further progress but his rifle dominated the situation  hold on he called warningly  hold on yerself yelled the other aghast as he halted his horse he gazed down and evidently was quick to take in the facts  slone had meant to kill this man without even a word yet now when the moment had come a feeling almost of sickness clouded his resolve but he leveled the rifle  i got it on you he called  reckon you hev but see hyar  i can hit you anywhere  wal ill take yer word fer thet  all right now talk fast are you one of cordtss gang  sure  why are you alone  we split down hyar  did you know i was on this trail  nope i didnt sure or youd never ketched me red hoss or no  who were you trailin  ole creech an the girl he kidnapped  slone felt the leap of his blood and the jerk it gave the rifle as his tense finger trembled on the trigger  girl what girl he called hoarsely  bostils girl  why did cordts split on the trail  he an hutch went round fer some more of the gang an to head off joel creech when he comes in with bostils hosses  slone was amazed to find how the horse thieves had calculated yet on second thought the situation once the creeches had been recognized appeared simple enough  what was your game he demanded  i was follerin creech jest to find out where hed hole up with the girl  whats cordtss gameafter he heads joel creech  then hes goin fer the girl  slone scarcely needed to be told all this but the deliberate words from the lips of one of cordtss gang bore a raw brutal proof of lucys peril and yet slone could not bring himself to kill this man in cold blood he tried but in vain  have you got a gun called slone hoarsely  sure  ride back the other way  if you dont lose me ill kill you  the man stared slone saw the color return to his pale face then he turned his horse and rode back out of sight slone heard him rolling the stones down the long rough slope and when he felt sure the horsethief had gotten a fair start he went back to mount wildfire in pursuit  this trailer of lucy never got back to lucys trailnever got away  but slone when that days hard deadly pursuit ended found himself lost in the canyons how bitterly he cursed both his weakness in not shooting the man at sight and his strength in following him with implacable purpose for to be fair to give the horsethief a chance for his life slone had lost lucys trail the fact nearly distracted him he spent a sleepless night of torture  all next day like a wild man he rode and climbed and descended spurred by one purpose pursued by suspense and dread that night he tied wildfire near water and grass and fell into the sleep of exhaustion  morning came but with it no hope he had been desperate and now he was in a frightful state it seemed that days and days had passed and nights that were hideous with futile nightmares  he rode down into a canyon with sloping walls and broken like all of these canyons under the great plateau every canyon resembled another the upland was one vast network the world seemed a labyrinth of canyons among which he was hopelessly lost what wouldwhat had become of lucy every thought in his whirling brain led back to thatand it was terrible  thenhe was gazing transfixed down upon the familiar tracks left by creechs mustangs days old but still unfollowed    chapter xix  that track led up the narrowing canyon to its head at the base of the plateau  slone mindful of his horse climbed on foot halting at the zigzag turns to rest a long gradually ascending trail mounted the last slope which when close at hand was not so precipitous as it appeared from below up there the wind sucked out of the canyons swooped and twisted hard  at last slone led wildfire over the rim and halted for another breathingspell before him was a beautiful gently sloping stretch of waving grass leading up to the dark pine forest from which came a roar of wind beneath slone the wild and whorled canyon breaks extended wonderful in thousands of denuded surfaces gold and red and yellow with the smoky depths between  wildfire sniffed the wind and snorted slone turned instantly alert the wild horse had given an alarm like a flash slone leaped into the saddle a faint cry away from the wind startled slone it was like a cry he had heard in dreams how overstrained his perceptions he was not really sure of anything yet on the instant he was tense  straggling cedars on his left almost wholly obstructed slones view wildfires ears and nose were pointed that way slone trotted him down toward the edge of this cedar clump so that he could see beyond before he reached it however he saw something blue moving waving lifting  smoke muttered slone and he thought more of the danger of fire on that windy height than he did of another peril to himself  wildfire was hard to hold as he rounded the edge of the cedars  slone saw a line of leaping flame a line of sweeping smoke the grass on fire  horsesa man  wildfire whistled his ringing blast of hate and menace his desert challenge to another stallion  the man whirled to look  slone saw joel creechand sage kingand lucy half naked bound on his back  joy agony terror in lightningswift turns paralyzed slone but wildfire lunged out on the run  sage king reared in fright came down to plunge away and with a magnificent leap cleared the line of fire  slone more from habit than thought sat close in the saddle a few of wildfires lengthening strides quickened slones blood then creech moved also awaking from a stupefying surprise and he snatched up a gun and fired slone saw the spurts of red the puffs of white but he heard nothing the torrent of his changed blood burning and terrible filled his ears with hate and death  he guided the running stallion in a few tremendous strides wildfire struck creech and slone had one glimpse of an awful face the impact was terrific creech went hurtling through the air limp and broken to go down upon a rock his skull cracking like a melon  the horse leaped over the body and the stone and beyond he leaped the line of burning grass  slone saw the king running into the forest he saw poor lucys white body swinging with the horses motion one glance showed the great gray to be running wild then the hate and passion cleared away leaving suspense and terror  wildfire reached the pines there down the open aisles between the black trees ran the fleet gray racer wildfire saw him and snorted the king was a hundred yards to the fore  wildfireits comethe racethe race called slone but he could not hear his own call there was a roar overhead heavy almost deafening the wind the wind yet that roar did not deaden a strange shrieking crack somewhere behind wildfire leaped in fright slone turned fire had run up a pinetree which exploded as if the trunk were powder  my god a race with fire  lucy lucy  in that poignant cry slone uttered his realization of the strange fate that had waited for the inevitable race between wildfire and the king he uttered his despairing love for lucy and his acceptance of death for her and himself no horse could outrun winddriven fire in a dry pine forest slone had no hope of that how perfectly fate and time and place and horses himself and his sweetheart had met slone damned joel creechs insane soul to everlasting torment to thinkto think his idiotic and wild threat had come trueand come true with a gale in the pinetops slone grew old at the thought and the fact seemed to be a dream but the dry pinescented air made breathing hard the gray racer carrying that slender halfnaked form white in the forest shade lengthened into his fleet and beautiful stride the motion of wildfire so easy so smooth so swift and the fierce reach of his head shooting forwardall these proved that it was no dream  tense questions pierced the dark chaos of slones mindwhat could he do run the king down make him kill lucy save her from horrible death by fire  the red horse had not gained a yard on the gray slone keen to judge distance saw this and for the first time he doubted wildfires power to ran down the king not with such a lead it was hopelessso hopeless  he turned to look back he saw no fire no smokeonly the dark trunks and the massed green foliage in violent agitation against the blue sky that revived a faint hope if he could get a few miles ahead before the fire began to leap across the pinecrests then it might be possible to run out of the forest if it were not wide  then a stronger hope grew it seemed that foot by foot wildfire was gaining on the king slone studied the level forest floor sliding toward him he lost his hopethen regained it again and then he spurred the horse wildfire hated that as he hated slone but apparently he did not quicken his strides and slone could not tell if he lengthened them he was not running near his limit but after the nature of such a horse left to choose his gait running slowly but rising toward his swiftest and fiercest  slones riders blood never thrilled to that race for his blood had curdled the sickness within rose to his mind and that flashed up whenever he dared to look forward at lucys white form slone could not bear this sight it almost made him reel yet he was driven to look he saw that the king carried no saddle so with lucy on him he was light he ought to run all day with only that weight wildfire carried a heavy saddle a pack a water bag and a rifle slone untied the pack and let it drop he almost threw aside the waterbag but something withheld his hand and also he kept his rifle what were a few more pounds to this desert stallion in his last run slone knew it was wildfires greatest and last race  suddenly slones ears rang with a terrible oncoming roar for an instant the unknown sound stiffened him robbed him of strength only the horn of the saddle hooking into him held him on then the years of his desert life answered to a call more than human  he had to race against fire he must beat the flame to the girl he loved there were miles of dry forest like powder fire backed by a heavy gale could rage through dry pine faster than any horse could run he might fail to save lucy fate had given him a bitter ride but he swore a grim oath that he would beat the flame the intense and abnormal riders passion in him like bostils dammed up but never fully controlled burst within him and suddenly he awoke to a wild and terrible violence of heart and soul he had accepted death he had no fear all that he wanted to do the last thing he wanted to do was to ride down the king and kill lucy mercifully how he would have gloried to burn there in the forest and for a million years in the dark beyond to save the girl  he goaded the horse then he looked back  through the aisles of the forest he saw a strange streaky murky something moving alive shifting up and down never an instant the same it must have been the windthe heat before the fire he seemed to see through it but there was nothing beyond only opaque dim mustering clouds hot puffs shot forward into his face his eyes smarted and stung his ears hurt and were growing deaf the tumult was the rear of avalanches of maelstroms of rushing seas of the wreck of the uplands and the ruin of the earth it grew to be so great a roar that he no longer heard there was only silence  and he turned to face ahead the stallion stretched low on a dead run the tips of the pines were bending before the wind and wildfire the terrible thing for which his horse was named was leaping through the forest but there was no sound  ahead of slone down the aisles low under the trees spreading over the running king floated swiftly some medium like a transparent veil it was neither smoke nor air it carried faint pin points of light sparks that resembled atoms of dust floating in sunlight it was a wave of heat driven before the storm of fire slone did not feel pain but he seemed to be drying up parching and lucy must be suffering now he goaded the stallion raking his flanks wildfire answered with a scream and a greater speed all except lucy and sage king and wildfire seemed so strange and unrealthe swift rush between the pines now growing ghostly in the dimming light the sense of a pursuing overpowering force and yet absolute silence  slone fought the desire to look back but he could not resist it some horrible fascination compelled him all behind had changed a hot wind like a blast from a furnace blew light stinging particles into his face the fire was racing in the treetops while below all was yet clear a lashing leaping flame engulfed the canopy of pines it was white seething inconceivably swift with a thousand flashing tongues it traveled ahead of smoke it was so thin he could see the branches through it and the fiery clouds behind it swept onward a sublime and an appalling spectacle slone could not think of what it looked like it was fire liberated freed from the bowels of the earth tremendous devouring this then was the meaning of fire this then was the horrible fate to befall lucy  but no he thought he must be insane not to be overcome in spirit yet he was not he would beat the flame to lucy he felt the loss of something some kind of a sensation which he ought to have had still he rode that race to kill his sweetheart better than any race he had ever before ridden he kept his seat he dodged the snags he pulled the maddened horse the shortest way he kept the king running straight  no horse had ever run so magnificent a race wildfire was outracing wind and fire and he was overhauling the most noted racer of the uplands against a tremendous handicap but now he was no longer racing to kill the king he was running in terror for miles he held that long swift wonderful stride without a break he was running to his death whether or not he distanced the fire nothing could stop him now but a bursting heart  slone untied his lasso and coiled the noose almost within reach of the king one throwone sudden swerveand the king would go down lucy would know only a stunning shock slones heart broke could he kill hercrush that dear golden head he could not yet he must he saw a long curved red welt on lucys white shoulders what was that had a branch lashed her slone could not see her face she could not have been dead or in a faint for she was riding the king bound as she was  closer and closer drew wildfire he seemed to go faster and faster as that wind of flame gained upon them the air was too thick to breathe it had an irresistible weight it pushed horses and riders onward in their flightstraws on the crest of a cyclone  again slone looked back and again the spectacle was different there was a white and golden fury of flame above beautiful and blinding and below farther back an inferno of glowing fire blackstreaked with trembling exploding puffs and streams of yellow smoke the aisles between the burning pines were smoky murky caverns moving and weird slone saw fire shoot from the treetops down the trunks and he saw fire shoot up the trunks like trains of powder they exploded like huge rockets and along the forest floor leaped the little flames his eyes burned and blurred till all merged into a wide pursuing storm too awful for the gaze of man  wildfire was running down the king the great gray had not lessened his speed but he was breaking slone felt a ghastly triumph when he began to whirl the noose of the lasso round his head already he was within range but he held back his throw which meant the end of all and as he hesitated wildfire suddenly whistled one shrieking blast  slone looked ahead there was light through the forest slone saw a white open space of grass a park nothe end of the forest wildfire like a demon hurtled onward with his smoothness of action gone beginning to break within a length of the king  a cry escaped slonea cry as silent as if there had been no deafening roaras wild as the race and as terrible as the ruthless fire it was the cry of lifeinstead of death both sage king and wildfire would beat the flame  then with the open just ahead slone felt a wave of hot wind rolling over him he saw the lashing tongues of flame above him in the pines the storm had caught him it forged ahead he was riding under a canopy of fire burning pine cones like torches dropped all around him he had a terrible blank sense of weight of suffocation of the air turning to fire  then wildfire with his nose at sage kings flank flashed out of the pines into the open slone saw a grassy wide reach inclining gently toward a dark break in the ground with crags rising sheer above it and to the right a great open space  slone felt that clear air as the breath of deliverance his reeling sense righted therethe king ran blindly going to his death wildfire was breaking fast his momentum carried him he was almost done  slone roped the king and holding hard waited for the end they ran on breaking breaking slone thought he would have to throw the king for they were perilously near the deep cleft in the rim but sage king went to his knees  slone leaped off just as wildfire fell how the blade flashed that released lucy she was wet from the horses sweat and foam she slid off into slones arms and he called her name could she hear above that roar back there in the forest the pieces of rope hung to her wrists and slone saw dark bruises raw and bloody she fell against him was she dead his heart contracted how white the face no he saw her breast heave against his and he cried aloud incoherently in his joy she was alive she was not badly hurt she stirred she plucked at him with nerveless hands she pressed close to him he heard a smothered voice yet so full so wonderful  putyourcoaton me came somehow to his ears  slone started violently abashed shamed to realize he had forgotten she was half nude he blindly tore off his coat blindly folded it around her  lin lin she cried  lucyoh are yyou he replied huskily  im not hurt im all right  but that wretch joel he  hed killed his fatherjust aminutebefore you came i fought him oh  but im all right did you  wildfire ran him downsmashed him lucy this cant be true yet i feel you thank god  with her free hand lucy returned his clasp she seemed to be strong it was a precious moment for slone in which he was uplifted beyond all dreams  let me loosea second she said i want toget in your coat  she laughed as he released her she laughed and slone thrilled with unutterable sweetness at that laugh  as he turned away he felt a swift wind then a strange impact from an invisible force that staggered him then the rend of flesh after that came the heavy report of a gun  slone fell he knew he had been shot following the rending of his flesh came a hot agony it was in his shoulder high up and the dark swift fear for his life was checked  lucy stood staring down at him unable to comprehend slowly paling her hands clasped the coat round her slone saw her saw the edge of streaming clouds of smoke above her saw on the cliff beyond the gorge two men one with a smoking gun half leveled  if slone had been inattentive to his surroundings before the sight of cordts electrified him  lucy drop down quick  oh whats happened youyou  ive been shot drop down i tell you get behind the horse an pull my rifle  shot exclaimed lucy blankly  yesyes my god lucy hes goin to shoot again  it was then lucy bostil saw cordts across the gulch he was not fifty yards distant plainly recognizable tall gaunt sardonic he held the halfleveled gun ready as if waiting he had waited there in ambush the clouds of smoke rolled up above him hiding the crags  cordts bostils blood spoke in the girls thrilling cry  hunch down lucy cried slone pull my rifle im only wingednot hurt hurry hes goin  another heavy report interrupted slone the bullet missed but slone made a pretense a convulsive flop as if struck  get the rifle quick he called  but lucy misunderstood his ruse to deceive cordts she thought he had been hit again she ran to the fallen wildfire and jerked the rifle from its sheath  cordts had begun to climb round a ledge evidently a short cut to get down and across hutchinson saw the rifle and yelled to cordts the horsethief halted his dark face gleaming toward lucy  when lucy rose the coat fell from her nude shoulders and slone watching suddenly lost his agony of terror for her and uttered a pealing cry of defiance and of rapture  she swept up the rifle it wavered hutchinson was above and cordts reaching up yelled for help hutchinson was reluctant but the stronger force dominated he leaned downclasped cordtss outstretched hands and pulled hutchinson bawled out hoarsely cordts turned what seemed a paler face he had difficulty on the slight footing he was slow  slone tried to call to lucy to shoot low but his lips had drawn tight after his one yell slone saw her white rounded shoulders bent with cold white face pressed against the rifle with slim arms quivering and growing tense with the tangled golden hair blowing out  then she shot  slones glance shifted he did not see the bullet strike up dust the figures of the men remained the samehutchinson straining cordts no cordts was not the same a strange change seemed manifest in his long form it did not seem instinct with effort yet it moved  hutchinson also was acting strangely yelling heaving wrestling but he could not help cordts he lifted violently raised cordts a little and then appeared to be in peril of losing his balance  cordts leaned against the cliff then it dawned upon slone that lucy had hit the horsethief hard hit he would nothe could not let go of hutchinson his was a death clutch the burly hutchinson slipped from his kneehold and as he moved cordts swayed his feet left the ledge he hung upheld only by the tottering comrade  what a harsh and terrible cry from hutchinson he made one last convulsive effort and it doomed him slowly he lost his balance cordtss dark evil haunting face swung round both men became lax and plunged and separated the dust rose from the rough steps then the dark forms shot downcordts falling sheer and straight hutchinson headlong with waving armsdown and down vanishing in the depths no sound came up a little column of yellow dust curled from the fatal ledge and catching the wind above streamed away into the drifting clouds of smoke    chapter xx  a darkness like the streaming clouds overhead seemed to blot out slones sight and then passed away leaving it clearer  lucy was bending over him binding a scarf round his shoulder and under his arm lin its nothing she was saying earnestly never touched a bone  slone sat up the smoke was clearing away little curves of burning grass were working down along the rim he put out a hand to grasp lucy remembering in a flash he pointed to the ledge across the chasm  theyregone cried lucy with a strange and deep note in her voice she shook violently but she did not look away from slone  wildfire the king he added hoarsely  both where they dropped oh im afraid toto look and lin i saw sarch two face and ben and plume go down there  she had her back to the chasm where the trail led down and she pointed without looking  slone got up a little unsteady on his feet and conscious of a dull pain  sarch will go straight home and the others will follow him said lucy they got away here where joel came up the trail the fire chased them out of the woods sarch will go home and thatll fetch the riders  we wont need them if only wildfire and the king slone broke off and grimly with a catch in his breath turned to the horses  how strange that slone should run toward the king while lucy ran to wildfire  sage king was a beaten broken horse but he would live to run another race  lucy was kneeling beside wildfire sobbing and crying wildfire wildfire  all of wildfire was white except where he was red and that red was not now his glossy flaming skin a terrible muscular convulsion as of internal collapse grew slower and slower yet choked blinded dying killed on his feet wildfire heard lucys voice  oh lin oh lin moaned lucy  while they knelt there the violent convulsions changed to slow heaves  he run the king downcarryin weightwith a long lead to overcome slone muttered and he put a shaking hand on the horses wet neck  oh he beat the king cried lucy but you mustntyou cant tell dad  what can we tell him  oh i know old creech told me what to say  a change both of body and spirit seemed to pass over the great stallion  wildfire wildfire  again the rider called to his horse with a low and piercing cry but wildfire did not hear   the morning sun glanced brightly over the rippling sage which rolled away from the ford like a gray sea  bostil sat on his porch a stricken man he faced the blue haze of the north where days before all that he had loved had vanished every day from sunrise till sunset he had been there waiting and watching his riders were grouped near him silent awed by his agony awaiting orders that never came  from behind a ridge puffed up a thin cloud of dust bostil saw it and gave a start above the sage appeared a bobbing black objectthe head of a horse then the big black body followed  sarch exclaimed bostil  with spurs clinking the riders ran and trooped behind him  more hosses back said holley quietly  thars plume exclaimed farlane  an two face added van  dusty ben said another  riderless finished bostil  then all were intensely quiet watching the racers come trotting in single file down the ridge sarchedons shrill neigh like a whistleblast pealed in from the sage from fields and corrals clamored the answer attended by the clattering of hundreds of hoofs  sarchedon and his followers broke from trot to cantercanter to gallopand soon were cracking their hard hoofs on the stony court like a swarm of bees the riders swooped down upon the racers caught them and led them up to bostil  on sarchedons neck showed a dry dustcaked stain of reddish tinge holley the old hawkeyed rider had precedence in the examination  wal thets a bulletmark plain as day said holley  who shot him demanded bostil  holley shook his gray head  he smells of smoke put in farlane who had knelt at the blacks legs hes been runnin fire see thet fetlocks all singed  all the riders looked and then with grave questioning eyes at one another  reckon thars been hell muttered holley darkly  some of the riders led the horses away toward the corrals bostil wheeled to face the north again his brow was lowering his cheek was pale and sunken his jaw was set  the riders came and went but bostil kept his vigil the hours passed afternoon came and wore on the sun lost its brightness and burned red  again dustclouds now like reddened smoke puffed over the ridge a horse carrying a dark thick figure appeared above the sage  bostil leaped up is thet a gray hossor ami blind he called unsteadily  the riders dared not answer they must be sure they gazed through narrow slits of eyelids and the silence grew intense  holley shaded the hawk eyes with his hand gray he isbostilgray as the sage an so help me god if he aint the king  yes its the king cried the riders excitedly sure i reckon no mistake about thet its the king  bostil shook his huge frame and he rubbed his eyes as if they had become dim and he stared again  whos thet up on him  slone i never seen his like on a hoss replied holley  an whatshe packin queried bostil huskily  plain to all keen eyes was the glint of lucy bostils golden hair but only holley had courage to speak  its lucy i seen thet long ago  a strange fleeting light of joy died out of bostils face the change once more silenced his riders they watched the king trotting in from the sage his head drooped he seemed grayer than ever and he limped but he was sage king splendid as of old all the more gladdening to the riders eyes because he had been lost he came on quickening a little to the clamoring welcome from the corrals  holley put out a swift hand bostilthe girls aliveshes smilin he called and the cool voice was strangely different  the riders waited for bostil slone rode into the courtyard he was white and weary reeling in the saddle a bloody scarf was bound round his shoulder he held lucy in his arms she had on his coat a wan smile lighted her haggard face  bostil cursing deep like muttering thunder strode out lucy you aint bad hurt he implored in a voice no one had ever heard before  imall rightdad she said and slipped down into his arms  he kissed the pale face and held her up like a child and then carrying her to the door of the house he roared for aunt jane  when he reappeared the crowd of riders scattered from around slone but it seemed that bostil saw only the king the horse was caked with dusty lather scratched and disheveled weary and broken yet he was still beautiful he raised his drooping head and reached for his master with a look as soft and dark and eloquent as a womans  no rider there but felt bostils passion of doubt and hope had the king been beaten bostils glory and pride were battling with love mighty as that was it did not at once overcome his fear of defeat  slowly the gaze of bostil moved away from sage king and roved out to the sage and back as if he expected to see another horse but no other horse was in sight at last his hard eyes rested upon the whitefaced slone  been somehard ridin he queried haltingly all there knew that had not been the question upon his lips  pretty hardyes replied slone he was weary yet tightlipped intense  nowthem creeches slowly continued bostil  dead  a murmur ran through the listening riders and they drew closer  both of them  yes joel killed his father fightin to get lucy an i ranwildfire over joelsmashed him  wal im sorry for the old man replied bostil gruffly i meant to make up to him but thet fool boy  an sloneyoure all bloody  he stepped forward and pulled the scarf aside he was curious and kindly as if it was beyond him to be otherwise yet that dark cold something almost sullen clung round him  been bored eh wal it aint low an thets good who shot you  cordts  cordts bostil leaned forward in sudden fierce eagerness  yes cordts his outfit run across creechs trail an we bunched i cant tell now but we hadhell an cordts is deadsos hutchan that other pard of his bostil theyll never haunt your sleep again  slone finished with a strange sternness that seemed almost bitter  bostil raised both his huge fists the blood was bulging his thick neck it was another kind of passion that obsessed him only some violent check to his emotion prevented him from embracing slone the huge fists unclenched and the big fingers worked  you mean to tell me you did fer cordts an hutch what you did fer sears he boomed out  theyre deadgone bostilhonest to god replied slone  holley thrust a quivering brown hand into bostils face what did i tell you he shouted didnt i say wait  bostil threw away all that deep fury of passion and there seemed only a resistless and speechless admiration left then ensued a moment of silence the riders watched slones weary face as it drooped and bostil as he loomed over him  wheres the red stallion queried bostil that was the question hard to get out  slone raised eyes dark with pain yet they flashed as he looked straight up into bostils face wildfires dead  dead ejaculated bostil  another moment of strained exciting suspense  shot he went on  no  what killed him  the king sir  killed him on his feet  bostils heavy jaw bulged and quivered his hand shook as he laid it on sage kings manethe first touch since the return of his favorite  slonewhatis it he said brokenly with voice strangely softened his face became transfigured  sage king killed wildfire on his feet a grand race bostil  but wildfires deadan heres the king ask me no more i want to forget  bostil put his arm around the young mans shoulder slone if i dont know what you feel fer the loss of thet grand hoss no rider on earth knows  go in the house boys take him inall of youan look after him  bostil wanted to be alone to welcome the king to lead him back to the home corral perhaps to hide from all eyes the change and the uplift that would forever keep him from wronging another man  the late rains came and like magic in a few days the sage grew green and lustrous and fresh the gray turning to purple  every morning the sun rose white and hot in a blue and cloudless sky and then soon the horizon line showed creamy clouds that rose and spread and darkened every afternoon storms hung along the ramparts and rainbows curved down beautiful and ethereal the dim blackness of the stormclouds was split to the blinding zigzag of lightning and the thunder rolled and boomed like the colorado in flood  the wind was fragrant sageladen no longer dry and hot but cool in the shade  slone and lucy never rode down so far as the stately monuments though these held memories as hauntingly sweet as others were poignantly bitter lucy never rode the king again but slone rode him learned to love him and lucy did not race any more when slone tried to stir in her the old spirit all the response he got was a wistful shake of head or a laugh that hid the truth or an excuse that the strain on her ankles from joel creechs lasso had never mended the girl was unutterably happy but it was possible that she would never race a horse again  she rode sarchedon and she liked to trot or lope along beside slone while they linked hands and watched the distance but her glance shunned the north that distance which held the wild canyons and the broken battlements and the long black pinefringed plateau  wont you ever ride with me out to the old camp where i used to wait for you asked slone  some day she said softly  when  whenwhen we come back from durango she replied with averted eyes and scarlet cheek and slone was silent for that planned trip to durango with its wonderful gift to be made his heart swell  and so on this rainbow day with storms all around them and blue sky above they rode only as far as the valley but from there before they turned to go back the monuments appeared close and they loomed grandly with the background of purple bank and creamy cloud and shafts of golden lightning they seemed like sentinelsguardians of a great and beautiful love born under their lofty heights in the lonely silence of day in the starthrown shadow of night they were like that love and they held lucy and slone calling every day giving a nameless and tranquil content binding them true to love true to the sage and the open true to that wild upland home
