                        songs of childhood 1901  to jill                                           sleepyhead   as i lay awake in the white moonlight i heard a faint singing in the wood       out of bed       sleepyhead     put your white foot now       here are we       beneath the tree     singing round the root now  i looked out of window in the white moonlight the leaves were like snow in the wood       come away       child and play     light with the gnomies       in a mound       green and round     thats where their home is        honey sweet       curds to eat     cream and frumenty       shells and beads       poppy seeds     you shall have plenty  but as soon as i stooped in the dim moonlight   to put on my stocking and my shoe the sweet shrill singing echoed faintly away   and the grey of the morning peeped through and instead of the gnomies there came a red robin   to sing of the buttercups and dew     bluebells   where the bluebells and the wind are     fairies in a ring i spied and i heard a little linnet     singing near beside  where the primrose and the dew are     soon were sped the fairies all only now the green turf freshens     and the linnets call     lovelocks   i watched the lady caroline bind up her dark and beauteous hair her face was rosy in the glass and twixt the coils her hands would pass     white in the candleshine  her bottles on the table lay stoppered yet sweet of violet her image in the mirror stooped to view those locks as lightly looped     as cherry boughs in may  the snowy night lay dim without i heard the waits their sweet song sing the window smouldered keen with frost yet still she twisted sleeked and tossed     her beauteous hair about     tartary   if i were lord of tartary   myself and me alone my bed should be of ivory   of beaten gold my throne and in my court would peacocks flaunt and in my forests tigers haunt and in my pools great fishes slant   their fins athwart the sun  if i were lord of tartary   trumpeters every day to every meal should summon me   and in my courtyard bray and in the evening lamps would shine yellow as honey red as wine while harp and flute and mandoline   made music sweet and gay  if i were lord of tartary   id wear a robe of beads white and gold and green theyd be   and clustered thick as seeds and ere should wane the morningstar id don my robe and scimitar and zebras seven should draw my car   through tartarys dark glades  lord of the fruits of tartary   her rivers silverpale lord of the hills of tartary   glen thicket wood and dale her flashing stars her scented breeze her trembling lakes like foamless seas her birddelighting citrontrees   in every purple vale     the buckle   i had a silver buckle   i sewed it on my shoe and neath a sprig of mistletoe   i danced the evening through  i had a bunch of cowslips   i hid them in a grot in case the elves should come by night   and me remember not  i had a yellow riband   i tied it in my hair that walking in the garden   the birds might see it there  i had a secret laughter   i laughed it near the wall only the ivy and the wind   may tell of it at all     the hare   in the black furrow of a field   i saw an old witchhare this night and she cocked a lissome ear   and she eyed the moon so bright and she nibbled of the green   and i whispered whsst witchhare away like a ghostie oer the field   she fled and left the moonlight there     bunches of grapes   bunches of grapes says timothy pomegranates pink says elaine a junket of cream and a cranberry tart     for me says jane  loveinamist says timothy primroses pale says elaine a nosegay of pinks and mignonette     for me says jane  chariots of gold says timothy silvery wings says elaine a bumpity ride in a waggon of hay     for me says jane     john mouldy   i spied john mouldy in his cellar   deep down twenty steps of stone in the dusk he sat asmiling     smiling there alone  he read no book he snuffed no candle   the rats ran in the rats ran out and far and near the drip of water     went whispering about  the dusk was still with dew afalling   i saw the dog star bleak and grim i saw a slim brown rat of norway     creep over him  i spied john mouldy in his cellar   deep down twenty steps of stone in the dusk he sat asmiling     smiling there alone     the fly   how large unto the tiny fly   must little things appear a rosebud like a feather bed   its prickle like a spear  a dewdrop like a lookingglass   a hair like golden wire the smallest grain of mustardseed   as fierce as coals of fire  a loaf of bread a lofty hill   a wasp a cruel leopard and specks of salt as bright to see   as lambkins to a shepherd     song   o for a moon to light me home   o for a lanthorn green for those sweet stars the pleiades that glitter in the darkling trees   o for a lovelorn taper o   for a lanthorn green  o for a frock of tartan   o for clear wild grey eyes for fingers light as violets neath branches that the blackbird frets   o for a thistly meadow o   for clear wild grey eyes  o for a heart like almond boughs   o for sweet thoughts like rain o for firstlove like fields of grey shut aprilbuds at break of day   o for a sleep like music   dreams still as rain     i saw three witches       i saw three witches     that bowed down like barley and straddled their brooms neath a louring sky     and mounting a stormcloud     aloft on its margin stood black in the silver as up they did fly      i saw three witches     that mocked the poor sparrows they carried in cages of wicker along     till a hawk from his eyrie     swooped down like an arrow smote on the cages and ended their song      i saw three witches     that sailed in a shallop all turning their heads with a snickering smile     till a bank of green osiers     concealed their grim faces though i heard them lamenting for many a mile      i saw three witches     asleep in a valley their heads in a row like stones in a flood     till the moon creeping upward     looked white through the valley and turned them to bushes in bright scarlet bud     the silver penny   sailorman ill give to you   my bright silver penny if out to sea youll sail me   and my dear sister jenny  get in young sir ill sail ye   and your dear sister jenny but pay she shall her golden locks   instead of your penny  they sail away they sail away   o fierce the winds blew the foam flew in clouds   and dark the night grew  and all the wild seawater   climbed steep into the boat back to the shore again   sail they will not  drowned is the sailorman   drowned is sweet jenny and drowned in the deep sea   a bright silver penny     the rainbow   i saw the lovely arch   of rainbow span the sky the gold sun burning   as the rain swept by  in brightringed solitude   the showery foliage shone one lovely moment   and the bow was gone     the fairies dancing   i heard along the early hills   ere yet the lark was risen up ere yet the dawn with firelight fills   the nightdew of the bramblecup i heard the fairies in a ring   sing as they tripped a lilting round soft as the moon on wavering wing   the starlight shook as if with sound as if with echoing and the stars   prankt their bright eyes with trembling gleams while red with war the gusty mars   rained upon earth his ruddy beams he shone alone low down the west   while i behind a hawthornbush watched on the fairies flaxentressed   the fires of the morning flush till as a mist their beauty died   their singing shrill and fainter grew and daylight tremulous and wide   flooded the moorland through and through till urdons copper weathercock   was reared in golden flame afar and dim from moonlit dreams awoke   the towers and groves of arroar     reverie   when slim sophia mounts her horse   and paces down the avenue it seems an inward melody       she paces to  each narrow hoof is lifted high   beneath the dark enclustering pines a silver ray within his bit       and bridle shines  his eye burns deep his tail is arched   and streams upon the shadowy air the daylight sleeks his jetty flanks       his mistress hair  her habit flows in darkness down   upon the stirrup rests her foot her brow is lifted as if earth       she heeded not  tis silent in the avenue   the sombre pines are mute of song the blue is dark there moves no breeze       the boughs among  when slim sophia mounts her horse   and paces down the avenue it seems an inward melody       she paces to     the three beggars   twas autumn daybreak gold and wild   while past st anns grey tower they shuffled three beggars spied a fairychild     in crimson mantle muffled  the daybreak lighted up her face   all pink and sharp and emeraldeyed she looked on them a little space     and shrill as hautboy cried  o three tall footsore men of rags   which walking this gold morn i see what will ye give me from your bags     for fairy kisses three  the first that was a reddish man   out of his bundle takes a crust la by the tombstones of st ann     theres fee if fee ye must  the second that was a chestnut man   out of his bundle draws a bone lo by the belfry of st ann     and all my breakfast gone  the third that was a yellow man   out of his bundle picks a groat la by the angel of st ann     and i must go without  that changeling lean and icylipped   touched crust and bone and groat and lo beneath her finger tapertipped     the magic all ran through  instead of crust a peacock pie   instead of bone sweet venison instead of groat a white lily     with seven blooms thereon  and each fair cup was deep with wine   such was the changelings charity the sweet feast was enough for nine     but not too much for three  o toothsome meat in jelly froze   o tender haunch of elfin stag o rich the odour that arose     o plump with scraps each bag  there in the daybreak gold and wild   each merryhearted beggar man drank deep unto the fairy child     and blessed the good st ann     the dwarf   now jinnie my dear to the dwarf be off   that lives in barberry wood and fetch me some honey but be sure you dont laugh   he hates little girls that are rude are rude     he hates little girls that are rude  jane tapped at the door of the house in the wood   and the dwarf looked over the wall he eyed her so queer twas as much as she could   to keep from laughing at all at all     to keep from laughing at all  his shoes down the passage came clod clod clod   and when he opened the door he croaked so harsh twas as much as she could   to keep from laughing the more the more     to keep from laughing the more  as there with his bushy red beard he stood   pricked out to double its size he squinted so cross twas as much as she could   to keep the tears out of her eyes her eyes     to keep the tears out of her eyes  he slammed the door and went clod clod clod   but while in the porch she bides he squealed so fierce twas as much as she could   to keep from cracking her sides her sides     to keep from cracking her sides  he threw a pumpkin over the wall   and melons and apples beside so thick in the air that to see them all fall   she laughed and laughed till she cried cried cried     jane laughed and laughed till she cried  down fell her teardrops a pitapatpat   and red as a rose she grew kah kah said the dwarf is it crying youre at   its the very worst thing you could do do do     its the very worst thing you could do  he slipped like a monkey up into a tree   he shook her down cherries like rain see now says he cheeping a blackbird i be   laugh laugh little jinnie againgaingain     laugh laugh little jinnie again  ah me what a strange what a gladsome duet   from a house in the deeps of a wood such shrill and such harsh voices never met yet alaughing as loud as they could could could     alaughing as loud as they could  come jinnie come dwarf cocksparrow and bee   theres a ring gaudygreen in the dell sing sing ye sweet cherubs that flit in the tree   la who can draw tears from a well well well     who ever drew tears from a well     alulvan  the sun is clear of bird and cloud   the grass shines windless grey and still in dusky ruin the owl dreams on   the cuckoo echoes on the hill yet soft along alulvans walks     the ghost at noonday stalks  his eyes in shadow of his hat   stare on the ruins of his house his cloak upfastened with a brooch   of faded velvet grey as mouse brushes the roses as he goes     yet wavers not one rose  the wild birds in a cloud fly up   from their sweet feeding in the fruit the droning of the bees and flies   rises gradual as a lute is it for fear the birds are flown     and shrills the insectdrone  thick is the ivy over alulvan   and crisp with summerheat its turf far far across its empty pastures   alulvans sands are white with surf and he himself is grey as the sea     watching beneath an eldertree  all night the fretful shrill banshee   lurks in the ivys dark festoons calling for ever oer garden and river   through magpie changing of the moons alulvan o alas alulvan   the doom of lone alulvan     the pedlar   there came a pedlar to an evening house sweet lettice from her lattice looking down wondered what man he was so curious his black hair dangled on his tattered gown then lifts he up his face with glittering eyes what will you buy sweetheartheres honeycomb and mottled pippins and sweet mulberry pies comfits and peaches snowy cherry bloom to keep in water for to make night sweet all that you want sweetheartcome taste and eat  even with his sugared words returned to her the clear remembrance of a gentle voice and o my child should ever a flatterer tap with his wares and promise of all joys and vain sweet pleasures that on earth may be seal up your ears sing some old happy song confuse his magic who is all mockery his sweets are death yet still how she doth long but just to taste then shut the lattice tight and hide her eyes from the delicious sight  what must i pay she whispered pay says he pedlar i am who through this wood to roam one lock of her hair is gold enough for me for apple peach comfit or honeycomb but from her bough a drowsy squirrel cried trust him not lettice trust oh trust him not and many another woodland tongue beside rose softly in the silencetrust him not then cried the pedlar in a bitter voice what in the thicket is this idle noise  a late harsh blackbird smote him with her wings as through the glade dark in the dim she flew yet still the pedlar his old burden sings what pretty sweetheart shall i show to you heres orange ribands heres a string of pearls heres silk of buttercup and pansy glove a pin of tortoiseshell for windy curls a box of silver scented sweet with clove come now he says with dim and lifted face i pass not often such a lonely place  pluck not a hair a hidden rabbit cried with but one hair hell steal thy heart away then only sorrow shall thy lattice hide go in all honest pedlars come by day there was dead silence in the drowsy wood heres syrup for to lull sweet maids to sleep and bells for dreams and fairy wine and food all day thy heart in happiness to keep and now she takes the scissors on her thumb o then no more unto my lattice come  sad is the sound of weeping in the wood now only night is where the pedlar was and bleak as frost upon a quickling bud his magic steals in darkness o alas why all the summer doth sweet lettice pine and ere the wheat is ripe why lies her gold hid neath fresh newplucked sprigs of eglantine why all the morning hath the cuckoo tolled sad to and fro in green and secret ways with solemn bells the burden of his days  and in the marketplace what man is this who wears a loop of gold upon his breast stuck heartwise and whose glassy flatteries take all the townsfolk ere they go to rest who come to buy and gossip doth his eye remember a face lovely in a wood o people hasten hasten do not buy his woeful wares the bird of grief doth brood there where his heart should be and far away there mourns long sorrowfulness this happy day     the ogre   tis moonlight on trebarwith vale   and moonlight on an ogre keen who prowling hungry through the dale   a lone cottage hath seen  small with thin smoke ascending up   three casements and a door the ogre eager is to tap   and here seems dainty store  sweet as a larder to a mouse   so to him staring down seemed the smallwindowed moonlit house   with jasmine overgrown  he snorted as the billows snort   in darkness of the night betwixt his lean locks tawnyswart   he glowered on the sight  into the garden sweet with peas   he put his wooden shoe and bending back the apple trees   crept covetously through  then stooping with a gloating eye   stared through the lattice small and spied two children which did lie   asleep against the wall  into their dreams no shadow fell   of his disastrous thumb groping discreet and gradual   across the quiet room  but scarce his nail had scraped the cot   wherein these children lay as if his malice were forgot   it suddenly did stay  for faintly in the inglenook   he heard a cradlesong that rose into his thoughts and woke   terror them among  for she who in the kitchen sat   darning by the fire guileless of what he would be at   sang sweet as wind or wire  lullay thou little tiny child   byby lullay lullie jesu in glory meek and mild   this night remember thee  fiend witch and goblin foul and wild   he deems them smoke to be lullay thou little tiny child   byby lullay lullie  the ogre lifted up his eyes   into the moons pale ray and gazed upon her leopardwise   cruel and clear as day  he snarled in gluttony and fear   the wind blows dismally jesu in storm my lambs be near   byby lullay lullie  and like a ravenous beast which sees   the hunters icy eye so did this wretch in wrath confess   sweet jesus mastery  lightly he drew his greedy thumb   from out that casement pale and strode enormous swiftly home   whinnying down the dale     dame hickory     dame hickory dame hickory     heres sticks for your fire   furzetwigs and oaktwigs     and beechtwigs and briar but when old dame hickory came for to see she found twas the voice of the false faerie    dame hickory dame hickory     heres meat for your broth   gooseflesh and hares flesh     and pigs trotters both but when old dame hickory came for to see she found twas the voice of the false faerie   dame hickory dame hickory     heres a wolf at your door   his teeth grinning white     and his tongue wagging sore nay said dame hickory ye false faerie but a wolf twas indeed and famished was he    dame hickory dame hickory     heres buds for your tomb bramble and lavender     and rosemary bloom whsst said dame hickory ye false faerie ye cry like a wolf ye do and trouble poor me     the pilgrim   shall we carry now your bundle you old grey man over hill and dale and meadow lighter than an owlets shadow we will whirl it through the air through blue regions shrill and bare so you may in comfort fare shall we carry now your bundle     you old grey man  the pilgrim lifted up his eyes and saw three fiends in the skies stooping oer that lonely place     evil in form and face  nay he answered leave me leave me   ye three wild fiends far it is my feet must wander and my city lieth yonder i must bear my bundle alone     till the day be done the fiends stared down with leaden eye fanning the chill air duskily twixt their hoods they stoop and cry  shall we smooth the path before you     you old grey man sprinkle it green with gilded showers strew it oer with painted flowers lure bright birds to sing and flit in the honeyed airs of it shall we smooth the path before you     grey old man  o tis better silence silence     ye three wild fiends footsore am i faint and weary dark the way forlorn and dreary beaten of wind torn of briar smitten of rain parched with fire o silence silence silence     ye three wild fiends  it seemed a smoke obscured the air bright lightning quivered in the gloom and a faint voice of thunder spake far in the lone hillhollowscome then half in fury half in dread the fiends drew closer down and said  nay thou stubborn fond old man     hearken awhile thorn and dust and ice and heat tarry now sit down and eat heat and ice and dust and thorn stricken footsore parched forlorn juice of purple grape shall be youth and solace unto thee music of tambour wire and wind ease shall bring to heart and mind wonderful sweet mouths shall sigh languishing and lullaby turn then curse the dream that lures thee turn thee ere too late it be lest thy three true friends grow weary     of comforting thee  the pilgrim crouches terrified as stooping hood and glassy face gloating evil side by side terror and hate brood oer the place he flings his withered hands on high with a bitter breaking cry leave me leave me leave me leave me     ye three wild fiends if i lay me down in slumber then i lay me down in wrath if i stir not in dark dreaming then i wither in my path if i hear sweet voices singing tis a demons lullaby and in hideous storm and terror     wake but to die  and even as he spake on high arrows of sunlight pierced the sky bright streamed the rain oer burning snow from hill to hill a wondrous bow of colour and fire trembled in air painting its heavenly beauty there wild flapped each fiend a batlike hood against that frighting light and stood beating the windless rain and then rose heavy and slow with cowering head circled in company again and into darkness fled  marvellous sweet it was to hear the waters gushing loud and clear marvellous happy it was to be alone and yet not solitary oh out of terror and dark to come     in sight of home     the gage   lady jane o lady jane your hound hath broken bounds again   and chased my timorous deer o     if him i see     that hour hell dee   my brakes shall be his bier o  hoots lord speak not so proud to me my hound i trow is fleet and free   hes welcome to your deer o     shoot shoot you may     hell gang his way   your threats we nothing fear o  hes fetched him in hes laid him low drips his lifeblood red and slow   darkens his dreary eye o    here is your beast     and now at least   my herds in peace shall lie o  in peace my lord o mark me well for what my jolly hound befell   you shall sup twentyfold o     for every tooth     of his in sooth   a stag in pawn i hold o  huntsman and horn huntsman and horn shall scour your heaths and coverts lorn   braying em shrill and clear o     but lone and still     shall lift each hill   each valley wan and sere o  ride up you may ride down you may lonely or trooped by night or day   my hound shall haunt you ever     bird beast and game     shall dread the same   the wild fish of your river  her cheek burns angry as the rose her eye with wrath and pity flows   he gazes fierce and round o     dear lord he says     what loveliness   to waste upon a hound o  id give my stags my hills and dales my stormcocks and my nightingales   to have undone this deed o     for deep beneath     my heart is death   which for her love doth bleed o  he wanders up he wanders down on foot ahorse by night and noon   his lands are bleak and drear o     forsook his dales     of nightingales   forsook his moors of deer o  forsook his heart ah me of mirth theres nothing gladsome left on earth   all thoughts and dreams seem vain o     save where remote     the moonbeams gloat   and sleeps the lovely jane o  until an even when lone he went gnawing his beard in dreariment   lo from a thicket hidden     lovely as flower     in april hour   steps forth a form unbidden  get ye now down my lord to me im troubled so im like to dee   she cries twixt joy and grief o     the hound is dead     when all is said   but love is past belief o  nights nights ive lain your lands to see forlorn and stilland all for me   all for a foolish curse o     now here am i     come out to die   to live unloved is worse o  in faith this lord in that lone dale hears now a sweeter nightingale   and lairs a tenderer deer o     his sorrow goes     like mountain snows   in waters sweet and clear o  what ghostly hound is this that fleet comes fawning to his mistress feet   and courses round his master     how swiftly love     may grief remove   how happy make disaster  now here he smells now there he smells winding his voice along the dells   till grey flows up the morn o     then hies again     to lady jane   no longer now forlorn o  ay as it were a bud did break to loveliness for her loves sake   so she in beauty moving     rides at his hand     across his land   beloved as well as loving     as lucy went awalking   as lucy went awalking one morning cold and fine there sate three crows upon a bough and three times three is nine then o said lucy in the snow its very plain to see a witch has been awalking in the fields in front of me  then slept she light and heedfully across the frozen snow and plucked a bunch of eldertwigs that near a pool did grow and by and by she comes to seven shadows in one place stretched black by seven poplartrees against the suns bright face  she looks to left she looks to right and in the midst she sees a little pool of water clear and frozen neath the trees then down beside its margent in the crusty snow she kneels and hears a magic belfry aringing with sweet bells  clear sang the faint far merry peal then silence on the air and icystill the frozen pool and poplars standing there then lo as lucy turned her head and looked along the snow she sees a witcha witch she sees come frisking to and fro  her scarlet buckled shoes they clicked her heels atwinkling high with mistletoe her steeplehat bobbed as she capered by but never a dint or mark or print in the whiteness for to see though danced she high though danced she fast though danced she lissomely  it seemed twas diamonds in the air or little flakes of frost it seemed twas golden smoke around or sunbeams lightly tossed it seemed an elfin music like to reeds and warblers rose nay lucy said it is the wind that through the branches flows  and as she peeps and as she peeps tis no more one but three and eye of bat and downy wing of owl within the tree and the bells of that sweet belfry apealing as before and now it is not three she sees and now it is not four  o who are ye sweet lucy cries that in a dreadful ring all muffled up in brindled shawls do caper frisk and spring a witch and witches one and nine they straight to her reply and looked upon her narrowly with green and needle eye  then lucy sees in clouds of gold green cherry trees upgrow and bushes of red roses that bloomed above the snow she smells all faint the almondboughs blowing so wild and fair and doves with milky eyes ascend fluttering in the air  clear flowers she sees like tulip buds go floating by like birds with wavering tips that warbled sweetly strange enchanted words and as with ropes of amethyst the boughs with lamps were hung and clusters of green emeralds like fruit upon them clung  o witches nine ye dreadful nine o witches seven and three whence come these wondrous things that i this christmas morning see but straight as in a clap when she of christmas says the word here is the snow and there the sun but never bloom nor bird  nor warbling flame nor gloamingrope of amethyst there shows nor bunches of green emeralds nor belfry well and rose nor cloud of gold nor cherrytree nor witch in brindled shawl but like a dream that vanishes so vanished were they all  when lucy sees and only sees three crows upon a bough and earthly twigs and bushes hidden white in driven snow then o said lucy three times three is ninei plainly see some witch has been awalking in the fields in front of me     the englishman   i met a sailor in the woods   a silver ring wore he his hair hung black his eyes shone blue   and thus he said to me  what country say of this round earth   what shore of what salt sea be this my son i wander in   and looks so strange to me  says i o foreign sailorman   in england now you be this is her wood and there her sky   and that her roaring sea  he lifts his voice yet louder   what smell be this says he my nose on the sharp morning air   snuffs up so greedily  says i it is wild roses   do smell so winsomely and winy briar too says i   that in these thickets be  and oh says he what leetle bird   is singing in yon high tree so every shrill and longdrawn note   like bubbles breaks in me  says i it is the mavis   that perches in the tree and sings so shrill and sings so sweet   when dawn comes up the sea  at which he fell amusing   and fixed his eye on me as one alone twixt light and dark   a spirit thinks to see  england he whispers soft and harsh   england repeated he and briar and rose and mavis   asinging in yon high tree  ye speak me true my leetle son   soso it came to me adrifting landwards on a spar   and grey dawn on the sea  ay ay i could not be mistook   i knew them leafy trees i knew that land so witchery sweet   and that old noise of seas  though here ive sailed a score of years   and heard em dream or wake lap small and hollow gainst my cheek   on sand and coral break  yet now my leetle son says i   adrifting on the wave that land i see so safe and green   is england i believe  and that there wood is english wood   and this here cruel sea the selfsame old blue ocean   years gone remembers me  asitting with my bread and butter   down ahind yon chitterin mill and this same marinerethats me   is that same leetle will  that very same wee leetle will   eating his bread and butter there alooking on the broad blue sea   betwixt his yaller hair  and here be i my son thrown up   like corpses from the sea ships stars winds tempests pirates past   yet leetle will i be  he said no more that sailorman   but in a reverie stared like the figure of a ship   with painted eyes to sea     the phantom   upstairs in the large closet child   this side the blue room door is an old bible bound in leather   standing upon the floor  go with this taper bring it me   carry it so upon your arm it is the book on many a sea   hath stilled the waves alarm  late the hour dark the night   the house is solitary feeble is a tapers light   to light poor ann to see  her eyes are yet with visions bright   of sylph and river flower and fay now through a narrow corridor   she goes her lonely way  vast shadows on the heedless walls   gigantic loom stoop low each little hasty footfall calls   hollowly to and fro  in the cold solitude her heart   remembers sorrowfully white winters when her mother was   her loving company  now in the dark clear glass she sees   a taper mocking hers a phantom face of light blue eyes   reflecting phantom fears  around her loom the vacant rooms   wind the upward stairs she climbs on into a loneliness   only her taper shares  out in the dark a cold wind stirs   at every window sighs a waning moon peers small and chill   from out the cloudy skies  casting faint tracery on the walls   so stony still the house from cellar to attic rings the shrill   squeak of the hungry mouse  her grandmother is deaf with age   a garden of moonless trees would answer not though she should cry   in anguish on her knees  so that she scarce can breatheso fast   her pent up heart doth beat when faint along the corridor   falleth the sound of feet  sounds lighter than silk slippers make   upon a ballroom floor when sweet violin and cello wake   music for twirling feet  o neath an old unfriendly roof   what shapes may not conceal their faces in the open day   at night abroad to steal  even her taper seems with fear   to languish small and blue far in the woods the winter wind   runs whistling through  a dreadful cold plucks at each hair   her mouth is stretched to cry but sudden with a gush of joy   it narrows to a sigh  it is a phantom child which comes   soft through the corridor singing an old forgotten song   this ancient burden bore  thorn thorn i wis and roses twain   a red rose and a white stoop in the blossom bee and kiss   a lonely child goodnight  swim fish sing bird and sigh again   i that am lost am lone bee in the blossom never stirred   locks hid beneath a stone  her eye was of the azure fire   that hovers in wintry flame her raiment wild and yellow as furze   that spouteth out the same  and in her hand she bore no flower   but on her head a wreath of faded flowers that did yet   smell sweetly after death  gloomy with night the listening walls   are now that she is gone albeit this solitary child   no longer seems alone  fast though her taper dwindles down   heavy and thick the tome a beauty beyond fear to dim   haunts now her alien home  ghosts in the world malignant grim   vex many a wood and glen and house and poolthe unquiet ghosts   of dead and restless men  but in her grannies house this spirit   a child as lone as she pining for love not found on earth   ann dreams again to see  seated upon her tapestry stool   her fairybook laid by she gazes into the fire knowing   she has sweet company     the miller and his son   a twangling harp for mary   a silvery flute for john and now well play the livelong day   the miller and his son  the miller went awalking   all in the forest high he sees three doves aflitting   against the dark blue sky  says he my son now follow   these doves so white and free that cry above the forest   and surely cry to thee  i go my dearest father   but o i sadly fear these doves so white will lead me far   but never bring me near  he kisses the miller   he cries awhoop to ye and straightway through the forest   follows the wooddoves three  there came a sound of weeping   to the miller in his mill red roses in a thicket   bloomed over near his wheel  three stars shone wild and brightly   above the forest dim but never his dearest son   returns again to him  the cuckoo shall call cuckoo   in vain along the vale the linnet and the blackbird   the mournful nightingale  the miller hears and sees not   thinking of his son his toppling wheel is silent   his grinding done  you doves so white he weepeth   you roses on the tree you stars that shine so brightly   you shine in vain for me  i bade him follow follow   he said o father dear these doves so white will lead me far   but never bring me near  a twangling harp for mary   a silvery flute for john and now well play the livelong day   the miller and his son     downadownderry   downadownderry   sweet annie maroon gathering daisies   in the meadows of doone hears a shrill piping   elflike and free where the waters go brawling   in rills to the sea     singing downadownderry  downadownderry   sweet annie maroon through the green grasses   peeps softly and soon spies under green willows   a fairy whose song like the smallest of bubbles   floats bobbing along     singing downadownderry  downadownderry   her cheeks were like wine her eyes in her wee face   like watersparks shine her niminy fingers   her sleep tresses preen the which in the combing   she peeps out between     singing downadownderry  downadownderry   shrill shrill was her tune come to my waterhouse   annie maroon come in your dimity   ribbon on head to wear siller seaweed   and coral instead     singing downadownderry  downadownderry   lean fish of the sea bring lanthorns for feasting   the gay faërie tis sand for the dancing   a music all sweet in the watergreen gloaming   for thistledown feet     singing downadownderry  downadownderry   sweet annie maroon looked large on the fairy   curled wan as the moon and all the grey ripples   to the mill racing by with harps and with timbrels   did ringing reply     singing downadownderry  downadownderry   sang the fairy of doone piercing the heart   of sweet annie maroon and lo when like roses   the clouds of the sun faded at dusk gone   was annie maroon     singing downadownderry  downadownderry   the daisies are few frost twinkles powdery   in haunts of the dew and only the robin   perched on a thorn can comfort the heart   of a father forlorn     singing downadownderry  downadownderry   theres snow in the air ice where the lily   bloomed waxen and fair he may call oer the water   crycry through the mill but annie maroon alas   answer neer will     singing downadownderry     the supper   a wolf he pricks with eyes of fire across the nights oercrusted snows     seeking his prey     he pads his way where jane benighted goes   where jane benighted goes  he curdles the bleak air with ire ruffling his hoary raiment through     and lo he sees     beneath the trees where janes light footsteps go   where janes light footsteps go  no hound peals thus in wicked joy he snaps his muzzle in the snows     his fiveclawed feet     do scamper fleet where janes bright lanthorn shows   where janes bright lanthorn shows  now his greeds green doth gaze unseen on a pure face of wilding rose     her amber eyes     in fears surprise watch largely as she goes   watch largely as she goes  salt wells his hunger in his jaws his lust it revels to and fro     yet small beneath     a soft voice saith jane shall in safety go   jane shall in safety go  he lurched as if a fiery lash had scourged his hide and through and through     his furious eyes     oerscanned the skies but nearer dared not go   but nearer dared not go  he reared like wild bucephalus his fangs like spears in him uprose     even to the town     janes flitting gown he grins on as she goes   he grins on as she goes  in fierce lament he howls amain he scampers marvelling in his throes     what brought him there     to sup on air while jane unharmèd goes   while jane unharmèd goes     the isle of lone   three dwarfs there were which lived in an isle   and the name of that isle was lone and the names of the dwarfs were alliolyle   lallerie muziomone  alliolye was green of een   lallerie light of locks muziomone was mild of mien   as ewes in april flocks  their house was small and sweet of the sea   and pale as the malmsey wine their bowls were three and their beds were three   and their nightcaps white were nine  their beds they were made of the hollywood   their combs of the tortoises shell three basins of silver in corners there stood   and three little ewers as well  green rushes green rushes lay thick on the floor   for light beamed a gobbet of wax there were three wooden stools for whatever they wore   on their humpitydumpity backs  so each would lie on a drowsy pillow   and watch the moon in the sky and hear the parrot scream to the billow   the billow roar reply  parrots of sapphire and sulphur and amber   scarlet and flame and green while fivefoot apes did scramble and clamber   in the featherytufted treen  all night long with bubbles aglisten   the ocean cried under the moon till ape and parrot too sleepy to listen   to sleep and slumber were gone  then from three small beds the dark hours while   in a house in the island of lone rose the snoring of lallerie alliolyle   the snoring of muziomone  but soon as ever came peep of sun   on coral and feathery tree three nightcapped dwarfs to the surf would run   and soon were abob in the sea  at six they went fishing at nine they snared   young foxes in the dells at noon on sweet berries and honey they fared   and blew in their twisted shells  dark was the sea they gambolled in   and thick with silver fish dark as green glass blown clear and thin   to be a monarchs dish  they sate to sup in a jasmine bower   lit pale with flies of fire their bowls the hue of the irisflower   and lemon their attire  sweet wine in little cups they sipped   and golden honeycomb into their bowls of cream they dipped   whipt light and white as foam  now alliolyle where the sandflower blows   taught three old apes to sing taught three old apes to dance on their toes   and caper around in a ring  they yelled them hoarse and they croaked them sweet   they twirled them about and around to the noise of their voices they danced with their feet   they stamped with their feet on the ground  but down to the shore skipped lallerie   his parrot on his thumb and the twain they scotched in mockery   while the dancers go and come  and alas in the evening rosy and still   lighthaired lallerie bitterly quarrelled with alliolyle   by the yellowsanded sea  the rising moon swam sweet and large   before their furious eyes and they rolled and rolled to the coral marge   where the surf for ever cries  too late too late comes muziomone   clear in the clear green sea alliolyle lies not alone   but clasped with lallerie  he blows on his shell plaintiff notes   ape parraquito bee flock where a shoe on the salt wave floats   the shoe of lallerie  he fetches nightcaps one and nine   grey apes he dowers three his house as fair as the malmsey wine   seems sad as cypresstree  three bowls he brims with sweet honeycomb   to feast the bumble bees saying o bees be this your home   for grief is on the seas  he sate him lone in a coral grot   at the flowing in of the tide when ebbed the billow there was not   save coral aught beside  so hairy apes in three white beds   and nightcaps one and nine on moonlit pillows lay three heads   bemused with dwarfish wine  a tomb of coral the dirge of bee   the grey apes guttural groan for alliolyle for lallerie   for thee o muziomone     sleeping beauty   the scent of bramble fills the air   amid her folded sheets she lies the gold of evening in her hair   the blue of morn shut in her eyes  how many a changing moon hath lit   the unchanging roses of her face her mirror ever broods on it   in silver stillness of the days  oft flits the moth on filmy wings   into his solitary lair shrill evensong the cricket sings   from some still shadow in her hair  in heat in snow in wind in flood   she sleeps in lovely loneliness halffolded like an april bud   on winterhaunted trees     the horn   hark is that a horn i hear   in cloudland winding sweet and belllike clash of bridlerein   and silvershod light feet  is it the elfin laughter   of fairies riding faint and high beneath the branches of the moon   straying through the starry sky  is it in the globèd dew   such sweet melodies may fall wood and valleyall are still   hushed the shepherds call     captain lean   out of the east a hurricane   swept down on captain lean that mariner and gentleman   will never again be seen  he sailed his ship against the foes   of his own country dear but now in the trough of the billows   an aimless course doth steer  powder was violets to his nostrils   sweet the din of the fightingline now he is flotsam on the seas   and his bones are bleached with brine  the stars move up along the sky   the moon she shines so bright and in that solitude the foam   sparkles unearthly white  this is the tomb of captain lean   would a straiter please his soul i trow he sleeps in peace   howsoever the billows roll     the portrait of a warrior   his brow is seamed with line and scar   his cheek is red and dark as wine the fires as of a northern star   beneath his cap of sable shine  his right hand bared of leathern glove   hangs open like an iron gin you stoop to see his pulses move   to hear the blood sweep out and in  he looks some king so solitary   in earnest thought he seems to stand as if across a lonely sea   he gazed impatient of the land  out of the noisy centuries   the foolish and the fearful fade yet burn unquenched these warrior eyes   time hath not dimmed nor death dismayed     haunted   from out the wood i watched them shine   the windows of the haunted house now ruddy as enchanted wine   now dark as flittermouse  there went a thin voice piping airs   along the grey and crooked walks a garden of thistledown and tares   bright leaves and giant stalks  the twilight rain shone at its gates   where longleaved grass in shadow grew and black in silence to her mates   a voiceless raven flew  lichen and moss the lone stones greened   green paths led lightly to its door keen from her hair the spider leaned   and dusk to darkness wore  amidst the sedge a whisper ran   the west shut down a heavy eye and like last tapers few and wan   the watchstars kindled in the sky     the ravens tomb   build me my tomb the raven said   within the dark yewtree so in the autumn yewberries   sad lamps may burn for me summon the haunted beetle   from twilight bud and bloom to drone a gloomy dirge for me   at dusk above my tomb beseech ye too the glowworm   to rear her cloudy flame where the small flickering bats resort   whistling in tears my name let the round dew a whisper make   welling on twig and thorn and only the grey cock at night   call through his silver horn and you dear sisters don your black   for ever and a day to show how true a raven   in his tomb is laid away     the christening   the bells chime clear soon will the sun behind the hills sink down come little ann your baby brother dear lies in his christeninggown  his godparents are all across the fields stepped on before and wait beneath the crumbling monuments this side the old church door  your mammie dear leans frail and lovely on your daddies arm watching her chick twixt happiness and fear lest he should come to harm  all to be blest full soon in the clear heavenly water he sleeps on unwitting of it his little breast heaving so tenderly  i carried you my little ann long since on this same quest and from the painted windows a pale hue lit golden on your breast  and then you woke chill as the holy water trickled down and weeping cast the window a strange look half smile half infant frown  i scarce could hear the shrill larks singing in the green meadows twas summertide and budding far and near the hedges thick with rose  and now youre grown a little girl and this same helpless mite is come like such another bud halfgrown out of the wintry night  time flies time flies and yet bless me tis little changed am i may jesu keep from tears those infant eyes be love their lullaby     the funeral   they dressed us up in black   susan and tom and me and walking through the fields   all beautiful to see with branches high in the air   and daisy and buttercup we heard the lark in the clouds   in black dressed up  they took us to the graves   susan and tom and me where the long grasses grow   and the funeral tree we stood and watched and the wind   came softly out of the sky and blew in susans hair   as i stood close by  back through the fields we came   tom and susan and me and we sat in the nursery together   and had our tea and looking out of the window   i heard the thrushes sing but tom fell asleep in his chair   he was so tired poor thing     the mother bird   through the green twilight of a hedge i peered with cheek on the cool leaves pressed and spied a bird upon a nest two eyes she had beseeching me meekly and brave and her brown breast throbbed hot and quick above her heart and then she opened her dagger bill twas not a chirp as sparrows pipe at break of day twas not a trill as falters through the quiet even but one sharp solitary note one desperate fierce and vivid cry of valiant tears and hopeless joy one passionate note of victory off like a fool afraid i sneaked smiling the smile the fool smiles best at the mother bird in the secret hedge patient upon her lonely nest     the child in the story goes to bed   i prythee nurse come smooth my hair   and prythee nurse unloose my shoe and trimly turn my silken sheet   upon my quilt of gentle blue  my pillow sweet of lavender   smooth with an amiable hand and may the dark pass peacefully by   as in the hourglass droops the sand  prepare my cornered manchet sweet   and in my little crystal cup pour out the blithe and flowering mead   that forthwith i may sup  withdraw my curtains from the night   and let the crispèd crescent shine upon my eyelids while i sleep   and soothe me with her beams benign  dark looks the forest faraway   o listen through its empty dales rings from the solemn echoing boughs   the music of its nightingales  now quench my silver lamp prythee   and bid the harpers harp that tune fairies which haunt the meadowlands   sing clearly to the stars of june  and bid them play though i in dreams   no longer heed their pining strains for i would not to silence wake   when slumber oer my senses wanes  you angels bright who me defend   enshadow me with curvèd wing and keep me in the darksome night   till dawn another day do bring     the lamplighter   when the light of day declines and a swift angel through the sky kindles gods tapers clear with ashen staff the lamplighter passes along the darkling streets to light our earthly lamps  lest prowling in the darkness the thief should haunt with quiet tread or men on evil errands set or wayfarers be benighted or neighbors bent from house to house should need a guiding torch  he is like a needlewoman who deftly on a sable hem stitches in gleaming jewels or haply he is like a hero whose bright deeds on the long journey are beacons on our way  and when in the east comes morning and the broad splendour of the sun then with the tune of little birds rings on high the lamplighter passes by each quiet house and he puts out the lamps     i met at eve   i met at eve the prince of sleep   his was a still and lovely face he wandered through a valley steep   lovely in a lonely place  his garb was grey of lavender   about his brows a poppywreath burned like dim coals and everywhere   the air was sweeter for his breath  his twilight feet no sandals wore   his eyes shone faint in their own flame fair moths that gloomed his steps before   seemed letters of his lovely name  his house is in the mountain ways   a phantom house of misty walls whose golden flocks at evening graze   and witch the moon with muffled calls  upwelling from his shadowy springs   sweet waters shake a trembling sound there flit the hootowls silent wings   there hath his web the silkworm wound  dark in his pools clear visions lurk   and rosy as with morning buds along his dales of broom and birk   dreams haunt his solitary woods  i met at eve the prince of sleep   his was a still and lovely face he wandered through a valley steep   lovely in a lonely place     lullaby   sleep sleep lovely white soul the little mouse cheeps plaintively the nightbird in the chestnuttree they sing together bird and mouse in starlight in darkness lonely sweet the wild notes and the faint notes meet   sleep sleep lovely white soul  sleep sleep lovely white soul amid the lilies floats the moth the mole along his galleries goeth in the dark earth the summer moon looks like a shepherd through the pane seeking his feeble lamp again   sleep sleep lovely white soul  sleep sleep lovely white soul time comes to keep nightwatch with thee nodding with roses and the sea saith peace peace amid his foam o be still the wind cries up the whispering hill   sleep sleep lovely white soul     envoi   child do you love the flower   ashine with colour and dew lighting its transient hour     so i love you  the lambs in the mead are at play   neath a hurdle the shepherds asleep from height to height of the day     the sunbeams sweep  evening will come and alone   the dreamer the dark will beguile all the world will be gone     for a dreams brief while  then i shall be old and away   and you with sad joy in your eyes will brood over children at play     with as loveful surmise
