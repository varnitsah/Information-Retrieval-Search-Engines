did i happen to own a farm asked uncle john interrupting his soup long enough to fix an inquiring glance upon major doyle who sat opposite  by virtue of circumstance my dear sir replied the major composedly its a part of my duty in attending to those affairs you wont look afther yourself to lend certain sums of your money to needy and ambitious young men who want a start in life  oh uncle do you do that exclaimed miss patricia doyle who sat between her uncle and father and kept an active eye upon both  so the major says answered uncle john dryly  and its true asserted the other hes assisted three or four score young men to start in business in the last year to my certain knowledge by lending them sums ranging from one to three thousand dollars and its the most wasteful and extravagant charity i ever heard of  but im so glad cried patsy clapping her hands with a delighted gesture its a splendid way to do goodto help young men to get a start in life without capital you know many a young fellow would never get his foot on the first round of the ladder  and many will never get it there in any event declared the major with a shake of his grizzled head more than half the rascals that john helps go to the dogs entirely and hang us up for all theyve borrowed  i told you to help deserving young men remarked uncle john with a scowl at his brotherinlaw  and how can i tell whether theyre desarving or not retorted major doyle fiercely do ye want me to become a sleuth or engage detectives to track the objects of your erroneous philanthropy i just have to form a judgment an take me chances and whin a poor devil goes wrong i charge your account with the loss  but some of them must succeed ventured patsy in a conciliatory tone  some do said john merrick and that repays me for all my trouble  all your throuble sir queried the major you mane all my throublewell and your money and a heap of throuble that confounded farm has cost me with one thing and another  what of it retorted the little round faced millionaire leaning back in his chair and staring fixedly at the other thats what i employ you for  now now gentlemen cried patsy earnestly ill have no business conversation at the table you know my rules well enough  this isnt business asserted the major  of course not agreed uncle john mildly no one has any business owning a farm how did it happen major  the old soldier had already forgotten his grievance he quarreled persistently with his wealthy employer and brotherinlawwhom he fairly adoredto prevent the possibility as he often confided to patsy of his falling down and worshiping him john merrick was a multimillionaire to be sure but there were palliating circumstances that almost excused him he had been so busily occupied in industry that he never noticed how his wealth was piling up until he discovered it by accident then he promptly retired to give the other fellows a chance and he now devoted his life to simple acts of charity and the welfare and entertainment of his three nieces he had rescued major doyle and his daughter from a lowly condition and placed the former in the great banking house of isham marvin  company where john merricks vast interests were protected and his income wisely managed he had given patsy this cosy little apartment house at 3708 willing square and made his home with her from which circumstance she had come to be recognized as his favorite niece  john merrick was sixty years old he was short stout and chubbyfaced with snowwhite hair mild blue eyes and an invariably cheery smile simple in his tastes modest and retiring lacking the education and refinements of polite society but shrewd and experienced in the affairs of the world the little man found his greatest enjoyment in the family circle that he had been instrumental in founding being no longer absorbed in business he had come to detest its every detail and so allowed his bankers to care for his fortune and his brotherinlaw to disburse his income while he himself strove to enjoy life in a shy and boyish fashion that was as unusual in a man of his wealth as it was admirable he had never married  patricia was the apple of uncle johns eye and the one goddess enshrined in her doting fathers heart glancing at her as she sat here at table in her plain muslin gown a stranger would be tempted to wonder why she was redhaired freckled as a robins egg pugnosed and widemouthed but her blue eyes were beautiful and they sparkled with a combination of saucy mischief and kindly consideration for others that lent her face an indescribable charm  everyone loved patsy doyle and people would gaze longer at her smilinglips and dancing eyes than upon many a more handsome but less attractive face she was nearly seventeen years old not very tall and her form to speak charitably was more neat than slender  a while ago said the major resuming the conversation as he carved the roast a young fellow came to me who had invented a new sort of pump to inflate rubber tires he wanted capital to patent the pump and put it on the market the thing looked pretty good john so i lent him a thousand of your money  quite right returned uncle john nodding  but pretty soon he came back with a sad tale he was in a bad fix another fellow was contesting his patent and fighting hard to head him off it would take a lot of money to fight backthree thousand at least but he was decent about it after all his father had left him a little farm at millville he couldnt say what it was worth but there were sixty acres and some good buildings and he would deed it to you as security if you would let him have three thousand more  so you took the farm and gave him the money  i did sir perhaps i am to blame but i liked the young fellows looks he was cleancut and frank and believed in his pump i did more at the climax of the struggle i gave another thousand making five thousand in all  well  its gone john and youve got the farm the other fellows were too clever for my young friend joseph wegg and knocked out his patent  im so sorry said patsy sympathetically  the major coughed  its not an unusual tale my dear especially when john advances the money he replied  what became of the young man asked the girl  hes a competent chauffeur and so he went to work driving an automobile  where is millville inquired uncle john thoughtfully  somewhere at the north of the state i believe  have you investigated the farm at all  i looked up a real estate dealer living at millville and wrote him about the wegg farm he said if any one wanted the place very badly it might sell for three thousand dollars  humph  but his best information was to the effect that no one wanted it at all  patsy laughed  poor uncle john she said  the little man however was serious for a time he ate with great deliberation and revolved an interesting thought in his mind  years ago said he i lived in a country town and i love the smell of the meadows and the hum of the bees in the orchards any orchards at my farm major  dont know sir  pretty soon continued uncle john its going to be dreadfully hot in new york and well have to get away  seashores the place remarked the major atlantic city or swampscott or  rubbish growled the other man impatiently the girls and i have just come from europe weve had enough sea to last us all this season at least what we pine for is country lifepure milk apple trees and new mown hay  we uncle said patsy  yes my dear a couple of months on the farm will do all of my nieces good beth is still with louise you know and they must find the city deadly dull just now the farms the thing and the major can run up to see us for a couple of weeks in the hot weather and well all have a glorious lazy time  and we can take mary along to do the cooking suggested patsy entering into the idea enthusiastically  and eat in our shirtsleeves said uncle john with a glowing face  and have a cow and some pigs cried the girl  pah said the major scornfully you talk as if it were a real farm instead of a place no one would have as a gift  uncle john looked sober again  anyone live on the place major he inquired  i believe not its gone to ruin and decay the last few years  but it could be put into shape  perhaps so at an expense that will add to your loss  never mind that  if you want farm life why dont you rent a respectable farm demanded the major  no this is my farm i own it and its my bounded duty to live on it said uncle john stubbornly write to that real estate fellow at millville tomorrow and tell him to have the place fixed up and put into shipshape order as quickly as possible tell him to buy some cows and pigs and chickens and hire a man to look after them also a horse and buggy some saddle horses  go slow john dont leave such a job to a country real estate dealer if i remember right the fellow wrote like a blacksmith if you want horses and rigs let hutchinson send you down the right sort with an experienced groom and stable hands but im not sure there will be a place to put them  oh uncle exclaimed patsy dont let us have all those luxuries let us live a simple life on the farm and not degrade its charms by adding city fixins the cow and the chickens are all right but lets cut out the horses until we get there dont you know dear that a big establishment means lots of servants and servants mean worry and strife i want to let down the bars for the cow when she moos and milk her myself  it takes a skilled mechanic to milk a cow objected the major  but patsys right cried her uncle with conviction we dont want any frills at all just tell your man major to put the place into good living condition  patrichia softly remarked the major with an admiring glance at his small daughter has more sinse in her frizzled head than both of us put together  if she hadnt more than you retorted uncle john with a grin id put a candle inside her noodle and call her a jacklantern    chapter ii  the agent  the major hunted up the real estate dealers former letter as soon as he reached his office next morning the printed letterhead somewhat blurred because too much ink had been used read as follows    marshall mcmahon mcnutt   real estate dealer  horses to pasture   by the week or month    also plymouth rock hens  road commissioner   agent for radleys lives of the saints   insurance and watermelons my specialty    millville mount county ny  the major shook his head doubtfully as he read the above announcement but mr mcnutt was the only known person to whom he could appeal to carry out john merricks orders so he dictated the following letter   dear sir  mr john merrick the present owner of the wegg farm at millville desires to spend his summer vacation on the premises and therefore requests you to have the house and grounds put in firstclass shape as soon as possible and to notify me directly the work is done have the house thoroughly cleaned the grass mowed around it and the barns and outbuildings repaired wherever it may be necessary you are also instructed to procure for mr merricks use a good jersey cow some pigs and a dozen or so barnyard fowls as several ladies will accompany the owner and reside with him on the place he would like you to report what necessary furniture if any will be required for their comfort send your bill to me and it will receive prompt attention  after several days this reply came  mister doyle you must be crazy as a loon send me fifty cold dollars as an evvidence of good fayth and i wull see what can be done old hucks is livin on the place yit do you want him to git out or what yours fer a square deal marshall mcmahon mcnutt  john said the major exhibiting this letter youre on the wrong tack the man is justified in thinking were crazy give up this idea and think of something else to bother me  but the new proprietor of the wegg farm was obdurate during the past week he had indulged in sundry sly purchases which had been shipped in his name to chazy junction the nearest railway station to millville therefore the die had been cast as far as mr merrick was concerned for the purchases were by this time at the farm awaiting him and he could not back out without sacrificing them they included a set of gardening tools several hammocks croquet and tennis sets and a remarkable collection of fishing tackle which the sportinggoods man had declared fitted to catch anything that swam from a whale to a minnow also uncle john decided to dress the part of a rural gentleman and ordered his tailor to prepare a corduroy fishing costume a suit of white flannel one of khaki and some oldfashioned blue jean overalls with apron front which when made to order by the obliging tailor cost about eighteen dollars a suit to forego the farm meant to forego all these luxuries and mr merrick was unequal to the sacrifice why only that same morning he had bought a charming cottage piano and shipped it to the junction for patsys use that seemed to settle the matter definitely to be balked of his summer vacation on his own farm was a thing mr merrick would not countenance for a moment  give me that letter major he said ill run this enterprise myself  the major resigned with a sigh of relief  uncle john promptly sent the real estate agent a draft for five hundred dollars with instructions to get the farm in shape for occupancy at the earliest possible day  if old hucks is a farm hand and a bachelor he wrote let him stay till i come and look him over if hes a married man and has a family chuck him out at once im sure you are a man of good taste and judgment look over the furniture in the house and telegraph me what condition it is in everything about the place must be made cozy and comfortable but i wish to avoid an appearance of vulgarity or extravagance  the answer to this was a characteristic telegram  furniture on the bum like everything else will do the best i can mcnutt  uncle john did not display this discouraging report to patsy or her father a little thought on the matter decided him to rectify the deficiencies in so far as it lay in his power he visited a large establishment making a specialty of furnishing homes complete and ordered a new kitchen outfit including a modern range a mission style outfit for a diningroom dainty summer furniture for the five chambers to be occupied by his three nieces the major and himself and a variety of lawn benches chairs etc  look after the details he said to the dealer dont neglect anything that is pretty or useful  i wont sir replied the man who knew his customer was the great john merrick who could furnish a city complete if he wished to and not count the cost  everything was to be shipped in haste to the junction and uncle john wrote mcnutt to have it delivered promptly to the farm and put in order  as soon as things are in shape he wrote wire me to that effect and ill come down but dont let any grass grow under your feet im a man who requires prompt service  the days were already getting uncomfortably warm and the little man was nervously anxious to see his farm so were the nieces for that matter who were always interested in the things that interested their eccentric uncle besides patricia doyle whom we have already introduced these nieces were miss louise merrick who had just celebrated her eighteenth birthday and miss elizabethor bethde graf now well past fifteen beth lived in a small town in ohio but was then visiting her city cousin louise so that both girls were not only available but eager to accompany uncle john to his new domain and assist him to enjoy his summer outing    chapter iii  millville hears exciting news  millville is rather difficult to locate on the map for the railroads found it impossible to run a line there chazy junction the nearest station is several miles away and the wagon road ascends the foothills every step of the distance finally you pass between mount parnassus whoever named it that and little bill hill and find yourself on an almost level plateau some four miles in diameter with a placid lake in the center and a fringe of tall pines around the edge at the south where tower the northern sentries of the adirondacks a stream called little bill creek comes splashing and dashing over the rocks to force its way noisily into the lake when it emerges again it is humble and sedate and flows smoothly to hookers falls from whence it soon joins a tributary that leads it to far away champlain  millville is built where the little bill rushes into the lake the old mill with its race and sluicegates still grinds wearily the scanty dole of grain fed into its hoppers and silas caldwell takes his toll and earns his modest living just as his father did before him and little bill thompson did before him  above the mill a rickety wooden bridge spans the stream for here the highway from chary junction reaches the village of millville and passes the wooden structures grouped on either side its main street on the way to thompsons crossing nine miles farther along the town boasts exactly eleven buildings not counting the mill which being on the other side of the little bill can hardly be called a part of millville proper cottings store contains the postoffice and telephone booth and is naturally the central point of interest seth davis blacksmith shop comes next widow clarks emporium for the sale of candy stationery and cigars adjoins that mcnutts office and dwelling combined is next and then thornes livery and feed stables you must understand they are not set close together but each has a little ground of its own on the other side of the street is the hardware store with farm machinery occupying the broad platform before it and then the millville house a twostoried hotel with a shedlike wing for the billiardroom and card tables nib corkins drug store jewelry store and music store combined with sewing machines for a side line is the last of the business establishments and the other three buildings are dwellings occupied by sam cotting seth davis and nick thorne  dick pearsons farm house is scarcely a quarter of a mile up the highway but it isnt in millville for all that theres a cross lane just beyond pearsons leading east and west and a mile to westward is the wegg farm in the wildest part of the foothills  it is a poor farming country around millville strangers often wonder how the little shops of the town earn a living for their proprietors but it doesnt require a great deal to enable these simple folk to live the tourist seldom penetrates these inaccessible foothills the roads are too rough and primitive for automobiles so millville is shamefully neglected and civilization halted there some half a century ago  however there was a genuine sensation in store for this isolated hamlet and it was the more welcome because anything in the way of a sensation had for many years avoided the neighborhood  marshall mcmahon mcnutt or as he was more familiarly called by those few who respected him most highly marsh mcnutt and sundry other appellations by those who respected him not at all became the recipient of a letter from new york announcing the intention of a certain john merrick the new owner of the wegg farm to spend the summer on the place mcnutt was an undersized man of about forty with a beardless face scraggly buffcolored hair and eyes that were big light blue and remarkably protruding the stare of those eyes was impenetrable because observers found it embarrassing to look at them macs friends had a trick of looking away when they spoke to him but children gazed fascinated at the expressionless blue eyeballs and regarded their owner with awe  the real estate agent was considered an enterprising man by his neighbors and a poor stick by his wife he had gone to school at thompsons crossing in his younger days had a call to preach but failed because he couldnt get religion inherited a farm from his uncle and married sam cottings sister whose tongue and temper were so sharp that everyone marveled at the mans temerity in acquiring them finally he had lost one foot in a mowing machine and the accident destroyed his further usefulness to the extent of inducing him to abandon the farm and move into town here he endeavored to find something to do to eke out his meagre income so he raised thoroughbred plymouth rocks selling eggs for hatching to the farmers doctored sick horses and pastured them in the lot back of his barn the rear end of which was devoted to watermelons in season sold subscription books to farmers who came to the mill or the village store was elected road commissioner and bossed the neighbors when they had to work out their polltax and turned his hand to any other affairs that offered a pennys recompense the real estate business was what seth davis labeled a blobbering bluff for no property had changed hands in the neighborhood in a score of years except the lot back of the mill which was traded for a yoke of oxen and the wegg farm which had been sold without the agents knowledge or consent  the only surprising thing about the sale of the wegg farm was that anyone would buy it captain wegg had died three years before and his son joe wandered south to albany worked his way through a technical school and then disappeared in the mazes of new york so the homestead seemed abandoned altogether except for the huckses  when captain wegg died old hucks his hired man and hucks blind wife nora were the only dependents on the place and the ancient couple had naturally remained there when joe scorned his inheritance and ran away after the sale they had no authority to remain but were under no compulsion to move out so they clung to their old quarters  when mcnutt was handed his letter by the postmaster and storekeeper he stared at its contents in a bewildered way that roused the loungers to amused laughter  whats up peggy called nick thorne from his seat on the counter somebody gone offn me hooks an left ye a fortun  peggy was one of mcnutts most popular nicknames acquired because he wore a short length of pine where his absent foot should have been  not quite was the agents slow reply but heres the blamedest funniest communicate a man ever got its from some critter that knows the man what bought the wegg farm  lets hear it remarked cotting the storekeeper a fat individual with a bald head who was counting matches from a shelf into the public matchbox he allowed the boys just twenty free matches a day  so the agent read the letter in an uncertain halting voice and when he had finished it the little group stared at one another for a time in thoughtful silence  wall ill be plunked finally exclaimed the blacksmith looks like the fellers rich dont it  ef hes rich what the tarnation blazes is he comin here for demanded nib corkins the dandy of the town i was over t huntingdon las year n seen how the rich folks live boys this haint no place for a man with money  that depends responded cotting gravely im sure wed all be better off if we had a few real bloods here to squander their substance  well heres a perposal to squander all right said mcnutt but the question is does he know what hes runnin up agin and what itll cost to do all the idiotic things as he says  probly not answered the storekeeper  its the best built farm house round thest parts announced the miller who had been silent until now old wegg were a seacapn once an rich he dumped a lot o money inter that place an never got it out agin nuther  course not sixty acres o cobblestone dont pay much divvydends that i ever hearn tell on replied seth  theres some good fruit though continued caldwell an the berries allus paid the taxes an left a little besides ol hucks gits along all right  jest lives n thats all  well thets enough said the miller its about all any of us do aint it  do ye take it this ere merricks goin to farm er what asked nib speculatively  i take it hes plumb crazy retorted the agent rubbing the fringe of hair behind his ears one things certain boys i dont do nuthin foolish till i see the color of his money  make him send you ten dollars in advance suggested seth  make him send fifty amended the storekeeper you cant buy a cow an pigs an chickens an make repairs on much less  by jinks i will cried mcnutt slapping his leg for emphasis ill strike him fer a cool fifty an if the feller dont pay he kin go to blazes thems my sentiments boys an ill stand by em  the others regarded him admiringly so the energetic little man stumped away to indite his characteristic letter to major doyle  if the first communication had startled the little village the second fairly plunged it into a panic of excitement peggys hand trembled as he held out the five hundred dollar draft and glared from it to his cronies with a white face  suffrin jehu gasped nick thorne is it good  the paper was passed reverently around and examined with a succession of dubious headshakes  send for bob west suggested cotting hes seen more o that sort o money than any of us  the widow clarkes boy who was present ran breathlessly to fetch the hardware dealer who answered the summons when he learned that peggy mcnutt had received a check for five hundred dollars  west was a tall lean man with shrewd eyes covered by horn spectacles and a stubby gray mustache he was the potentate of the town and reputed to be worth at a conservative estimate in the neighborhood of ten thousand dollarser more fer that matter fer bob aint tellin his business to nobody hardware and implements were acknowledged to be paying merchandise and west lent money on farm mortgages besides he was a quiet man had a good library in his comfortable rooms over the store and took the only new york paper that found its way into millville after a glance at the remittance he said  its a draft on isham marvin  company the new york bankers good as gold mcnutt where did you get it  a lunitic named john merrick him thats bought the capn wegg farm sent it on heres his letter bob  the hardware dealer read it carefully and gave a low whistle  there may be more than one john merrick he said thoughtfully but ive heard of one who is many times a millionaire and a power in the financial world what will you do for him mcnutt to expend this money properly  blesst if i know answered the man his eyes bulging with a helpless look what n thunder kin i do bob  west smiled  i dont wish to interfere in business matters said he but it is plainly evident that the new owner wishes the farm house put into such shape that it will be comfortable for a man accustomed to modern luxuries you dont know much about such things mac and mr merrick has made a blunder in employing your services in such a delicate matter but do the best you can ride across to the wegg place and look it over then get taft the carpenter to fix up whatever is necessary ill sell you the lumber and nails and youve got more money than you can probably use telegraph mr merrick frankly how you find things but remember the report must not be based upon your own mode of life but upon that of a man of wealth and refinement especially he must be posted about the condition of the furniture which i can guess is illsuited to his needs  how bout hucks asked the agent  they all hung eagerly on wests reply for old hucks was a general favorite the fact that the old retainer of the weggs had a blind wife to whom he was tenderly devoted made the proposition of his leaving the farm one of intense interest old hucks and his patient wife had not been so much hired help as a part of the wegg establishment and it was doubtful if they had ever received any wages it was certain that hucks had not a dollar in the world at the present time and if turned out of their old home the ancient couple must either starve or go to the poorhouse  say nothing further about old hucks or his wife to mr merrick advised west gravely when the owner comes he will need servants and hucks is a very capable old fellow let that problem rest until the time comes for solution if the old folks are to be turned out make john merrick do it it will put the responsibility on his shoulders  by dum yer right bob exclaimed mcnutt slapping the counter with his usual impulsiveness ill do the best i kin for the rich man an let the poor man alone  after an examination of the farm house and other buildings which seemed in his eyes almost palatial and a conference with alonzo taft the carpenter the agent began to feel that his task was going to prove an easy one he purchased a fine jersey cow of will johnson sold his own flock of plymouth rocks at a high price to mr merrick and hired ned long to work around the yard and help hucks mow the grass and clean up generally  but now his real trouble and bewilderment began a carload of new furniture and fixins was sidetracked at the junction and mcnutt was ordered to get it unloaded and carted to the farm without delay there were four hayrack loads of the truck altogether and when it was all dumped into the big empty barn at the wegg farm the poor agent had no idea what to do with it  see here said nick thorne who had done the hauling youve got to let a woman inter this deal peggy  thats what my wife says gumtwist her  keep yer ol woman outn it shed spile a rotten apple  who then nick  why schoolteachers the right one i guess theyve got a vacation now an likely shell come over here an put things to rights peggy that air new furnitures the rambunctionest stuff thet ever come inter these parts an itll make the ol house bloom like a rose in spring but folks like us haint got no call to tech it you fetch schoolteacher  peggy sighed he was keeping track of his time and charging john merrick at the rate of two dollars a day being firmly resolved to make hay while the sun was shining and absorb as much of the money placed in his hands as possible to let schoolteacher into this deal and be obliged to pay her wages was an undesirable thing to do yet he reflected that it might be wise to adopt nick thornes suggestion  so next morning he drove the liverymans sorrel mare out to thompsons crossing where the brick schoolhouse stood on one corner and will thompsons residence on another a mile away could be seen the spires of the little church at hookers falls  mcnutt hitched his horse to thompsons post walked up the neat pebbled path and knocked at the door  ethel in he asked of the sadfaced woman who after some delay answered his summons  shes in the garden weedin  ill go round said the agent  the garden was a bower of roses among them stood a slender girl in a checked gingham tying vines to a trellis  mornn ethel said the visitor  the girl smiled at him she was not very pretty because her face was long and wan and her nose a bit onesided but her golden hair sparkled in the sun like a mass of spun gold and the smile was winning in its unconscious sweetness surely such attractions were enough for a mere country girl  ethel thompson had however another claim to distinction she had been eddicated as her neighbors acknowledged in awed tones and took a diploma from a college school at troy young as she was ethel had taught school for two years and might have a life tenure if she cared to retain the position as he looked at her neat gown and noted the grace and ease of her movements the agent acknowledged that he had really come to the right shop to untangle his perplexing difficulties  new folks is comin to the capn wegg farm he announced as a beginning  she turned and looked at him queerly  has joe sold the place she asked  near a year ago some fool rich man has bought it and is comin down here to spend his summer vacation he says here read his letters theyll explain it better n i can  her hand trembled a little as she took the letters mcnutt pulled from his pocket then she sat upon a bench and read them all through by that time she had regained her composure  the gentleman is somewhat eccentric she remarked but he will make no mistake in coming to this delightful place if he wishes quiet and rest  dont know what hes after im sure replied the man but hes sent down enough furniture an truck to stock a hotel an i want to know ef youll go over an put it in the rooms an straighten things out  me  why yes youve lived in cities some an know how citified things go contwist it ethel theres things in the bunch that neither i ner nick thorne ever hearn tell of much less knowin what theyre used for  the girl laughed  when are the folks coming she asked  when i git things in shape theyve sent some money down to pay fer whats done so you wont have to work fer nuthin  i will though responded the girl in a cheery tone it will delight me to handle pretty things are nora and tom still there  oh yes i had orders to turn the huckses out ye see but i didnt do it  im glad of that she returned brightly perhaps we may arrange it so they can stay old noras a dear  but shes blind  she knows every inch of the wegg house and does her work more thoroughly than many who can see when do you want me peggy  soons you kin come  then ill be over tomorrow morning  at that moment a wild roar like that of a beast came from the house the sad faced woman ran down a passage a door slammed and then all was quiet again  mcnutt hitched uneasily from the wooden foot to the good one  hows ol will he enquired in a low voice  grandfathers about as usual replied the girl with trained composure  still crazy as a bedbug  at times he becomes a bit violent but those attacks never last long  dont spose i could see him ventured the agent still in hesitating tones  oh no he has seen no visitor since captain wegg died  well goodbye ethel see you at the farm in the mornin  the girl sat for a long time after mcnutt had driven away seemingly lost in revery  poor joe she sighed at last poor foolish joe i wonder what has become of him    chapter iv  ethel makes preparation  the wegg homestead stood near the edge of a thin forest of pines through which little bill creek wound noisily on its way to the lake at the left was a slope on which grew a neglected orchard of apple and pear trees their trunks rough and gnarled by the struggle to outlive many severe winters there was a rude rocky lane in front separated from the yard by a fence of split pine rails but the ground surrounding the house was rich enough to grow a profusion of june grass  the farm was of very little value back of the yard was a fairly good berry patch but aside from that some two acres of corn and a small strip of timothy represented all that was fertile of the sixty acres the place contained  but the house itself was the most imposing dwelling for many miles around just why that silent old seadog jonas wegg had come into this secluded wilderness to locate was a problem the millville people had never yet solved certainly it was with no idea of successfully farming the land he had acquired for half of it was stony and half covered by pine forest but the house he constructed was the wonder of the countryside in its day it was a big twostory building the lower half being jest cobblestones as the neighbors sneeringly remarked while the upper half was decent pine lumber the lower floor of this main building consisted of a single room with a great cobblestone fireplace in the center of the rear wall and narrow prisonlike windows at the front and sides there was a small porch in front with a great entrance door of carved dark wood of a foreign look which the captain had brought from some port in massachusetts a stair in one corner of the big living room led to the second story where four large bedchambers were arranged these had once been plastered and papered but the wallpaper had all faded into dull neutral tints and in one of the rooms a big patch of plaster had fallen away from the ceiling showing the bare lath only one of the upstairs rooms had ever been furnished and it now contained a corded wooden bedstead a cheap pine table and one brokenlegged chair indeed the main building which i have briefly described had not been in use for many years sometimes when captain wegg was alive he would build a log fire in the great fireplace on a winters evening and sit before it in silent mood until far into the night and once when his young wife had first occupied the new house the big room had acquired a fairly cosy and comfortable appearance but it had always been sparsely furnished and most of the decadent furniture that now littered it was useless and unlovely  the big wooden leanto at the back and the right wing were at this time the only really habitable parts of the mansion the leanto had an entrance from the living room but old hucks and nora his wife used the back door entirely it consisted of a large and cheerful kitchen and two rooms off it one used as a store room and the other as a sleeping chamber for the aged couple  the right wing was also constructed of cobblestone and had formerly been captain weggs own chamber after his death his only child joe then a boy of sixteen had taken possession of his fathers room but after a day or two he had suddenly quitted the house where he was born and plunged into the great outside worldto seek his fortune it was said decidedly there was no future for the boy here in the cities lurks opportunity  when ethel thompson arrived in the early morning that followed her interview with mcnutt she rode her pony through the gap in the rail fence across the june grass and around to the back door on a bench beside the pump an old woman sat shelling peas her form was thin but erect and her hair snowy white she moved with alertness and as the girl dismounted and approached her she raised her head and turned a pleasant face with deepset sightless gray eyes upon her visitor  good morning ethel dear she said i knew the ponys whinney youre up early today  good morning nora responded the schoolteacher advancing to kiss the withered cheek are you pretty well  in body dear in mind both tom n mes pretty bad i spose we couldnt a spected to stay here in peace forever but the blows come suddinlike an it hurts us  where is tom  in the barn lookin over all the wonerful things the rich nabob has sent here he says most things has strips o wood nailed over em but some hasnt an tom looks em over keerful an then tells me bout em hes gone to take another look at a wonerful new cookstove sos he kin describe it to me right pertickler  is he worried nora  wes both worried ethel our times come an no mistake peggy mcnutt says as he had real orders to turn hucks out if he was a married man an theres no disclaimin hes married is there peggys a kind man an tol us to keep stayin til the nabobs arrove then i guess well git our walkinpapers mighty quick  im not sure of that said the girl thoughtfully they must be hardhearted indeed to turn you out into the world and you are both capable people and would serve the city folks faithfully and well  its my eyes replied the other in a simple matteroffact tone hucks might wait on the nabobs all right but they wont tolrate a blind woman a minute im sure an hucks d ruther be with me in the poorhouse than to let me go alone  right y air nora girl cried a merry voice and as the blind woman looked up with a smile ethel turned around to face old hucks  a tall man but much bent at the shoulders and limping in one leg from an old hurt aggravated by rheumatism his form was as gnarled as the treetrunks in the appleorchard and twisted almost as fantastically but the head uplifted from the stooped shoulders and held a little to one side was remarkable enough to attract attention it had scanty white locks and a fringe of white whiskers under the chin and these framed a smiling face and features that were extremely winning in expression no one could remember ever seeing old hucks when he was not smiling and the expression was neither set nor inane but so cheery and bright that you were tempted to smile with him without knowing why for dress he wore a much patched pair of woolen trousers and a hickory shirt of faded blue with rough top boots and a dilapidated straw hat that looked as if it might have outlived several generations  as ethel greeted the man she looked him over carefully and sighed at the result for certainly as far as personal appearances went he seemed as unlikely a person to serve a nabob as could well be imagined but the girl knew thomas good points and remembering them took courage  if the worst comes she said brightly you are both to come to us to live ive arranged all that with grandmother you know but im not much afraid of your being obliged to leave here from all accounts this mr merrick is a generous and freehearted man and ive discovered that strangers are not likely to be fearsome when you come to know them the unknown always makes us childishly nervous you see and then we forget its wrong to borrow trouble  trues gospil said old hucks to know my nora is to love her evbody loves nora an the good lord hes tookn care o us so long it seems like a sort o sacrelidge to feel that all thet pretty furnture in the barn spells ony poorhouse to us eh ethel  mcnutt arrived just then with big ned long lon taft the carpenter and widow clark that lady having agreed to help with the cleanin she didnt usually work out but was impelled to this task as much through curiosity to see the new furniture as from desire to secure the wages  at once the crowd invaded the living room and after a glance around ethel ordered every bit of the furniture with the exception of two antique but comfortable horsehair sofas carried away to the barn and stored in the loft it did not take long to clear the big room and then the widow clark swept out and began to scrub the floor and woodwork while schoolteacher took her men into the right wing and made another clearing of its traps  this room interested the girl very much in it joe was born and frail mrs wegg and her silent husband had both passed away it had two broad french windows with sash doors opening on to a little porch of its own which was covered thickly with honeysuckle vines a cupboard was built into a niche of the thick cobblestone wall but it was locked and the key was missing  upstairs the girl had the rubbish removed for the first time in a generation the corded bedstead in the north room was sent to join its fellows in the barn loft and ned long swept everything clean in readiness for the scrubbers  then while widow clark and nora cleaned industriouslyfor the blind woman insisted on helping and did almost as much work as her companionthe men folks proceeded to the barn and under the schoolteachers directions uncrated the new furniture and opened the bales of rugs and matting lon taft was building new steps to the front porch but old hucks and ned and mcnutt reverently unpacked the truck and set each piece carefully aside how they marveled at the enameled beds and colored wicker furniture the easy chairs for lounging the dainty dressers and all the innumerable pretty things discovered in boxes bales and barrels you may well imagine even ethel was amazed and delighted at the thoughtfulness of the dealer in including everything that might be useful or ornamental in a summer home  the next few days were indeed busy ones for the girl entered enthusiastically upon her task to transform the old house and with the material john merrick had so amply provided she succeeded admirably the little maid was country bred but having seen glimpses of city life and possessing much native good taste she arranged the rooms so charmingly that they would admit of scant improvement the big living room must serve as a dining room as well as parlor but so spacious was it that such an arrangement proved easy no especial furniture for the living room had been provided but by stealing a few chairs and odd pieces from the ample supply provided for the bedrooms adding the two quaint sofas and the upright piano and spreading the rugs in an artistic fashion ethel managed to make the parlor part of the room appear very cosy the dining corner had a round table and highbacked chairs finished in weathered oak and when all was in order the effect was not inharmonious some inspiration had induced mr merrick to send down a batch of eighteen framed pictures procured at a bargain but from a reliable dealer he thought they might help out and ethel knew they would for the walls of the old house were quite bare of ornament she made them go as far as possible and old hucks by this time thoroughly bewildered hung them where she dictated and made laughable attempts to describe the subjects to blind nora  a telegram telephoned over from the junction announced the proposed arrival of the party on thursday morning and the schoolteacher was sure that everything would be in readiness at that time the paint on lons repairs would be dry the grass in the front yard was closely cropped and the little bed of flowers between the corncrib and the woodshed was blooming finely the cow was in the stable the pigs in the shed and the plymouth rocks strutted over the yard with an absurd assumption of pride  wednesday ethel took old hucks over to millville and bought for him from sam cotting a new suit of dark gray store clothes together with shirts shoes and underwear she made mcnutt pay the bill with john merricks money agreeing to explain the case to the nabob herself and back up the agent in the unauthorized expenditure nora had a new gingham dress too which the girl had herself provided and on thursday morning ethel was at the wegg farm bright and early to see the old couple properly attired to receive their new master she also put a last touch to the pretty furniture and placed vases of her own roses and sweet peas here and there to render the place homelike and to welcome the expected arrivals  if they dont like it said the girl smiling theyre rather hard to please  theyre sure to like it dear answered old nora touching with sensitive fingers the flowers the books and the opened piano if they dont theyre heretics an sinners an theres no good in em whatever  then the little schoolteacher bade goodbye to hucks and his wife told them to keep brave hearts and rode her pony crosslots to thompsons crossing    chapter v  the arrival of the nabobs  well said uncle john looking out of the car window were nearly there  he didnt look the millionaire or nabob or anything else but a modest little man full of joy at getting into the country his clothing was not distinctive of wealth his hands were hard and roughened by years of toil and his necktie had a plebeian trick of sliding under his left ear uncle john was just a plain simple goodhearted fellow before he acquired riches and the possession of millions had in no way altered his nature  the three nieces and himself were the only passengers in the coach aside from rosycheeked mary patricias cook finding that the road did not run a sleeper to chazy junction mr merrick had ordered one attached to the train for his especial use but he did not allow even patsy to suspect this extravagance  it seems to me observed beth as she peered out while the train puffed up the steep grade as if wed arrived at the heart of a wilderness where farms are likely to be as scarce as egyptian temples  the truth is replied her uncle with a cheerful smile that none of us has an idea where were going or what that farm of mine looks like were explorers like stanley in midafrica thats the beauty of this excursion  im glad i didnt bring any party dresses said dainty louise shaking her blonde head with a doubting expression toward the rock covered hills  why you might need them for hayrides remarked patsy with a laugh that is if any hay grows in this land of quarries  the train stopped with a jerk started with another jerk and stopped again with a third that made them catch their breaths and hold fast to the seats  chazy junction seh said the colored porter entering in haste to seize their bags  they alighted on a small wooden platform and their hand baggage was deposited beside them their trunks were being tumbled off a car far ahead  then the whistle screamed the train gave a jerk and proceeded on its way and uncle john his nieces and their maid found themselves confronting a solitary man in shirtsleeves who yawned languidly thrust his hands in his pockets and stared at the strangers unmoved  it was six oclock the july sun was set in a clear sky but the air was cool and pleasant uncle john glanced around with the eye of a practiced traveler back of the station was a huddle of frame buildings set in a hollow the stationtender was the only person in sight  isnt there a carriage to meet us asked louise in a slightly frigid tone  seems not replied her uncle then he addressed the native can you tell us sir where millville is he asked  sevn mile up the road  thank you kindly is there any carriage to be had  the man smiled sardonically  kerridges he said dont grow in these parts i take it you be the party fer the wegg farm  youre right said mr merrick im glad we are getting acquainted folks all well  pretty fair  now sir we want some breakfast to begin with and then some way to get to my farm  peggy orter a looked after you remarked the man eyeing the dainty gowns of the young ladies reflectively  whos peggy  thats mcnutt the man you hired to do things  ah yes he surely ought to have sent some sort of a team to meet us agreed uncle john whats that group of houses yonder  thets the junction  any hotel  sure  and a livery stable  course there is  then well get along said uncle john assuming a sudden brisk manner just keep your eye on our baggage till we get back my good fellow there are no people to interfere with it but some bears or tigers might come out of the hills and eat it up now girls away we go  uncle johns nieces were not so greatly dismayed at this experience as might have been expected they had recently accompanied their erratic relative on a european trip and had learned to be patient under difficulties  a quarter of a mile down the dusty road they came to the hotel a dismal unclean looking place that smelled of stale beer uncle john routed out the proprietor  folks up he inquired  long ago said the man  get us some boiled eggs bread and butter and plenty of fresh milkright away ordered mr merrick the quicker it comes the more ill pay you bring a table out here on the porch and well eat in the open air wheres the livery stableeh oh i see now step lively my man and your fortunes made ill add a quarter of a dollar for every five minutes you save us in time  the fellow stared then woke up with a start and disappeared within  by gum ill bet a hen its thet air nabob he muttered  leaving his girls and mary to sit on the wooden benches of the porch uncle john crossed the road to the livery stable where he discovered a man and a boy engaged in cleaning the half dozen sorry looking nags the establishment contained a threeseated democrat wagon was engaged to carry the party to the wegg farm at millville and a rickety lumber wagon would take the baggage the liveryman recognized his customer as soon as the wegg farm was mentioned and determined to do the city guy up brown  roads bad an up hill an my times vallyble he said in a surly voice ill hev to charge ye three dollars  for what asked uncle john quietly  fer the two teams to millville  get them harnessed right away load up the baggage and have the democrat at the hotel in twenty minutes heres five dollars and if youll look pleasant you may keep the change  blame my thick skull muttered the liveryman as he watched the little man depart what a cussed fool i were not to say four dollars instead o three  but he called to his boy to hurry up and in the stipulated time the teams were ready  uncle john and his nieces were just finishing their eggs which were fresh and delicious the milk was also a revelation through the windows of the hotel several frowsy looking women and an open mouthed boy were staring hard at the unconscious city folk  even louise was in a mood for laughter as they mounted to the high seats of the democrat the glorious air the clear sunshine and a satisfactory if simple breakfast had put them all in a good humor with the world  they stopped at the station for their hand baggage and saw that the trunks were properly loaded on the lumber wagon then slowly they started to mount the long hill that began its incline just across the tracks  sure this is the way inquired uncle john perched beside the driver  i were horned here answered the man conclusively  that seems to settle it pretty big hill that one ahead of us  its the little bill when we cross it were at millville  seven miles of desolate country could not dampen the spirits of the girls secretly each one was confident that uncle johns unknown farm would prove to be impossible and that in a day or so at the latest they would retrace their steps but in the meantime the adventure was novel and interesting and they were prepared to accept the inevitable with all graciousness  when after the long climb up the hill they saw the quaint mill and the town lying just across rushing little bill creek when from their elevation they beheld the placid lake half hidden by its stately pines and gazed up the rugged and picturesque foothills to the great mountains beyond then indeed they drew in deep breaths and began as patsy exclaimed to be glad they came  that millville asked uncle john eagerly  yes sir  and which of those houses belongs to the wegg farm  ye cant see the wegg house from here the pines hide it said the man urging his horses into a trot as they approached the bridge  pretty good farm inquired uncle john hopefully  worst in the county was the disconcerting reply half rocks an half trees ol capn wegg wasnt no farmer he were a seacapn so its no wonder he got took in when he bought the place  uncle john sighed  ive just bought it myself he observed  theres a ol addige said the man grinning bout a fool an his money the house is a hunker but wats the use of a house without a farm  what is a hunker please inquired louise curiously  the liveryman ventured no reply perhaps because he was guiding his horses over the rickety bridge  want to stop at the village he asked  no drive on to the farm  the scene was so rude and at the same time so picturesque that it impressed them all very agreeably perhaps they were the more delighted because they had expected nothing admirable in this all but forsaken spot they did not notice the people who stared after them as they rattled through the village or they would have seen uncle johns agent in front of his office his round eyes fairly bulging from his head  it had never occurred to mcnutt to be at the junction to welcome his patron he had followed his instructions and set mr merricks house in order and there he considered that his duty ended he would of course call on the nabob presently and render an account of the money he had received  sam cotting the storekeeper gazed after the livery team with a sour countenance he resented the fact that five bigboxes of groceries had been forwarded from the city to the wegg farm whatn thunders the use havin city folks here ef they dont buy nothin he asked the boys and they agreed it was no use at all  proceeding at a smart trot the horses came to the pearson farm where they turned into the jane at the left and straightway subsided to a slow walk the wheels bumping and jolting over the stony way  whats this exclaimed uncle john who had narrowly escaped biting his tongue through and through why did you turn down here  its the road returned the driver with a chuckle its the cobblestone lane to yer farm an the farms bout the same sort o land as the lane  for a few moments the passengers maintained a dismal silence  the countrys lovely said patsy glancing at the panorama as they mounted a slight elevation  are you sure uncle that there is a house or any place of refuge on your farm asked louise in a mischievous tone  why theres a rumor of a house and the rumor says its a hunker replied mr merrick in a voice that betrayed a slight uneasiness  doubtless the house matches the farm said beth calmly i imagine it has two rooms and a leaky roof but never mind girls this has been a pleasant trip and we can seek shelter elsewhere if the worst comes to the worst  i guess the worst has come aready observed the driver for the house is by odds the best part o the wegg farm its big enough fer a hotel an cost a lot o money in its day seems like the lunatics all crowd to thet placefust ol capn wegg wasted of his substance on it an now  he paused perhaps fearing he might become personal in his remarks and uncle john coughed while the girls shrieked with laughter  expecting nothing they were amazed when they passed the orchard and the group of pines that had concealed the house and suddenly drew up beside the oldfashioned stile built into the rail fence every eye was instantly upon the quaint roomy mansion the grassy sward extending between it and the road and the cosy and homelike setting of the outbuildings  heres weggs said the liveryman  oh uncle cried beth how lovely  louises pretty face was wreathed with smiles patsy drew in a long breath and scrambled out of the high seat  on the corner of the front porch stood nora arrayed in her neat gray gown and a cap her face was composed but she felt herself trembling a little  old hucks came slowly down the steps to greet the company never in his memory had his dress been so immaculate the queer old fellow seemed to appreciate this as he raised his smiling face from the stooped shoulders and poised it on one side like a sparrow  welcome home sir he said to uncle john im hucks sir thomas hucks and without more words he proceeded to remove the satchels from the wagon  ah yes returned mr merrick cheered by the welcome and the smile of the old man id forgotten about you but im glad youre here  and that is my wife nora on the porch shes the housekeeper sir and then lowering his voice so that only the girls and uncle john could hear he added simply shes blind  patsy walked straight up to the eager pathetic figure of the woman and took her hand in a warm clasp  im patricia nora she said and im sure we shall be friends  beth followed her cousins lead  and i am beth nora will you remember me  surely miss by your voice returned the old woman beaming delightedly at these evidences of kindliness  here is another nora said their cousin in gentle tones i am louise  three young and pretty girls nora and as good as they are pretty announced uncle john proudly will you show us in thomas or will your wife  nora will take the young ladies to their rooms sir  not now uncle they all protested in nearly identical words and louise added let us drink in the delights of this pretty picture before we shut ourselves up in the stuffy rooms i hope theyve been aired  patsy ran to a chickencoop on the side lawn where a fussy hen was calling to her children that strangers had arrived beth exclaimed at the honeysuckle vines and louise sank into a rustic chair with a sigh of content  im so glad you brought us here uncle she said what a surprise it is to find the place so pretty  they could hear the rush of the little bill in the wood behind them and a soft breeze stirred the pines and wafted their fragrance to the nostrils of the new arrivals uncle john squatted on the shady steps and fairly beamed upon the rustic scene spread out before him patsy had now thrown aside her hat and jacket and lay outstretched upon the cool grass while the chickens eyed her with evident suspicion beth was picking a bouquet of honeysuckles just because they were so sweet and homely  im almost sure i sent some hammocks and a croquet set remarked uncle john  theyre here sir said old hucks who had watched each one with his persistent smile and now stood awaiting his new masters commands but we didnt know jest where ye wanted em put  mary came out she had taken off her things and donned her white apron  the house is quite wonderful mr merrick she said there is everything we can possibly need and all as neat as wax  the report stirred the girls to explore they all trooped into the big living room and were at once captivated by its charm nora led them upstairs to their chambers finding the way as unerringly as if she possessed perfect vision and here a new chorus of delight was evoked  the blue room is mine cried louise  mine is the pink room said beth  and i choose the white room declared patsy the majors is just next and it will please him because it is all green and gold but where will uncle john room  the master will use the right wing said old nora who had listened with real pleasure to the exclamations of delight it were capn weggs room ye know an weve fitted it all new  indeed uncle john was at that moment inspecting his apartment and he sighed contentedly as he congratulated himself upon his foresight in sending down the furnishings on the chance of their being needed they had effected a complete transformation of the old house  but who had arranged everything surely the perfect taste and dainty touch evidenced everywhere was not to be attributed to blind nora the little man was thoughtful as he turned to old hucks  who did it thomas he asked  miss ethel sir the schoolmaam  oh a city girl  no sir crazy will thompsons granddaughter she lives bout nine mile away  is she here now  went home this mornin sir it were a great pleasure to her she said an she hoped as how youd like everything an be happy here  undo john nodded  we must call on that girl he remarked we owe her a good deal i imagine and shes entitled to our grateful thanks    chapter vi  peggy presents his bill  millville waited in agonized suspense for three days for tangible evidence that the nabob was in their midst as nib corkins poetically expressed it but the city folks seemed glued to the farm and no one of them had yet appeared in the village as a matter of fact patsy and uncle john were enthusiastically fishing in the little bill far up in the pine woods and having the time of their lives in spite of their scant success in capturing trout old hucks could go out before breakfast and bring in an ample supply of speckled beauties for mary to fry but uncle johns splendid outfit seemed scorned by the finny folk and after getting her dress torn in sundry places and a hook in the fleshy part of her arm patsy learned to seek shelter behind a tree whenever her uncle cast his fly but they reveled in the woods and would lie on the bank for hours listening to the murmur of the brook and the songs of the birds  the temper of the other two girls was different beth de graf had brought along an archery outfit and she set up her target on the ample green the day following her arrival here she practiced persistently shooting at sixty yards with much skill but occasionally when louise tired of her novel and her cushions in the hammock the two girls would play tennis or croquet togetherbeth invariably winning  such delightful laziness could brook no interference for the first days of their arrival and it was not until peggy mcnutt ventured over on monday morning for a settlement with mr merrick that any from the little world around them dared intrude upon the dwellers at the wegg farm  although the agent had been late in starting from millville and nick thornes sorrel mare had walked every step of the way peggy was obliged to wait in the yard a good half hour for the nabob to finish his breakfast during that time he tried to decide which of the two statements of accounts that he had prepared he was most justified in presenting he had learned from the liveryman at the junction that mr merrick had paid five dollars for a trip that was usually made for two and also that the extravagant man had paid seventyfive cents more to lucky todd the hotel keeper than his bill came to the knowledge of such reckless expenditures had fortified little mcnutt in marking up the account of the money he had received and instead of charging two dollars a day for his own services as he had at first intended he put them down at three dollars a dayand made the days stretch as much as possible also he charged a round commission on the wages of lon taft and ned long and doubled the liverymans bill for hauling the goods over from the junction ethel thompson had refused to accept any payment for what she had done but peggy bravely charged it up at good round figures when the bill was made out and figured up it left him a magnificent surplus for his private account but at the last his heart failed him and he made out another bill more modest in its extortions he had brought them both along though one in each pocket vacillating between them as he thought first of the merrick millions and then of the righteous anger he might incur by the time uncle john came out to him smiling and cordial he had not thoroughly made up his mind which account to present  i must thank you for carrying out my orders so intelligently began the millionaire without your assistance i might have found things in bad shape i fear  mcnutt was reassured the nabob would stand for bill no 1 without a doubt  i tried fer to do my best sir he said  and you did very well was the reply i hope you kept your expenditures well within bounds  the agents heart sank at the question and the shrewd alert look that accompanied it even millionaires do not allow themselves to be swindled if they can help it bill no 2 would be stiff enough he might even have to knock a few dollars off from that  most things is high in millville he faltered an wages has gone up jest terrble the boys dont seem to wanter do nuthin without big pay  that is the case everywhere responded mr merrick thoughtfully and between us mcnutt im glad wages are better in these prosperous times the man who works by the day should be well paid for he has to pay well for his living adequately paid labor is the foundation of all prosperity  peggy smiled cheerfully he was glad he had had the forethought to bring bill no 1 along with him  hosses is high too he remarked complacently an lumber an nails is up as fer the livestock i bought fer ye i found i had to pay like sixty for it  i suppose they overcharged you because a city man wanted the animals but of course you would not allow me to be robbed  oh course not mr merrick  and that nag in the stable is a sorry old beast  peggy was in despair why in the world hadnt he charged for the beast as it was now too late to add it to the bill he replied grudgingly  the hoss you mention belongs to the place sir it went with the farm long o old hucks an nora  im glad you reminded me of those people said uncle john seriously tell me their history  louise sauntered from the house at this juncture and sank gracefully upon the grass at her uncles feet she carried a book but did not open it  aint much to tell sir bout them folks replied the agent capn wegg brung the huckses with him when he settled here wegg were a seacapn ye see an when he retired he wanted to git as far from the seas he could  that was strange a sailor usually loves to be near salt water all his days observed uncle john  wall wegg he were diffrent he come here when i were a boy bringin a sadfaced young woman an ol hucks an nora i spose hucks were a sailor too though he never says nuthin bout that the capn bought this nocount farm an had this house built on ita proceedin that ef i do say it struck evrybody as curous  it was curious agreed mr merrick  but the curousest thing was thet he didnt make no tempt at farmin folks said he had money to burn fer he loaded it into this fool house an then sot down an smoked all day an looked glum ol hucks planted the berry patch an looked arter the orchard an the stock but capn wegg ony smoked an sulked people at millville was glad to leave him alone an the ony friend he ever had were crazy will thompson  crazy  as a loon the agent hitched uneasily on the lawn bench where he was seated and then continued hastily but thet aint neither here ner there a baby was born arter a time an while he was young the sadfaced mother sickened an died capn wegg give her a decent funral an went right on smokin his pipe an sulkin same as ever then hehedied rather lamely an joethets the boybein then about sixteen dug out n run away we haint seen him sense  nice boy asked uncle john  joe were pretty well liked here though he had a bit o his dads sulkiness he n ethel thompsoncrazy wills grandaughterseemed like to make up together but even she dont know what drav him offnless it were the capns suddint deathner where he went to  uncle john seemed thoughtful but asked no more questions and mcnutt appeared to be relieved that he refrained but the bill ought to be forthcoming now and the agent gave a guilty start as his patron remarked  i want to settle with you for what you have done im willing to pay a liberal price you understand but i wont submit to being robbed outrageously by you or any of your millville people  this was said so sternly that it sent mcnutt into an ague of terror he fumbled for the smallest bill tremblingly placed it in mr merricks hand and then with a thrill of despair realized he had presented the dreadful no 1  itsitsacount of what i spent out he stammered  uncle john ran his eye over the bill  what are plymouth rocks he demanded  hehens sir  hens at a dollar apiece  thoroughbreds sir extry fine stock i raised em myself  hm youve charged them twice  eh  heres an item twelve plymouth rocks twelve dollars and farther down twelve plymouth rocks eighteen dollars  oh yes o course ye see i sold you a dozen first of the dollar kind then i thought as how bein fine young birds youd be tempted fer to eat em an a dozen dont go fur on the table so i up an sold ye another dozen extry ol stock an remarkable highbred fer a dollaranahalf each which is dirt cheap because theys too old to eat an jest right fer layers  are they here  every one of em  very good im glad to have them the cow seems reasonably priced for a jersey  it is jest extrornary exclaimed peggy reassured  and your people have all done work of an unusual character in a painstaking manner i am very much pleased there seems to be a hundred and forty dollars my due remaining from the five hundred i sent you  here it is sir responded mcnutt taking the money from his pocketbook in another place he had more money which he had intended to pay if the smaller bill had been presented  uncle john took the money  you are an honest fellow mcnutt said he i hadnt expected a dollar back for folks usually take advantage of a stranger if he gives them half a chance so i thank you for your honesty as well as for your services good morning  the agent was thoroughly ashamed of himself to be sech a duffer as to return that money when by means of a little strategy he might have kept it made him feel both humiliated and indignant a hundred and forty dollars when would he have a chance to get such a windfall again pah he was a foolto copy his identical thoughts a gol dum blithering idjit  all the way home he reflected dismally upon his lack of business foresight and strove to plan ways to get money outn thet easy mark  didnt the man rob you uncle asked louise when the agent had disappeared  yes dear but i wouldnt give him the satisfaction of knowing i realized it  that was what i thought by the way that wegg history seems both romantic and unusual she said musingly dont you scent some mystery in what the man said of it  mystery cried uncle john lordy no louise youve been readin too many novels romances dont grow in parts like these  but i think this is where they are most likely to grow uncle persisted the girl just consider a retired sea captain hides inland with no companions but a grinning sailor and his blind housekeeper except his pale wife of course and she is described as sad and unhappy who was she do you think  i dont think said uncle john smiling and patting the fair check of his niece and it dont matter who she was  im sure it does it is the key to the whole mystery even her baby could not cheer the poor things broken heart even the fine house the captain built failed to interest her she pined away and died and  and that finished the romance louise  oh no that added to its interest the boy grew up in this dismal place and brooded on his mothers wrongs his stern sulky old father died suddenly was he murdered in a low voice did the son revenge his mothers wrongs  figglepiff louise youre getting theatricand so early in the morning too want to saddle my new farm with a murder do you well its rubbish joe wegg ran away from here to get busy in the world major doyle helped him with my money in exchange for this farm which the boy was sensible to get rid ofalthough im glad its now mine the major liked joe wegg and says hes a cleancut fine young feller hes an inventor too even if an unlucky one and ive no doubt hell make his way in the world and become a good citizen  with these words uncle john arose and sauntered around to the barn to look at the litter of new pigs that just then served to interest and amuse him the girl remained seated upon the grass her hands clasped over her knee and a look of deep retrospection upon her face    chapter vii  louise scents a mystery  louise merrick was the eldest of uncle johns nieces having just passed her eighteenth birthday in the city she was devoted to the requirements of fashionable society andurged thereto by her worldlyminded motherled a mere butterfly existence her two cousins frankly agreed that louise was shallow insincere and inclined to be affected but of the three girls she displayed the most equable and pleasant disposition and under the most trying circumstances was composed and charming in manner for this reason she was an agreeable companion and men usually admired her graceful figure and her piquant pretty face with its crown of fluffy blonde hair and winning expression there was a rumor that she was engaged to be married to arthur weldon a young man of position in the city but uncle john ignored the possibility of losing one of his cherished nieces and declared that louise was still too young to think of marriage  when away from her frivolous mother and the inconsequent home environments the girl was more unaffected and natural in her ways and her faults were doubtless more the result of education than of natural tendency  one thing was indisputable however louise merrick was a clever girl possessing a quick intellect and a keen insight into the character of others her apparent shallowness was a blind of the same character as her assumed graciousness and while she would have been more lovable without any pretence or sham she could not have been louise merrick and allow others to read her as she actually was patsy and beth thought they knew her and admired or liked rather than loved their cousin uncle john thought he knew her too and was very proud of his eldest niece in spite of some discovered qualities that were not wholly admirable  an extensive course of light literature not void of detective stories had at this moment primed louise with its influence to the extent of inducing her to scent a mystery in the history of captain wegg the plain folks around millville might speculate listlessly upon the queer doins at the farm and never get anywhere near the truth indeed the strange occurrences she had just heard were nearly forgotten in the community and soon would be forgotten altogetherunless the quick ear of a young girl had caught the clue so long ignored  at first she scarcely appreciated the importance of the undertaking it occurred to her that an effort to read to the bottom of the sea captains romance would be a charming diversion while she resided at millville and in undertaking the task she laughingly accused herself of becoming an amateur detectivean occupation that promised to be thrilling and delightful  warned however by the rebuff she had met with from uncle john the girl decided not to confide either her suspicions or her proposed investigation to anyone for the present but to keep her own counsel until she could surprise them all with the denouement or required assistance to complete her work  inspired by the cleverness and fascination of this idea louise set to work to tabulate the information she had received thus far noting the element of mystery each fact evolved first captain wegg must have been a rich man in order to build this house maintain two servants and live for years in comfort without any income from his barren farm lands what became of his money after his death why was his only son obliged to fly to the cities in order to obtain a livelihood secondly the captain a surly and silent man had brought hitherperhaps by forcea young woman as his wife who was so unhappy that she pined away and died who was this woman what had rendered her so unhappy and despairing  thirdly the captains only friend had been a crazy man named will thompson was he crazy before the captains death or had he become crazed at that time some terrible tragedy unhinging his mind  fourthly the granddaughter of thompson ethel and the son of captain wegg had been in love with each other and people expected they would marry in time but at his fathers sudden death the boy fled and left his sweetheart without a word whyunless something had occurred that rendered their marriage impossible  in the fifth place there was old hucks and his blind wife to be considered what did they know about their old masters secret history what tragic memories lurked beneath the mans perpetual smile and the womans composed and sightless face  surely there was enough here to excite the curiosity and warrant an effort to untangle the mystery and as instruments to the end there were several people available who could be of use to her mcnutt the agent who evidently knew more than he had cared to tell old hucks and his wife and ethel thompson the schoolteacher there might be others but one or another of these four must know the truth and it would be her pleasant duty to obtain a full disclosure so she was anxious to begin her investigations at once  when her uncle returned from his visit to the pigs louise said to him  ive been thinking dear that we ought to call upon that young lady who arranged our rooms and thank her for her kindness  thats true he replied  cant we drive over to thompsons this morning uncle  beth and patsy have planned a tramp to the lake and a row after waterlilies  then let us make our call together we can invite the girl to come here and spend a day with us when patsy and beth will be able to meet her  thats a good idea louise i was wondering what id do this morning tell old hucks to get the nag harnessed  the girl ran eagerly upon her errand old hucks seemed surprised and a curious expression showed for an instant through his smile but he turned without a word to harness the horse  louise stood watching him  your fingers are quite nimble thomas considering the fact that you were once a sailor she said  but sailors have to be nimble miss he returned buckling a strap unmoved who tol ye i were once a seafarin man  i guessed it  as he appeared indisposed to say more on the subject she asked did you sail with captain wegg  partly miss dans already now dont jerk the bit fer his mouths tender an it makes him balky ef he balks jest let him rest a time an then speak to him dan aint vicious hes jest ornery  she climbed into the dilapidated old buggy and took the reins dan groaned and ambled slowly around to where uncle john stood awaiting his niece  let me drive uncle she said i understand dan  well i dont returned uncle john in his whimsical way as he mounted to the seat beside her i dont understand how hes happened to live since the landing of columbus or what hes good for or why someone dont knock him on the head  dan turned his long lean face as if to give the speaker a reproachful look then he groaned again leaned forward and drew the buggy slowly into the stony lane  do you know where the thompsons live inquired uncle john  no whoa dan  that was the best thing the nag did he knew how to whoa  thomas called uncle john turning in his seat and at the summons old hucks came from the barn and approached them how do you get to miss thompsons place  miss ethels another fleeting expression of surprise  yes were going over to thank her for her kindness to us  iim most sure as shell be here soon to call sir andperhaps you oughtnt toto go tothompsons stammered hucks glancing up at them with his bright elusive smile  well were going anyhow growled mr merrick  then turn left at the main road an keep straight ahead to thompsons ye cant miss it sir brick schoolhouse on the other corner  thank you thomas drive on louise    chapter viii  the little schoolmaam  dan balked only twice on the journey but even this moderate rebellion so annoyed uncle john that he declared he would walk back rather than ride behind this mulish antiquity again  when they came to the thompson dwelling it at first sight seemed deserted a knock on the front door failed to produce any response  perhaps theyre away from home suggested louise  theres a path around to the back said uncle john lets explore in that direction  they made their way leisurely toward the rear and had almost passed the house when a deep roar broke the stillness it was succeeded by another and another like the bellowing of a mad bull and the intruders stopped short and louise clung to her uncle in sudden panic  be still will stop i saystop  a sharp crack as of a lash accompanied the words and a moan or two was followed by absolute silence  uncle john and louise looked at one another with startled eyes  he must be worse said the old gentleman mopping his forehead with a handkerchief  with one accord they started softly to retrace their steps when a new sound halted them again it was a clear fresh young voice singing a plaintive ditty in a nonchalant careless tone  thats ethel im sure exclaimed louise grasping her uncles arm  well what shall we do he demanded  mrthe crazy man seems quiet now she whispered let us find the girl if we can  so again they traversed the path and this time came to the pretty garden behind the house ethel was tending a flower bed she wore her gingham dress and a sunbonnet and kneeling in the path stretched out her slim brown arm to uproot the weeds but the crunching of the gravel aroused her attention and observing her visitors she sprang up and hastened toward them  louise introduced her uncle and herself in her most pleasant and gracious way and the school teacher led them to a garden bench and begged them to be seated  the day is lovely she said and i always find my garden more cheerful than the house grandfathers illness makes the house unpleasant for strangers too  louise was surprised at this frank reference and uncle john coughed to hide his embarrassment  ii hope the invalid isis improving he said doubtful whether he should say anything on the delicate subject or not  he is always the same sir was the quiet response i suppose they have told you that grandfather is a madman our great trouble is well known in this neighborhood  he is not dangerous i suppose hazarded uncle john remembering the brutal bellowing  oh not at all he is fully paralyzed from his waist down poor grandfather and can do no harm to anyone but often his outbreaks are unpleasant to listen to continued the girl deprecatingly as if suddenly conscious that they had overheard the recent uproar  has he beenthis wayfor long inquired louise  his mind has been erratic and unbalanced since i can remember answered ethel calmly but he first became violent at the time captain wegg died some three years ago grandfather was very fond of the captain and happened to be with him at the time of his sudden death the shock drove him mad  was he paralyzed before that time asked louise earnestly  no but the paralysis followed almost immediately the doctor says that a blood vessel which burst in the brain is responsible for both afflictions  the pause that followed was growing awkward when uncle john said with an evident effort to change the subject  this is a fine old homestead  it is indeed responded ethel brightly and it enjoys the distinction of being one of the first houses built in the foothills my greatgrandfather was really the first settler in these parts and originally located his cabin where the mill now stands little bill thompson he was called for he was a small wiry manvery different from grandfather who in his prime was a powerful man of over six feet little bill hill and little bill creek were named after this pioneer greatgrandsire who was quite successful raising flocks of sheep on the plateau before he died he built this house preferring the location to his first one  the garden is beautiful said louise enthusiastically and do you teach in the little brick schoolhouse across the way  yes grandfather built it years ago without dreaming i would ever teach there now the county supports the school and pays me my salary  how long have you taught  for two years it is necessary now that grandfather is disabled he has a small income remaining however and with what i earn we get along very nicely  it was very good of you to assist in getting our house ready for us said louise we might have found things in sorry condition but for your kindness  oh i enjoyed the work i assure you replied ethel as it is my vacation it was a real pleasure to me to have something to do but i fear my arrangement of your pretty furniture was very ungraceful  we havent altered a single thing declared louise you must have found it a tedious task unpacking and getting everything in shape  tom and nora were good help because they are fond of me and seem to understand my wishes and peggy mcnutt brought me some men to do the lifting and rough work explained ethel  have you known hucks and his wife long asked uncle john  since i can remember sir they came here many years ago with captain wegg  and has thomas always smiled louise inquired  always was the laughing reply its an odd expressionisnt itto dwell forever on a mans face but tom is never angry or hurt or excited by anything so there is no reason he should not smile at the time of captain weggs death and poor grandfathers terrible affliction old hucks kept right on smiling the same as ever and perhaps his pleasant face helped to cheer us all  louise drew a long breath  then the smile is a mask she said and is assumed to conceal the mans real feelings  i do not think so ethel answered thoughtfully the smile is habitual and dominates any other expression his features might be capable of but that it is assumed i do not believe thomas is a simpleminded honesthearted old fellow and to face the world smilingly is a part of his religion i am sure he has nothing to conceal and his devotion to his blind wife is very beautiful  but norahow long has she been blind  perhaps all her life i cannot tell how long yet it is wonderful how perfectly she finds her way without the aid of sight captain wegg used to say she was the best housekeeper he ever knew  did not his wife keep house for him when she was alive  i do not remember her  they say she was most unhappy  ethel dropped her eyes and did not reply  how about capn wegg asked uncle john did you like him you see were mighty curious about the family because weve acquired their old home and are bound to be interested in the people that used to live there  that is natural remarked the little school teacher with a sigh captain wegg was always kind to me but the neighbors as a rule thought him moody and badtempered after a pause she added he was not as kind to his son as to me but i think his life was an unhappy one and we have no right to reprove his memory too severely for his faults  what made him unhappy asked louise quickly  ethel smiled into her eager face  no one has solved that problem they say the captain was as silent as he was morose  the detective instinct was alive in louise she hazarded a startling query  who killed captain wegg she demanded suddenly  another smile preceded the reply  a dreadful foe called heart disease but come let me show you my garden there are no such roses as these for miles around  louise was confident she had made progress ethel had admitted several things that lent countenance to the suspicions already aroused but perhaps this simple country girl had never imagined the tragedy that had been enacted at her very door  she cordially urged ethel thompson to spend a day with them at the farm and uncle john who was pleased with the modesty and frankness of the fairhaired little school teacher earnestly seconded the invitation  then he thought of going home and the thought reminded him of dan  do you know he inquired where i could buy a decent horse  the girl looked thoughtful a moment then glanced up with a bright smile  will you buy one off me she asked  willingly my dear if youve an animal to sell  itsits our joe he was grandfathers favorite colt when his trouble came upon him we have no use for him now for i always ride or drive my pony and grandmother says hes eating his head off to no purpose so wed like to sell him if you will come to the barn ill introduce you to him  joe proved on inspection to be an excellent horse if appearances were to be trusted and ethel assured mr merrick that the steed was both gentle and intelligent  do you use that surrey inquired uncle john pointing to a neat vehicle that seemed to be nearly new  very seldom sir grandmother would like to sell it with the horse  its exactly what i need declared mr merrick how much for joe and his harness and the surrey  ill go and ask what grandmother wants  she returned after a few minutes stating a figure that made uncle john lift his brows with a comical expression  a hundred dollars do you take me for a brigand little girl i know what horses are worth for ive bought plenty of em your joe seems sound as a dollar and hes just in his prime a hundred and fifty is dirt cheap for him and the surrey will be worth at least seventyfive put in the harness at twentyfive and ill give you twofifty for the outfit and not a cent more or less eh  no indeed said ethel we could not get more than a hundred dollars from anyone else around here  because your neighbors are countrymen and cant afford a proper investment so when they buy at all they only give about half what a thing is actually worth but ill be honest with you the price i offer is a good deal less than id have to pay in the cityhutchinson would charge me five hundred at leastand i need just what youve got to sell what do you say miss ethel  the price is one hundred dollars mr merrick  i wont pay it let me talk with your grandmother  she does not see anyone sir  louise looked up sharply scenting another clue  isnt she well dear she asked in smooth tones  she looks after grandfather and helps aunt lucy with the housework  well come louise well go home said uncle john sadly id hoped to be able to drive this fine fellow back but danll have to groan an balk all the way to the farm  ethel smiled  better buy at my price mr merrick she suggested  tell you what ill do he said pausing ill split the difference take two hundred and well call it a bargain  but i cannot do that sir  it will help pay you for the hard work of fixing up the house he rejoined pleadingly your bill wasnt half enough  my bill wonderingly  the one i paid mcnutt for your services  i made no charge sir i could not accept anything for a bit of assistance to a neighbor  oh then mcnutt got it did he  im awfully sorry mr merrick i told peggy i would not accept payment  hm never mind were not going to quarrel little neighbor may i hitch joe to the surrey  if you like ill help you  uncle john led joe from his stall and together they harnessed the horse to the surrey the girl knew better than the man how to buckle the straps properly while louise stood by helplessly and watched the performance  then uncle john went for old dan whom he led rickety buggy and all into the thompson stable  ill send hucks over to get him although we might as well knock him in the head he said as he unharnessed the ancient steed now then louise hop in  youll be sure to come over thursday for the day miss thompson asked louise taking joes reins from her uncles hands  ill not forget such a delightful engagement be sure  uncle john had his pocketbook out and now he wadded up some bills and thrust them into the little school teachers hand  drive ahead louise he called good morning my dear see you on thursday  as the vehicle rolled out of the yard and turned into the highway ethel unrolled the bills with trembling fingers  if he has dared she began but paused abruptly with a smile of content  the rich man had given her exactly one hundred dollars    chapter ix  the lives of the saints  on wednesday afternoon mcnutt drove the sadeyed sorrel mare over to the wegg farm again he had been racking his brain for a way to get more money out of the nabob for the idea had become a veritable passion with him and now occupied all his thoughts  that very morning an inspiration had come to him among other occupations he had at one time adopted that of a bookagent and by dint of persistent energy had sold numerous copies of radfords lives of the saints to the surrounding farmers they had cost him ninety cents a copy and he had sold them at three dollars each netting a fine profit in return for his labor the books were printed upon cheap paper fearfully illustrated with blurred cuts but the covers were bound in bright red with gold lettering through misunderstandings three of these copies had come back to him the subscribers refusing to accept them and so thorough had been his canvassing that there remained no other available customers for the saintly works so peggy had kept them on a shelf in his office for several years and now when his eye chanced to light upon them he gave a snort of triumph and pounced upon them eagerly mr merrick was a newcomer without doubt he could be induced to buy a copy of radfords lives  an hour later mcnutt was on his mission the three copies which had been carefully dusted reclining on the buggy seat beside him arrived at the wegg farm he drove up to the stile and alighted  louise was reading in the hammock and merely glanced at the little man who solemnly stumped around to the back door with the three red volumes tucked underneath his arm he had brought them all along to make his errand look like business  wheres the nabob he asked blind nora  whats that mr mcnutt she inquired as if puzzled she knew his voice as she did that of nearly everyone with whom she had ever been brought in contact  why the nabob the boss mr merrick  oh hes in the barn with tom i guess  mcnutt entered the barn uncle john was seated upon an overturned pail watching old hucks oil joes harness the agent approached him with a deferential bow  sir said he youll scuse my comin agin so soon to be abotherin but i hev here three copies of radfords famis wucks on the lives o the saints in a edishun dee looks  a what  a edishun dee looks which means extry fine its a great book an theys all outn print cept these three which i haint no doubt many folks would be glad to give their weight in gold fer an some over  stand out of the light mcnutt  the agent shifted his position  them books sir  oh take em away  what  i dont read novels  mcnutt scratched his head perplexed at the rebuff his dee looks speech had usually resulted in a sale an idea flashed across his brainperhaps evolved by the scratching  the young lady sir  oh the girls are loaded with books growled the nabob  the agent became desperate  but the young lady in the hammick sir as i jest now left says to tell ye she wants one o these books mighty bad an hopes youll buy it for her eddificationing  oh she does eh  mighty bad sir  uncle john watched thomas polish a buckle  is it a moral work he asked  nuthin could be moraler sir all bout the lives o  how much is it  comes pretty high sir three dollars but its  here take your money and get out youre interrupting me  very sorry sir much obleeged sir wherell i leave the book  throw it in the manger  mcnutt selected a volume that had a broken corner and laid it carefully on the edge of the oatbin then he put his money in his pocket and turned away  mornn to ye mr merrick  stop a bit said uncle john suddenly  the agent stopped  i believe i paid you ten dollars for miss ethel thompsons services is that correct  yeyes mr merrick  mcnutts heart was in his shoes and he looked guiltily at his accuser the pale blue eyes bulging fearfully  very well see that she gets it  of course mr merrick  and at once you may go  mcnutt stumped from the barn he felt that a dreadful catastrophe had overtaken him scarcely could he restrain the impulse to sob aloud ten dollarsten dollars gone to the dogs as the result of his visit to the nabob that morning to lose ten dollars in order to gain three was very bad business policy mcnutt reflected bitterly that he would have been better off had he stayed at home he ought to have been contented with what he had already made and the severe manner the nabob had used in addressing him told the agent plainly that he need not expect further pickings from this source  in the midst of his despair the comforting thought that ethel would surely refuse the money came to sustain him so he recovered somewhat his former spirits as he turned the corner of the house he observed louise still reading in the hammock  in some ways mcnutt was a genius he did not neglect opportunities  heres my las chance at these idjits he muttered an ill learn thet nabob what it costs to make marsh mcnutt stand outn his light  then he hastened over to the hammock  scuse me miss said he in his most ingratiating voice is yer uncle round anywheres  isnt he in the barn asked the girl looking up  cant find him high ner low but he ordered a book of me tother dayradfords lives o the saintsan perhaps youll take it an pay me the money sos i kin go home  louise gazed at the man musingly he was one of the people she intended to pump for information concerning the mystery of captain wegg and she must be gracious to him in order to win his goodwill and induce him to speak freely with this thought in mind she drew out her purse and asked  how much were you to be paid for the book  three dollars miss  here is the money then tell meyour name is mcnutt isnt ithow long have you lived in this place  all my life miss thank e miss good day to ye miss  he placed the book in the hammock beside her  dont go please said the girl id like you to tell me something about captain wegg and of his poor wife who died and  nuther time miss ill be glad to yell find me in my orfice any time jest now im in the dumdest hurry ye ever knew good day to ye miss he repeated and stumped quickly to the buggy awaiting him next moment he had seized the reins and was urging the sorrel mare along the stony lane at her best pace  louise was both astonished and disappointed but after a little thought she looked after the departing agent with a shrewd smile  hes afraid to talk she murmured and that only confirms my suspicions that he knows more than he cares to tell  meantime mcnutt was doing his best to get away from the premises before the discovery was made that he had sold two lives of the saints to one family that there might be future consequences to follow his deception never occurred to him only the immediate necessity for escape occupied his mind  nor were his fears altogether groundless turning his head from time to time for a glance behind he had seen mr merrick come from the barn with a red book in his hand and approach the hammock whereupon the young lady arose and exhibited a second book then they both dropped the books and ran into the lane and began shouting for him to stopthe mans voice sounding especially indignant and imperative  but mcnutt chose to be deaf he did not look around again and was congratulating himself that he would soon be out of earshot when a sudden apparition ahead caused the mare to halt abruptly it also caused the cold chills to run down the agents back beth and patsy had stepped into the lane from a field being on their way home from their daily walk  theyre calling to you sir said patsy to the agent didnt you hear them  iim a little deaf miss stammered mcnutt who recognized the young ladies as mr merricks nieces  i think they wish you to go back remarked beth thoughtfully watching the frantic waves of uncle johns chubby arms and louises energetic beckonings they were too far off to be heard plainly but their actions might surely be understood  mcnutt with reluctance looked over his shoulder and a second shudder went through him  i haint got time to go back he said as an inspiration came to him but i guess you kin do jest as well this book here picking up the last of the three from the seat i offered to sell yer uncle fer five dollars but he wanted it fer four i aint no haggler you understan so i jest driv away now mr merrick has changed his mind an is willin to give five fer it but there aint nuthin small about me ef you galsll jest give me the four dollars ye kin take the book to yer uncle with my compliments an i wont hev t go back im in a dreaful hurry  patsy laughed at the little mans excited manner  fortunately i have some money with me she said but you may as well take the five dollars for unless uncle had been willing to pay it he would not have called you back  i think so myself miss he rejoined taking the money and handing her the volume  uncle john and louise glaring at the distant group saw the third red book change hands and in answer to their renewed cries and gestures patsy waved the lives of the saints at them reassuringly and came on at a brisk walk followed by beth  mcnutt slapped the sorrel with the ends of the reins so energetically that the mare broke into a trot and before the girls had come within speaking distance of their uncle the agent was well out of sight and exulting in the possession of eleven dollars to pay for his mornings work even if ethel accepted that ten he reflected he would still be a dollar ahead but he was sure she would tell him to keep it and hed jest like to see thet air nabob git a penny back agin  meantime uncle johns wrath which was always an effervescent quality with the little gentleman had changed to wonder when he saw his nieces approaching with the third redandgold book louise was leaning against the rail fence and laughing hysterically and suddenly a merry smile appeared and spread over her uncles round face as he said  did you ever hear of such an audacious swindle in all your born days  what will you do uncle asked the girl wiping the tears of merriment from her eyes have the man arrested  of course not my dear its worth the money just to learn what talents the fellow possesses tell me patsy he continued as the other nieces joined them what did you pay for your book  five dollars uncle he said  never mind what he said my dear its all right i wanted it to add to my collection so far ive got three lives of the saintsand im thankful theyre not cats or thered be nine lives for me to accumulate    chapter x  the mystery deepens  ethel thompson came over the next day as she had promised and the sweetfaced gentle schoolmistress won the hearts of uncle johns three nieces without an effort she was the eldest of them all but her retired country life had kept her fresh and natural and ethel seemed no more mature than the younger girls except in a certain gravity that early responsibility had thrust upon her  together the four laughing lighthearted maids wandered through the pines where the little schoolmaam showed them many pretty nooks and mossy banks that the others had not yet discovered by following an unsuspected path they cut across the wooded hills to the waterfall where little bill creek made a plunge of twenty feet into a rocky basin below in spite of the bubbles the water here showed clear as crystal and the girls admiringly christened it the champagne cup they shed their shoes and stockings and waded in the pool enjoying the sport with shrieks of merry laughtermore because they were happy than that there was anything to laugh at  afterward they traced the stream down to a lovely glade a half mile above millville where ethel informed them the annual sundayschool picnic was always held and then trailed across the rocky plateau to the farm by the time they reached home their appetites were well sharpened for marys excellent luncheon and the afternoon was devoted to rest under the shady pines that grew beside the house  it was now when they felt thoroughly acquainted and at ease in one anothers society that the girls indulged in talks concerning events in their past and ethel was greatly interested in the nieces recital of their recent trip abroad with uncle john they also spoke frankly of their old life together at elmhurst where aunt jane who was uncle johns sister had congregated her three nieces for the purpose of choosing from among them one to inherit her vast estates it seemed no source of regret to any of them that a boy kenneth forbes had finally succeeded to aunt janes property and this may be explained by the fact that uncle john had at that interesting juncture appeared to take charge of the nieces it was quite evident that the eccentric but kindly old fellow had succeeded in making these three girls as happy as their dispositions would allow them to be  after the most interesting phases of their personal history had been discussed the nieces began perhaps unconsciously to draw from ethel her own story it was simple enough and derived its interest mainly from the fact that it concerned their new friend her parents had both passed away while she was young and ethel had always lived with her fathers father big will thompson a man reputed very welltodo for this section and an energetic farmer from his youth  old will had always been accused of being unsociable and considering himself above the neighboring farmers and it was true that bob west the implement dealer was his only associate before captain wegg arrived a casual acquaintance with the millville people might easily explain this  with the advent of the weggs however a strong friendship seemed to spring up between the retired sea captain and the bluff erratic old farmer which lasted until the fatal day when one died and the other became a paralytic and a maniac  we have always thought said ethel that the shock of the captains death unsettled my grandfathers mind they had been sitting quietly in captain weggs room one evening as they were accustomed to do when there was a sudden fall and a cry thomas ran in at once and found grandfather raving over the captains dead body the old seaman had heart disease it seems and had often declared he would die suddenly it was a great blow to us all but especially to joe  her voice softened at this last remark and patsy exclaimed impulsively  tell us about joe wegg did you like him  yes said ethel simply we were naturally thrown much together in our childhood and became staunch friends grandpa often took me with him on his visits to the weggs and sometimes but not often the captain would bring joe to see us he was a quiet thoughtful boy much like his mother i imagine but for some reason he had conceived an intense dislike for his father and an open hatred for this part of the country where he was born aside from these morbid notions joe was healthyminded and frank and genuine had he been educated in any other atmosphere than the gloomy one of the wegg household i am sure joes character would have been wholly admirable and i have never blamed the boy much for his peculiarities captain wegg would not permit him to go to school but himself attended to such instructions as joe could acquire at home and this was so meager and the boy so ambitious that i think it was one cause of his discontent i remember when i was sent to school at troy that joe sobbed for days because he could not have the same advantages he used to tell me wonderful stories of what he would accomplish if he could only get out into the world  when he implored his father to let him go away captain wegg used to assure joe that he would some day be rich and there was no need of his preparing himself for either a business or a profession but that did not satisfy joes ambition as you may imagine and when the end came scarcely a dollar of money could be found among the captains possessions and no other property than this farm so it is evident he deceived his son for some selfish purpose  joe was at last free and the only thing i reproach him for is going away without a word to me or any of his friends i heard indirectly of his working his way through a technical school for he was always crazy about mechanics and then he went to new york and i lost all further trace of him  what do you suppose became of captain weggs money asked louise  ive no idea it is a singular thing that most of my grandfathers savings disappeared at the same time on account of his mental condition he can never tell us what became of his little fortune but luckily the returns from the farm which we rent on shares and my own salary as teacher of the district school enable us to live quite comfortably although we must be economical  why its really a romance cried patsy who had listened eagerly  there are many romances in real life added beth in her undemonstrative way  louise said nothing but her heart was throbbing with excitement engendered by the tale which so strongly corroborated the suspicions she had begun to entertain when ethel had gone home louise still deliberated upon this fascinating mystery and her resolve grew to force some sort of an explanation from the smiling lips of old hucks for the sole available witness of that fatal nights tragedy when one strong man died and another was driven mad was thomas hucks the old servitor was also in a position to know much of the causes leading up to the catastrophe he having been the confidential retainer of captain wegg for many years hucks must speak but the girl was wise enough to realize that he would not do so unless urged by coaxing or forced by strategy there was doubtless good reason why the old man had remained silent for three years her plan was to win his confidence interest him in joes welfare and then the truth must come out  the frankly related story of ethel had supplied louise with the motive for the crime for that a crime had been committed she was now doubly sure captain wegg had money old will thompson had money both were welltodo men in a retired country district where there were no banks it was reasonable to suppose they kept large sums of money on hand and the knowledge of this fact had tempted some one to a dreadful deed captain wegg had been killed and old thompson perhaps injured by a blow upon the head from which he had never recovered any suspicion the fair young detective may have entertained that thompson himself had killed his friend was eradicated by the fact that he had been robbed at the same time  louise had originally undertaken her investigation through curiosity and a desire to amuse herself by unveiling the mystery now she began to reflect that she was an instrument of justice for a discovery of the truth might restore a fortune to poor joe wegg now struggling with the world and put sweet ethel thompson in a position where the necessity for her to teach school would be abolished this thought added a strong impulse to her determination to succeed  sunday afternoon the girl took blind nora for a long drive through the country taking pains to explain to her all the points of interest they came to and delighting the old woman with her bright chatter louise had been kind to nora from the beginning and her soft sympathetic voice had quite won the poor creatures heart  on the way home in the delightful summer twilight the girl dexterously led the conversation toward noras past history  was thomas a sailor when you married him she asked  yes miss he were bosn on capn weggs schooner the lively kate an i were livin with miss mary as come to be mrs wegg arterward  oh i see and were you blind then nora  no miss i went blind arter our great trouble come to us  trouble oh im so sorry dear what was it  the old woman was silent for a time then she said  id better not mention it i guess thomas likes to forgit an when i gets cryin an nervous he knows ive been thinkin bout the old trouble  louise was disappointed but changed the subject adroitly  and miss mary who was afterward mrs wegg did you love her nora  indeed i did child  what was she like  she were gentle an sweet an the mos beautiful creetur in allinin the place where we lived an her fambily was that proud an aristocratic thet no one could tech em with a tenfoot pole  i see did she love captain wegg  natrally sense she married of him an fit all her fambily to do it an the capn were thet proud o her thet he thought the world lay in her sweet eyes  oh i had an idea he didnt treat her well remarked the girl soberly  thats wrong declared nora promptly arter the trouble comefer it come to the weggs as well as to tom an methe capn sort o lost heart to see his mary cry day arter day an never be comforted he were hard hit himself ye see an that made it a gloomy house an no mistake  do you mean after you moved here to the farm  yes deary  i hear captain wegg was very fond of ethels grandfather continued louise trying to find an opening to penetrate old noras reserve  they was good friends always was the brief reply  did they ever quarrel nora  never that i knows of  and what do you suppose became of their money asked the girl  i dont know child air we gettin near home  we are quite near now i wish you would open your heart to me and tell me about that great trouble nora i might be able to comfort you in some way  the blind woman shook her head  theres no comfort but in forgettin she said an the way to forgit aint to talk about it  the unsatisfactory result of this conversation did not discourage louise although she was sorry to meet with no better success gradually she was learning the inside history of the weggs when she discovered what that great trouble had been she would secure an important clue in the mystery she was sure nora might some time be induced to speak more freely and it was possible she might get the desired information from old hucks she would try anyway  a dozen theories might be constructed to account for this great trouble the one that louise finally favored was that captain wegg had been guilty of some crime on the high seas in which his boatswain old hucks was likewise implicated they were obliged to abandon the sea and fly to some outoftheway corner inland where they could be safely hidden and their whereabouts never discovered it was the knowledge of this crime she conjectured that had ruined sweet mrs weggs life and made her weep day after day until her guilty husband became surly and silent and unsociable  louise now began to cultivate thomas but her progress was slow patsy seemed to be the old mans favorite and for some reason he became glum and uncommunicative whenever louise was around the girl suspected that nora had told her husband of the recent conversation in spite of her assertion that she wished to avoid all reference to their great trouble    chapter xi  three amateur detectives  puzzling her brain what to do next louise suddenly decided to confide her secret to her two cousins not that she considered them capable of a greater success than she could herself accomplish but they might prove valuable assistants in the capacity of lieutenants she had great respect for beths calm judgment and keen intuitions and patsy had a way of accomplishing difficult things with ease  the two girls listened to louise with expressions of mingled wonder and amusement while she confided to them her first suspicions that captain wegg had been murdered and then the bits of information she had gathered to strengthen the surmise and assure her she was justified in her efforts to untangle the web of mystery  you see my dears she explained impressively as the three lounged upon the grass in the shade of the right wing of the house there is a very interesting story about these people that ought to guide us directly to a solution of the puzzle a roving sea captain marries a girl of good family in spite of the opposition of her relatives his boatswain a confidential servant marries the girls maid the next thing we know is that a great trouble causes them to fleedoubtless some crime committed by the captain it may have been robbery or perhaps piracy on the high seas who knows anyhow he steals away to this forsaken spot far from the sea or the railroads and builds a fine house on a worthless farm showing that he has money but that retirement is his main object here the weggs make no friends but the wife cries her eyes out until she dies miserably leaving a son to the tender mercies of a wicked father so fearful is he of discovery that he will not allow the boy to go to school but tries to educate him himself  probably the captains real name was not wegg at all suggested patsy entering into the spirit of the relation  probably not dear he would assume some name of course so that it might be more difficult to trace him answered louise but nowmark me well girlsa nemesis was on the track of this wicked sinner after many years the man captain wegg had wronged or stolen from or something discovered his enemys hiding place he promptly killed the captain and probably recovered the money for its gone old thompson ethels grandfather happened to be present the murderer also took his money and  oh louise that isnt reasonable objected beth who had been following the story carefully  why not  because you are making the wronged party as wicked as the man who wronged him when the avenger found his enemy he might force him to give up his illgotten gains i agree with you there but he wouldnt be liable to rob old thompson im sure  beth is right said patsy stoutly  but old thompson lost his money at the same time you know at least his money could never be found afterward and im sure he was dealt some blow on the head that made him crazy answered louise positively  they thought that over  i believe i can explain it girls said beth presently the avenger found captain wegg all rightjust as louise has saidand when he found him he demanded a restitution of his money threatening to send the criminal to jail that would be very natural wouldnt it well captain wegg had spent a good deal of the money and couldnt pay it all back so ethels grandfather being his friend offered to makeup the balance himself rather than see his friend go to prison that accounts for the disappearance of all the money  if that is so observed patsy i dont see why the man having got his money back should murder one and knock the other on the head  it way a puzzle they all acknowledged and after discussing the matter from every conceivable standpoint they were no nearer an explanation thats the way with mysteries theyre often hard to understand  the only thing that occurs to me as being sensible said louise finally is that after the money was paid over they got into a quarrel then the avenger lost his temper and committed the murders  this talk about an avenger is all guess work asserted beth calmly i dont believe the facts point to an avenger at all  but the old crimethe great trouble  oh well allow all that returned beth and i dont say that an avenger wouldnt be the nicest person to exact retribution from the wicked captain but avengers dont always turn up in real life when they ought to girls so we mustnt be too sure that one turned up in this case  but now else can you account for the captains murder objected louise  well some one else might know he had money and that ethels grandfather had money too was the reply suppose the robbery and murder had nothing to do with the old crime at all but that the murderer knew this to be a deserted place where he could make a good haul without being discovered the two old men sat in the right wing quite unsuspicious when  when in walks mr murderer chokes the captain knocks his friend on the brainbox and makes off with the money continued patsy gleefully oh girls im sure weve got it right this time  louise reflected a moment  this country is almost a wilderness she mused aloud and few strangers ever come here besides a stranger would not know positively that these two men had money if we abandon the idea of an avenger and follow beths clue then the murderer is still right here in millville and unsuspected by any of his neighbors  oh louise with startled glances over their shoulders  let us be sensible reasoning girls not silly things trying to figure out possible romances continued louise with a pretty and impressive assumption of dignity do you know i feel that some angel of retribution has guided us to this lonely farmhouse and put the idea into my head to discover and expose a dreadful crime  succotash cried patsy irrelevantly youre romancing this minute louise the way you figure things out i wouldnt be surprised if you accused me or uncle john any time during the next half hour adopting your last supposition for the sake of argument im interested to know what inhabitant of sleepy old millville you suspect  dont get flighty patricia admonished beth this is a serious matter and louise is in earnest if were going to help her we mustnt talk rubbish now it isnt a bad suggestion that we ought to look nearer home for the key to this mystery theres old hucks  hucks  to be sure no one knew so well as he the money affairs of the two men who were robbed  im ashamed of you said patsy  and the mans smile is a mask exclaimed louise  oh no protested patsy  my dear no person who ever lived could smile every minute winter and summer rain or shine day and night and always have a reason for the smile  of course not agreed beth old hucks is a curious character i realized that when i had known him five minutes  but hes poor urged patsy in defense of the old man he hasnt a penny in the world and mcnutt told me if we turned thomas and nora away theyd have to go to the poorhouse  that is no argument at all said louise calmly if we consider the fact that old hucks may be a miser and have a craving for money without any desire to spend it then we are pretty close to a reason why he should bide his time and then murder his old master to obtain the riches he coveted mind you i dont say hucks is guilty but it is our duty to consider this phase of the question  and then added beth if hucks should prove to be a miser it is easy to guess he would hide his wealth where he could secretly gloat over it and still continue to pose as a pauper  i dont believe it said patsy stoutly  youll never make a successful detective if you allow your personal feelings to influence you returned louise i too sincerely hope that thomas is innocent but we are not justified in acquitting him until we have made a careful investigation and watched his actions  im quite sure hes connected with the mystery in some way said beth it will do no harm to watch old hucks as louise suggests  and you might try to pump him patsy and see if you can get him to talk of the murder some careless remark might give us just the clue we need and guide us to the real criminal that would free thomas from all suspicion you see  but why do you ask me to do this demanded patsy thomas and i are good friends and id feel like a traitor to try to get him to confess a murder  if he is innocent you have done no harm said her eldest cousin and if he is guilty you dont want him for your friend  he likes you dear added beth and perhaps he will tell you frankly all we want to know theres another person though louise who might tell us something  who is that  the little man with the golfball eyes mcnutt  now theres some sense in suspecting him exclaimed patsy we know hes a robber already and a man who is clever enough to sell uncle john three lives of the saints would stick at nothing im sure  he hasnt enough courage to commit a great crime observed beth  but he may be able to give us some information louise asserted so i propose we walk over to the town tomorrow morning and interview him  this was promptly agreed to for even patsy the least enthusiastic detective of the three was eager to find some sort of a solution of the wegg mystery meantime they decided to watch old hucks very carefully  beth happened to be present when uncle john paid thomas his weekly wage that evening and was interested to notice how the old mans hand trembled with eagerness as he took the money  how much are you accustomed to receive uncle john had asked  nothing tall sir since capn wegg died was the reply we was glad enough to have a home nora an me thout spectin wages  and there was no one here for you to serve mused uncle john but in captain weggs day how much did he give you  thomas hesitated and his smile wavered an instant  my old master was also my old friend said he in a low voice an i ast him fer little money because my needs were little  well the conditions are now different remarked uncle john carelessly and while you are in my employ you shall have your wages regularly will ten dollars a week be satisfactory  oh sir  and five for nora  you are too good sir ii  never mind thomas if you want more at any time let me know  it was then as the old man took the fifteen dollars extended to him that beth noted a flash in the mild blue eyes and a trembling of the horny hands hucks was very glad to get the money there was little doubt of that  she spoke of this incident to louise and the following morning they tested the man again all three girls being present beth tendered old hucks two dollars saying it was intended as a slight mark of her appreciation of his attention thomas demurred at first but on being urged took the money with the same eager gesture he had before displayed louise followed with a donation of a like sum and patsy gave the old man still another two dollar bill this generosity so amazed him that tears stood in his eyes as he tried to thank them all it was noticed that the smile did not give way even to the tears although it was tinged with a pathetic expression that proved wonderfully affecting he concealed the offerings with a stealthy motion as if ashamed of his weakness in accepting them and then hurried away to his work  well said louise when they were alone is thomas a miser or not  he clutched the money almost as if he loved it observed beth in a musing and slightly regretful tone  but think how poor he has been pleaded patsy and how destitute both he and nora are yet can we blame him for being glad to earn something substantial at last  somehow that did not seem to explain fully the old mans behavior and the girl who had championed him sighed and then gave a sudden shiver as she remembered the awful suspicion that had fallen upon this strange individual if the proof must be accepted that hucks had miserly instincts had not beth accidentally stumbled upon a solution of the whole mystery  but patsy would not believe it if thomas open countenance lied it was hard to put faith in any one    chapter xii  the baiting of peggy mnutt  by this time the three nieces were so thoroughly impressed with the importance of the task they had undertaken that more ordinary things failed to interest them louise longed to solve the mystery beth wanted to punish the wrongdoers patsy yearned to exonerate the friends whom she imagined unjustly accused therefore the triple alliance for detective purposes was a strong one  by mutual agreement they kept the matter secret from uncle john for they realized what a triumph it would be to surprise the old gentleman with proofs of their cleverness to confide in him now would mean to invite no end of ridicule or good natured raillery for uncle john had not a grain of imagination or romance in his nature and would be unable to comprehend the delights of this secret investigation  because he was in the dark the significant looks and unnatural gravity of his nieces in the succeeding days puzzled the poor man greatly  whats wrong girls he would ask arent you happy here do you miss anything youd like is it too quiet and dull at millville to suit you  oh no they would exclaim we are having a splendid time and would not leave the farm for anything  and he often noticed them grouped in isolated places and conversing in low eager tones that proved something was up he felt somewhat grieved that he was not their confidant since these girls and their loyal affection for him constituted the chief joy of his life when he put on his regulation fishing costume and carried his expensive rod and reel his landing net and creel to the brook for a days sport he could no longer induce one of his girls to accompany him even patsy pleaded laughingly that she had certain fish to fry that were not to be found in the brook  soon the three nieces made their proposed visit to mcnutt their idea being to pump that individual until he was dry of any information he might possess concerning the wegg mystery they tramped over to the village after breakfast one morning and found the agent seated on the porch before his little office by which name the front room of his cottage was dignified he was dressed in faded overalls a checked shirt and a broadbrimmed cheap straw hat his off foot as he called it with grim humor was painted green and his other foot was bare and might have been improved in color both these extremities rested on the rail of the porch while mcnutt smoked a corncob pipe and stared at his approaching visitors with his disconcerting protruding eyes  good morning mr mcnutt said louise pleasantly weve come to see if you have any books to sell  the agent drew a long breath he had at first believed they had come to reproach him for his cruel deception for although his conscience was wholly dormant he had at times been a bit uneasy concerning his remarkable book trade  uncle is making a collection of the lives of the saints announced patsy demurely at present he has but three varieties of this work one with several pages missing another printed partly upside down and a third with a broken corner he is anxious to secure some further variations of the dee looks lives if you can supply them  peggys eyes couldnt stare any harder so they just stared  ii haint got no more on hand he stammered fairly nonplussed by the remarkable statement  no more oh how sad how disappointed we are said beth  we were depending so much on you mr mcnutt added louise in a tone of gentle reproach  mcnutt wiggled the toes of his good foot and regarded them reflectively these city folks were surely the easiest marks he had ever come across  ef ye could wait a few days he began hopefully i might  oh no we cant possibly wait a single minute declared patsy unless uncle can get the saints right away he will lose interest in the collection and then he wont care for them at all  mcnutt sighed dismally here was a chance to make good money by fleecing the lambs yet he was absolutely unable to take advantage of it  yeye couldnt use any duck eggs could ye he said a sudden thought seeming to furnish him with a brilliant idea  duck eggs  i got the dumtwistedest extry fine lot o duck eggs ye ever seen  but what can we do with duck eggs inquired beth wonderingly while patsy and louise tried hard not to shriek with laughter  wy set em under a hen an hatch em out  sir said beth i strongly disapprove of such deceptions it seems to me that making a poor hen hatch out ducks under the delusion that they are chickens is one of the most cruel and treacherous acts that humanity can be guilty of imagine the poor things feelings when her children take to water im surprised you could suggest such a wicked use for duck eggs  mcnutt wiggled his toes again desperately  cant use any sasfrass roots can ye  no indeed all we crave is the lives of the saints  dont want to buy no land  what have you got to sell  nuthn jest now but ef yell buy i kin git most anything  dont go to any trouble on our account sir we are quite content with our splendid farm  shoo thet aint no good  captain wegg thought it was answered louise quickly seizing this opening otherwise he would not have built so good a house upon it  the capn were plumb crazy declared the agent emphatically he didnt want ter farm when he come here he jest wanted to hide  the girls exchanged quick glances of intelligence  why  why repeated mcnutt thets a thing whats puzzled us fer years miss some thinks wegg were a piret some thinks he kidnaped thet pretty wife o hisn an took her money some thinks he tried to rob ol will thompson an will killed him an then went crazy hisself theres all sorts o thinks goin round but who knows  dont you mr mcnutt  the agent was flattered by the question as he had said the weggs had formed the chief topic of conversation in millville for years and no one had a more vivid interest in their history than marshall mcmahon mcnutt he enjoyed gossiping about the weggs almost as much as he did selling books  i never thought i had no call to stick my nose inter other folkses privit doins he said after a few puffs at the corncob pipe but they kaint hide much from marsh mcnutt when he has his eyes open  patsy wondered if he could possibly close them the eyelids seemed to be shy and retiring  i seen what i seen continued the little man glancing impressively at his attentive audience i seen capn wegg livin without workin fer he never lifted a hand to do even a chore i seen him jest settin round an smokin his pipe an a glowerin like a devil on evryone thet come near say once he ordered me offn his premisesme  what a dreadful man said patsy did he buy any lives of the saints  not a life he made poor ol hucks fetch an carry fer him evry blessid minnit an never paid him no wages  are you sure asked louise  sure as shootin hucks haint never been seen to spend a cent in all the years hes been here  hasnt he sold berries and fruit since the captains death  jest nough to pay the taxes which aint much ye see young joe were away an couldnt raise the tax money so ol hucks had to but how they got enough ter live on him an nora beats me  perhaps captain wegg left some money suggested patsy  no when joe an hucks ransacked the house arter the capns death they couldnt find a dollar curous plenty o money till he died n then not a red cent curiouser yet ol will thompsons savins dispeared too an never could be located to this day  were they robbed do you suppose asked louise  natrally but who done it not ol hucks fer hes too honest an hasnt showed the color of a nickel sense not joe cause he had to borrer five dollars of bob west to git to the city with who then  perhaps said louise slowly some burglar did it  aint no burglers round these parts  i suppose not only book agents remarked beth  mcnutt flushed  do ye mean as i did it he demanded angrily do ye mean as i killed capn wegg an druv 01 will crazy an robbed the house  his features were fairly contorted and his colorless eyes rolled fearfully  if you did said beth coolly you would be sure to deny it  i kin prove a alybi answered the little man calming down somewhat i kin prove my ol woman had me locked up in the chickencoop thet night cause i wouldnt split a lot o cordwood thet were full o knots he cast a half fearful glance over his shoulder toward the interior of the cottage next day i split em he added mildly  perhaps said louise again someone who knew captain wegg in the days before he came here followed him to his retreat and robbed and murdered him  now yeve hit the nail on the head cried the agent slapping his fat thigh energetically thets what i allus claimed even when bob west jest shook his head an smiled sort o superior like  who is bob west asked louise with interest  hes our implement man an hardware dealer bob were the ony one o the millville folks thet could git along with capn wegg an even he didnt manage to be any special friend bobs rich ye know rich as blazes folks do say hes wuth ten thousan dollars but it dont set bob up any he jest minds his business an goes on sellin plows an harvesters to the farmers an takin notes fer em  and you say he knew captain wegg well inquired patsy  better n most folks round here did once er twicet a year the capn d go to bobs office an set around an smoke his pipe sometimes bob would go to the farm an spend an evnin but not often ol will thompson might be said to be the ony friend the capn really hankered fer  id like to meet mr west said louise casting a shrewd look at her cousins for here was another clue unearthed  hes in his store now remarked mcnutt last buildin on the left ye cant miss it  thank you good morning sir  cant use any buttermilk er dutch cheese  no thank you  mcnutt stared after them disconsolately these girls represented so much money that ought to be in his pockets and they were moreover innercent as turtle doves but he could think of no way to pluck their golden quills or even to arrest their flight  well let em go he muttered this thing aint ended yit    chapter xiii  bob west hardware dealer  a few steps down the little street brought the girls to the hardware store quite the most imposing building in town they crossed the broad platform on which stood samples of heavy farm machinery and entered a wellstocked room where many articles of hardware and house furnishings were neatly and systematically arranged  the place seemed deserted for at that time of day no country people were at millville but on passing down the aisle the visitor approached a little office built at the rear of the store behind the desk bob west sat upon his high stool gravely regarding his unusual customers over the rims of his spectacles  good morning said louise taking the lead have you a stew pan  the merchant left the office and silently walked behind the counter  large or small miss he then asked  the girls became interested in stew pans which they were scarcely able to recognize by their official name mr west offered no comment as they made their selection  can you send this to the wegg farm asked louise opening her purse to make payment  west smiled  i have no means of delivering goods said he but if you can wait a day or two i may catch some farmer going that way who will consent to take it  oh didnt captain wegg purchase his supplies in the village asked the girl  some of them but it is our custom here to take goods that we purchase home with us as yet millville is scarcely large enough to require a delivery wagon  the nieces laughed pleasantly and beth said  are you an old inhabitant mr west  i have been here thirtyfive years  then you knew captain wegg louise ventured  very well  the answer was so frank and free from embarrassment that his questioner hesitated here was a man distinctly superior to the others they had interviewed a man of keen intellect and worldly knowledge who would be instantly on his guard if he suspected they were crossexamining him so louise with her usual tact decided to speak plainly  we have been much interested in the history of the wegg family she remarked easily and perhaps it is natural for us to speculate concerning the characters of our predecessors it was so odd that captain wegg should build so good a house on such a poor farm  yes  and he was a sea captain who retired far from the sea which he must have loved  to be sure  it made him dissatisfied they say as well as surly and unsociable but he stuck it out even after his poor wife died and until the day of the murder  murder in a tone of mild surprise  was it not murder she asked quickly  he gave his shoulders a quiet shrug  the physician pronounced it heart disease i believe  what physician  eh why one who was fishing in the neighborhood for trout and staying at the hotel old dr jackson was in huntington at the time i remember  the girls exchanged significant glances and west noted them and smiled again  that murder theory is a new one to me he said but i see now why it originated the employment of a strolling physician would give color to the suspicion  what do you think sir asked patsy who had been watching the mans expression closely  i what do i think why that captain wegg died from heart disease as he had often told me he was sure to do in time  then what made old mr thompson go mad inquired beth  the shock of his friends sudden death he had been mentally unbalanced for some time previousnot quite mad you understand but showing by his actions at times that his brain was affected  can you explain what became of their money asked louise abruptly  west gave a start but collected himself in an instant and covered the action with another shrug  i cannot say what become of their money he answered  it struck both beth and louise that his tone indicated he would not rather than that he could not say before they had time to ask another questioned he continued  will you take the saucepan with you then or shall i try to send it in a day or so  we will take it if you please answered louise but as he wrapped it into a neat parcel she made one more effort  what sort of a young man was joseph wegg  joe a mere boy untried and unsettled a bright boy in his way and ambitious to have a part in the big world hes there now i believe  he spoke with an air of relief and handed louise the parcel  thank you young ladies pray call again if i can be of service to you he added in a brisker tone  they had no recourse but to walk out which they did without further words indeed they were all three silent until they had left the village far behind and were half way to the farm  then patsy said inquiringly  well girls  we have progressed announced louise seriously  in what way  several things are impressed upon my mind replied the girl one is mcnutts absurd indignation when he thought we hinted that he was the murderer  what do you make of that queried patsy  it suggests that he knows something of the murder even if he is himself wholly innocent his alibi is another absurdity  then that exonerated old hucks said patsy relieved  oh not at all hucks may have committed the deed and mcnutt knows about it or they might have been partners in the crime  what else have you learned louise asked beth  that the man west knows what became of the money  he seems like a very respectable man asserted patsy  outwardly yes but i dont like the cold calculating expression in his eyes he is the rich man of this neighborhood do you suppose he acquired a fortune honestly in this forsaken district where everyone else is poor as a church mouse  seems to me said patsy discontentedly that the plot thickens as they say in novels if we interview many more people we shall find ourselves suspecting an army  not at all my dear replied louise coldly from our present knowledge the murder lies between the unknown avenger and hucks with the possibility that mcnutt is implicated this avenger may be the stranger who posed as a physician and said captain wegg died of heart disease in order to prevent the simple people from suspecting a murder his fishing was all a blind perhaps mcnutt was his accomplice that staring scarecrow would do anything for money and then we come to the robbery if hucks did the murder he took the money and perhaps west the hardware dealer knows this or west may have arrived at the house after the mysterious stranger committed the deed and robbed the two men himself  and perhaps he didnt said patsy skeptically do you know girls id like to find joe wegg he could put us right im sure  joe  yes why dont we suspect him of something or ethel or old nora  do be sensible patsy said beth impatiently  but louise walked on a way in silence presently she remarked  im glad you mentioned joe wegg the boy gives me an idea that may reconcile many conflicting suspicions  in what way louise  ill tell you when ive thought it out she replied    chapter xiv  the major is puzzled  ethel came frequently to visit the girls at the wegg farm and at such times uncle john treated her with the same affectionate consideration he bestowed upon his nieces and made her so cordially welcome that the little school teacher felt entirely at her ease the girls did not confide to ethel their investigation of the wegg mystery but in all other matters gave her their full confidence together they made excursions to the falls to the natural caves on the rocky hill called mount parnassus or rowed on the lake or walked or drove as the mood seized them but mostly they loved the shade of the pines and the broad green beside the quaint mansion captain wegg had built and which now contained all the elements of a modern summer home  once louise asked ethel casually if she knew what great trouble had come to hucks and his wife in their early life but the girl frankly answered that the old people had never referred to anything of the kind in her presence  finally a telegram announced the arrival of major doyle to join the party at the farm patsy was in the seventh heaven of delight and drove joe over to the junction to meet her father on the arrival of the morning train  the major was a prime favorite with all the party and his coming infused new life into the household he was the type of educated polished openhearted irish gentleman it is always a delight to meet and uncle john beamed upon his brotherinlaw in a way that betokened a hearty welcome it was a source of much satisfaction to lug the major over the farm and prove to him how wise mr merrick had been in deciding to spend the summer on his own property and the major freely acknowledged that he had been in error and the place was as charming as anyone could wish it was a great treat to the grizzled old warrior to find himself in the country away from every responsibility of work and he promised himself a fortnight of absolute rest with the recreation of beholding his beloved patsy as often as he pleased  of course the girl would tell her father about the wegg mystery for patsy had a habit of telling him everything therefore the cousins decided to take the major freely into their confidence so as to obtain the benefit of his opinion that could not be done the first day of course for on that day uncle john insisted on displaying the farm and afterward carrying the major a willing prisoner to watch him fish in the brook but on the following morning the girls surrounded patsys father and with solemn faces recounted their suspicions the important clues they had unearthed and their earnest desire to right the great wrong that had been done by apprehending the criminal  the major smoked his after breakfast cigar and listened attentively the story told consecutively was quite impressive in spite of his long experience in buffeting the world the old soldiers heart was still as simple as that of a child and the recital awakened his sympathies at once  tis evident me children said he in his quaint way that youve shtumbled on the inside of a crime that doesnt show on the outside many of the things you mention are so plain that he who runs may read but ive remarked that its just the things ye dont suspect in real life that prove to be the most important  that is true major commented louise at first it was just to amuse ourselves that we became amateur detectives but the developments are so startling and serious that we now consider it our duty to uncover the whole dreadful crime in the interests of justice  just so he said nodding  but im sure old hucks is innocent declared patsy emphatically  then he is asserted the major for patsys always right even when shes wrong ive had me eye on that man hucks already for hes the merriest faced villain i ever encountered do you say hes shy with you girls  he seems afraid of us or suspicious and wont let us talk to him answered beth  leave him to me proposed the major turning a stern face but twinkling eyes upon the group twill be my task to detect him leave him to me young women an ill put the thumbscrews on him in short order  here was the sort of energetic confederate they had longed for the majors assurance of cooperation was welcome indeed and while he entered heartily into their campaign he agreed that no mention of the affair ought to reach uncle johns ears until the case was complete and they could call upon the authorities to arrest the criminal  its me humble opinion he remarked that the interesting individual you call the avenger was put on the trail by someone hereeither thomas hucks or the timbertoed book agent or the respectable hardware man being invited to come and do his worst he passed himself as a docther on a fishing excursion and having with deliberate intent murthered captain wegg got himself called by the coroner to testify that the victim died of heart disease a very pretty bit of scoundrelism eh me dears  but the robberwho do you think he was asked louise  that ive still to discover you inform me that hucks is eager for money and acts like a miser ive seen the time i was eager for money meself and theres not a miserly hair on me bald head but exceptions prove the rule ill watch our smiling thomas and make a report later  within half an hour he was telling hucks a funny story and slapping the old man upon the back as familiarly as if he had known him for years he found an opportunity that same day to give thomas a dollar in return for a slight service and was amazed at the eagerness with which the coin was clutched and the earnestness of the thanks expressed it really did seem as if the man was fond of money but when the major tried to draw hucks into speaking of his past history and of captain weggs singular life and death the old fellow became reserved at once and evaded the inquiries most skillfully  that night as the major strolled in the orchard to smoke his last cigar after all the others had retired to bed he noticed hucks leave the back door of the leanto with a parcel under his arm and pass hurriedly around the barn after a little hesitation he decided to follow the man and crept stealthily along in the shadow of the trees and buildings until he found himself at the edge of the berrypatch that was in the rear of the outbuildings but there he paused irresolutely for thomas had completely disappeared  the major was puzzled but decided to watch for the mans return so he took a position where he could watch the rear door of the house and smoked patiently for nearly an hour before hucks returned and let himself quietly in  he said nothing to the girls next day of this mysterious proceeding but on the following night again took his station in the orchard to watch  sure enough as soon as the house was quiet the old servant came out with a bundle underneath his arm but this time he led his blind wife by the other hand  the major gave a low whistle and threw away his cigar the night was so dark that he had little difficulty in following the aged pair closely enough to keep their shadowy forms in sight without the risk of being discovered they passed around the barn and along a path that led through the raspberry bushes back of the yard there were several acres of these bushes and just now they were fullleaved and almost shoulder high the path wound this way and that and branched in several directions twice the major thought he had lost his quarry but was guided aright by their soft footfalls the ground dipped here and there and as they entered one of the hollows major doyle was startled to observe the twinkle of a dim light ahead a minute later he saw the outlines of a little frame building and within this old hucks and nora presently disappeared    chapter xv  the man in hiding  cautiously the major approached the cabin which seemed to have been built as a place for the berry pickers to assemble and pack their fruit it was constructed of rough boards and had a little window in the side nearest the dwelling house and a door on the opposite side  creeping near to the window the major obtained a clear view of the interior upon a dilapidated wicker settee which had one end propped with a box partially reclined the form of a man whose right arm was in splints and supported by a sling while his head was covered with plasters and bandages the mans back was toward the window but from his slender form and its graceful poise the major imagined him young  old nora held the left hand of this mysterious person in a warm clasp bending now and then to press a kiss upon it while hucks busied himself opening the parcel he had brought and arranging various articles of food on a rickety stand at the head of the couch the old mans smile was more benevolent and cheery than ever and his actions denoted that strange suppressed eagerness the major had marked when he had taken the money  the three spoke little and in tones so low that the spy outside the window failed to catch them soon the injured man began to eat feeding himself laboriously with his left hand but his hunger was quickly satisfied and then he lay back wearily upon his pillows while nora tenderly spread a coverlet over him  after this the old couple did not linger long hucks poured some water from a jug into a tumbler glanced around the little room to see that everything was in order and thenafter he and nora had both kissed the bandaged foreheadblew out the candle and retired  the major crouched low in the berry bushes until the couple had passed by then he rose and thoughtfully followed after them  whatever patsys father might have thought of the wegg farm mystery before this adventure convinced him that the girls were not altogether foolish in imagining a romance connected with the place and notwithstanding patsys loyal defense of old hucks he was evidently tangled up in the affair to a large extent and could explain if he chose much that was now puzzling the girl detectives  after careful thought the major decided to confide in uncle john at this juncture rather than in the nieces since the latest developments were more fitted for a mans interference  by good fortune the girls had an engagement the next day and set out together in the surrey to visit ethel thompson and lunch with her in the rose bower which was the pride of the little school teachers garden as soon as they were gone the major hunted up uncle john and said  come with me sir  i wont was the brisk reply im going fishing and whoever wishes my society must come with me  youll not catch anything fishing but youre very liable to catch something if you follow my lead said the major meaningly  whats up gregory  im not sure what it is john and then he carefully explained his discovery that an injured man was occupying the cabin in the berry patch and seemed to be the object of the hucks tender care  its the secrecy of the thing that astounds me most sir he added if all was open and above board id think little enough of it  uncle johns kindly interest was at once aroused and he proposed that they go directly to the cabin and interview the man in hiding hucks being at the time busy in the barn the two men sauntered into the berry patch without being observed and then walked briskly along the winding paths until they sighted the building  pausing at the window they saw the man still reclining upon his cot and holding in his left hand a bookone of patsys the major observedwhich he was quietly engaged in reading then they moved around to the door which uncle john pushed open  without hesitation the two men entered and stood gazing down upon the strange occupant of the place  good morning said mr merrick while the major nodded a greeting  the man half arose moving stiffly  pardon me sirs he said rather startled at the interruption i regret that i am physically unable to receive you with more courtesy  the major gazed into the partially bandaged face with a glimmer of awakening recognition  hm ha if im not mistaken said he its joseph wegg  oh is it asked uncle john looking upon the young man curiously whats happened to you joseph  just an automobile accident sir the steering gear broke and we went over an embankment  i see  are you mr merrick sir  yes  i owe you an apology for intruding upon your premises in this way and beg you to forgive the seeming impertinence but ive been rather unlucky of late sir and without this refuge i dont know what would have become of me i will explain if you will permit me  uncle john nodded  after i had squandered the money you paid me through major doyle for this farm in a vain endeavor to protect a patent i had secured i was forced to become a chauffeur to earn my livelihood i understand automobiles you know and obtained employment with a wealthy man who considered me a mere part of his machine when the accident occurred through no fault of mine i was fortunately the only person injured but my employer was so incensed over the damage to his automobile that he never even sent to inquire whether i lived or died at a charity hospital they tried to mend my breaks and tinker up my anatomy my shoulderblade was shattered my arm broken in three places and four ribs were crashed in the wounds in my head are mere abrasions of the scalp and not serious but it has taken me a long time to mend and the crowded stuffy hospital got on my nerves and worried me being penniless and friendless i wrote to thomas and asked him if he could find a way to get me to the old farm for i never imagined you would yourself take possession of the deserted place you had bought  thomas and nora have cared for me since i was born you know and the old man was greatly distressed by the knowledge of my sad condition he did not tell me you were here for fear i would hesitate to come but he sent me the money you had given him and nora for wages together with all that the young ladies had kindly given him i was thus enabled to leave the hospital which i had come to detest and journey to my old home i arrived at the junction on a night train and thomas met me with your surrey drove me here under cover of darkness and concealed me in this outoftheway place hoping you would not discover me  i regret that i was thus foisted upon you believe me sir but being here i have no means of getting away again thomas hucks has had little worldly experience and cannot realize the full extent of the imposition he has practiced he feeds me from your table and is hoarding up his money for me against the time i shall have recovered sufficiently to leave i think that is the full explanation mr merrick  again uncle john nodded  how are you he asked  doing finely sir i can walk a little and my appetite is improving the doctors said my shoulder would never be very strong again but im beginning to hope they were mistaken my ribs seem all right and in another ten days i shall remove the splints from my arm  you have no medical attendance  not since i left the hospital but i imagine this pure bracing air is better for me than a dozen doctors was the cheerful reply  and what are your future plans  the young man smiled he was little more than a boy but his questioner noticed that he had a fine manly face and his eye was clear and steadfast  nothing further than to get to work again as soon as i am able to undertake it he said  uncle john looked thoughtfully and drummed with his finger upon the little table  joseph he remarked presently i bought this farm at a price altogether too small considering its value  the boy flushed  please do not say that he exclaimed hastily i am well aware that i virtually robbed you and my only excuse is that i believed i would win my fight and be able to redeem the place but that is over now and you must not think that because i am ill and helpless i am an object of charity  phoo said the little man arent you accepting charity from old hucks  but he stands as a second father to me he is an old retainer of my family and one of my ambitions is to secure a home for him and nora in their old age no i do not feel at all embarrassed in accepting money or assistance from thomas  young man said uncle john sternly one of the follies of youth is the idea of being independent of the goodwill of your fellowcreatures every person who lives is dependent on some other person for something or other and ill not allow you to make a fool of yourself by refusing to let me take you in hand your brain is affected  it is not  you are mentally unbalanced and need a guardian thats me you are helpless and cannot resist so youre my prisoner dare to defy me dare to oppose my wishes in any way and ill have you put in a straightjacket and confined in a padded cell understand me sir  joseph wegg looked into the little mans round face until the tears filled his own eyes and blurred his vision  wont you protect me major doyle he asked weakly  not i said the major stoutly this brotherinlaw of mine who connected himself with me without asking permission is a perfect demon when roused and ill not meddle with any opposition to his desires if you value your life and happiness joseph wegg youll accept mr merrick as a guardian until he resigns of his own accord and then its likely youll wish he hadnt  i dont deserve began the young man brokenly but uncle john quickly interrupted him  no one deserves anything said he but everyone gets something or other nevertheless in this vale of tears if youll kindly remember that youve no right to express an opinion in the presence of your guardian well get along better together now then youre going to leave here because the place is not comfortable my guests fill every room in my house so you cant go there but the hotel in millville is a cheerfullooking place and ive noticed some vinecovered windows that indicate pleasant and sunny rooms major go and tell hucks to hitch that groaning balky daniel to the ancient buggy and then to drive this young man over to the hotel well walk  the major started at once and uncle john continued i dont know whether this arrangement suits you or not joseph but it suits me and as a matter of fact its none of your business feel able to take a ride  the boy smiled gratefully  yes indeed mr merrick said he and was shrewd enough not to venture a word of thanks    chapter xvi  a matter of speculation  old hucks still smiling but dreadfully nervous over the discovery of joe and mr merricks sudden activity in the boys behalf speedily harnessed daniel and induced the reluctant steed to amble down the path to the cabin leaning on uncle johns arm the invalid walked to the buggy and was assisted to mount to the seat beside thomas then away they started and although dan obeyed hucks more willingly than any other driver the major and uncle john walked crosslots and reached the hotel a good fifteen minutes in advance of the equipage  the millville hotel depended almost entirely for patronage upon the commercial travelers who visited the place periodically to sell goods to the merchants and these did not come too often because trade was never very energetic and orders never very large bob west boarded at the hotel and so did ned long a farm hand who did sundry odd jobs for anyone who needed him and helped pay his keep by working for mrs kebble when not otherwise engaged  mrs kebble was the landlady and a famous cook kate kebble a slatternly girl of sixteen helped her mother do the work and waited on the table chet kebble the landlord was a silent old man with billygoat whiskers and one stray eye which being constructed of glass usually assumed a slanting gaze and refused to follow the direction of its fellow chet minded the billiardroom which was mostly patronized saturday nights and did a meager business in fire insurance but he was so eternal lazy an shifless as mrs kebble sharply asserted that he was considered more a hangeron of the establishment than its recognized head  the little rooms of the hotel were plainly furnished but maintained with exceptional neatness  the one in the east corner of the second floor met with the approval of uncle john and the major and was promptly engaged it was cheerful and sunny with outlooks on the lake and the village and contained a lounge as well as the bed  when the invalid arrived he was assisted to this apartment and installed as its permanent occupant  any baggage asked mr merrick  theres a small trunk lying at the junction said joe but it contains little of importance  well make yourself at home my boy and get well at your leisure remarked uncle john mrs kebble has promised to look after you and the major and i will stop in now and then and see how you progress  then he went out engaged nick thorne to go to the junction for the boys trunk and selected several things at the store that he thought might be useful to the invalid afterward he marched home again beside the major feeling very well pleased with his mornings work  when the girls reached home late in the afternoon they were thrown into a state of great excitement by the news briefly related by their uncle that joseph wegg had returned to millville considerably smashed by an automobile accident and was now stopping at the village hotel for repairs  they refrained from making remarks upon the incident until they were alone when the secret council of three decided to make joe weggs acquaintance as soon as possible to discover what light the young man might be able to throw upon the great mystery  do you know girls said louise impressively it almost seems as if fate had sent joe wegg here to be an instrument in the detection of the murderer and robber of his poor father  if joe knew about it why didnt he track the villain down himself inquired patsy  perhaps he hasnt suspected the truth said beth often those who are closely concerned with such tragedies do not observe the evidences of crime as clearly as outsiders  where did you get that information demanded patsy  from one of anna doyle oppenheims detective stories answered beth seriously ive been reading up on such things lately  detective stories said louise reflectively are only useful in teaching us to observe the evidences of crime this case for example is so intricate and unusual that only by careful thought and following each thread of evidence to its end can we hope to bring the criminal to justice  that seems to me conceited observed miss doyle composedly detective stories dont have to stick to facts or rather they can make the facts to be whatever they please so i dont consider them as useful as they are ornamental and this isnt a novel girls its mostly suspicion and slander  you dont seem able to be in earnest about anything objected beth turning a little red  but i try to be said patricia  we are straying from the subject now under discussion remarked louise i must say that i feel greatly encouraged by the sudden appearance of the wegg boy he may know something of his fathers former associates that will enable us to determine the object of the murder and who accomplished it  captain wegg was killed over three years ago suggested miss doyle recovering easily from her rebuff by this time the murderer may have died or moved to madagascar  he is probably living within our reach never suspecting that justice is about to overtake him asserted louise we must certainly go to call upon this wegg boy and draw from him such information as we can i am almost certain that the end is in sight  we havent any positive proof at all yet observed patsy musingly  we have plenty of circumstantial evidence returned beth there is only one way to explain the facts we have already learned and the theory we have built up will be a hard one to overthrow the flight of captain wegg to this place his unhappy wife the great trouble that old nora has hinted at the  the great trouble ought to come first declared louise it is the foundation upon which rest all the mysterious occurrences following and once we have learned what the great trouble was the rest will be plain sailing  i agree with you said beth and perhaps joseph wegg will be able to tell us what the trouble was that ruined the lives of his parents as well as of old hucks and his wife and caused them all to flee here to hide themselves  it was not until the following morning that the major found an opportunity to give the confederates a solemn wink to indicate he had news to confide to them they gathered eagerly on the lawn and he told them of the finding of joe wegg in the isolated cabin and how old thomas and nora loving the boy as well as if he had been their own child had sacrificed everything to assist him in his extremity  so ye see my avenging angels that ye run off the track in the hucks matter he added smiling at their bewildered faces  patsy was delighted at this refutation of the slanderous suspicions that thomas was a miser and his smiling face a mask to hide his innate villainy the other girls were somewhat depressed by the overthrow of one of their pet theories and reluctantly admitted that if hucks had been the robber of his master and old will thompson he would not have striven so eagerly to get enough money to send to joe wegg but they pointed out that the old servant was surely hiding his knowledge of captain weggs past and could not be induced to clear up that portion of the mystery which he had full knowledge of so while he might be personally innocent of the murder or robbery both beth and louise were confident he was attempting to shield the real criminal  but who is the real criminal inquired patsy  let us consider answer louise with the calm businesslike tone she adopted in these matters there is the strolling physician whom we call the unknown avenger for one a second suspect is the man mcnutt whose nature is so perverted that he would stick at nothing the third suspicious individual is mr bob west  oh louise mr west is so respectable and so prosperous exclaimed patsy  its a far jump from mcnutt to west added beth  leaving out hucks continued louise her eyes sparkling with the delightful excitement of maintaining her theories against odds here are three people who might have been concerned in the robbery or murder two of them are under our hands perhaps joseph wegg may be able to tell us where to find the third  they pleaded so hard with the major to take them to call upon the injured youth that very day that the old gentleman consented and without telling uncle john of their plans they drove to millville in the afternoon and alighted at the hotel  the major went first to the boys room and found him not only very comfortable but bright and cheerful in mood  at this rate sir he said smilingly i shall be able to discharge my guardian in quick time im twice the man i was yesterday  ive brought some young ladies to call upon you announced the major will you see them  joe flushed at first remembering his plastered skull and maimed condition but he could not well refuse to receive his callers whom he guessed to be the three girls old hucks had praised to him so highly  it will give me great pleasure sir he replied  an invalid is usually of interest to women so it is no wonder that the three young ladies were at once attracted by the brightfaced boy who reclined upon his couch before the vinecovered windows they thought of ethel too and did not marvel that the girl grieved over the loss of this friend of her childhood  joe had to recount the adventure with the automobile which led to his injuries and afterward give an account of his life at the hospital that led naturally to the timely assistance rendered him by the faithful thomas so that louise was able to broach the subject nearest her heart  we have been greatly interested in your old servantswhom we acquired with the farm it seemsand all of us admire their simplicity and sincerity she began  nora is a dear added beth  and thomas is so cheerful that his smile is enough to vanquish any attack of the blues said patsy  the hucks are the right sort and no mistake declared the major taking his cue from the others  this praise evidently delighted the boy they could have found no more direct way to win his confidence  nora was my mothers maid from the time she was a mere girl said he and thomas sailed with my father many years before i was born  they were a little surprised to hear him speak so frankly but louise decided to take advantage of the opening afforded her  nora has told us that some great trouble came to them years agoa trouble that also affected your own parents but they do not wish to talk about it to us  his face clouded  no indeed said he their loving old hearts have never recovered from the blow would you like to know their history it is a sad story and pitiful but i am sure you would understand and appreciate my old friends better after hearing it  their hearts fairly jumped with joy would they like to hear the story was it not this very clue which they had been blindly groping for to enable them to solve the mystery of the wegg crime the boy marked their interest and began his story at once while the hearts of the three girls sanggladly at lastat last    chapter xvii  joe tells of the great trouble  as a young man my father was a successful sea captain said the boy and before he was thirty owned a considerable interest in the ship he sailed thomas hucks was his boatswainan honest and able seaman in whom my father became much interested hucks was married and his wife was an attendant in the employ of hugh carter a wealthy ship chandler of edmunton the port from which my fathers ship sailed thomas had some difficulty in enjoying his wifes society when on shore because old carter did not want him hanging around the house so captain wegg goodnaturedly offered to intercede for him  carter was a gruff and disagreeable man and although my father had been a good customer he refused his request and threatened to discharge nora which he did this made captain wegg angry and he called upon mary carter whose especial attendant nora had been to ask her to take the girl back mary was a mild young lady who dared not oppose her father but the result of the interview was that the sea captain and mary carter fell mutually in love during the next two or three years whenever the ship was in port the lovers frequently met by stealth at the cottage of mrs hucks a little place thomas had rented here my father and mother were finally married  meantime nora had a son a fine young chap ive heard and presently my mother who had a little fortune of her own plucked up enough courage to leave her fathers roof and took up her abode in a pretty villa on the edge of a bluff overlooking the sea nora came to live with her again bringing her child and the two women were company for one another while their husbands were at sea  in course of time my mother had two children a girl and a boy and because the hucks boy was considerably older than they he took care of them to a great extent and the three youngsters were always together their favorite playground was on the beach at the foot of the bluff and before young tom was ten years old he could swim like a duck and manage a boat remarkably well the wegg children having something of their mothers timid nature perhaps were not so adventurous but they seldom hesitated to go wherever tom led them  one day while my mother was slightly ill and nora was attending to her tom disobeyed the commands that had been given him and took his younger companions out on the ocean for a ride in his boat no one knows how far they went or exactly what happened to them but a sudden squall sprang up and the children being missed my mother insisted ill as she was in running down to the shore to search for her darlings braving the wind and drenched by rain the two mothers stood side by side peering into the gloom while brave men dared the waves to search for the missing ones the body of the girl was first washed ashore and my mother rocked the lifeless form in her arms until her dead son was laid beside her then young toms body was recovered and the horror was complete  when my father arrived three days later he not only found himself bereaved of the two children he had loved so tenderly but his young wife was raving with brain fever and likely to follow her babies to the grave during that terrible time nora who could not forget that it was her own adventurous son who had led all three children to their death went suddenly blindfrom grief the doctors said  my father pulled his wife back to life by dint of careful nursing but whenever she looked at the sea she would scream with horror so it became necessary to take her where the cruel sound of the breakers could never reach her ears i think the grief of thomas and nora was scarcely less than that of my own parents and both men had suffered so severely that they were willing to abandon the sea and devote their lives to comforting their poor wives captain wegg sold all his interests and his wifes villa and brought the money here where he established a home amid entirely different surroundings he was devoted to my mother i have heard and when she died soon after my birth the captain seemed to lose all further interest in life and grew morose and unsociable with all his fellowcreatures  that young ladies is the story of what thomas and nora call their great trouble and i think it is rightly named because it destroyed the happiness of two families i was born long after the tragedy but its shadow has saddened even my own life  when the boy had finished his voice trembling with emotion as he uttered the last words his auditors were much affected by the sad tale patsy was positively weeping and the major blew his nose vigorously and advised his daughter to dry up an be sinsible beths great eyes stared compassionately at the young fellow and even louise for the moment allowed her sympathy to outweigh the disappointment and chagrin of seeing her carefully constructed theory of crime topple over like the house of cards it was there was now no avenger to be discovered because there had been nothing to avenge the simple yet pathetic story accounted for all the mystery that in her imagination enveloped the life and death of captain wegg butstay  how did your father die she asked softly  through a heart trouble from which he had suffered for years and which had obliged him to lead a very quiet life was the reply that was one of the things which after my mothers death helped to sour his disposition he could not return to the sea again because he was told that any sudden excitement was likely to carry him off and indeed that was exactly what happened  how is that sir asked the major  it is more difficult to explain than the first of the story replied the boy thoughtfully gazing through the window perhaps because i do not understand it so well our simple life here never made much of an inroad into my fathers modest fortune for our wants were few but captain wegg was a poor man of business having been a sailor during all his active life his only intimate friendan honest bluff old farmer named will thompsonwas as childish regarding money matters as my father but had a passion for investments and induced my father to join some of his schemes mr thompsons mind was somewhat erratic at times but keen in some ways nevertheless fearing to trust his judgment entirely my father chose to lean upon the wisdom and experience of a shrewd merchant of millville named robert west  the hardware dealer asked louise impulsively  yes i see you have met him replied joseph wegg with a smile at the eager pretty face of his visitor bob west was a prosperous man and very careful about his own investments so he became a sort of business adviser to my father and mr thompson and arbitrated any differences of opinion they might have for several years due to wests good offices the two oddly mated friends were successful in their ventures and added to their capital finally west came to them himself with a proposition he had discovered a chance to make a good deal of money by purchasing an extensive pine forest near almaquo just across the border in canada west had taken an option on the property when he found by accident that the piercelane lumber company was anxious to get hold of the tract and cut the timber on a royalty that would enable the owners to double their investment  howld on a jiffy cried the major excitedly did i understand you to say the piercelane lumber company  that was the firm sir i used to overhear my father and will thompson talking about this matter but i must admit my knowledge is somewhat imperfect because i never was allowed to ask questions i remember learning the fact that west had not enough money to swing his option and so urged his friends to join him relying upon wests judgment they put all their little fortunes into the deal although thompson grumbled at doing so because he claimed he had another investment that was better and this matter of wests would prevent him from undertaking it the almaquo tract was purchased and a contract made with the lumber company to cut the timber and pay them a royalty of so much a thousand feet yet although the prospects for profit seemed so good i know that for some reason both my father and thompson were dissatisfied with the deal and this may be accounted for by the fact that every penny of their money was tied up in one investment west used to come to the house and argue with them that the property was safe as the bank of england and then old will would tell him how much more he could have made out of another investment he had in mind so that a coolness grew up between west and the others that gradually led to their estrangement  i can well remember the evening when bob wests pretty financial bubble burst thompson and my father were sitting together in the right wing smoking solemnly and exchanging a few words as was their custom when west arrived with a while face and a newspaper under his arm i was in the next room lying half asleep upon the sofa when i heard west cry despairingly ruinedruinedruined i crept to the halfopened door then and looked in both men were staring openmouthed and halfdazed at west who was explaining in a trembling voice that a terrible forest fire had swept through the almaquo section and wiped out every tree upon the property he had the full account in the newspaper and had begun reading it when my father uttered a low moan and tumbled off his chair to the floor  will thompson gave a wild cry and knelt beside him  my god hes dead bobhes deadand youve killed him with your good news he screamed already raving and then old hucks ran in just in time to prevent the madman from throttling west for his fingers were even then twined around bobs throat there was a desperate struggle and i remember that scared as i was i joined thomas in trying to pull thompson off his prey but suddenly old will threw up his arms and toppled backward still raving like a demon but unable to move his body from the waist downward west helped us to put him in bed and said he was paralyzed which afterward proved to be the truth also his mind was forever gone and i think it was fathers death that did that rather than the loss of his money  they were all staring whitefaced at the speaker most of the mystery was being cleared away indeed there was now little of mystery remaining at all  west hurried after a doctor continued joe who was almost as much absorbed in his story as were his listeners and spoke in a reflective musing way and he succeeded in finding one who was stopping for a few days at the hotel poor bob was very kind to us in our trouble and i never heard him mention a word about his own losses which must have been severe after the funeral was over and i found i had nothing to inherit but the farm i decided to go to the city and make my way there as i had long wished to do west gave me a little money to start me on my way and the rest of my story is not very interesting to anybody major doyle knows something of it after the time when i got through my technical school by working as a servant to pay for my instruction im a failure in life so far young ladies but if youll not bear that against me ill try to do better in the future  good cried the major approvingly as he took the boys left hand in both his own and pressed it youre developing the right spirit joseph me lad and well think no more about the sadness of the past but look forward to the joy of your future  of course said patsy nodding gravely joe wegg is bound to be a great man some day    chapter xviii  the locked cupboard  louise and beth returned to the farm in dismal silence every prop had been knocked from beneath their carefully erected temple of mystery now there was no mystery at all  in a few words joe wegg had explained everything and explained all so simply and naturally that louise felt like sobbing with the bitterness of a child deprived of its pet plaything the band of selfconstituted girl detectives had been put out of business as patsy said because the plain fact had developed that there was nothing to detect and never had been there had been no murder no robbery no flight or hiding on the part of the weggs to escape an injured enemy nothing even mysterious in the light of the story they had just heard it was dreadfully humiliating and thoroughly disheartening after all their earnest endeavor to investigate a crime that had never been committed  uncle john rallied his nieces on their somber faces at the dinner table and was greatly amused when the major despite the appealing looks directed at him gave mr merrick a brief resume of the afternoons developments  well i declare said the little man merrily didnt i warn you louise not to try to saddle a murder onto my new farm how you foolish girls could ever have imagined such a carnival of crime in connection with the weggs is certainly remarkable  i dont know about that sir returned the major seriously i was meself inoculated with the idea and for a while i considered meself and the girls the equals of all the pinkertons in the country and when ye come to think of it the history of poor captain wegg and his wife and of nora and thomas as well is out of the ordinary entirely and without the explanation contained all the elements of a firstclass mystery  how did you say the weggs lost their money inquired uncle john turning the subject because he saw that it embarrassed his nieces  why forest fires at almaquo in canada burned down the timber they had bought replied the major and by the way john youre interested in that matter yourself for the piercelane lumber company in which you own a lot of stock had contracted to cut the timber on a royalty  how long ago  three years sir  well weve been cutting timber at almaquo ever since said mr merrick  louise dropped her fork with a clatter disclosing in this wellbred young lady an unusual degree of excitement  then there is something to detect she cried  eh what do you mean inquired her uncle  if youve been cutting timber at almaquo for three years the trees couldnt have burned down louise declared triumphantly  that is evident said the major dryly ive had it in me mind louise to take that matter up for investigation but you are so imbued with the detective spirit that theres no heading you off a trail  before the dessert comes on announced uncle john impressively i want to make a statement you folks have tried your hands at the detective business and made a mess of it now its my turn ill be a detective for three days and if i dont succeed better than you did young women well mingle our tears in all humility eh major  put me in the bunch sir said the old soldier i was as bad as any of them and go ahead in your own way if ye like its me humble opinion john that youre no sherlock holmes but ye wont believe it til ye satisfy yourself of the fact  next morning the loungers around sam cottings store were thrown into a state of great excitement when the nabob came over from the wegg farm and held the longdistance telephone for more than an hour while he talked with people in new york the natives knew that their telephone which was built into a small booth at one end of the storenext the postoffice boxeswas part of a system that made it possible for one to talk to those in far away cities often the country people would eye the mysteriouslooking instrument with awe and whisper to each other of its mighty powers but no one had ever before used it to telephone farther than the junction and then only on rare occasions  itll cost a heap o money sam said mcnutt uneasily while uncle john was engaged in his remarkable conversation they could see him in the booth through the little window  it will mac was the solemn reply but the fool nabob may as well spend it thet way as any other its mighty little of his capital er surplus gits inter my cashdrawer n thets a fact  uncle john came from the booth perspiring but smiling and happy he walked across the street to see joe wegg and found the youth seated in a rockingchair and looking quite convalescent but he had company in a chair opposite sat a man neatly dressed with a thin intelligent face a stubby gray moustache and shrewd eyes covered by hornrimmed spectacles  good morning mr merrick said joe cheerily this is mr robert west one of the millville merchants who is an old friend of our family  ive heard of mr west and im glad to meet him replied uncle john looking at the other calmly but not offering to shake hands i believe you are the president and treasurer of the almaquo timber tract company are you not  joseph looked startled and then embarrassed as he overheard the question west without altering his position of careless ease glanced over the rims of his glasses at the speaker  i am the humble individual you refer to mr merrick he said briefly  but the almaquo timber all burned down remarked joe thinking an explanation was needed  thats a mistake returned mr merrick my company has paid mr west as treasurer of his company more than fifty thousand dollars during the last three years  wests jaw dropped  your company he exclaimed as if mystified  yes i own the controlling interest in the piercelane lumber company which has the contract to cut your timber answered mr merrick  the hardware dealer slowly arose and glanced at his watch  i must get back to my store he said you are somewhat in error about your company mr merrick but i suppose your interests are so large and varied that you cannot well keep track of them good morning sir ill see you again soon joe glad youre improving so rapidly let me know if i can do anything to help you  with these quiet words he bowed and left the room and when he had gone joe said in a deprecating tone  poor bob must be very unhappy about having lost my fathers money in that speculation for he advocated the plan very strongly believing it was a good investment im afraid your mistake about paying him all that money upset him dont mind if he was a little brusque sir bob west is a simple kindly man whom my father fully trusted it was he that loaned me the money to get away from here with  tell me said uncle john thoughtfully did your father receive stock in the almaquo timber tract company in exchange for his money  oh yes i have seen it in the steel cupboard replied joe  where is that  why it is the cupboard in the right wing of our house which was the captains own room it was one of his whims when he built to provide what he called his bank you may have noticed the wooden doors of a cupboard built into the stone wall sir  yes i occupy the room  behind the wooden doors are others of steel the entire cupboard is steellined near the bottom is a slidingplate which when pushed aside discovers a hidden drawera secret my father never confided to anyone but me he once told me that if his heart trouble earned him off suddenly i ought to know of the existence of this drawer so he showed me how to find it on the day after his death i took the keys which he always carried on a small chain around his neck and concealed underneath his clothing and opened the cupboard to see if i could find anything of value it is needless to say i could not discover anything that could be converted into a dollar the captain had filled the cupboard with old letters and papers of no value and with relics he had brought from foreign lands during his many voyages these last are mere rubbish but i suppose he loved them for their association in the secret drawer i found his stock in the timber company and also that of old will thompson who had doubtless left it with my father for safekeeping knowing it was now worthless i left it in the drawer  id like to see it announced uncle john  joe laughed  ive lost the keys he said  hows that my lad  why on the day of the funeral the keys disappeared i could never imagine what became of them but i did not care to look in the cupboard a second time so the loss did not matter  mr merrick seemed thoughtful  i suppose i own that cupboard now he remarked  of course said joe but without the keys it is not serviceable if you drill through the steel doors you destroy their security  true but i may decide to do that  if you do sir id like you to clear out the rubbish and papers and send them to me they are family matters and i did not intend to sell them with the place  you shall have them joe  just underneath the left end of the lower shelf you will find the sliding steel plate it slides toward the front in the drawer you will find the worthless stock and a picture of my mother id like to keep the picture  you shall joseph how are you getting on  why im a new man mr merrick and today im feeling as strong as a buffalothanks to your kind guardianship  dont overdo sir take it easy theres a young lady coming to see you today  ethel the boy exclaimed his face turning crimson  yes returned uncle john tersely youve treated that girl shamefully joseph wegg try to make proper amends  i never could understand said joe slowly why ethel refused to answer the letter i wrote her when i went away it explained everything yet  ill bet the farm against your lame shoulder she never got your letter declared uncle john she thought you left her without a word  i gave it to mcnutt to deliver after i was gone but you say shes coming today  that is her intention sir  joe said nothing more but his expressive face was smiling and eager uncle john pressed the boys hand and left him promising to call again soon  now then muttered the little millionaire as he walked down the street to beard the lion in his den  the den proved to be the hardware store and the lion none other than robert west mr merrick found the merchant seated at his desk in the otherwise deserted store and with a nod helped himself to the only other chair the little office contained  sir said he i am here to demand an explanation  of what asked west coldly  of your action in the matter of the almaquo timber tract company i believe that you falsely asserted to captain wegg and mr thompson that the timber had burned and their investment was therefore worthless the news of the disaster killed one of your confiding friends and drove the other mad but that was a consequence that i am sure you did not intend when you planned the fraud the most serious thing i can accuse you of is holding the earnings of the wegg and thompson stockand big earnings they are toofor your own benefit and defrauding the heirs of your associates of their money  west carefully balanced a penholder across his fingers and eyed it with close attention  you are a queer man mr merrick he said quietly i can only excuse your insults on the grounds of ignorance or the fact that you have been misinformed here is the newspaper report of the almaquo fire which i showed my friends the night of captain weggs sudden death he took a clipping from a drawer of the desk and handed it to uncle john who read it carefully  as a matter of fact continued west you are not cutting that portion of the almaquo tract which this fire refers to and which thompson and wegg were interested in but the north half of the tract which they had never acquired any title to  i suppose the stock will show that suggested mr merrick  of course sir  i will look it up  west smiled  you will have some trouble doing that he said  why  wegg and thompson had transferred their entire stock to me before one died and the other went mad was the quiet reply  oh i see the lie was so evident that uncle john did not try to refute it  i am rather busy mr merrick anything more sir  not today bye and bye mr west  he marched out again and climbed into his buggy to drive home the interview with bob west had made him uneasy for the merchants cold crafty nature rendered him an opponent who would stick at nothing to protect his illgotten gains uncle john had thought it an easy matter to force him to disgorge but west was the one inhabitant of millville who had no simplicity in his character he was as thoroughly imbued with worldly subtlety and cunning as if he had lived amid the grille of a city all his life and mr merrick was by no means sure of his own ability to unmask the man and force him to make restitution    chapter xix  the courtn of skim clark  by this time the summer was well advanced and the rich people at the wegg farm had ceased to be objects of wonder to the millville folk the girls were still regarded with curious looks when they wandered into the village on an errand and mr merrick and major doyle inspired a certain amount of awe but time had dulled the edge of marvelous invasion and the city people were now accepted as a matter of course  peggy mcnutt was still bothering his head over schemes to fleece the strangers in blissful ignorance of the fact that one of his neighbors was planning to get ahead of him  the widow clark was a shrewd woman she had proven this by becoming one of the merchants of millville after her husbands death the poor man had left an insurance of five hundred dollars and the little frame building wherein he had conducted a harness shop mrs clark couldnt make and repair harness so she cleared the straps and scraps and waxends out of the place painted the interior of the shop bright yellow with a blue ceiling erected some shelves and a counter and turned part of the insurance money into candy cigars stationery and a meager stock of papercovered novels  skim her small son helped her as far as he was able and between them they managed things so frugally that at the end of eight years the widow still had her five hundred dollars capital and the little store had paid her living expenses  skim was named after his uncle peter skimbley who owned a farm near watertown the widows hopeful was now a lank palefaced youth of eighteen whose most imposing features were his big hands and a long nose that ended in a sharp point the shop had ruined him for manual labor for he sat hunched up by the stove in winter and in summer hung around cottings store and listened to the gossip of the loungers he was a boy of small conversational powers but his mother declared that skim done a heap o thinkin that nobody suspected  the widow was a good gossip herself and knew all the happenings in the little town she had a habit of reading all her stock of papercovered novels before she sold them and her mind was stocked with the mass of romance and adventure she had thus absorbed what i loves moren eatn or sleepn she often said is a rattlin good love story there dont seem to be much love in real life so a poor lone crittur like me has to calm her hankerins by areadin novels  no one had been more interested in the advent of the millionaire at the wegg farm than the widow clark she had helped fix up the house for the new owner and her appreciative soul had been duly impressed by the display of wealth demonstrated by the fine furniture sent down from the city she had watched the arrival of the party and noticed with eager eyes the group of three pretty and stylishly dressed nieces who accompanied their rich uncle once or twice since the young ladies had entered her establishment to purchase pens or stationery and on such occasions the widow was quite overcome by their condescension  all this set her thinking to some purpose one day she walked over to the farm and made her way quietly to the back door by good fortune she found blind nora hemming napkins and in a mood to converse nora was an especially neat seamstress but required some one to thread her needles mary the cook had been doing this but now mrs clark sat down beside nora to hev a little talk and keep the needles supplied with thread  she learned a good deal about the nieces for old nora could not praise them enough they were always sweet and kind to her and she loved to talk about them they were all rich too or would be for their uncle had no children of his own and could leave several millions to each one when he died  an theyre so simple too said the old woman nothin cityfied ner stuckup about any on em i kin tell ye they dresses as fine as the queen o sheba tom says but they romp round just like they was borned in the country miss patsy shes learnin to milk the cow an miss beth takes care o the chickens all by herself theyre reglar girls marthy clark an money haint spiled em a bit  this report tended to waken a great ambition in the widows heart or perhaps the ambition had already taken form and this gossip confirmed and established it before she left the farm she had a chance to secretly observe the girls and they met with her full approval  at supper that evening she said to her hopeful  skim i want ye to go courtin  skim looked up in amazement  me ma he asked  yes you its time you was thinkin of gittin married  skim held his knife in his mouth a moment while he thought over this startling proposition then he removed the cutlery heaved a deep sigh and enquired  who at ma  whats that  wholl i go courtin at  skim you member in thet las book we read the angel maniacs revenge there was a sayin that fate knocks wunst on evry mans door well fates knockin on your door  skim listened with a nervous glance toward the doorway then he shook his head  all fool fancy ma he remarked dont ye go an git no rumantic notions outn books inter yer head  skim am i a fool er aint i  taint fer me ter say ma  fates knockin an if you dont open to it skim ill wash my hands o ye an ye kin jest starve to death  the boy looked disturbed  whats aggrivatin of ye then he enquired anxiously  a millionaire is come right under yer nose hes here in millville with three gals fer nieces thets all got money to squander ans bound to hev more  skim gave a low whistle  ye dont mean fer me to be courtin at them gals do ye he demanded  why not yer famblys jest as respectible as any cept thet yer uncle mell backslided after the last revival an went to a hoss race yer young an yer hansome an theres three gals waitin ready to be won by a bold wooer be bold skim take fate by the fetlock an yer fortuns made easy  skim did not reply at once he gulped down his tea and stared at the opposite wall in deep thought it wasnt such a tarnal bad notion after all and so thoroughly impressed was he with his own importance and merit that it never occurred to him he would meet with any difficulties if he chose to undertake the conquest  peggy says marrige is the mark of a fool an peggy married money too he remarked slowly  pah money mary ann cotting didnt hev but a hundred an forty dollars all told an she were an old maid an soured an squinteyed when peggy hitched up with her  i haint seen nuthin o the world yit continued skim evasively  ner ye wont nuther onless ye marry money any one o them gals could take ye to europe an back a dozen times  skim reflected still farther  courtin ought to hev some decent clothes he said i kaint set in the nabobs parlor with all thet slick furnitur in nick thornes castoff sunday suit  the cloths as good as ever was made an i cut em down myself an stitched em all over  they dont look like store clothes though objected skim  the widow sighed  taint the coat that makes the man skim  its the coat thet makes decent courtin though he maintained stubbornly gals like to see a feller dressed up it shows he means business an mounts to somethin  i give nick thorne two dollars an a packidge o terbacker fer them clotlies which the ony thing wrong about was theyd got too snug fer comfert nick said so himself but ill make a bargain with ye skim ef youll agree to give me fifty dollars after yer married ill buy ye some store clothes o sam cotting to do courtin in  fifty dollars  well ive brung ye up haint i ive worked like a nigger mindin shop say forty dollars i aint small an ef ye git one o them city gals skim forty dollars wont mean no moren a wink of an eye to ye  skim frowned then he smiled and the smile disclosed a front tooth missing  ill dream ont he said let ye know in the mornin ma but i wont court a minite mind ye nless i git store clothes    chapter xx  a lost cause  the boys musings confirmed him in the idea that his mothers scheme was entirely practical he didnt hanker much to marry being young and fairly satisfied with his present lot but opportunities like this did not often occur and it seemed his bounden duty to take advantage of it  he got the store clothes next day together with a scarlet necktie that was all made up in the latest style as sam cotting assured him and a pair of yellow kid gloves fit fer a howlin swell skim wasnt sure at first about the gloves but capitulated when sam declared they were real cityfied  in the evening he togged up with his mothers help and then walked over to the wegg farm  beth answered the knock at the door the living room was brightly lighted uncle john and the major were playing checkers in a corner and patsy was softly drumming on the piano louise had a book and beth had been engaged upon some fancywork  when the door opened skim bobbed his head and said  evenin mom ive come avisitin  beth conquered an inclination to smile  wont you come in she said sweetly  thankee i will im skimbley clark ye know down t the village ma keeps a store there  im pleased to meet you mr clark allow me to introduce to you my uncle and cousins said the girl her eyes dancing with amusement  skim acknowledged the introductions with intense gravity and then sat down upon a straightbacked chair near the piano this being the end of the room where the three girls were grouped uncle john gave a chuckle and resumed his game with the major who whispered that he would give a dollar for an oil painting of mr clarkif it couldnt be had for less  louise laid down her book and regarded the visitor wonderingly patsy scented fun and drew a chair nearer the group beth resumed her embroidery with a demure smile that made skim decide at once that he picked the pretty one  indeed the decision did justice to his discretion beth de graf was a rarely beautiful girl and quite outshone her cousins in this respect louise might be attractive and patsy fascinating but beth was the real beauty of the trio and the most charming trait in her character was her unconsciousness that she excelled in good looks  so skim stared hard at beth and answered the preliminary remarks addressed to him by patsy and louise in a perfunctory manner  wont you take off your gloves asked louise soberly its so warm this evening you know  the boy looked at his hands  its sech a tarnal job to git em on agin he replied  dont put them on then advised patsy here in the country we are allowed to dispense with much unnecessary social etiquette  air ye then off they come i aint much stuck on gloves myself but ma she lowed that a feller goin courtin orter look like a sport  a chorus of wild laughter which greeted this speech had the effect of making skim stare at the girls indignantly he couldnt find anything funny in his remark but there they sat facing him and uttering hysterical peals of merriment until the tears ran down their cheeks  silently and with caution he removed the yellow gloves from his hands and so gave the foolish creatures a chance to laugh out their blamed giggle  but they were watching him and saw that he was disconcerted they had no mind to ruin the enjoyment in store for them by offending their guest so they soon resumed a fitting gravity and began to assist the youth to forget their rudeness  may i ask said patsy very graciously which one of us you intend to favor with your attentions  i aint much used to sech things he replied looking down at his big hands and growing a little redfaced praps i hadnt orter tell before the rest o ye  oh yes do tell pleaded louise were so anxious to know  i dont spose its right clever to pick an choose when yere all by said skim regaining confidence but ma she lowed thet with three gals handy i orter git one on em to say the least  if you got more than one remarked beth calmly it would be illegal  oh ones enough said skim with a grin peggy says its too many an a feller oughtnt to take his gal outn a grabbag  i should think not indeed returned patsy but here are three of us openly displayed and unless you turn us all down as unworthy it will be necessary for you to make a choice  what foolishness are you girls up to now demanded uncle john catching a stray word from the other corner while engaged in a desperate struggle with the major  this is a time for you to keep quiet uncle retorted patsy merrily weve got important things to consider that are none of your affairs whatever  skim reflected that he didnt want this one except as a last resort she was too bossy  when i started out he said i jest come acourtin as any feller might do thet wasnt much acquainted but ef ive got to settle down to one o ye  he hesitated  oh you must really take one at a time you know asserted louise its the only proper way  then ill start on thet darkeyed one thets a sewin he said slowly  beth looked up from her work and smiled  go ahead mr clark she said encouragingly my name is beth had you forgotten it  call me skim he said gently  very well skimnow look here patsy doyle if youre going to sit there and giggle youll spoil everything mr clark wants to court and its getting late  praps ive went fur enough fer tonight remarked skim uneasily next time theyll leave us alone an then  oh dont postpone it please begged beth giving the boy a demure glance from her soft brown eyes and dont mind my cousins i dont  these things kaint be hurried he said si merkle courted three weeks afore he popped he tol me so  then he was a very foolish man declared patsy positively just look at beth shes dying to have you speak out whats the use of waiting when she knows why you are here  by this time skim had been flattered to the extent of destroying any stray sense he might ever have possessed his utter ignorance of girls and their ways may have been partly responsible for his idiocy or his mothers conviction that all that was necessary was for him to declare himself in order to be accepted had misled him and induced him to abandon any native diffidence he might have had anyway the boy fell into the snare set by the mischievous young ladies without a suspicion of his impending fate  miss beth said he ef yer willin ill marry ye any time ye say i agreed t help dick pearson with the harvestin but ill try to git ned long to take my place an it dont matter much nohow  but i couldnt have you break an engagement cried beth hastily  why not  oh it wouldnt be right at all mr pearson would never forgive me she asserted  cant ye  no not before harvest skim i couldnt think of it  but arterward  no ive resolved never to marry after harvest so as youre engaged and i dont approve of breaking engagements i must refuse your proposition entirely  skim looked surprised then perplexed then annoyed  praps i didnt pop jest right he murmured growing red again  you popped beautifully declared patsy but beth is very peculiar and set in her ways im afraid she wouldnt make you a good wife anyhow  then praps the gal in blue  no said louise i have the same prejudices as my cousin if you hadnt been engaged for the harvest i might have listened to you but that settles the matter definitely as far as i am concerned  skim sighed  mall be mad as a hornet ef i dont get any of ye he remarked sadly shes paid sam cotting fer this courtin suit an he wont take back the gloves on no count arter theyve been wore an thetll set ma crazy miss patsy ef yo think ye could  im sure i couldnt said patsy promptly im awfully sorry to break your heart skim dear and ruin your future life and make you misanthropic and cynical and spoil your mothers investment and make her mad as a hornet all this grieves me terribly but ill recover from it if youll only give me time and i hope youll find a wife that will be more congenial than i could ever be  skim didnt understand all these words but the general tenor of the speech was convincing and filled him with dismay  rich gals is tarnal skeerce in these parts he said regretfully  then they gave way again and so lusty was the merriment that uncle john and the major abandoned their game and came across the room to discover the source of all this amusement  whats up young women asked their uncle glancing from their laughing faces to the lowering sullen one of the boy who had only now begun to suspect that he was being poked fun at  oh uncle cried patsy youve no idea how near you have been to losing us we have each had an offer of marriage within the last half hour  dear me ejaculated uncle john  it shows the young mans intelligence and good taste said the major much amused but is it a mormon ye are sir to want all three directing a keen glance at skim  naw taint he returned wholly disgusted with the outcome of his suit all three got ast cause none of ems got sense enough t know a good thing when they seen it  but i do said the major stoutly and i maintain that youre a good thing and always will be i hope sir youll call round and see me in baltimore next year ill not be there but ye can leave your card just the same  please call again sir added uncle john about octoberjust before snow flies  the boy got up  i dont keer none he said defiantly its all mas fault gittin me laughed at an she wont hear the last of it in a hurry nuther  be gentle with her skim suggested beth softly remember she has to face the world with you by her side  having no retort for this raillery which he felt rather than understood skim seized his hat and fled then patsy wiped the tears from her eyes and said  wasnt it grand girls i havent had so much fun since i was born    chapter xxi  the trap is set  uncle john was forced to acknowledge to his nieces that his boast to unmask bob west within three days was mere blustering if he accomplished anything in three weeks he would consider himself fortunate but he had no wish to conceal anything from the girls so he told them frankly of his interview with the hardware merchant and also what joe wegg had said about the stock in the locked cupboard they were of course greatly interested in this new phase of the matter and canvassed it long and eagerly  the man is lying of course said patsy for captain wegg and poor mr thompson could not transfer their stock to west after that fatal night when he brought to them the news of the fire  i believe the stock is still in this cupboard declared uncle john  unless west stole the keys and has taken it away suggested louise  im sure he did not know about the secret drawer said her uncle probably he stole the keys and searched the cupboard if he had found the stock he would have left the keys which would then be of no further use to him as he did not find the stock certificates he carried the keys away that he might search again at his leisure and theyve never yet been returned  why john yere possessed of the true detective instinct the major remarked admiringly your reasoning is at once clever and unassailable  i wonder mused beth if we could tempt mr west to come again to search the cupboard  he will scarcely venture to do that while we are here replied uncle john  i said tempt him uncle  and what did you mean by that expression beth  ill think it over and tell you later she returned quietly                                       ethel thompson would have shown joe wegg how much she resented his leaving millville without a word to her had she not learned from mr merrick the boys sad condition knowing her old friend was ill she determined to ignore the past and go to him at once and uncle john knew very well there would be explanations to smooth away all the former misunderstandings  joe was now aware of the fact that his letter to ethel had never reached its destination so as soon as the girl had arrived and the first rather formal greetings were over he sent kate kebble to mcnutts to ask the agent to come over to the hotel at once  the girl returned alone  peggy says as he cant come she announced  why not asked joe  says hes jest painted his off foot blue an striped it with red an it haint dried yit  go back said joe firmly tell peggy hes in trouble and its likely to cost him more than a new coat of paint for his foot if he doesnt come here at once  kate went back and in due time the stump of mcnutts foot was heard on the stairs he entered the room looking worried and suspicious and the stern faces of ethel and joe did not reassure him by any means but he tried to disarm the pending accusation with his usual brazen impertinence  nice time ter send fer me this is joe he grumbled its gittin so a feller cant even paint his foot in peace an quiet  peggy said joe when i went away three years ago i gave you a letter for miss ethel what did you do with it  peggys bulging eyes stared at his blue foot which he turned first one side and then the other to examine the red stripes  its this way joe he replied there want no postige stamp on the letter an sam cotting said it couldnt be posted no way thout a stamp  it wasnt to be sent through the postoffice said the boy i gave you a quarter to deliver it in person to miss ethel  did ye joe did ye  of course i did  curous said mcnutt leaning over to touch the foot cautiously with one finger to see if the paint was dry  well sir  well joe theres no use gittin mad bout it thet blamed quarter ye giv me rolled down a crack in the stoop an got lost sure got lost as easy as anything  well what was that to me  oh i aint blamin you said peggy but twere a good deal to me i kin tell ye a whole quarter lost  why didnt you take up a board and get it again  oh i did said mcnutt cheerfully i did joe but the money was all black an tarnished like by thet time an didnt look at all like silver sam he wouldnt take it at the store so my ol woman she lowed shed polish it up a bit ye know how sort o vigrous she is joe she polished that blamed quarter the same way she jaws an sweeps she polished it til she rubbed both sides smooth as glass an then sam wouldnt take it nuther n said it wasnt money any more so i drilled two holes in it an sewed it on my pants fer a spender buttn  but why didnt you deliver the letter  did ye spect id tramp way t thompsons crossing fer nuthin  i gave you a quarter  an it turned out to be ony a spender buttn be reasonble joe  where is the letter  taint a letter no more its ony ol fambly papers by this time three years is  where is it by thunder peggy if you dont answer me ill put you in jail for breach of trust  yeve changed joe sadly ye aint no more like  where is it  behind the lookinglass in my settnroom  go and get it immediately sir  ef i hev to cross thet dusty road twict more ill hev to paint all over agin an thets a fact  ethel said joe with the calmness of despair youll have to telephone over to the junction and ask them to send a constable here at once  never mind cried mcnutt jumping up hastily ill go paint dont cost much nohow  he stumped away but on his return preferred to let kate carry the soiled torn envelope up to the young folks the letter had palpably been tampered with it had been opened and doubtless read and the flap clumsily glued down again  but ethel had it now and even after three years her sweet eyes dimmed as she read the tender words that joe had written because he lacked the courage to speak them my one great ambition is to win a home for us dear he had declared and with this before her eyes ethel reproached herself for ever doubting his love or loyalty  when she rode her pony over to the wegg farm next day ethels bright face was wreathed with smiles she told her girl friends that she and joe had had a good talk together and understood each other better than ever before the nieces did not tell her of their newly conceived hopes that the young couple would presently possess enough money to render their future comfortable because there were so many chances that bob west might win the little game being played but at this moment ethel did not need worldly wealth to make her heart light and happy for she had regained her childhoods friend and his injuries only rendered the boy the more interesting and companionable  meantime uncle john had been busily thinking it annoyed him to be so composedly defied by a rascally country merchant and he resolved if he must fight to fight with all his might  so he wired to his agent in new york the following words  what part of the almaquo timber tract burned in forest fire three years ago  the answer he received made him give a satisfied grunt  no forest fires near almaquo three years ago almadona seventy miles north burned at that time and newspaper reports confounded the names  very good exclaimed uncle john ive got the rascal now  he issued instructions to the lumber company to make no further payments of royalties to robert west until otherwise advised and this had the effect of bringing west to the farm white with rage  what do you mean by this action mr merrick he demanded  weve been paying you money that does not belong to you for three years sir was the reply in a few days when my investigations are complete i will give you the option of being arrested for embezzlement of funds belonging to joseph wegg and the thompsons or restoring to them every penny of their money  west stared  you are carrying matters with a high hand sir he sneered  oh no i am acting very leniently said uncle john  neither joe nor the thompsons own a dollars interest in the almaquo property it is all mine and mine alone  then produce the stock and prove it retorted mr merrick triumphantly  at that moment louise interrupted the interview by entering the room suddenly  oh uncle said she will you join us in a picnic to the falls tomorrow afternoon we are all going  then i wont be left behind he replied smiling upon her  we shall take even thomas and nora and come home late in the evening by moonlight  that suits me my dear said he  west stood silent and scowling but as the girl tripped away she saw him raise his eyes and glance slyly toward the cupboard for they were in the right wing room  mr merrick he resumed in a harsh voice i warn you that if your company holds up the payment of my royalties it will break the contract and i will forbid them to cut another tree you are doubtless aware that there are a dozen firms willing to take your place and pay me higher royalties  act as you please sir said uncle john indifferently i believe you are face to face with ruin and it wont matter much what you do  west went away more quietly than he had come and the girls exclaimed delightedly  the trap is set uncle  i think so myself he rejoined that picnic was a happy thought louise  early the next afternoon they started out with hammocks and baskets and all the paraphernalia of a picnic party the three girls nora and uncle john squeezed themselves into the surrey while the major and old hucks rode after them in the ancient buggy with dan moaning and groaning every step he took but the old horse moved more briskly when following joe and hucks could get more speed out of him than anyone else so he did not lag much behind  the procession entered millville where a brief stop was made at the store and then made its exit by the north road west was standing in the door of his hardware store quietly observing them when they disappeared in the grove he locked the door of his establishment and sauntered in the direction of the pearson farm no one noticing him except peggy mcnutt who was disappointed because he had intended to go over presently and buy a paper of tacks  when the village was left behind uncle john drove swiftly along following the curve of the lake until he reached a primitive lane that he had discovered formed a short cut directly back to the wegg farm old thomas was amazed by this queer action on the part of the picnic party but aside from blind nora who had no idea where they were the others seemed full of repressed eagerness and in no way surprised  the lane proved very rocky though and they were obliged to jolt slowly over the big cobble stones so beth and patsy leaped out of the surrey and the former called out  we will run through the forest uncle and get home as soon as you do  be careful not to show yourselves then he replied remember our plans  we will and dont forget to tie the horses in the thicket and warn thomas and nora to keep quiet until we come for them said patsy  ill attend to all that dear remarked louise composedly but if you girls are determined to walk you must hurry along or you will keep us waiting  the nieces had explored every path in the neighborhood by this time so beth and patsy were quite at home in the pine forest the horses started up again and after struggling along another quarter of a mile a wheel of the surrey dished between two stones and with a bump the axle struck the ground and the journey was promptly arrested  what shall we do now asked uncle john much annoyed as the party alighted to examine the wreck  send thomas back to the village for another wheel suggested the major  not today cried louise we mustnt appear in the village again this afternoon on any account it is absolutely necessary we should keep out of sight  true agreed uncle john promptly thomas and nora must picnic here all by themselves until nearly midnight then they may drive the buggy home leading daniel behind them it will be time enough tomorrow to get a new buggy wheel and the broken surrey wont be in anybodys way until we send for it  if old hucks thought they had all gone crazy that day he was seemingly justified in the suspicion for his master left the baskets of good things to be consumed by himself and nora and started to walk to the farm the major and louise accompanying him  we mustnt loiter said the girl for while west may wait until darkness falls to visit the farm he is equally liable to arrive at any time this afternoon he has seen us all depart and believes the house deserted  but they were obliged to keep to the lane where walking was difficult and meantime patsy and beth were tripping easily along their woodland paths and making much better progress    chapter xxii  caught  were early said beth as they came to the edge of the woods and sighted the farm house but that is better than being late  then she stopped suddenly with a low cry and pointed to the right wing which directly faced them bob west turned the corner of the house tried the door of uncle johns room and then walked to one of the french windows the sash was not fastened so he deliberately opened it and stepped inside  what shall we do gasped patsy clasping her hands excitedly  beth was always cool in an emergency  you creep up to the window dear and wait till you hear me open the inside door said she ill run through the house and enter from the livingroom the key is under the mat you know  but what can we do oughtnt we to wait until uncle john and father come patsy asked in a trembling voice  of course not west might rob the cupboard and be gone by that time weve got to act promptly patsy so dont be afraid  without further words beth ran around the back of the house and disappeared while patsy trying to control the beating of her heart stole softly over the lawn to the open window of uncle johns room  she could not help looking in at the risk of discovery bob westtall lean and composed as everwas standing beside the cupboard the doors of which were wide open the outer doors were of wood panelled and carved the inner ones were plates of heavy steel and in the lock that secured these latter doors were the keys that had so long been missing both were attached to a slender silver chain  as patsy peered in at the man west was engaged in deliberately examining packet after packet of papers evidently striving to find the missing stock certificates he was in no hurry believing he would have the house to himself for several hours so he tumbled captain weggs souvenirs of foreign lands in a heap on the floor beside him thrusting his hand into every corner of the cupboard in order that the search might be thorough he had once before examined the place in vain this time he intended to succeed  presently west drew a cigar from his pocket lighted it and was about to throw the match upon the floor when the thought that it might later betray his presence made him pause and then walk to the open window as he approached patsy became panicstricken and well knowing that she ought to run or hide stood rooted to the spot gazing half appealingly and half defiantly into the startled eyes of the man who suddenly confronted her  so for a moment they stood motionless west was thinking rapidly by some error be had miscounted the picnic party and this girl had been left at home she had discovered his intrusion had seen him at the cupboard and would report the matter to john merrick this being the case it would do him no good to retreat without accomplishing his purpose if once he secured the stock certificates he could afford to laugh at his accusers and secure them he must while he had the opportunity  so clearly did these thoughts follow one another that wests hesitation seemed only momentary without a word to the girl he tossed the match upon the grass calmly turned his back and started for the cupboard again  but here a new surprise awaited him brief as had been his absence another girl had entered the room beth opened the door even as west turned toward the window and taking in the situation at a glance she tiptoed swiftly to the cupboard withdrew the keys from the lock and dropped them noiselessly into a widemouthed vase that stood on the table and was partially filled with flowers the next instant west turned and saw her but she smiled at him triumphantly good afternoon sir said the girl sweetly can i do anything to assist you  west uttered an impatient exclamation and regarded beth savagely  is the house full of girls he demanded  oh no patsy and i are quite alone she replied with a laugh come in patsy dear and help me to entertain our guest she added  patsy came through the window and stood beside her cousin the man stared at them bit his lip and then turned again to the cupboard if he noted the absence of the keys he did not remark upon the fact but with hurried yet thorough examination began anew to turn over the bundles of papers  beth sat down and watched him but patsy remained standing behind her chair west emptied all the shelves and then after a pause took out his pocket knife and began tapping with its end the steel sides of the cupboard there was no doubt he suspected the existence of a secret aperture and beth began to feel uneasy  slowly the man worked his way downward from shelf to shelf and began to sound the bottom plates wholly oblivious of the fascinated gaze of the two young girls then a sudden gruff ejaculation startled them all and west swung around to find a new group of watchers outside the window in the foreground appeared the stern face of john merrick  the scene was intensely dramatic to all but the singular man who had been battling to retain a fortune west knew in an instant that his attempt to secure the certificates was a failure he turned from the cupboard dusted his hands and nodded gravely to the last arrivals  come in mr merrick said he seating himself in a chair and removing his hat which he had been wearing i owe you an apology for intruding upon your premises in your absence  uncle john strode into the room angry and indignant at the fellows cool impertinence the major and louise followed and all eyes centered upon the face of bob west  the contents of this cupboard remarked the hardware merchant calmly belong to the estate of captain wegg and can scarcely be claimed by you because you have purchased the house you falsely accused me the other day sir and i have been searching for proof that the almaquo timber tract stock is entirely my property  have you found such proof inquired mr merrick  not yet  and you say the stock was all issued to you  west hesitated  it was all transferred to me by captain wegg and will thompson  does the transfer appear upon the stock itself  of course sir  in that case said uncle john i shall be obliged to ask your pardon but the fact can be easily proved  he walked to the open cupboard felt for the slide joe had described to him and drew it forward a small drawer was behind the orifice and from this mr merrick drew a packet of papers  west gave a start and half arose then he settled back into his chair again  hm this appears to be the stock in question said uncle john he drew a chair to the table unfolded the documents and examined them with deliberate care  the nieces watched his face curiously mr merrick first frowned then turned red and finally a stern determined look settled upon his rugged features  take your stock mr west he said tossing it toward the man and try to forgive us for making fools of ourselves    chapter xxiii  mr west explains  a cry of amazed protest burst from the girls the major whistled softly and walked to the window  i find the stock properly transferred continued uncle john grimly conscious that he was as thoroughly disappointed as the girls it is signed by both wegg and thompson and witnessed in the presence of a notary i congratulate you mr west you have acquired a fortune  but not recently replied the hardware dealer enjoying the confusion of his recent opponents i have owned this stock for more than three years and you will see by the amount endorsed upon it that i paid a liberal price for it under the circumstances  uncle john gave a start and a shrewd look  of course you did said he on paper  i have records to prove that both captain wegg and will thompson received their money said west quietly i see it is hard for you to abandon the idea that i am a rogue  there could be no adequate reply to this so for a time all sat in moody silence but the thoughts of some were busy  i would like mr west to explain what became of the money he paid for this stock said louise adding that is if he will be so courteous  west did not answer for a moment then he said with a gesture of indifference  i am willing to tell all i know but you people must admit that the annoyances you have caused me during the past fortnight to say nothing of the gratuitous insults heaped upon my head render me little inclined to favor you  you are quite justified in feeling as you do replied uncle john meekly i have been an ass west but circumstances warranted me in suspecting you and even joseph wegg did not know that the almaquo stock had been transferred to you he merely glanced at it at the time of his fathers death without noticing the endorsement and thought the fire had rendered it worthless but if you then owned the stock why was it not in your possession  that was due to my carelessness was the reply the only notary around here is at hookers falls and mr thompson offered to have him come to captain weggs residence and witness the transfer as my presence was not necessary for this and i had full confidence in my friends integrity i paid them their money which they were eager to secure at once and said i would call in a few days for the stock i did call and was told the notary had been here and the transfer had been legally made wegg said he would get the stock from the cupboard and hand it to me but we both forgot it at that time after his death i could not find it for it was in the secret drawer  another thing sir said uncle john if neither wegg nor thompson was then interested in the almaquo property why did the news of its destruction by fire shock them so greatly that the result was captain weggs death  i see it will be necessary for me to explain to you more fully returned west with a thoughtful look it is evident mr merrick from your questions that some of these occurrences seem suspicious to a stranger and perhaps you are not so much to be blamed as in my annoyance and indignation i have imagined  i would like the matter cleared up for the sake of ethel and joe said mr merrick simply  and so would i declared the hardware dealer you must know sir that will thompson was the one who first led captain wegg into investing his money i think the captain did it merely to please will for at that time he had become so indifferent to worldly affairs that he took no interest in anything beyond a mild wish to provide for his sons future but thompson was erratic in judgment so wegg used to bring their matters to me to decide upon i always advised them as honestly as i was able at the time i secured an option on the almaquo tract and wanted them to join me will thompson had found another lot of timber but located in an outoftheway corner which he urged the captain to join him in buying wegg brought the matter to me as usual and i pointed out that my proposed contract with the piercelane lumber company would assure our making a handsome profit at almaquo while thompson had no one in view to cut the other tract indeed it was far away from any railroad wegg saw the force of my argument and insisted that thompson abandon his idea and accept my proposition together we bought the property having formed a stock company and the contract for cutting the timber was also secured things were looking bright for us and royalty payments would soon be coming in  then to my amazement wegg came to me and wanted to sell out their interests he said thompson had always been dissatisfied because they had not bought the other tract of timber and that the worry and disappointment was affecting his friends mind he was personally satisfied that my investment was the best but in order to sooth old will and prevent his mind from giving way wegg wanted to withdraw and purchase the other tract  i knew there was a fortune in almaquo so i went to new york and mortgaged all i possessed discounting a lot of notes given me by farmers in payment for machinery and finally borrowing at a high rate of interest the rest of the money i needed in other words i risked all my fortune on almaquo and brought the money home to pay wegg and thompson for their interest the moment they received the payment they invested it in the bogue tract  hold on cried uncle john what tract did you say  the bogue timber tract sir it lies  i know where it lies our company has been a whole year trying to find out who owned it  wegg and thompson bought it i was angry at the time because their withdrawal had driven me into a tight corner to protect my investment and i told them they would bitterly regret their action i think wegg agreed with me but will thompson was still stubborn  then came the news of the fire at almaquo it was a false report i afterward learned but at that time i believed the newspapers and the blow almost deprived me of reason in my excitement i rushed over to weggs farm and found the two men together whereupon i told them i was ruined  the news affected them powerfully because they had just saved themselves from a like ruin they thought wegg was also a sympathetic man in spite of his reserve his old heart trouble suddenly came upon him aggravated by the excitement of the hour and he died with scarcely a moan thompson whose reason was tottering long before this became violently insane at witnessing his friends death and has never since recovered that is all i am able to tell you sir  the bogue tract said uncle john slowly is worth far more than the almaquo old will thompson was sane enough when insisting on that investment but where is the stock or deed to show they bought that property  i do not know sir i only know they told me they had effected the purchase  pardon me said the major have you not been through this cupboard before  west looked at him with a frown  yes in a search for my own stock he said but i found neither that nor any deed to the bogue property i am not a thief major doyle  you stole the keys though said louise pointedly  i did not even do that said west on the day of the funeral joe carelessly left them lying upon a table so i slipped them into my pocket when i thought of them again joe had gone away and i did not know his address i came over and searched the cupboard unsuccessfully but it was not a matter of great importance at that time if the stock was mislaid since there was no one to contest my ownership of it it was only after mr merrick accused me of robbing my old friends and ordered my payments stopped that i realized it was important to me to prove my ownership that is why i came here today  again a silence fell upon the group said uncle john finally  if the deed to the bogue tract can be found joe and ethel will be rich i wonder what became of the paper  no one answered for here was another mystery    chapter xxiv  peggy has revenge  joe wegg made a rapid recovery his strength returning under the influence of pleasant surroundings and frequent visits from ethel and uncle johns three nieces not a word was hinted to either the invalid or the school teacher regarding the inquiries mr merrick was making about the deed to the bogue timber lands which if found would make the young couple independent joe was planning to exploit a new patent as soon as he could earn enough to get it introduced and ethel exhibited a sublime confidence in the boys ability that rendered all question of money insignificant  joes sudden appearance in the land of his birth and his generally smashed up condition were a nine days wonder in millville the gossips wanted to know all the whys and wherefores but the boy kept his room in the hotel or only walked out when accompanied by ethel or one of the three nieces sometimes they took him to ride as he grew better and the fact that joe were hand an glove wi the nabobs lent him a distinction he had never before possessed  mcnutt always busy over somebody elses affairs was very curious to know what had caused the accident joe had suffered notwithstanding the little affair of the letter in which he had not appeared with especial credit peggy made an effort to interview the young man that resulted in his complete discomfiture but that did not deter him from indulging in various vivid speculations about joe wegg which the simple villagers listened to with attention for one thing he confided to the boys at the store that in his opinion the man who had murdered capn wegg had tried to murder his son also and it wasnt likely joe could manage to escape him a second time another tale evolved from peggys fertile imagination was that joe being about to starve to death in the city had turned burglar and been shot in the arm in an attempt at housebreaking  wouldnt be sprised said the agent in an awed voice ef the plice was on his track now praps theres a reward offered boys lets keep an eye on him  he waylaid the nieces once or twice and tried to secure from them a verification of his somber suspicions which they mischievously fostered  the girls found him a source of much amusement and relieved their own disappointment at finding the wegg mystery a pricked bubble by getting mcnutt excited over many sly suggestions of hidden crimes they knew he was harmless for even his neighbors needed proof of any assertion he made moreover the investigation uncle john was making would soon set matters right so the young ladies did not hesitate to have fun at the little agents expense  one of mcnutts numerous occupations was raising a patch of watermelons each year on the lot back of the house these he had fostered with great care since the plants had first sprouted through the soil and in these late august days two or three hundreds of fine big melons were just getting ripe he showed the patch with much pride one day to the nieces saying  heres the most extryfine mellingpatch in this county ef i do say it myself dan brayley he thinks he kin raise mellings but the ol fool aint got a circumstance to this aint they beauties  it seems to me observed patsy gravely that brayleys are just as good we passed his place this morning and wondered how he could raise such enormous melons  normous brayleys  im sure they are finer than these said beth  well ill be jiggered peggys eyes stared as they had never stared before dan brayley hes a miserble ol skinflint thet man couldnt raise decent mellings ef he tried  what do you charge for melons mr mcnutt inquired louise  charge whyerfifty cents a piece is my price to nabobs an dirt cheap at that  that is too much declared patsy mr brayley says he will sell his melons for fifteen cents each  him fifteen cents gasped peggy greatly disappointed say brayleys a disturbin element in these parts he oughter go to jail fer asking fifteen cents fer them mean little mellings o hisn  they seem as large as yours murmured louise  but they aint an brayleys a cheat an a rascal while a honester man ner me dont breathe nobody likes brayley round millville why ony las winter he called me a meddlerin publican said as i shot off my mouth too much me  how impolite  but thats dan brayley my mellings at fifty cents is better n hisn at fifteen  tell me said patsy with a smile did you ever rob a melonpatch mr mcnutt  me i dont hev to i grow em  but the ones you grow are worth fifty cents each are they not  sure mine is  then every time you eat one of your own melons you eat fifty cents if you were eating one of mr brayleys melons you would only eat fifteen cents  and it would be brayleys fifteen cents too added beth quickly  peggy turned his protruding eyes from one to the other and a smile slowly spread over his features  by jinks lets rob brayleys mellingpatch he cried  all right well help you answered patsy readily  oh my dear remonstrated louise not understanding  it will be such fun replied her cousin with eyes dancing merrily boys always rob melonpatches so i dont see why girls shouldnt when shall we do it mr mcnutt  there aint any moon jest now an the nights is dark as blazes lets go ternight  its a bargain declared patsy we will come for you in the surrey at ten oclock and all drive together to the back of brayleys yard and take all the melons we want  itll serve him right said peggy delightedly ol dan called me a meddler onctin publican im bound t git even with him  dont betray us sir pleaded beth  i cant replied mcnutt frankly im in it myself an well jest find out what his blametwisted ol fifteencent mellings is like  patsy was overjoyed at the success of her plot which she had conceived on the spur of the moment as most clever plots are conceived on the way home she confided to her cousins a method of securing revenge upon the agent for selling them the three copies of the lives of the saints  mcnutt wants to get even with brayley he says and we want to get even with mcnutt i think our chances are best dont you she asked  and they decided to join the conspiracy  there was some difficulty escaping from uncle john and the major that night but patsy got them interested in a game of chess that was likely to last some hours while beth stole to the barn and harnessed joe to the surrey soon the others slipped out and joined her and with patsy and beth on the front seat and louise inside the canopy they drove slowly away until the sound of the horses feet on the stones was no longer likely to betray them  mcnutt was waiting for them when they quietly drew up before his house the village was dark and silent for its inhabitants retired early to bed by good fortune the sky was overcast with heavy clouds and not even the glimmer of a star relieved the gloom  they put mcnutt on the back seat with louise cautioned him to be quiet and then drove away dan brayleys place was two miles distant but in answer to peggys earnest inquiry if she knew the way beth declared she could find it blindfolded in a few moments louise had engaged the agent in a spirited discussion of the absorbing mystery and so occupied his attention that he paid no heed to the direction they had taken the back seat was hemmed in by side curtains and the canopy so it would be no wonder if he lost all sense of direction even had not the remarks of the girl at his side completely absorbed him  beth drove slowly down the main street up a lane back by the lake road and along the street again and this programme was repeated several times until she thought a sufficient distance had been covered to convince the agent they had arrived at brayleys they way was pitch dark but the horse was sensible enough to keep in the middle of the road so they met with no accident more than to jolt over a stone now and then  but now the most difficult part of the enterprise lay before them the girls turned down the lane back of the main street and bumped over the ruts until they thought they had arrived at a spot opposite mcnutts own melon patch  whats wrong asked the agent as they suddenly stopped with a jerk  this ought to be brayleys said beth but its so dark im not certain just where we are  mcnutt thrust his head out and peered into the blackness  drive along a little he whispered  the girl obeyed  stopstop said he a moment later i think thats them contwisted fifteencent mellingsover there  they all got out and beth tied the horse to the fence peggy climbed over and at once whispered  come on its them all right  through the drifting clouds there was just enough light to enable them to perceive the dark forms of the melons lying side by side upon their vines the agent took out his big clasp knife and recklessly slashed one of them open  greens grass he grumbled and slashed another  patsy giggled and the others felt a sudden irresistible impulse to join her  keep still cautioned mcnutt wouldnt ol dan be jest ravin ef he knew this sayheres a ripe one hev a slice  they all felt for the slices he offered and ate the fruit without being able to see it but it really tasted delicious  as the girls feasted they heard a crunching sound and inquired in low voices what it was  mcnutt was stumping over the patch and plumping his wooden foot into every melon he could find smashing them wantonly against the ground the discovery filled them with horror they had thought inducing the agent to rob his own patch of a few melons while under the delusion that they belonged to his enemy brayley a bit of harmless fun but here was the vindictive fellow actually destroying his own property by the wholesale  oh dont please dont mr mcnutt pleaded patsy in frightened accents  yes i will declared the agent stubbornly ill git even with dan brayley fer once in my life ef i never do another thing by gum  but its wrongits wicked protested beth  cant help it this is my chance an ill make them bum fifteencent mellings look like a penny a piece afore i gits done with em  never mind girls whispered louise its the law of retribution poor peggy will be sorry for this tomorrow  the man had not the faintest suspicion where he was he knew his own melon patch well enough having worked in it at times all the summer but he had never climbed over the fence and approached it from the rear before so it took on a new aspect to him from this point of view and moreover the night was dark enough to deceive anybody  if he came across an especially big melon mcnutt would lug it to the carriage and dump it in and so angry and energetic was the little man that in a brief space the melon patch was a scene of awful devastation and the surrey contained all the fruit that survived the massacre  beth unhitched the horse and they all took their places in the carriage again having some difficulty to find places for their feet on account of the cargo of melons mcnutt was stowed away inside with louise and they drove away up the lane the agent was jubilant and triumphant and chuckled in gleeful tones that thrilled the girls with remorse as they remembered the annihilation of mcnutts cherished melons  ol dan usully has a dorg said peggy between his fits of laughter but i guess he had him chained up ternight  im not positively sure that was brayleys place remarked beth its so very dark  oh it were brayleys all right mcnutt retorted i could tell by the secondclass taste o them mellings an their measley little size them things aint a circumstance to the kind i raise  are you sure asked louise  sures shootln guess im a jedge o mellings when i sees em  no one could see tonight said beth  feelins jest the same declared the little man confidently  after wandering around a sufficient length of time to allay suspicion beth finally drew up before mcnutts house again  ill jest take my share o them mellings said peggy as he alighted they aint much count bein brayleys but itll save me an the ol woman from eatin our own or perhaps i kin sell em to sam cotting  he took rather more than his share of the spoils but the girls had no voice to object they were by this time so convulsed with suppressed merriment that they had hard work not to shriek aloud their laughter for in spite of the tragic revelations the morrow would bring forth the situation was so undeniably ridiculous that they could not resist its humor  ive had a heap o fun whispered mcnutt good night gals ef ye didnt belong to thet gumtwisted nabob yed be some punkins  thank you mr mcnutt good night  and it was not until well on their journey to the farm that the girls finally dared to abandon further restraint then indeed they made the grim black hills of the plateau resound to the peals of their merry laughter    chapter xxv  good news at last  it was on the morning following this adventure that uncle john received a bulky envelope from the city containing the result of the investigation he had ordered regarding the ownership of the bogue tract of pine forest it appeared that the company in which he was so largely interested had found the tract very valuable and had been seeking for the owners in order to purchase it or lease the right to cut the timber but although they had traced it through the hands of several successive owners the present holders were all unknown to them until mr merricks information had furnished them with a clue a year ago the company had paid up the back taxestwo years overduein order to establish a claim to the property and now they easily succeeded in finding the record of the deed from a certain charles walton to jonas wegg and william thompson the deed itself could not be found but uncle john considered the county record a sufficient claim to entitle the young folks to the property unless the ownership should be contested by others which was not likely  uncle john invited ethel and joe to dine with him that evening and mary was told the occasion merited the best menu she could provide the young folks arrived without any idea of receiving more than a good dinner and the pleasure of mingling with the cordial kindly household at the farm but the general air of hilarity and good fellowship pervading the family circle this evening inspired the guests with like enthusiasm and no party could be merrier than the one that did full justice to marys superior cookery  one of the last courses consisted of iced watermelon and when it appeared the three girls eyed one another guiltily and then made frantic attempts to suppress their laughter which was unseemly because no one but themselves understood the joke but all else was speedily forgotten in the interest of the coming ceremony which mr merrick had carefully planned and prepared  the company was invited to assemble in the room comprising the spacious right wing and when all were seated the little gentleman coughed to clear his throat and straightway began his preamble  he recited the manner in which captain wegg and will thompson having money to invest were led into an enterprise which bob west had proposed but finally preferred another venture and so withdrew their money altogether from the almaquo tract  this statement caused both joe and ethel to stare hard but they said nothing  your grandfather ethel continued the narrator was much impressed by the value of another timber tract although where he got his information concerning it i have been unable to discover this piece of property called the bogue tract was purchased by wegg and thompson with the money they withdrew from almaquo and still stands in their name  then he recounted quite frankly his unjust suspicions of the hardware dealer and told of the interview in which the full details of this transaction were disclosed by west as well as the truth relating to the death of captain wegg and the sudden insanity and paralysis of old will thompson  joe could corroborate this last and now understood why thompson had cried out that wests good news had killed his father he meant of course their narrow escape from being involved in wests supposed ruin for at that time no one knew the report of the fire was false  finally these matters being cleared up uncle john declared that the piercelane lumber company was willing to contract to cut the timber on the bogue property or would pay a lump sum of two hundred thousand dollars for such title to the tract as could be given he did not add that he had personally offered to guarantee the title that was an unnecessary bit of information  you may perhaps imagine the happiness this announcement gave joe and ethel they could scarcely believe the good news was true even when the kindly old gentleman with tears in his eyes congratulated the young couple on the fortune in store for them the major followed with a happy speech of felicitation and then the three girls hugged the little school teacher rapturously and told her how glad they were  i think sir said joe striving to curb his elation that it will be better in the end for us to accept the royalty dont you  i do indeed my boy was the reply for if our people make an offer for the land of two hundred thousand you may rest assured it is worth much more the manager has confided to me in his letter that if we are obliged to pay royalties the timber will cost us nearly double what it would by an outright purchase of the tract  in that case sir began joe eagerly we will  nonsense the company can afford the royalty joe for it is making a heap of moneymore than i wish it were one of my greatest trials is to take care of the money ive already made and  and he couldnt do it at all without my help broke in the major dont ye hesitate to take an advantage of him joseph if ye can get itwhich i doubtfor mr merrick is most disgracefully rich already  thats true sighed the little millionaire so it will be a royalty joe we are paying the same percentage to bob west for the almaquo tract but yours is so much better that i am sure your earnings will furnish you and ethel with all the income you need  they sat discoursing upon the happy event for some time longer but joe had to return to the hotel early because he was not yet strong enough to be out late  before i go mr merrick he said id like you to give me my mothers picture which is in the secret drawer of the cupboard you have the keys now and ethel is curious to see how my mother looked  uncle john went at once to the cupboard and unlocked the doors joe himself pushed the slide and took out of the drawer the picture which had lain just beneath the almaquo stock certificates  the picture was passed reverently around a sweetfaced sad little woman it showed with appealing eyes and lips that seemed to quiver even in the photograph  as louise held it in her hand something induced her to turn it over  here is some writing upon the back she said  joe bent over and read it aloud it was in his fathers handwriting  press the spring in the left hand lower corner of the secret drawer  hah cried uncle john while the others stared stupidly thats it thats the information weve been wanting so long joseph  he ran to the cupboard even as he spoke and while they all thronged about him thrust in his hand felt for the spring and pressed it  the bottom of the drawer lifted showing another cavity beneath from this the searcher withdrew a long envelope tied
