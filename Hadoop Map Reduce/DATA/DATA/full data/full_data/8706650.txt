frontispiece  mr welling explains                               facing page 52     a likely story     i  mr and mrs willis campbell   mrs campbell now this i think is the most exciting part of the whole affair and the pleasantest she is seated at breakfast in her cottage at summeringbythesea a heap of letters of various stylish shapes colors and superscriptions lies beside her plate and irregularly straggles about among the coffeeservice visàvis with her sits mr campbell behind a newspaper how prompt they are why i didnt expect to get half so many answers yet but that shows that where people have nothing to do but attend to their social duties they are always prompteven the men women of course reply early anyway and you dont really care for them but in town the men seem to put it off till the very last moment and then some of them call when its over to excuse themselves for not having come after accepting it really makes you wish for a leisure class its only the drive and hurry of american life that make our men seem wanting in the convenances and if they had the time with their instinctive delicacy they would be perfect it would come from the heart theyre more truly polite now willis just look at this  campbell behind his paper look at what  mrs campbell these replies why i do believe that more than half the people have answered already and the invitations only went out yesterday that comes from putting on rsvp i knew i was right and i shall always do it i dont care what you say  campbell you didnt put on rsvp after all i said he looks round the edge of his paper at her  mrs campbell yes i did the idea of your setting up for an authority in such a thing as that  campbell then im sorry i didnt ask you to do it its a shame to make people say whether theyll come to a gardenparty from four till seven or not  mrs campbell a shame how can you provide if you dont know how many are coming i should like to know that but of course i couldnt expect you to give in gracefully  campbell i should give in gracefully if i gave in at all but i dont he throws his paper down beside his chair here hand over the letters and ill be opening them for you while you pour out the coffee  mrs campbell covering the letters with her hands indeed you wont  campbell well pour out the coffee then anyway  mrs campbell after a moments reflection no i shall not do it im going to open them every one before you get a drop of coffeejust to punish you  campbell to punish me for what mrs campbell hesitates as if at a loss what to say there you dont know  mrs campbell yes i do for saying i oughtnt to have put on rsvp do you take it back  campbell how can i till ive had some coffee my mind wont work on an empty stomach well he rises and goes round the table towards her  mrs campbell spreading both arms over the letters willis if you dare to touch them ill ring for jane and then shell see you cutting up  campbell touch what im coming to get some coffee  mrs campbell well ill give you some coffee but dont you touch a single one of those lettersafter what youve said  campbell all right he extends one hand for the coffee and with the other sweeps all the letters together and starts back to his place as she flies upon him look out amy youll make me spill this coffee all over the tablecloth  mrs campbell sinking into her seat oh willis how can you be so base give me my letters do  campbell sorting them over you may have half  mrs campbell no i shall have all i insist upon it  campbell well then you may have all the ladies letters there are twice as many of them  mrs campbell no i shall have the mens too give me the mens first  campbell how can i tell which are the mens without opening them  mrs campbell how could you tell which were the ladies come now willis dont tease me any longer you know i hate it  campbell studying the superscriptions one after another i want to see if i can guess who wrote them dont you like to guess who wrote your letters before you open them  mrs campbell with dignity i dont like to guess who wrote other peoples letters she looks down at the tablecloth with a menace of tears and campbell instantly returns all the notes  campbell there amy you may have them i dont care who wrote them nor whats in them and i dont want you to interrupt me with any exclamations over them if you please he reaches to the floor for his newspaper and while he sips his coffee mrs campbell loses no time in opening her letters  mrs campbell i shall do nothing but exclaim the curwens accept of coursethe very first letter that means mrs curwen that is one at any rate the new york addingses do and the philadelphia addingses dont i hardly expected they would so soon after their aunts death but i thought i ought to ask them mr and mrs roberts naturally it was more a joke than anything sending their invitation mrs and the misses carver regret very much well i dont professor and mrs traine are very happy and so am i he doesnt go everywhere and hes awfully nice mr and mrs lou bemis are very happy too and dr lawton is very happy mrs bridges dear mrs campbells me and is very sorry in the first person shes always nice mr phillips mr rangeley mr small mr peters mr staples mr thornton all accept and theyre all charming young fellows  campbell around his paper well what of that  mrs campbell with an air of busy preoccupation dont eavesdrop please i wasnt talking to you the merrills have the pleasure and the morgans are sorrowstricken the  campbell yes but why should you care whether those fellows are charming or not whos going to marry them  mrs campbell i am mrs stevenson is bowed to the earth colonel murphree is overjoyed the misses ja  campbell putting his paper down look here amy do you know that you have one little infinitesimal ewelamb of a foible you think too much of young men  mrs campbell younger men you mean and you have a multitude of perfectly mammoth peccadilloes you interrupt she goes on opening and reading her letters well i didnt expect the macklines could but everybody seems to be coming  campbell you pay them too much attention altogether it spoils them and one of these days youll be getting some of them in love with you and then what will you do  mrs campbell with affected distraction what are you talking about id refer them to you and you could kill them i suppose you killed lots of people in california thats what you always gave me to understand she goes on with her letters  campbell i never killed a single human being that i can remember but theres no telling what i might do if i were provoked now theres that young welling hes about here under my feet all the time and hes got a way lately of coming in through the window from the piazza thats very intimate hes a nice fellow enough and sweet as you say i suppose he has talent too but i never heard that he had set any of the adjacent watercourses on fire and i dont know that he could give the apollo belvedere many points in beauty and beat him  mrs campbell i do mrs and miss rice accept and her friend miss greenway whos staying with her andyes heres one from mr welling oh how glad i am willis dearest if i could be the means of bringing those two lovely young creatures together i should be so happy dont you think now he is the most delicateminded truly refined exquisitely modest young fellow that ever was she presses the unopened note to her corsage and leans eagerly forward entreating a sympathetic acquiescence  campbell well as far as i can remember my own youth no but what does he say  mrs campbell regarding the letter i havent looked yet he writes the most characteristic hand for a man that i ever saw and he has the divinest taste in perfumes oh i wonder what that is like a memorya regret she presses it repeatedly to her pretty nose in the endeavor to ascertain  campbell oh hello  mrs campbell laughing willis you are delightful i should like to see you really jealous once  campbell you wont as long as i know my own incomparable charm but give me that letter amy if youre not going to open it i want to see whether welling is going to come  mrs campbell fondly would you really like to open it ive half a mind to let you just for a reward  campbell reward what for  mrs campbell oh i dont know being so nice  campbell thats something i cant help its no merit well hand over the letter  mrs campbell i should have thought youd insist on my opening it after that  campbell why  mrs campbell to show your confidence  campbell when i havent got any  mrs campbell tearing the note open well its no use trying any sentiment with you or any generosity either youre always just the same a teasing joke is your ideal you cant imagine a womans wanting to keep up a little romance all through and a character like mr wellings whos all chivalry and delicacy and deference is quite beyond you thats the reason youre always sneering at him  campbell im not sneering at him my dear im only afraid miss rice isnt good enough for him  mrs campbell instantly placated well shes the only girl whos anywhere near it i dont say shes faultless but she has a great deal of character and shes very practical just the counterpart of his dreaminess and she is very very goodlooking dont you think  campbell her bang isnt so nice as his  mrs campbell no and arent his eyes beautiful and that high serious look and his nose and chin are perfectly divine he looks like a young god  campbell i dare say though i never saw an old one well is he coming im not jealous but im impatient read it out loud  mrs campbell sinking back in her chair for the more luxurious perusal of the note indeed i shall not she opens it and runs it hastily through with various little starts stares frowns smiles of arrested development laughs and cries whywhy what does it mean is he crazy why theres some mistake no its his handand heres his name i cant make it out she reads it again and again why its perfectly bewildering why there must be some mistake he couldnt have meant it could he have imagined could he have dared there never has been the slightest thing that could be tortured intobut of course not and mr welling of all men oh i cant understand it oh willis willis willis what does it mean she flings the note wildly across the table and catching her handkerchief to her face falls back into her chair tumultuously sobbing  campbell with the calm of a man accustomed to emotional superabundance lifting the note from the toastrack before him well lets see he reads aloud oh my darling how can i live till i see you i will be there long before the hour to think of your asking me you should have said i permit you to come and i would have flown from the ends of the earth the presence of others will be nothing it will be sweet to ignore them in my heart and while i see you moving among them and looking after their pleasure with that beautiful thoughtfulness of yours to think she is mine mine mine      oh young lord lover what sighs are those     for one that can never be thine  i thank you and thank you a thousand times over for this proof of your trust in me and of your loveour love you shall be the sole keeper of our secretit is so sweet to think that no one even suspects itand it shall live with you and if you will it shall die with me forever yours arthur welling campbell turns the note over and picking up the envelope examines the address well upon my word its to you amyon the outside anyway what do you suppose he means  mrs campbell in her handkerchief oh i dont know i dont know why he should address such language to me  campbell recurring to the letter i never did oh my darlinglive till i see youends of the earthothers will be nothingbeautiful thoughtfulnessmine mine mineour lovesweet to think no one suspects itforever yours amy these are pretty strong expressions to use towards the wife of another and she a married lady i think i had better go and solve that little problem of how he can live till he sees you by relieving him of the necessity it would be disagreeable to him but perhaps theres a social duty involved  mrs campbell oh willis dont torment me what do you suppose it means is it somemistake its for somebody else  campbell i dont see why he should have addressed it to you then  mrs campbell but dont you see hes been writing to some other person at the same time and hes got the answers mixedput them in the wrong envelopes oh dear i wonder who she is  campbell studying her with an air of affected abstraction her curiosity gets the better of her anguish look here amy i believe youre afraid its to some one else  mrs campbell willis  campbell yes and before we proceed any further i must know just what you wrote to thisthis mr welling of yours did you put on rsvp  mrs campbell yes and just a printed card like all the rest i did want to write him a note in the first person and urge him to come because i expected miss rice and miss greenway to help me receive but when i found margaret had promised mrs curwen for the next day i knew she wouldnt like to take the bloom off that by helping me first so i didnt  campbell didnt what  mrs campbell write to him i just sent a card  campbell then these passionate expressions are unprovoked and my duty is clear i must lose no time in destroying mr welling do you happen to know where i laid my revolver  mrs campbell oh willis what are you going to do you see its a mistake  campbell mr welling has got to prove that im not going to have young men addressing my wife as oh their darling without knowing the reason why its a liberty  mrs campbell inclined to laugh ah willis how funny you are  campbell funny im furious  mrs campbell you know youre not give me the letter dearest i know its for margaret rice and i shall see her and just feel round and find out if it isnt so and  campbell what an idea you havent the slightest evidence that its for miss rice or that it isnt intended for you and its my duty to find out and nobody is authority but mr welling and im going to him with the corpus delicti  mrs campbell but how can you remember how sensitive how shrinking he is dont willis you mustnt it will kill him  campbell well that may save me considerable bother if he will simply die of himself i cant ask anything better he goes on eating his breakfast  mrs campbell admiring him across the table oh willis how perfectly delightful you are  campbell i know but why  mrs campbell why taking it in the nice sensible way you do now some husbands would be so stupid of course you couldnt thinkyou couldnt dreamthat the letter was really for me and yet you might behave very disagreeably and make me very unhappy if you were not just the lovely kindhearted magnanimous  campbell looking up from his coffee oh hello  mrs campbell yes that is what took my fancy in you willis that generosity that real gentleness in spite of the brusque way you have refinement of the heart i call it  campbell amy what are you after  mrs campbell weve been married a whole year now  campbell longer isnt it  mrs campbell and i havent known you do an unkind thing a brutal thing  campbell well i understand the banging around hardly ever begins much under two years  mrs campbell how sweet you are and youre so funny always  campbell come come amy get down to business what is it you do want  mrs campbell you wont go and tease that poor boy about his letter will you just hand it to him and say you suppose here is something that has come into your possession by mistake and that you wish to restore it to him and thenjust run off  campbell with my parasol in one hand and my skirts caught up in the other  mrs campbell oh how good of course i was imagining how i should do it  campbell well a man cant do it that way he would look silly he rises from the table and comes and puts his arm round her shoulders but you neednt be afraid of my being rough with him of course its a mistake but hes a fellow who will enter into the joke too hell enjoy it hell he merges his sentence in a kiss on her upturned lips and she clings to his hand with her right pressing it fondly to her cheek i shall do it in a mans way but i guess youll approve of it quite as much  mrs campbell i know i shall thats what i like about you willis your being so helplessly a man always  campbell well thats what attracted me to you amy your manliness  mrs campbell and i liked your finesse you are awfully inventive willis why willis ive just thought of something oh it would be so good if you only would  campbell would what  mrs campbell invent something now to get us out of the scrape  campbell what a brilliant idea im not in any scrape and as for mr welling i dont see how you could help him out unless you sent this letter to miss rice and asked her to send yours back  mrs campbell springing to her feet willis you are inspired oh how perfectly delightful and its so delicate of you to think of that i will just enclose his notegive it here willisand he need never know that it ever went to the wrong address oh i always felt that you were truly refined anyway he passively yields the letter and she whirls away to a writingdesk in the corner of the room now ill just keep a copy of the letterfor a joke i think ive a perfect right toscribbling furiously awayand then ill match the paper with an envelopei can do that perfectlyand then ill just imitate his handsuch funand send it flying over to margaret rice oh how good touch the bell willis and thenas the servingmaid appearsyes jane run right across the lawn to mrs rices and give this letter for miss margaret and say it was left here by mistake well it was willis fly jane oh willis love isnt it perfect of course shell have got his formal reply to my invitation and be all mixed up by it and now when this note comes shell see through it all in an instant and it will be such a relief to her and oh shell think that hes directed both the letters to her because he couldnt think of any one else isnt it lovely just like anything thats nice its ten times as nice as you expected it to be and  campbell but hold on amy he lifts a note from the desk youve sent your copy heres the original now shell think youve been playing some joke on her  mrs campbell clutching the letter from him and scanning it in a daze what oh my goodness it is i have oh i shall die run call her back shriek willis they rush to the window together no no its too late shes given it to their man and now nothing can save me oh willis willis willis this is all your fault with that fatal suggestion of yours oh if you had only left it to me i never should have got into such a scrape she will think now that ive been trying to hoax her and shes perfectly implacable at the least hint of a liberty and shell be ready to kill me i dont know what she wont do oh willis how could you get me into this  campbell irately get you into this now amy this is a little too much you got yourself into it you urged me to think of something  mrs campbell well do willis do think of something or i shall go mad help me willis dont be so heartlessso unfeeling  campbell theres only one thing now and that is to make a clean breast of it to welling and get him to help us out a word from him can make everything right and we cant take a step without him we cant move  mrs campbell i cant let you oh isnt it horrible  campbell yes a nice thing is always ten times nicer than you expected it to be  mrs campbell oh how can you stand there mocking me why dont you go to him at once and tell him the whole thing and beg him implore him to help us  campbell why you just told me i mustnt  mrs campbell you didnt expect me to say you might did you oh how cruel she whirls out of the room and campbell stands in a daze in which he is finally aware of mr arthur welling seen through the open window on the veranda without mr welling with a terrified and furtive air seems to be fixed to the spot where he stands     ii  mr welling mr campbell   campbell why welling what the devil are you doing there  welling trying to get away  campbell to get away but you shant man i wont let you i was just going to see you how long have you been there  welling ive just come  campbell what have you heard  welling nothingnothing i was knocking on the windowcasing to make you hear but you seemed preoccupied  campbell preoccupied convulsed cataclysmed look here were in a box welling and youve got us into it he pulls wellings note out of his pocket where he has been keeping his hand on it and pokes it at him is that yours  welling examining it with bewilderment mounting into anger its mine yes may i ask mr campbell how you came to have this letter  campbell may i ask mr welling how you came to write such a letter to my wife  welling to your wife to mrs campbell i never wrote any such letter to her  campbell then you addressed it to her  welling impossible  campbell impossible i think i can convince you much as i regret to do so he makes search about mrs campbells letters on the table first and then on the writingdesk we have the envelope it came amongst a lot of letters and theres no mistake about it he continues to toss the letters about and then desists but no matter i cant find it amys probably carried it off with her theres no mistake about it i was going to have some fun with you about it but now you can have some fun with me whom did you send mrs campbells letter to  welling mrs campbells letter  campbell oh pshaw your acceptance or refusal or whatever it was of her garden fandango you got an invitation  welling of course  campbell and you wrote to accept it or decline it at the same time that you wrote this letter here to some one else and you addressed two envelopes before you put the notes in either and then you put them into the wrong envelopes and you sent this note to my wife and the other note to the other person  welling no i didnt do anything of the kind he regards campbell with amazement and some apparent doubt of his sanity  campbell well then mr welling will you allow me to ask what the deuce you did do  welling i never wrote to mrs campbell at all i thought i would just drop in and tell her why i couldnt come it seemed so formal to write  campbell then will you be kind enough to tell me whom you did write to  welling no mr campbell i cant do that  campbell you write such a letter as that to my wife and then wont tell me whom its to  welling no and youve no right to ask me  campbell ive no right to ask you  welling no when i tell you that the note wasnt meant for mrs campbell thats enough  campbell ill be judge of that mr welling you say that you were not writing two notes at the time and that you didnt get the envelopes mixed then if the note wasnt meant for my wife why did you address it to her  welling thats what i cant tell thats what i dont know its as great a mystery to me as it is to you i can only conjecture that when i was writing that address i was thinking of coming to explain to mrs campbell that i was going away today and shouldnt be back till after her party it was too complicated to put in a note without seeming to give my regrets too much importance and i suppose that when i was addressing the note that i did write i put mrs campbells name on because i had her so much in mind  campbell with irony oh     iii  mrs campbell mr welling mr campbell   mrs campbell appearing through the portière that separates the breakfastroom from the parlor beyond yes she goes up and gives her hand to mr welling with friendly frankness and it was very nice of you to think of me at such a time when you ought to have been thinking of some one else  welling with great relief and effusion oh thank you mrs campbell i was sure you would understand you couldnt have imagined me capable of addressing such language to you of presumingof  mrs campbell of course not and willis has quite lost his head i saw in an instant just how it was im so sorry you cant come to my party  campbell amy have you been eavesdropping  mrs campbell there was no need of eavesdropping i could have heard you out at loon rock light you shouted so but as soon as i recognized mr wellings voice i came to the top of the stairs and listened i was sure you would do something foolish but now i think we had better make a clean breast of it and tell mr welling just what weve done we knew of course the letter wasnt for me and we thought we wouldnt vex you about it but just send it to the one it was meant for weve surprised your secret mr welling though we didnt intend to but if youll accept our congratulationsunder the rose of coursewe wont let it go any further it does seem so perfectly ideal and i feel like saying bless you my children youve been in and out here so much this summer and i feel just like an elder sister to margaret  welling margaret  mrs campbell well miss rice then  welling miss rice  mrs campbell with dignity oh im sorry if we seem to presume upon our acquaintance with the matter we couldnt very well help knowing it under the circumstances  welling certainly certainlyof course i dont mind that at all i was going to tell you anyway that was partly the reason why i came instead of writing  campbell in an audible soliloquy i supposed he had written  mrs campbell intensely dont interrupt willis well  welling but i dont see what miss rice has to do with it  mrs campbell you dont see why isnt margaret rice the one  welling what one  mrs campbell the one that youre engagedthe one that the note was really for  welling no what an idea miss rice not for an instant itsits her friendmiss greenwaywhos staying with her  mrs campbell in a very awful voice willis get me some watersome wine help me ah dont touch me it was you you who did it all oh now what shall i do she drops her head upon campbells shoulder while welling watches them in stupefaction  campbell its about a million times nicer than we could have expected thats the way with a nice thing when you get it started well young man youre done for and so are we for that matter we supposed that note which you addressed to mrs campbell was intended for miss rice  welling ho ho ho ah ha ha miss rice ha  campbell im glad you like it youll enjoy the rest of it still better we thought it was for miss rice and my wife neatly imitated your hand on an envelope and sent it over to her just before you came in funny isnt it laugh on dont mind us  welling aghast thought my note was for miss rice sent it to her gracious powers they all stand for a moment in silence and then welling glances at the paper in his hand but theres some mistake you havent sent my note to miss rice here it is now  campbell oh thats the best of the joke mrs campbell took a copymrs campbell moansshe meant to have some fun with you about it and its ten times as much fun as i expected and in her hurry she sent off her copy and kept the original perhaps that makes it better  mrs campbell detaching herself from him and confronting mr welling no worse shell think weve been trying to hoax her and shell be in a towering rage and shell show the note to miss greenway and youll be ruined oh poor mr welling oh what a fatal fatalmix she abandons herself in an attitude of extreme desperation upon a chair while the men stare at her till campbell breaks the spell by starting forward and ringing the bell on the table  mrs campbell what are you doing willis  campbell ringing for jane as jane appears did you give miss rice the note     iv  jane mrs campbell welling campbell   jane no sir i gave it to the man he said he would give it to miss rice  campbell then its all up if by any chance she hadnt got it amy you might have sent over for it and said there was a mistake  jane he said miss rice was out driving with miss greenway in her phaeton but they expected her back every minute  mrs campbell oh my goodness and you didnt come to tell me oh if we had only known weve lost our only chance willis  jane i did come and knock on your door maam but i couldnt make you hear  campbell theres still a chance perhaps she hasnt got back yet  jane i know she aint sir ive been watching for her ever since i can always see them come from the pantry window  mrs campbell well then dont stand there talking but run at once oh willis never tell me again that theres no such thing as an overruling providence oh what an interposition oh i can never be grateful and humble enoughgoodness me jane why dont you go  jane go where maam i dont know what you want me to do im willing enough to do anything if i know what it is but its pretty hard to do things if you dont  campbell youre perfectly right jane mrs campbell wants you to telegraph yourself over to mrs rices and say to her that the letter you left for miss rice is not for her but another lady and mrs campbell sent it by mistake get it and bring it back here dead or alive even if mrs rice has to pass over your mangled body in the attempt  jane tasting the joke while mrs campbell gasps in ineffective efforts to reinforce her husbands instructions i will that sir     v  mrs campbell welling campbell   campbell and now while were waiting lets all join hands and dance round the table youre saved welling so are you amy and so am iwhich is more to the point  mrs campbell gayly dansons she extends her hands to the gentlemen and as they circle round the breakfasttable she sings      sur le pont davignon     tout le monde y danse en rond  she frees her hands and courtesies to one gentleman and the other      les belles dames font comme ça     les beaux messieurs font comme ça  then she catches hands with them again and they circle round the table as before singing      sur le pont davignon     tout le monde y danse en rond  oh dear stop im dizzyi shall fall she spins into a chair while the men continue solemnly circling by themselves  campbell it is a sacred dance      sur le pont davignon  welling its an expiation      tout le monde y danse en rond  mrs campbell springing from her chair and running to the window stop you crazy things here comes jane come right in here jane did you get it give it to me jane  welling i think it belongs to me mrs campbell  campbell jane i am master of the housenominally give me the letter     vi  jane mrs campbell welling campbell   jane entering blown and panting through the open window oh how i did run  mrs campbell yes yes but the letter  welling did you get it  campbell where is it  jane fanning herself with her apron i cant hardly get my breath  mrs campbell had she got back  jane no maam  campbell did mrs rice object to giving it up  jane no sir  welling then its all right  jane no sir all wrong  welling all wrong  campbell how all wrong  mrs campbell whats all wrong jane  jane please maam may i have a drink of water im so dry i cant speak  mrs campbell yes certainly  campbell of course  welling here they all pour glasses of water and press them to her lips  jane pushing the glasses away and escaping from the room they thought mrs campbell was in a great hurry for miss rice to have the letter and they sent off the man with it to meet her     vii  mrs campbell welling campbell   mrs campbell oh merciful goodness  welling gracious powers  campbell another overruling providence now you are in for it my boy so is amy and so am iwhich is still more to the point  mrs campbell well now what shall we do  campbell all that we can do now is to await developments theyll come fast enough miss rice will open her letter as soon as she gets it and she wont understand it in the least how could she understand a letter in your handwriting with wellings name signed to it shell show it to miss greenway  welling oh dont say that  campbell greenway and miss greenway wont know what to make of it either but shes the kind of girl wholl form some lively conjectures when she reads that letter in the first place shell wonder how mr welling happens to be writing to miss rice in that affectionate strain  mrs campbell in an appealing shriek willis  campbell and she naturally wont believe hes done it but then when miss rice tells her its your handwriting amy shell think that you and miss rice have been having your jokes about mr welling and shell wonder what kind of person you are anyway to make free with a young mans name that way  welling oh i assure you that she admires mrs campbell more than anybody  mrs campbell dont try to stop him hes fiendish when he begins teasing  campbell oh well if she admires mrs campbell and confides in you then the whole affair is very simple all youve got to do is to tell her that after youd written her the original of that note your mind was so full of mrs campbell and her gardenparty that you naturally addressed it to her and then mrs campbell can cut in and say that when she got the note she knew it wasnt for her but she never dreamed of your caring for miss greenway and was so sure it was for miss rice that she sent her a copy of it that will make it all right and perfectly agreeable to every one concerned  mrs campbell and i can say that i sent it at your suggestion and then instead of trying to help me out of the awful awfulbox you took a cruel pleasure in teasing me about it but i shall not say anything for i shall not see them i will leave you to receive them and make the best of it dont try to stop me willis she threatens him with her fan as he steps forward to intercept her escape  campbell no no listen amy you must stay and see those ladies its all well enough to leave it to me but what about poor welling he hasnt done anythingexcept cause the whole trouble  mrs campbell i am very sorry but i cant help it i must go campbell continues to prevent her flight and she suddenly whirls about and makes a dash at the open window oh very well then i can get out this way at the same moment miss rice and miss greenway appear before the window on the piazza ugh eee how you frightened me butbut come in so glglad to see you and youyou too miss greenway heres mr welling hes been desolating us with a story about having to be away over my party and just getting back for mrs curwens isnt it too bad cant some of you young ladiesor all of youmake him stay as mrs campbell talks on she readjusts her spirit more and more to the exigency and subdues her agitation to a surface of the sweetest politeness     viii  miss rice miss greenway and the others   miss rice entering with an unopened letter in her hand which she extends to mrs campbell what in the world does it all mean mrs campbell your sending your letters flying after me at this rate  mrs campbell with a gasp my letters she mechanically receives the extended note and glances at the superscription mrs willis campbell ah she hands it quickly to her husband who reads the address with a similar cry  campbell well well amy this is a pretty good joke on you youve sealed up one of your own notes and sent it to miss rice capital ah ha ha  mrs campbell with hysterical rapture oh how delicious what a ridiculous blunder i dont wonder you were puzzled margaret  welling what sent her your own letter addressed to yourself  mrs campbell yes isnt it amusing  welling the best thing i ever heard of  miss rice yes and if you only knew what agonies of curiosity miss greenway and i had suffered wanting to open it and read it anyway in spite of all the decencies i think you would read it to us  campbell or at least give miss rice her own letter what in the world did you do with that  mrs campbell put it in my desk where i thought i put mine but never mind it now i can tell you what was in it just as well come in here a moment margaret she leads the way to the parlor whither miss rice follows  miss greenway poutingly oh maynt i know too i think thats hardly fair mrs campbell  mrs campbell no ormargaret may tell you afterwards or mr welling may now  miss greenway how very formidable  mrs campbell over her shoulder on going out willis bring me the refusals and acceptances wont you theyre upstairs  campbell delighted to be of any service behind miss greenways back he dramatizes over her head to welling his sense of his own escape and his compassion for the fellowman whom he leaves in the toils of fate     ix  miss greenway mr welling   welling nelly he approaches and timidly takes her hand  miss greenway arthur that letter was addressed in your handwriting will you please explain  welling why its very simplethat is its the most difficult thing in the world nelly can you believe anything i say to you  miss greenway what nonsense of course i canif youre not too long about it  welling well then the letter in that envelope was one i wrote to mrs campbellor the copy of one  miss greenway the copy  welling but let me explain you see when i got your note asking me to be sure and come to mrs curwens  miss greenway yes  welling i had just received an invitation from mrs campbell for her gardenparty and i sat down and wrote to you and concluded id step over and tell her why i couldnt come and with that in mind i addressed your letterthe one id written youto her  miss greenway with my name inside  welling no i merely called you darling and when mrs campbell opened it she saw it couldnt be for her and she took it into her head it must be for miss rice  miss greenway for margaret what an idea but why did she put your envelope on it  welling she made a copy for the joke of it and then in her hurry she enclosed that in my envelope and kept the original and the envelope shed addressed to miss rice andand thats all  miss greenway what a perfectly delightful muddle and how shall we get out of it with margaret  welling with margaret i dont care for her its you that i want to get out of it with and you do believe meyou do forgive me nelly  miss greenway for what  welling forfori dont know what for but i thought youd be so vexed  miss greenway i shouldnt have liked you to send a letter addressed darling to mrs curwen but mrs campbell is different  welling oh how archangelically sensible how divine of you to take it in just the right way  illustration mr welling explains  miss greenway why of course how stupid i should be to take such a thing in the wrong way  welling and im so glad now i didnt try to lie to you about it  miss greenway it wouldnt have been of any use you couldnt have carried off anything of that sort the truth is bad enough for you to carry off promise me that you will always leave the other thing to me  welling i will darling i will indeed  miss greenway and now we must tell margaret of course     x  miss rice then mr and mrs campbell and the others   miss rice rushing in upon them and clasping miss greenway in a fond embrace you neednt mrs campbell has told me and oh nelly im so happy for you and isnt it all the greatest mix  campbell rushing in and wringing wellings hand you neednt tell me either ive been listening and ive heard every word i congratulate you my dear boy id no idea shed let you up so easily youll allow yourself it isnt a very likely story  welling i know it but  miss rice thats the very reason no one could have made it up  miss greenway he couldnt have made up even a likely story  campbell congratulate you again welling do you suppose she can keep so always  mrs campbell rushing in with extended hands dont answer the wretch mr welling of course she can with you dansons she gives a hand to miss greenway and welling each the others join them and as they circle round the table she sings      sur le pont davignon     tout le monde y danse en rond   the end
