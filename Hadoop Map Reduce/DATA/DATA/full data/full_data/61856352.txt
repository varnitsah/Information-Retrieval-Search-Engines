61856352	the haunted man and the ghosts bargain     chapter ithe gift bestowed    everybody said so  far be it from me to assert that what everybody says must be true everybody is often as likely to be wrong as right  in the general experience everybody has been wrong so often and it has taken in most instances such a weary while to find out how wrong that the authority is proved to be fallible  everybody may sometimes be right but thats no rule as the ghost of giles scroggins says in the ballad  the dread word ghost recalls me  everybody said he looked like a haunted man  the extent of my present claim for everybody is that they were so far right  he did  who could have seen his hollow cheek his sunken brilliant eye his blackattired figure indefinably grim although wellknit and wellproportioned his grizzled hair hanging like tangled sea weed about his faceas if he had been through his whole life a lonely mark for the chafing and beating of the great deep of humanitybut might have said he looked like a haunted man  who could have observed his manner taciturn thoughtful gloomy shadowed by habitual reserve retiring always and jocund never with a distraught air of reverting to a bygone place and time or of listening to some old echoes in his mind but might have said it was the manner of a haunted man  who could have heard his voice slowspeaking deep and grave with a natural fulness and melody in it which he seemed to set himself against and stop but might have said it was the voice of a haunted man  who that had seen him in his inner chamber part library and part laboratoryfor he was as the world knew far and wide a learned man in chemistry and a teacher on whose lips and hands a crowd of aspiring ears and eyes hung dailywho that had seen him there upon a winter night alone surrounded by his drugs and instruments and books the shadow of his shaded lamp a monstrous beetle on the wall motionless among a crowd of spectral shapes raised there by the flickering of the fire upon the quaint objects around him some of these phantoms the reflection of glass vessels that held liquids trembling at heart like things that knew his power to uncombine them and to give back their component parts to fire and vapourwho that had seen him then his work done and he pondering in his chair before the rusted grate and red flame moving his thin mouth as if in speech but silent as the dead would not have said that the man seemed haunted and the chamber too  who might not by a very easy flight of fancy have believed that everything about him took this haunted tone and that he lived on haunted ground  his dwelling was so solitary and vaultlikean old retired part of an ancient endowment for students once a brave edifice planted in an open place but now the obsolete whim of forgotten architects smokeageandweatherdarkened squeezed on every side by the overgrowing of the great city and choked like an old well with stones and bricks its small quadrangles lying down in very pits formed by the streets and buildings which in course of time had been constructed above its heavy chimney stalks its old trees insulted by the neighbouring smoke which deigned to droop so low when it was very feeble and the weather very moody its grass plots struggling with the mildewed earth to be grass or to win any show of compromise its silent pavements unaccustomed to the tread of feet and even to the observation of eyes except when a stray face looked down from the upper world wondering what nook it was its sundial in a little brickedup corner where no sun had straggled for a hundred years but where in compensation for the suns neglect the snow would lie for weeks when it lay nowhere else and the black east wind would spin like a huge hummingtop when in all other places it was silent and still  his dwelling at its heart and corewithin doorsat his fireside was so lowering and old so crazy yet so strong with its worn eaten beams of wood in the ceiling and its sturdy floor shelving downward to the great oak chimneypiece so environed and hemmed in by the pressure of the town yet so remote in fashion age and custom so quiet yet so thundering with echoes when a distant voice was raised or a door was shutechoes not confined to the many low passages and empty rooms but rumbling and grumbling till they were stifled in the heavy air of the forgotten crypt where the norman arches were halfburied in the earth  you should have seen him in his dwelling about twilight in the dead winter time  when the wind was blowing shrill and shrewd with the going down of the blurred sun  when it was just so dark as that the forms of things were indistinct and bigbut not wholly lost  when sitters by the fire began to see wild faces and figures mountains and abysses ambuscades and armies in the coals  when people in the streets bent down their heads and ran before the weather  when those who were obliged to meet it were stopped at angry corners stung by wandering snowflakes alighting on the lashes of their eyeswhich fell too sparingly and were blown away too quickly to leave a trace upon the frozen ground  when windows of private houses closed up tight and warm  when lighted gas began to burst forth in the busy and the quiet streets fast blackening otherwise when stray pedestrians shivering along the latter looked down at the glowing fires in kitchens and sharpened their sharp appetites by sniffing up the fragrance of whole miles of dinners  when travellers by land were bitter cold and looked wearily on gloomy landscapes rustling and shuddering in the blast  when mariners at sea outlying upon icy yards were tossed and swung above the howling ocean dreadfully  when lighthouses on rocks and headlands showed solitary and watchful and benighted seabirds breasted on against their ponderous lanterns and fell dead  when little readers of storybooks by the firelight trembled to think of cassim baba cut into quarters hanging in the robbers cave or had some small misgivings that the fierce little old woman with the crutch who used to start out of the box in the merchant abudahs bedroom might one of these nights be found upon the stairs in the long cold dusky journey up to bed  when in rustic places the last glimmering of daylight died away from the ends of avenues and the trees arching overhead were sullen and black  when in parks and woods the high wet fern and sodden moss and beds of fallen leaves and trunks of trees were lost to view in masses of impenetrable shade  when mists arose from dyke and fen and river  when lights in old halls and in cottage windows were a cheerful sight  when the mill stopped the wheelwright and the blacksmith shut their workshops the turnpike gate closed the plough and harrow were left lonely in the fields the labourer and team went home and the striking of the church clock had a deeper sound than at noon and the churchyard wicket would be swung no more that night  when twilight everywhere released the shadows prisoned up all day that now closed in and gathered like mustering swarms of ghosts when they stood lowering in corners of rooms and frowned out from behind halfopened doors  when they had full possession of unoccupied apartments  when they danced upon the floors and walls and ceilings of inhabited chambers while the fire was low and withdrew like ebbing waters when it sprang into a blaze  when they fantastically mocked the shapes of household objects making the nurse an ogress the rockinghorse a monster the wondering child halfscared and halfamused a stranger to itselfthe very tongs upon the hearth a straddling giant with his arms akimbo evidently smelling the blood of englishmen and wanting to grind peoples bones to make his bread  when these shadows brought into the minds of older people other thoughts and showed them different images  when they stole from their retreats in the likenesses of forms and faces from the past from the grave from the deep deep gulf where the things that might have been and never were are always wandering  when he sat as already mentioned gazing at the fire  when as it rose and fell the shadows went and came  when he took no heed of them with his bodily eyes but let them come or let them go looked fixedly at the fire  you should have seen him then  when the sounds that had arisen with the shadows and come out of their lurkingplaces at the twilight summons seemed to make a deeper stillness all about him  when the wind was rumbling in the chimney and sometimes crooning sometimes howling in the house when the old trees outside were so shaken and beaten that one querulous old rook unable to sleep protested now and then in a feeble dozy highup caw  when at intervals the window trembled the rusty vane upon the turrettop complained the clock beneath it recorded that another quarter of an hour was gone or the fire collapsed and fell in with a rattle   when a knock came at his door in short as he was sitting so and roused him  whos that said he  come in  surely there had been no figure leaning on the back of his chair no face looking over it  it is certain that no gliding footstep touched the floor as he lifted up his head with a start and spoke  and yet there was no mirror in the room on whose surface his own form could have cast its shadow for a moment and something had passed darkly and gone  im humbly fearful sir said a freshcoloured busy man holding the door open with his foot for the admission of himself and a wooden tray he carried and letting it go again by very gentle and careful degrees when he and the tray had got in lest it should close noisily that its a good bit past the time tonight  but mrs william has been taken off her legs so often   by the wind  ay  i have heard it rising  by the wind sirthat its a mercy she got home at all  oh dear yes  yes  it was by the wind mr redlaw  by the wind  he had by this time put down the tray for dinner and was employed in lighting the lamp and spreading a cloth on the table from this employment he desisted in a hurry to stir and feed the fire and then resumed it the lamp he had lighted and the blaze that rose under his hand so quickly changing the appearance of the room that it seemed as if the mere coming in of his fresh red face and active manner had made the pleasant alteration  mrs william is of course subject at any time sir to be taken off her balance by the elements  she is not formed superior to that  no returned mr redlaw goodnaturedly though abruptly  no sir  mrs william may be taken off her balance by earth as for example last sunday week when sloppy and greasy and she going out to tea with her newest sisterinlaw and having a pride in herself and wishing to appear perfectly spotless though pedestrian  mrs william may be taken off her balance by air as being once overpersuaded by a friend to try a swing at peckham fair which acted on her constitution instantly like a steamboat mrs william may be taken off her balance by fire as on a false alarm of engines at her mothers when she went two miles in her nightcap  mrs william may be taken off her balance by water as at battersea when rowed into the piers by her young nephew charley swidger junior aged twelve which had no idea of boats whatever  but these are elements  mrs william must be taken out of elements for the strength of her character to come into play  as he stopped for a reply the reply was yes in the same tone as before  yes sir  oh dear yes said mr swidger still proceeding with his preparations and checking them off as he made them  thats where it is sir  thats what i always say myself sir  such a many of us swidgerspepper  why theres my father sir superannuated keeper and custodian of this institution eighty seven year old  hes a swidgerspoon  true william was the patient and abstracted answer when he stopped again  yes sir said mr swidger  thats what i always say sir  you may call him the trunk of the treebread  then you come to his successor my unworthy selfsaltand mrs william swidgers bothknife and fork  then you come to all my brothers and their families swidgers man and woman boy and girl  why what with cousins uncles aunts and relationships of this that and tother degree and whatnot degree and marriages and lyingsin the swidgerstumblermight take hold of hands and make a ring round england  receiving no reply at all here from the thoughtful man whom he addressed mr william approached him nearer and made a feint of accidentally knocking the table with a decanter to rouse him  the moment he succeeded he went on as if in great alacrity of acquiescence  yes sir  thats just what i say myself sir  mrs william and me have often said so  theres swidgers enough we say without our voluntary contributionsbutter  in fact sir my father is a family in himselfcastorsto take care of and it happens all for the best that we have no child of our own though its made mrs william rather quietlike too  quite ready for the fowl and mashed potatoes sir  mrs william said shed dish in ten minutes when i left the lodge  i am quite ready said the other waking as from a dream and walking slowly to and fro  mrs william has been at it again sir said the keeper as he stood warming a plate at the fire and pleasantly shading his face with it  mr redlaw stopped in his walking and an expression of interest appeared in him  what i always say myself sir  she will do it  theres a motherly feeling in mrs williams breast that must and will have went  what has she done  why sir not satisfied with being a sort of mother to all the young gentlemen that come up from a variety of parts to attend your courses of lectures at this ancient foundationits surprising how stonechaney catches the heat this frosty weather to be sure here he turned the plate and cooled his fingers  well said mr redlaw  thats just what i say myself sir returned mr william speaking over his shoulder as if in ready and delighted assent thats exactly where it is sir  there aint one of our students but appears to regard mrs william in that light  every day right through the course they puts their heads into the lodge one after another and have all got something to tell her or something to ask her  swidge is the appellation by which they speak of mrs william in general among themselves im told but thats what i say sir  better be called ever so far out of your name if its done in real liking than have it made ever so much of and not cared about  whats a name for  to know a person by  if mrs william is known by something better than her namei allude to mrs williams qualities and dispositionnever mind her name though it is swidger by rights  let em call her swidge widge bridgelord  london bridge blackfriars chelsea putney waterloo or hammersmith suspensionif they like  the close of this triumphant oration brought him and the plate to the table upon which he half laid and half dropped it with a lively sense of its being thoroughly heated just as the subject of his praises entered the room bearing another tray and a lantern and followed by a venerable old man with long grey hair  mrs william like mr william was a simple innocentlooking person in whose smooth cheeks the cheerful red of her husbands official waistcoat was very pleasantly repeated  but whereas mr williams light hair stood on end all over his head and seemed to draw his eyes up with it in an excess of bustling readiness for anything the dark brown hair of mrs william was carefully smoothed down and waved away under a trim tidy cap in the most exact and quiet manner imaginable  whereas mr williams very trousers hitched themselves up at the ankles as if it were not in their irongrey nature to rest without looking about them mrs williams neatlyflowered skirtsred and white like her own pretty facewere as composed and orderly as if the very wind that blew so hard out of doors could not disturb one of their folds whereas his coat had something of a flyaway and halfoff appearance about the collar and breast her little bodice was so placid and neat that there should have been protection for her in it had she needed any with the roughest people  who could have had the heart to make so calm a bosom swell with grief or throb with fear or flutter with a thought of shame  to whom would its repose and peace have not appealed against disturbance like the innocent slumber of a child  punctual of course milly said her husband relieving her of the tray or it wouldnt be you  heres mrs william sirhe looks lonelier than ever tonight whispering to his wife as he was taking the tray and ghostlier altogether  without any show of hurry or noise or any show of herself even she was so calm and quiet milly set the dishes she had brought upon the tablemr william after much clattering and running about having only gained possession of a butterboat of gravy which he stood ready to serve  what is that the old man has in his arms asked mr redlaw as he sat down to his solitary meal  holly sir replied the quiet voice of milly  thats what i say myself sir interposed mr william striking in with the butterboat  berries is so seasonable to the time of yearbrown gravy  another christmas come another year gone murmured the chemist with a gloomy sigh  more figures in the lengthening sum of recollection that we work and work at to our torment till death idly jumbles all together and rubs all out  so philip breaking off and raising his voice as he addressed the old man standing apart with his glistening burden in his arms from which the quiet mrs william took small branches which she noiselessly trimmed with her scissors and decorated the room with while her aged fatherinlaw looked on much interested in the ceremony  my duty to you sir returned the old man  should have spoke before sir but know your ways mr redlawproud to sayand wait till spoke to  merry christmas sir and happy new year and many of em  have had a pretty many of em myselfha haand may take the liberty of wishing em  im eightyseven  have you had so many that were merry and happy asked the other  ay sir ever so many returned the old man  is his memory impaired with age  it is to be expected now said mr redlaw turning to the son and speaking lower  not a morsel of it sir replied mr william  thats exactly what i say myself sir  there never was such a memory as my fathers  hes the most wonderful man in the world  he dont know what forgetting means  its the very observation im always making to mrs william sir if youll believe me  mr swidger in his polite desire to seem to acquiesce at all events delivered this as if there were no iota of contradiction in it and it were all said in unbounded and unqualified assent  the chemist pushed his plate away and rising from the table walked across the room to where the old man stood looking at a little sprig of holly in his hand  it recalls the time when many of those years were old and new then he said observing him attentively and touching him on the shoulder  does it  oh many many said philip half awaking from his reverie  im eightyseven  merry and happy was it asked the chemist in a low voice merry and happy old man  maybe as high as that no higher said the old man holding out his hand a little way above the level of his knee and looking retrospectively at his questioner when i first remember em cold sunshiny day it was out awalking when some oneit was my mother as sure as you stand there though i dont know what her blessed face was like for she took ill and died that christmas timetold me they were food for birds  the pretty little fellow thoughtthats me you understandthat birds eyes were so bright perhaps because the berries that they lived on in the winter were so bright  i recollect that  and im eightyseven  merry and happy mused the other bending his dark eyes upon the stooping figure with a smile of compassion  merry and happyand remember well  ay ay ay resumed the old man catching the last words  i remember em well in my school time year after year and all the merrymaking that used to come along with them  i was a strong chap then mr redlaw and if youll believe me hadnt my match at football within ten mile  wheres my son william  hadnt my match at football william within ten mile  thats what i always say father returned the son promptly and with great respect  you are a swidger if ever there was one of the family  dear said the old man shaking his head as he again looked at the holly  his mothermy son williams my youngest sonand i have sat among em all boys and girls little children and babies many a year when the berries like these were not shining half so bright all round us as their bright faces  many of em are gone shes gone and my son george our eldest who was her pride more than all the rest is fallen very low  but i can see them when i look here alive and healthy as they used to be in those days and i can see him thank god in his innocence  its a blessed thing to me at eightyseven  the keen look that had been fixed upon him with so much earnestness had gradually sought the ground  when my circumstances got to be not so good as formerly through not being honestly dealt by and i first come here to be custodian said the old man which was upwards of fifty years agowheres my son william  more than half a century ago william  thats what i say father replied the son as promptly and dutifully as before thats exactly where it is  two times oughts an ought and twice five ten and theres a hundred of em  it was quite a pleasure to know that one of our foundersor more correctly speaking said the old man with a great glory in his subject and his knowledge of it one of the learned gentlemen that helped endow us in queen elizabeths time for we were founded afore her dayleft in his will among the other bequests he made us so much to buy holly for garnishing the walls and windows come christmas  there was something homely and friendly in it being but strange here then and coming at christmas time we took a liking for his very picter that hangs in what used to be anciently afore our ten poor gentlemen commuted for an annual stipend in money our great dinner halla sedate gentleman in a peaked beard with a ruff round his neck and a scroll below him in old english letters lord keep my memory green  you know all about him mr redlaw  i know the portrait hangs there philip  yes sure its the second on the right above the panelling  i was going to sayhe has helped to keep my memory green i thank him for going round the building every year as im a doing now and freshening up the bare rooms with these branches and berries freshens up my bare old brain  one year brings back another and that year another and those others numbers  at last it seems to me as if the birthtime of our lord was the birthtime of all i have ever had affection for or mourned for or delighted inand theyre a pretty many for im eightyseven  merry and happy murmured redlaw to himself  the room began to darken strangely  so you see sir pursued old philip whose hale wintry cheek had warmed into a ruddier glow and whose blue eyes had brightened while he spoke i have plenty to keep when i keep this present season  now wheres my quiet mouse  chatterings the sin of my time of life and theres half the building to do yet if the cold dont freeze us first or the wind dont blow us away or the darkness dont swallow us up  the quiet mouse had brought her calm face to his side and silently taken his arm before he finished speaking  come away my dear said the old man  mr redlaw wont settle to his dinner otherwise till its cold as the winter  i hope youll excuse me rambling on sir and i wish you good night and once again a merry  stay said mr redlaw resuming his place at the table more it would have seemed from his manner to reassure the old keeper than in any remembrance of his own appetite  spare me another moment philip  william you were going to tell me something to your excellent wifes honour  it will not be disagreeable to her to hear you praise her  what was it  why thats where it is you see sir returned mr william swidger looking towards his wife in considerable embarrassment mrs williams got her eye upon me  but youre not afraid of mrs williams eye  why no sir returned mr swidger thats what i say myself it wasnt made to be afraid of  it wouldnt have been made so mild if that was the intention  but i wouldnt like tomilly him you know  down in the buildings  mr william standing behind the table and rummaging disconcertedly among the objects upon it directed persuasive glances at mrs william and secret jerks of his head and thumb at mr redlaw as alluring her towards him  him you know my love said mr william  down in the buildings  tell my dear  youre the works of shakespeare in comparison with myself  down in the buildings you know my love student  student repeated mr redlaw raising his head  thats what i say sir cried mr william in the utmost animation of assent  if it wasnt the poor student down in the buildings why should you wish to hear it from mrs williams lips mrs william my dearbuildings  i didnt know said milly with a quiet frankness free from any haste or confusion that william had said anything about it or i wouldnt have come  i asked him not to  its a sick young gentleman sirand very poor i am afraidwho is too ill to go home this holidaytime and lives unknown to any one in but a common kind of lodging for a gentleman down in jerusalem buildings  thats all sir  why have i never heard of him said the chemist rising hurriedly  why has he not made his situation known to me  sick give me my hat and cloak  poorwhat housewhat number  oh you mustnt go there sir said milly leaving her fatherin law and calmly confronting him with her collected little face and folded hands  not go there  oh dear no said milly shaking her head as at a most manifest and selfevident impossibility  it couldnt be thought of  what do you mean  why not  why you see sir said mr william swidger persuasively and confidentially thats what i say  depend upon it the young gentleman would never have made his situation known to one of his own sex  mrs williams has got into his confidence but thats quite different  they all confide in mrs william they all trust her  a man sir couldnt have got a whisper out of him but woman sir and mrs william combined  there is good sense and delicacy in what you say william returned mr redlaw observant of the gentle and composed face at his shoulder  and laying his finger on his lip he secretly put his purse into her hand  oh dear no sir cried milly giving it back again  worse and worse  couldnt be dreamed of  such a staid matteroffact housewife she was and so unruffled by the momentary haste of this rejection that an instant afterwards she was tidily picking up a few leaves which had strayed from between her scissors and her apron when she had arranged the holly  finding when she rose from her stooping posture that mr redlaw was still regarding her with doubt and astonishment she quietly repeatedlooking about the while for any other fragments that might have escaped her observation  oh dear no sir  he said that of all the world he would not be known to you or receive help from youthough he is a student in your class  i have made no terms of secrecy with you but i trust to your honour completely  why did he say so  indeed i cant tell sir said milly after thinking a little because i am not at all clever you know and i wanted to be useful to him in making things neat and comfortable about him and employed myself that way  but i know he is poor and lonely and i think he is somehow neglected toohow dark it is  the room had darkened more and more  there was a very heavy gloom and shadow gathering behind the chemists chair  what more about him he asked  he is engaged to be married when he can afford it said milly and is studying i think to qualify himself to earn a living  i have seen a long time that he has studied hard and denied himself muchhow very dark it is  its turned colder too said the old man rubbing his hands theres a chill and dismal feeling in the room  wheres my son william  william my boy turn the lamp and rouse the fire  millys voice resumed like quiet music very softly played  he muttered in his broken sleep yesterday afternoon after talking to me this was to herself about some one dead and some great wrong done that could never be forgotten but whether to him or to another person i dont know  not by him i am sure  and in short mrs william you seewhich she wouldnt say herself mr redlaw if she was to stop here till the new year after this next one said mr william coming up to him to speak in his ear has done him worlds of good  bless you worlds of good  all at home just the same as evermy father made as snug and comfortablenot a crumb of litter to be found in the house if you were to offer fifty pound ready money for itmrs william apparently never out of the wayyet mrs william backwards and forwards backwards and forwards up and down up and down a mother to him  the room turned darker and colder and the gloom and shadow gathering behind the chair was heavier  not content with this sir mrs william goes and finds this very night when she was coming home why its not above a couple of hours ago a creature more like a young wild beast than a young child shivering upon a doorstep  what does mrs william do but brings it home to dry it and feed it and keep it till our old bounty of food and flannel is given away on christmas morning  if it ever felt a fire before its as much as ever it did for its sitting in the old lodge chimney staring at ours as if its ravenous eyes would never shut again  its sitting there at least said mr william correcting himself on reflection unless its bolted  heaven keep her happy said the chemist aloud and you too philip and you william  i must consider what to do in this  i may desire to see this student ill not detain you any longer now goodnight  i thankee sir i thankee said the old man for mouse and for my son william and for myself  wheres my son william william you take the lantern and go on first through them long dark passages as you did last year and the year afore  ha ha i rememberthough im eightyseven  lord keep my memory green  its a very good prayer mr redlaw that of the learned gentleman in the peaked beard with a ruff round his neckhangs up second on the right above the panelling in what used to be afore our ten poor gentlemen commuted our great dinner hall lord keep my memory green  its very good and pious sir amen  amen  as they passed out and shut the heavy door which however carefully withheld fired a long train of thundering reverberations when it shut at last the room turned darker  as he fell a musing in his chair alone the healthy holly withered on the wall and droppeddead branches  as the gloom and shadow thickened behind him in that place where it had been gathering so darkly it took by slow degreesor out of it there came by some unreal unsubstantial processnot to be traced by any human sensean awful likeness of himself  ghastly and cold colourless in its leaden face and hands but with his features and his bright eyes and his grizzled hair and dressed in the gloomy shadow of his dress it came into his terrible appearance of existence motionless without a sound  as he leaned his arm upon the elbow of his chair ruminating before the fire it leaned upon the chairback close above him with its appalling copy of his face looking where his face looked and bearing the expression his face bore  this then was the something that had passed and gone already this was the dread companion of the haunted man  it took for some moments no more apparent heed of him than he of it  the christmas waits were playing somewhere in the distance and through his thoughtfulness he seemed to listen to the music it seemed to listen too  at length he spoke without moving or lifting up his face  here again he said  here again replied the phantom  i see you in the fire said the haunted man i hear you in music in the wind in the dead stillness of the night  the phantom moved its head assenting  why do you come to haunt me thus  i come as i am called replied the ghost  no  unbidden exclaimed the chemist  unbidden be it said the spectre  it is enough  i am here  hitherto the light of the fire had shone on the two facesif the dread lineaments behind the chair might be called a faceboth addressed towards it as at first and neither looking at the other  but now the haunted man turned suddenly and stared upon the ghost  the ghost as sudden in its motion passed to before the chair and stared on him  the living man and the animated image of himself dead might so have looked the one upon the other  an awful survey in a lonely and remote part of an empty old pile of building on a winter night with the loud wind going by upon its journey of mystery whence or whither no man knowing since the world beganand the stars in unimaginable millions glittering through it from eternal space where the worlds bulk is as a grain and its hoary age is infancy  look upon me said the spectre  i am he neglected in my youth and miserably poor who strove and suffered and still strove and suffered until i hewed out knowledge from the mine where it was buried and made rugged steps thereof for my worn feet to rest and rise on  i am that man returned the chemist  no mothers selfdenying love pursued the phantom no fathers counsel aided me  a stranger came into my fathers place when i was but a child and i was easily an alien from my mothers heart my parents at the best were of that sort whose care soon ends and whose duty is soon done who cast their offspring loose early as birds do theirs and if they do well claim the merit and if ill the pity  it paused and seemed to tempt and goad him with its look and with the manner of its speech and with its smile  i am he pursued the phantom who in this struggle upward found a friend  i made himwon himbound him to me  we worked together side by side  all the love and confidence that in my earlier youth had had no outlet and found no expression i bestowed on him  not all said redlaw hoarsely  no not all returned the phantom  i had a sister  the haunted man with his head resting on his hands replied i had  the phantom with an evil smile drew closer to the chair and resting its chin upon its folded hands its folded hands upon the back and looking down into his face with searching eyes that seemed instinct with fire went on  such glimpses of the light of home as i had ever known had streamed from her  how young she was how fair how loving  i took her to the first poor roof that i was master of and made it rich  she came into the darkness of my life and made it bright she is before me  i saw her in the fire but now  i hear her in music in the wind in the dead stillness of the night returned the haunted man  did he love her said the phantom echoing his contemplative tone  i think he did once  i am sure he did  better had she loved him lessless secretly less dearly from the shallower depths of a more divided heart  let me forget it said the chemist with an angry motion of his hand  let me blot it from my memory  the spectre without stirring and with its unwinking cruel eyes still fixed upon his face went on  a dream like hers stole upon my own life  it did said redlaw  a love as like hers pursued the phantom as my inferior nature might cherish arose in my own heart  i was too poor to bind its object to my fortune then by any thread of promise or entreaty  i loved her far too well to seek to do it  but more than ever i had striven in my life i strove to climb  only an inch gained brought me something nearer to the height  i toiled up  in the late pauses of my labour at that timemy sister sweet companion still sharing with me the expiring embers and the cooling hearthwhen day was breaking what pictures of the future did i see  i saw them in the fire but now he murmured  they come back to me in music in the wind in the dead stillness of the night in the revolving years  pictures of my own domestic life in aftertime with her who was the inspiration of my toil  pictures of my sister made the wife of my dear friend on equal termsfor he had some inheritance we nonepictures of our sobered age and mellowed happiness and of the golden links extending back so far that should bind us and our children in a radiant garland said the phantom  pictures said the haunted man that were delusions  why is it my doom to remember them too well  delusions echoed the phantom in its changeless voice and glaring on him with its changeless eyes  for my friend in whose breast my confidence was locked as in my own passing between me and the centre of the system of my hopes and struggles won her to himself and shattered my frail universe  my sister doubly dear doubly devoted doubly cheerful in my home lived on to see me famous and my old ambition so rewarded when its spring was broken and then  then died he interposed  died gentle as ever happy and with no concern but for her brother  peace  the phantom watched him silently  remembered said the haunted man after a pause  yes  so well remembered that even now when years have passed and nothing is more idle or more visionary to me than the boyish love so long outlived i think of it with sympathy as if it were a younger brothers or a sons  sometimes i even wonder when her heart first inclined to him and how it had been affected towards menot lightly once i thinkbut that is nothing  early unhappiness a wound from a hand i loved and trusted and a loss that nothing can replace outlive such fancies  thus said the phantom i bear within me a sorrow and a wrong thus i prey upon myself  thus memory is my curse and if i could forget my sorrow and my wrong i would  mocker said the chemist leaping up and making with a wrathful hand at the throat of his other self  why have i always that taunt in my ears  forbear exclaimed the spectre in an awful voice  lay a hand on me and die  he stopped midway as if its words had paralysed him and stood looking on it  it had glided from him it had its arm raised high in warning and a smile passed over its unearthly features as it reared its dark figure in triumph  if i could forget my sorrow and wrong i would the ghost repeated  if i could forget my sorrow and my wrong i would  evil spirit of myself returned the haunted man in a low trembling tone my life is darkened by that incessant whisper  it is an echo said the phantom  if it be an echo of my thoughtsas now indeed i know it is rejoined the haunted man why should i therefore be tormented it is not a selfish thought  i suffer it to range beyond myself all men and women have their sorrowsmost of them their wrongs ingratitude and sordid jealousy and interest besetting all degrees of life  who would not forget their sorrows and their wrongs  who would not truly and be happier and better for it said the phantom  these revolutions of years which we commemorate proceeded redlaw what do they recall  are there any minds in which they do not reawaken some sorrow or some trouble  what is the remembrance of the old man who was here tonight  a tissue of sorrow and trouble  but common natures said the phantom with its evil smile upon its glassy face unenlightened minds and ordinary spirits do not feel or reason on these things like men of higher cultivation and profounder thought  tempter answered redlaw whose hollow look and voice i dread more than words can express and from whom some dim foreshadowing of greater fear is stealing over me while i speak i hear again an echo of my own mind  receive it as a proof that i am powerful returned the ghost hear what i offer  forget the sorrow wrong and trouble you have known  forget them he repeated  i have the power to cancel their remembranceto leave but very faint confused traces of them that will die out soon returned the spectre  say  is it done  stay cried the haunted man arresting by a terrified gesture the uplifted hand  i tremble with distrust and doubt of you and the dim fear you cast upon me deepens into a nameless horror i can hardly beari would not deprive myself of any kindly recollection or any sympathy that is good for me or others  what shall i lose if i assent to this  what else will pass from my remembrance  no knowledge no result of study nothing but the intertwisted chain of feelings and associations each in its turn dependent on and nourished by the banished recollections  those will go  are they so many said the haunted man reflecting in alarm  they have been wont to show themselves in the fire in music in the wind in the dead stillness of the night in the revolving years returned the phantom scornfully  in nothing else  the phantom held its peace  but having stood before him silent for a little while it moved towards the fire then stopped  decide it said before the opportunity is lost  a moment  i call heaven to witness said the agitated man that i have never been a hater of any kindnever morose indifferent or hard to anything around me  if living here alone i have made too much of all that was and might have been and too little of what is the evil i believe has fallen on me and not on others but if there were poison in my body should i not possessed of antidotes and knowledge how to use them use them  if there be poison in my mind and through this fearful shadow i can cast it out shall i not cast it out  say said the spectre is it done  a moment longer he answered hurriedly  i would forget it if i could  have i thought that alone or has it been the thought of thousands upon thousands generation after generation  all human memory is fraught with sorrow and trouble  my memory is as the memory of other men but other men have not this choice  yes i close the bargain  yes  i will forget my sorrow wrong and trouble  say said the spectre is it done  it is  it is  and take this with you man whom i here renounce  the gift that i have given you shall give again go where you will without recovering yourself the power that you have yielded up you shall henceforth destroy its like in all whom you approach  your wisdom has discovered that the memory of sorrow wrong and trouble is the lot of all mankind and that mankind would be the happier in its other memories without it  go  be its benefactor  freed from such remembrance from this hour carry involuntarily the blessing of such freedom with you  its diffusion is inseparable and inalienable from you  go  be happy in the good you have won and in the good you do  the phantom which had held its bloodless hand above him while it spoke as if in some unholy invocation or some ban and which had gradually advanced its eyes so close to his that he could see how they did not participate in the terrible smile upon its face but were a fixed unalterable steady horror melted before him and was gone  as he stood rooted to the spot possessed by fear and wonder and imagining he heard repeated in melancholy echoes dying away fainter and fainter the words destroy its like in all whom you approach a shrill cry reached his ears  it came not from the passages beyond the door but from another part of the old building and sounded like the cry of some one in the dark who had lost the way  he looked confusedly upon his hands and limbs as if to be assured of his identity and then shouted in reply loudly and wildly for there was a strangeness and terror upon him as if he too were lost  the cry responding and being nearer he caught up the lamp and raised a heavy curtain in the wall by which he was accustomed to pass into and out of the theatre where he lecturedwhich adjoined his room  associated with youth and animation and a high amphitheatre of faces which his entrance charmed to interest in a moment it was a ghostly place when all this life was faded out of it and stared upon him like an emblem of death  halloa he cried  halloa  this way  come to the light when as he held the curtain with one hand and with the other raised the lamp and tried to pierce the gloom that filled the place something rushed past him into the room like a wildcat and crouched down in a corner  what is it he said hastily  he might have asked what is it even had he seen it well as presently he did when he stood looking at it gathered up in its corner  a bundle of tatters held together by a hand in size and form almost an infants but in its greedy desperate little clutch a bad old mans  a face rounded and smoothed by some halfdozen years but pinched and twisted by the experiences of a life bright eyes but not youthful  naked feet beautiful in their childish delicacyugly in the blood and dirt that cracked upon them  a baby savage a young monster a child who had never been a child a creature who might live to take the outward form of man but who within would live and perish a mere beast  used already to be worried and hunted like a beast the boy crouched down as he was looked at and looked back again and interposed his arm to ward off the expected blow  ill bite he said if you hit me  the time had been and not many minutes since when such a sight as this would have wrung the chemists heart  he looked upon it now coldly but with a heavy effort to remember somethinghe did not know whathe asked the boy what he did there and whence he came  wheres the woman he replied  i want to find the woman  who  the woman  her that brought me here and set me by the large fire  she was so long gone that i went to look for her and lost myself  i dont want you  i want the woman  he made a spring so suddenly to get away that the dull sound of his naked feet upon the floor was near the curtain when redlaw caught him by his rags  come you let me go muttered the boy struggling and clenching his teeth  ive done nothing to you  let me go will you to the woman  that is not the way  there is a nearer one said redlaw detaining him in the same blank effort to remember some association that ought of right to bear upon this monstrous object  what is your name  got none  where do you live  live  whats that  the boy shook his hair from his eyes to look at him for a moment and then twisting round his legs and wrestling with him broke again into his repetition of you let me go will you  i want to find the woman  the chemist led him to the door  this way he said looking at him still confusedly but with repugnance and avoidance growing out of his coldness  ill take you to her  the sharp eyes in the childs head wandering round the room lighted on the table where the remnants of the dinner were  give me some of that he said covetously  has she not fed you  i shall be hungry again tomorrow shant i  aint i hungry every day  finding himself released he bounded at the table like some small animal of prey and hugging to his breast bread and meat and his own rags all together said  there  now take me to the woman  as the chemist with a newborn dislike to touch him sternly motioned him to follow and was going out of the door he trembled and stopped  the gift that i have given you shall give again go where you will  the phantoms words were blowing in the wind and the wind blew chill upon him  ill not go there tonight he murmured faintly  ill go nowhere tonight  boy straight down this longarched passage and past the great dark door into the yardyou see the fire shining on the window there  the womans fire inquired the boy  he nodded and the naked feet had sprung away  he came back with his lamp locked his door hastily and sat down in his chair covering his face like one who was frightened at himself  for now he was indeed alone  alone alone    chapter iithe gift diffused    a small man sat in a small parlour partitioned off from a small shop by a small screen pasted all over with small scraps of newspapers  in company with the small man was almost any amount of small children you may please to nameat least it seemed so they made in that very limited sphere of action such an imposing effect in point of numbers  of these small fry two had by some strong machinery been got into bed in a corner where they might have reposed snugly enough in the sleep of innocence but for a constitutional propensity to keep awake and also to scuffle in and out of bed  the immediate occasion of these predatory dashes at the waking world was the construction of an oystershell wall in a corner by two other youths of tender age on which fortification the two in bed made harassing descents like those accursed picts and scots who beleaguer the early historical studies of most young britons and then withdrew to their own territory  in addition to the stir attendant on these inroads and the retorts of the invaded who pursued hotly and made lunges at the bed clothes under which the marauders took refuge another little boy in another little bed contributed his mite of confusion to the family stock by casting his boots upon the waters in other words by launching these and several small objects inoffensive in themselves though of a hard substance considered as missiles at the disturbers of his reposewho were not slow to return these compliments  besides which another little boythe biggest there but still littlewas tottering to and fro bent on one side and considerably affected in his knees by the weight of a large baby which he was supposed by a fiction that obtains sometimes in sanguine families to be hushing to sleep  but oh the inexhaustible regions of contemplation and watchfulness into which this babys eyes were then only beginning to compose themselves to stare over his unconscious shoulder  it was a very moloch of a baby on whose insatiate altar the whole existence of this particular young brother was offered up a daily sacrifice  its personality may be said to have consisted in its never being quiet in any one place for five consecutive minutes and never going to sleep when required  tetterbys baby was as well known in the neighbourhood as the postman or the potboy  it roved from doorstep to doorstep in the arms of little johnny tetterby and lagged heavily at the rear of troops of juveniles who followed the tumblers or the monkey and came up all on one side a little too late for everything that was attractive from monday morning until saturday night  wherever childhood congregated to play there was little moloch making johnny fag and toil  wherever johnny desired to stay little moloch became fractious and would not remain  whenever johnny wanted to go out moloch was asleep and must be watched  whenever johnny wanted to stay at home moloch was awake and must be taken out  yet johnny was verily persuaded that it was a faultless baby without its peer in the realm of england and was quite content to catch meek glimpses of things in general from behind its skirts or over its limp flapping bonnet and to go staggering about with it like a very little porter with a very large parcel which was not directed to anybody and could never be delivered anywhere  the small man who sat in the small parlour making fruitless attempts to read his newspaper peaceably in the midst of this disturbance was the father of the family and the chief of the firm described in the inscription over the little shop front by the name and title of a tetterby and co newsmen  indeed strictly speaking he was the only personage answering to that designation as co was a mere poetical abstraction altogether baseless and impersonal  tetterbys was the corner shop in jerusalem buildings  there was a good show of literature in the window chiefly consisting of picturenewspapers out of date and serial pirates and footpads walkingsticks likewise and marbles were included in the stock in trade  it had once extended into the light confectionery line but it would seem that those elegancies of life were not in demand about jerusalem buildings for nothing connected with that branch of commerce remained in the window except a sort of small glass lantern containing a languishing mass of bullseyes which had melted in the summer and congealed in the winter until all hope of ever getting them out or of eating them without eating the lantern too was gone for ever  tetterbys had tried its hand at several things  it had once made a feeble little dart at the toy business for in another lantern there was a heap of minute wax dolls all sticking together upside down in the direst confusion with their feet on one anothers heads and a precipitate of broken arms and legs at the bottom  it had made a move in the millinery direction which a few dry wiry bonnetshapes remained in a corner of the window to attest  it had fancied that a living might lie hidden in the tobacco trade and had stuck up a representation of a native of each of the three integral portions of the british empire in the act of consuming that fragrant weed with a poetic legend attached importing that united in one cause they sat and joked one chewed tobacco one took snuff one smoked  but nothing seemed to have come of itexcept flies  time had been when it had put a forlorn trust in imitative jewellery for in one pane of glass there was a card of cheap seals and another of pencilcases and a mysterious black amulet of inscrutable intention labelled ninepence  but to that hour jerusalem buildings had bought none of them  in short tetterbys had tried so hard to get a livelihood out of jerusalem buildings in one way or other and appeared to have done so indifferently in all that the best position in the firm was too evidently cos co as a bodiless creation being untroubled with the vulgar inconveniences of hunger and thirst being chargeable neither to the poorsrates nor the assessed taxes and having no young family to provide for  tetterby himself however in his little parlour as already mentioned having the presence of a young family impressed upon his mind in a manner too clamorous to be disregarded or to comport with the quiet perusal of a newspaper laid down his paper wheeled in his distraction a few times round the parlour like an undecided carrierpigeon made an ineffectual rush at one or two flying little figures in bedgowns that skimmed past him and then bearing suddenly down upon the only unoffending member of the family boxed the ears of little molochs nurse  you bad boy said mr tetterby havent you any feeling for your poor father after the fatigues and anxieties of a hard winters day since five oclock in the morning but must you wither his rest and corrode his latest intelligence with your wicious tricks  isnt it enough sir that your brother dolphus is toiling and moiling in the fog and cold and you rolling in the lap of luxury with awith a baby and everything you can wish for said mr tetterby heaping this up as a great climax of blessings but must you make a wilderness of home and maniacs of your parents  must you johnny  hey  at each interrogation mr tetterby made a feint of boxing his ears again but thought better of it and held his hand  oh father whimpered johnny when i wasnt doing anything im sure but taking such care of sally and getting her to sleep  oh father  i wish my little woman would come home said mr tetterby relenting and repenting i only wish my little woman would come home  i aint fit to deal with em  they make my head go round and get the better of me  oh johnny  isnt it enough that your dear mother has provided you with that sweet sister indicating moloch isnt it enough that you were seven boys before without a ray of gal and that your dear mother went through what she did go through on purpose that you might all of you have a little sister but must you so behave yourself as to make my head swim  softening more and more as his own tender feelings and those of his injured son were worked on mr tetterby concluded by embracing him and immediately breaking away to catch one of the real delinquents  a reasonably good start occurring he succeeded after a short but smart run and some rather severe crosscountry work under and over the bedsteads and in and out among the intricacies of the chairs in capturing this infant whom he condignly punished and bore to bed  this example had a powerful and apparently mesmeric influence on him of the boots who instantly fell into a deep sleep though he had been but a moment before broad awake and in the highest possible feather  nor was it lost upon the two young architects who retired to bed in an adjoining closet with great privacy and speed  the comrade of the intercepted one also shrinking into his nest with similar discretion mr tetterby when he paused for breath found himself unexpectedly in a scene of peace  my little woman herself said mr tetterby wiping his flushed face could hardly have done it better  i only wish my little woman had had it to do i do indeed  mr tetterby sought upon his screen for a passage appropriate to be impressed upon his childrens minds on the occasion and read the following  it is an undoubted fact that all remarkable men have had remarkable mothers and have respected them in after life as their best friends  think of your own remarkable mother my boys said mr tetterby and know her value while she is still among you  he sat down again in his chair by the fire and composed himself crosslegged over his newspaper  let anybody i dont care who it is get out of bed again said tetterby as a general proclamation delivered in a very soft hearted manner and astonishment will be the portion of that respected contemporarywhich expression mr tetterby selected from his screen  johnny my child take care of your only sister sally for shes the brightest gem that ever sparkled on your early brow  johnny sat down on a little stool and devotedly crushed himself beneath the weight of moloch  ah what a gift that baby is to you johnny said his father and how thankful you ought to be  it is not generally known johnny he was now referring to the screen again but it is a fact ascertained by accurate calculations that the following immense percentage of babies never attain to two years old that is to say  oh dont father please cried johnny  i cant bear it when i think of sally  mr tetterby desisting johnny with a profound sense of his trust wiped his eyes and hushed his sister  your brother dolphus said his father poking the fire is late tonight johnny and will come home like a lump of ice  whats got your precious mother  heres mother and dolphus too father exclaimed johnny i think  youre right returned his father listening  yes thats the footstep of my little woman  the process of induction by which mr tetterby had come to the conclusion that his wife was a little woman was his own secret she would have made two editions of himself very easily considered as an individual she was rather remarkable for being robust and portly but considered with reference to her husband her dimensions became magnificent  nor did they assume a less imposing proportion when studied with reference to the size of her seven sons who were but diminutive  in the case of sally however mrs tetterby had asserted herself at last as nobody knew better than the victim johnny who weighed and measured that exacting idol every hour in the day  mrs tetterby who had been marketing and carried a basket threw back her bonnet and shawl and sitting down fatigued commanded johnny to bring his sweet charge to her straightway for a kiss johnny having complied and gone back to his stool and again crushed himself master adolphus tetterby who had by this time unwound his torso out of a prismatic comforter apparently interminable requested the same favour  johnny having again complied and again gone back to his stool and again crushed himself mr tetterby struck by a sudden thought preferred the same claim on his own parental part  the satisfaction of this third desire completely exhausted the sacrifice who had hardly breath enough left to get back to his stool crush himself again and pant at his relations  whatever you do johnny said mrs tetterby shaking her head take care of her or never look your mother in the face again  nor your brother said adolphus  nor your father johnny added mr tetterby  johnny much affected by this conditional renunciation of him looked down at molochs eyes to see that they were all right so far and skilfully patted her back which was uppermost and rocked her with his foot  are you wet dolphus my boy said his father  come and take my chair and dry yourself  no father thankee said adolphus smoothing himself down with his hands  i ant very wet i dont think  does my face shine much father  well it does look waxy my boy returned mr tetterby  its the weather father said adolphus polishing his cheeks on the worn sleeve of his jacket  what with rain and sleet and wind and snow and fog my face gets quite brought out into a rash sometimes  and shines it doesoh dont it though  master adolphus was also in the newspaper line of life being employed by a more thriving firm than his father and co to vend newspapers at a railway station where his chubby little person like a shabbilydisguised cupid and his shrill little voice he was not much more than ten years old were as well known as the hoarse panting of the locomotives running in and out  his juvenility might have been at some loss for a harmless outlet in this early application to traffic but for a fortunate discovery he made of a means of entertaining himself and of dividing the long day into stages of interest without neglecting business  this ingenious invention remarkable like many great discoveries for its simplicity consisted in varying the first vowel in the word paper and substituting in its stead at different periods of the day all the other vowels in grammatical succession  thus before daylight in the wintertime he went to and fro in his little oilskin cap and cape and his big comforter piercing the heavy air with his cry of morning paper which about an hour before noon changed to morning pepper which at about two changed to morning pipper which in a couple of hours changed to morning popper and so declined with the sun into evening pupper to the great relief and comfort of this young gentlemans spirits  mrs tetterby his ladymother who had been sitting with her bonnet and shawl thrown back as aforesaid thoughtfully turning her weddingring round and round upon her finger now rose and divesting herself of her outofdoor attire began to lay the cloth for supper  ah dear me dear me dear me said mrs tetterby  thats the way the world goes  which is the way the world goes my dear asked mr tetterby looking round  oh nothing said mrs tetterby  mr tetterby elevated his eyebrows folded his newspaper afresh and carried his eyes up it and down it and across it but was wandering in his attention and not reading it  mrs tetterby at the same time laid the cloth but rather as if she were punishing the table than preparing the family supper hitting it unnecessarily hard with the knives and forks slapping it with the plates dinting it with the saltcellar and coming heavily down upon it with the loaf  ah dear me dear me dear me said mrs tetterby  thats the way the world goes  my duck returned her husband looking round again you said that before  which is the way the world goes  oh nothing said mrs tetterby  sophia remonstrated her husband you said that before too  well ill say it again if you like returned mrs tetterby  oh nothingthere  and again if you like oh nothingthere  and again if you like oh nothingnow then  mr tetterby brought his eye to bear upon the partner of his bosom and said in mild astonishment  my little woman what has put you out  im sure i dont know she retorted  dont ask me  who said i was put out at all  i never did  mr tetterby gave up the perusal of his newspaper as a bad job and taking a slow walk across the room with his hands behind him and his shoulders raisedhis gait according perfectly with the resignation of his manneraddressed himself to his two eldest offspring  your supper will be ready in a minute dolphus said mr tetterby  your mother has been out in the wet to the cooks shop to buy it  it was very good of your mother so to do  you shall get some supper too very soon johnny  your mothers pleased with you my man for being so attentive to your precious sister  mrs tetterby without any remark but with a decided subsidence of her animosity towards the table finished her preparations and took from her ample basket a substantial slab of hot pease pudding wrapped in paper and a basin covered with a saucer which on being uncovered sent forth an odour so agreeable that the three pair of eyes in the two beds opened wide and fixed themselves upon the banquet  mr tetterby without regarding this tacit invitation to be seated stood repeating slowly yes yes your supper will be ready in a minute dolphusyour mother went out in the wet to the cooks shop to buy it  it was very good of your mother so to dountil mrs tetterby who had been exhibiting sundry tokens of contrition behind him caught him round the neck and wept  oh dolphus said mrs tetterby how could i go and behave so  this reconciliation affected adolphus the younger and johnny to that degree that they both as with one accord raised a dismal cry which had the effect of immediately shutting up the round eyes in the beds and utterly routing the two remaining little tetterbys just then stealing in from the adjoining closet to see what was going on in the eating way  i am sure dolphus sobbed mrs tetterby coming home i had no more idea than a child unborn  mr tetterby seemed to dislike this figure of speech and observed say than the baby my dear  had no more idea than the baby said mrs tetterbyjohnny dont look at me but look at her or shell fall out of your lap and be killed and then youll die in agonies of a broken heart and serve you rightno more idea i hadnt than that darling of being cross when i came home but somehow dolphus  mrs tetterby paused and again turned her weddingring round and round upon her finger  i see said mr tetterby  i understand  my little woman was put out  hard times and hard weather and hard work make it trying now and then  i see bless your soul  no wonder  dolf my man continued mr tetterby exploring the basin with a fork heres your mother been and bought at the cooks shop besides pease pudding a whole knuckle of a lovely roast leg of pork with lots of crackling left upon it and with seasoning gravy and mustard quite unlimited  hand in your plate my boy and begin while its simmering  master adolphus needing no second summons received his portion with eyes rendered moist by appetite and withdrawing to his particular stool fell upon his supper tooth and nail  johnny was not forgotten but received his rations on bread lest he should in a flush of gravy trickle any on the baby  he was required for similar reasons to keep his pudding when not on active service in his pocket  there might have been more pork on the knucklebonewhich knucklebone the carver at the cooks shop had assuredly not forgotten in carving for previous customersbut there was no stint of seasoning and that is an accessory dreamily suggesting pork and pleasantly cheating the sense of taste  the pease pudding too the gravy and mustard like the eastern rose in respect of the nightingale if they were not absolutely pork had lived near it so upon the whole there was the flavour of a middlesized pig it was irresistible to the tetterbys in bed who though professing to slumber peacefully crawled out when unseen by their parents and silently appealed to their brothers for any gastronomic token of fraternal affection  they not hard of heart presenting scraps in return it resulted that a party of light skirmishers in nightgowns were careering about the parlour all through supper which harassed mr tetterby exceedingly and once or twice imposed upon him the necessity of a charge before which these guerilla troops retired in all directions and in great confusion  mrs tetterby did not enjoy her supper  there seemed to be something on mrs tetterbys mind  at one time she laughed without reason and at another time she cried without reason and at last she laughed and cried together in a manner so very unreasonable that her husband was confounded  my little woman said mr tetterby if the world goes that way it appears to go the wrong way and to choke you  give me a drop of water said mrs tetterby struggling with herself and dont speak to me for the present or take any notice of me  dont do it  mr tetterby having administered the water turned suddenly on the unlucky johnny who was full of sympathy and demanded why he was wallowing there in gluttony and idleness instead of coming forward with the baby that the sight of her might revive his mother  johnny immediately approached borne down by its weight but mrs tetterby holding out her hand to signify that she was not in a condition to bear that trying appeal to her feelings he was interdicted from advancing another inch on pain of perpetual hatred from all his dearest connections and accordingly retired to his stool again and crushed himself as before  after a pause mrs tetterby said she was better now and began to laugh  my little woman said her husband dubiously are you quite sure youre better  or are you sophia about to break out in a fresh direction  no dolphus no replied his wife  im quite myself  with that settling her hair and pressing the palms of her hands upon her eyes she laughed again  what a wicked fool i was to think so for a moment said mrs tetterby  come nearer dolphus and let me ease my mind and tell you what i mean  let me tell you all about it  mr tetterby bringing his chair closer mrs tetterby laughed again gave him a hug and wiped her eyes  you know dolphus my dear said mrs tetterby that when i was single i might have given myself away in several directions  at one time four after me at once two of them were sons of mars  were all sons of mas my dear said mr tetterby jointly with pas  i dont mean that replied his wife i mean soldiers serjeants  oh said mr tetterby  well dolphus im sure i never think of such things now to regret them and im sure ive got as good a husband and would do as much to prove that i was fond of him as  as any little woman in the world said mr tetterby  very good very good  if mr tetterby had been ten feet high he could not have expressed a gentler consideration for mrs tetterbys fairylike stature and if mrs tetterby had been two feet high she could not have felt it more appropriately her due  but you see dolphus said mrs tetterby this being christmas time when all people who can make holiday and when all people who have got money like to spend some i did somehow get a little out of sorts when i was in the streets just now  there were so many things to be soldsuch delicious things to eat such fine things to look at such delightful things to haveand there was so much calculating and calculating necessary before i durst lay out a sixpence for the commonest thing and the basket was so large and wanted so much in it and my stock of money was so small and would go such a little wayyou hate me dont you dolphus  not quite said mr tetterby as yet  well  ill tell you the whole truth pursued his wife penitently and then perhaps you will  i felt all this so much when i was trudging about in the cold and when i saw a lot of other calculating faces and large baskets trudging about too that i began to think whether i mightnt have done better and been happier ifihadnt the weddingring went round again and mrs tetterby shook her downcast head as she turned it  i see said her husband quietly if you hadnt married at all or if you had married somebody else  yes sobbed mrs tetterby  thats really what i thought  do you hate me now dolphus  why no said mr tetterby  i dont find that i do as yet  mrs tetterby gave him a thankful kiss and went on  i begin to hope you wont now dolphus though im afraid i havent told you the worst  i cant think what came over me  i dont know whether i was ill or mad or what i was but i couldnt call up anything that seemed to bind us to each other or to reconcile me to my fortune  all the pleasures and enjoyments we had ever hadthey seemed so poor and insignificant i hated them i could have trodden on them  and i could think of nothing else except our being poor and the number of mouths there were at home  well well my dear said mr tetterby shaking her hand encouragingly thats truth after all  we are poor and there are a number of mouths at home here  ah but dolf dolf cried his wife laying her hands upon his neck my good kind patient fellow when i had been at home a very little whilehow different  oh dolf dear how different it was  i felt as if there was a rush of recollection on me all at once that softened my hard heart and filled it up till it was bursting  all our struggles for a livelihood all our cares and wants since we have been married all the times of sickness all the hours of watching we have ever had by one another or by the children seemed to speak to me and say that they had made us one and that i never might have been or could have been or would have been any other than the wife and mother i am  then the cheap enjoyments that i could have trodden on so cruelly got to be so precious to meoh so priceless and dearthat i couldnt bear to think how much i had wronged them and i said and say again a hundred times how could i ever behave so dolphus how could i ever have the heart to do it  the good woman quite carried away by her honest tenderness and remorse was weeping with all her heart when she started up with a scream and ran behind her husband  her cry was so terrified that the children started from their sleep and from their beds and clung about her  nor did her gaze belie her voice as she pointed to a pale man in a black cloak who had come into the room  look at that man  look there  what does he want  my dear returned her husband ill ask him if youll let me go whats the matter  how you shake  i saw him in the street when i was out just now  he looked at me and stood near me  i am afraid of him  afraid of him  why  i dont know whyistop husband for he was going towards the stranger  she had one hand pressed upon her forehead and one upon her breast and there was a peculiar fluttering all over her and a hurried unsteady motion of her eyes as if she had lost something  are you ill my dear  what is it that is going from me again she muttered in a low voice  what is this that is going away  then she abruptly answered   ill  no i am quite well and stood looking vacantly at the floor  her husband who had not been altogether free from the infection of her fear at first and whom the present strangeness of her manner did not tend to reassure addressed himself to the pale visitor in the black cloak who stood still and whose eyes were bent upon the ground  what may be your pleasure sir he asked with us  i fear that my coming in unperceived returned the visitor has alarmed you but you were talking and did not hear me  my little woman saysperhaps you heard her say it returned mr tetterby that its not the first time you have alarmed her to night  i am sorry for it  i remember to have observed her for a few moments only in the street  i had no intention of frightening her  as he raised his eyes in speaking she raised hers  it was extraordinary to see what dread she had of him and with what dread he observed itand yet how narrowly and closely  my name he said is redlaw  i come from the old college hard by  a young gentleman who is a student there lodges in your house does he not  mr denham said tetterby  yes  it was a natural action and so slight as to be hardly noticeable but the little man before speaking again passed his hand across his forehead and looked quickly round the room as though he were sensible of some change in its atmosphere  the chemist instantly transferring to him the look of dread he had directed towards the wife stepped back and his face turned paler  the gentlemans room said tetterby is upstairs sir  theres a more convenient private entrance but as you have come in here it will save your going out into the cold if youll take this little staircase showing one communicating directly with the parlour and go up to him that way if you wish to see him  yes i wish to see him said the chemist  can you spare a light  the watchfulness of his haggard look and the inexplicable distrust that darkened it seemed to trouble mr tetterby  he paused and looking fixedly at him in return stood for a minute or so like a man stupefied or fascinated  at length he said ill light you sir if youll follow me  no replied the chemist i dont wish to be attended or announced to him  he does not expect me  i would rather go alone please to give me the light if you can spare it and ill find the way  in the quickness of his expression of this desire and in taking the candle from the newsman he touched him on the breast withdrawing his hand hastily almost as though he had wounded him by accident for he did not know in what part of himself his new power resided or how it was communicated or how the manner of its reception varied in different persons he turned and ascended the stair  but when he reached the top he stopped and looked down  the wife was standing in the same place twisting her ring round and round upon her finger  the husband with his head bent forward on his breast was musing heavily and sullenly  the children still clustering about the mother gazed timidly after the visitor and nestled together when they saw him looking down  come said the father roughly  theres enough of this  get to bed here  the place is inconvenient and small enough the mother added without you  get to bed  the whole brood scared and sad crept away little johnny and the baby lagging last  the mother glancing contemptuously round the sordid room and tossing from her the fragments of their meal stopped on the threshold of her task of clearing the table and sat down pondering idly and dejectedly  the father betook himself to the chimneycorner and impatiently raking the small fire together bent over it as if he would monopolise it all  they did not interchange a word  the chemist paler than before stole upward like a thief looking back upon the change below and dreading equally to go on or return  what have i done he said confusedly  what am i going to do  to be the benefactor of mankind he thought he heard a voice reply  he looked round but there was nothing there and a passage now shutting out the little parlour from his view he went on directing his eyes before him at the way he went  it is only since last night he muttered gloomily that i have remained shut up and yet all things are strange to me  i am strange to myself  i am here as in a dream  what interest have i in this place or in any place that i can bring to my remembrance my mind is going blind  there was a door before him and he knocked at it  being invited by a voice within to enter he complied  is that my kind nurse said the voice  but i need not ask her there is no one else to come here  it spoke cheerfully though in a languid tone and attracted his attention to a young man lying on a couch drawn before the chimneypiece with the back towards the door  a meagre scanty stove pinched and hollowed like a sick mans cheeks and bricked into the centre of a hearth that it could scarcely warm contained the fire to which his face was turned  being so near the windy housetop it wasted quickly and with a busy sound and the burning ashes dropped down fast  they chink when they shoot out here said the student smiling so according to the gossips they are not coffins but purses  i shall be well and rich yet some day if it please god and shall live perhaps to love a daughter milly in remembrance of the kindest nature and the gentlest heart in the world  he put up his hand as if expecting her to take it but being weakened he lay still with his face resting on his other hand and did not turn round  the chemist glanced about the roomat the students books and papers piled upon a table in a corner where they and his extinguished readinglamp now prohibited and put away told of the attentive hours that had gone before this illness and perhaps caused itat such signs of his old health and freedom as the outofdoor attire that hung idle on the wallat those remembrances of other and less solitary scenes the little miniatures upon the chimneypiece and the drawing of homeat that token of his emulation perhaps in some sort of his personal attachment too the framed engraving of himself the lookeron the time had been only yesterday when not one of these objects in its remotest association of interest with the living figure before him would have been lost on redlaw  now they were but objects or if any gleam of such connexion shot upon him it perplexed and not enlightened him as he stood looking round with a dull wonder  the student recalling the thin hand which had remained so long untouched raised himself on the couch and turned his head  mr redlaw he exclaimed and started up  redlaw put out his arm  dont come nearer to me  i will sit here  remain you where you are  he sat down on a chair near the door and having glanced at the young man standing leaning with his hand upon the couch spoke with his eyes averted towards the ground  i heard by an accident by what accident is no matter that one of my class was ill and solitary  i received no other description of him than that he lived in this street  beginning my inquiries at the first house in it i have found him  i have been ill sir returned the student not merely with a modest hesitation but with a kind of awe of him but am greatly better  an attack of feverof the brain i believehas weakened me but i am much better  i cannot say i have been solitary in my illness or i should forget the ministering hand that has been near me  you are speaking of the keepers wife said redlaw  yes  the student bent his head as if he rendered her some silent homage  the chemist in whom there was a cold monotonous apathy which rendered him more like a marble image on the tomb of the man who had started from his dinner yesterday at the first mention of this students case than the breathing man himself glanced again at the student leaning with his hand upon the couch and looked upon the ground and in the air as if for light for his blinded mind  i remembered your name he said when it was mentioned to me down stairs just now and i recollect your face  we have held but very little personal communication together  very little  you have retired and withdrawn from me more than any of the rest i think  the student signified assent  and why said the chemist not with the least expression of interest but with a moody wayward kind of curiosity  why  how comes it that you have sought to keep especially from me the knowledge of your remaining here at this season when all the rest have dispersed and of your being ill  i want to know why this is  the young man who had heard him with increasing agitation raised his downcast eyes to his face and clasping his hands together cried with sudden earnestness and with trembling lips  mr redlaw  you have discovered me  you know my secret  secret said the chemist harshly  i know  yes  your manner so different from the interest and sympathy which endear you to so many hearts your altered voice the constraint there is in everything you say and in your looks replied the student warn me that you know me  that you would conceal it even now is but a proof to me god knows i need none of your natural kindness and of the bar there is between us  a vacant and contemptuous laugh was all his answer  but mr redlaw said the student as a just man and a good man think how innocent i am except in name and descent of participation in any wrong inflicted on you or in any sorrow you have borne  sorrow said redlaw laughing  wrong  what are those to me  for heavens sake entreated the shrinking student do not let the mere interchange of a few words with me change you like this sir  let me pass again from your knowledge and notice  let me occupy my old reserved and distant place among those whom you instruct  know me only by the name i have assumed and not by that of longford  longford exclaimed the other  he clasped his head with both his hands and for a moment turned upon the young man his own intelligent and thoughtful face  but the light passed from it like the sunbeam of an instant and it clouded as before  the name my mother bears sir faltered the young man the name she took when she might perhaps have taken one more honoured mr redlaw hesitating i believe i know that history  where my information halts my guesses at what is wanting may supply something not remote from the truth  i am the child of a marriage that has not proved itself a wellassorted or a happy one  from infancy i have heard you spoken of with honour and respectwith something that was almost reverence  i have heard of such devotion of such fortitude and tenderness of such rising up against the obstacles which press men down that my fancy since i learnt my little lesson from my mother has shed a lustre on your name  at last a poor student myself from whom could i learn but you  redlaw unmoved unchanged and looking at him with a staring frown answered by no word or sign  i cannot say pursued the other i should try in vain to say how much it has impressed me and affected me to find the gracious traces of the past in that certain power of winning gratitude and confidence which is associated among us students among the humblest of us most with mr redlaws generous name  our ages and positions are so different sir and i am so accustomed to regard you from a distance that i wonder at my own presumption when i touch however lightly on that theme  but to one whoi may say who felt no common interest in my mother onceit may be something to hear now that all is past with what indescribable feelings of affection i have in my obscurity regarded him with what pain and reluctance i have kept aloof from his encouragement when a word of it would have made me rich yet how i have felt it fit that i should hold my course content to know him and to be unknown  mr redlaw said the student faintly what i would have said i have said ill for my strength is strange to me as yet but for anything unworthy in this fraud of mine forgive me and for all the rest forget me  the staring frown remained on redlaws face and yielded to no other expression until the student with these words advanced towards him as if to touch his hand when he drew back and cried to him  dont come nearer to me  the young man stopped shocked by the eagerness of his recoil and by the sternness of his repulsion and he passed his hand thoughtfully across his forehead  the past is past said the chemist  it dies like the brutes who talks to me of its traces in my life  he raves or lies  what have i to do with your distempered dreams  if you want money here it is  i came to offer it and that is all i came for  there can be nothing else that brings me here he muttered holding his head again with both his hands  there can be nothing else and yet  he had tossed his purse upon the table  as he fell into this dim cogitation with himself the student took it up and held it out to him  take it back sir he said proudly though not angrily  i wish you could take from me with it the remembrance of your words and offer  you do he retorted with a wild light in his eyes  you do  i do  the chemist went close to him for the first time and took the purse and turned him by the arm and looked him in the face  there is sorrow and trouble in sickness is there not he demanded with a laugh  the wondering student answered yes  in its unrest in its anxiety in its suspense in all its train of physical and mental miseries said the chemist with a wild unearthly exultation  all best forgotten are they not  the student did not answer but again passed his hand confusedly across his forehead  redlaw still held him by the sleeve when millys voice was heard outside  i can see very well now she said thank you dolf  dont cry dear  father and mother will be comfortable again tomorrow and home will be comfortable too  a gentleman with him is there  redlaw released his hold as he listened  i have feared from the first moment he murmured to himself to meet her  there is a steady quality of goodness in her that i dread to influence  i may be the murderer of what is tenderest and best within her bosom  she was knocking at the door  shall i dismiss it as an idle foreboding or still avoid her he muttered looking uneasily around  she was knocking at the door again  of all the visitors who could come here he said in a hoarse alarmed voice turning to his companion this is the one i should desire most to avoid  hide me  the student opened a frail door in the wall communicating where the garretroof began to slope towards the floor with a small inner room  redlaw passed in hastily and shut it after him  the student then resumed his place upon the couch and called to her to enter  dear mr edmund said milly looking round they told me there was a gentleman here  there is no one here but i  there has been some one  yes yes there has been some one  she put her little basket on the table and went up to the back of the couch as if to take the extended handbut it was not there a little surprised in her quiet way she leaned over to look at his face and gently touched him on the brow  are you quite as well tonight  your head is not so cool as in the afternoon  tut said the student petulantly very little ails me  a little more surprise but no reproach was expressed in her face as she withdrew to the other side of the table and took a small packet of needlework from her basket  but she laid it down again on second thoughts and going noiselessly about the room set everything exactly in its place and in the neatest order even to the cushions on the couch which she touched with so light a hand that he hardly seemed to know it as he lay looking at the fire when all this was done and she had swept the hearth she sat down in her modest little bonnet to her work and was quietly busy on it directly  its the new muslin curtain for the window mr edmund said milly stitching away as she talked  it will look very clean and nice though it costs very little and will save your eyes too from the light  my william says the room should not be too light just now when you are recovering so well or the glare might make you giddy  he said nothing but there was something so fretful and impatient in his change of position that her quick fingers stopped and she looked at him anxiously  the pillows are not comfortable she said laying down her work and rising  i will soon put them right  they are very well he answered  leave them alone pray  you make so much of everything  he raised his head to say this and looked at her so thanklessly that after he had thrown himself down again she stood timidly pausing  however she resumed her seat and her needle without having directed even a murmuring look towards him and was soon as busy as before  i have been thinking mr edmund that you have been often thinking of late when i have been sitting by how true the saying is that adversity is a good teacher  health will be more precious to you after this illness than it has ever been  and years hence when this time of year comes round and you remember the days when you lay here sick alone that the knowledge of your illness might not afflict those who are dearest to you your home will be doubly dear and doubly blest  now isnt that a good true thing  she was too intent upon her work and too earnest in what she said and too composed and quiet altogether to be on the watch for any look he might direct towards her in reply so the shaft of his ungrateful glance fell harmless and did not wound her  ah said milly with her pretty head inclining thoughtfully on one side as she looked down following her busy fingers with her eyes  even on meand i am very different from you mr edmund for i have no learning and dont know how to think properlythis view of such things has made a great impression since you have been lying ill  when i have seen you so touched by the kindness and attention of the poor people down stairs i have felt that you thought even that experience some repayment for the loss of health and i have read in your face as plain as if it was a book that but for some trouble and sorrow we should never know half the good there is about us  his getting up from the couch interrupted her or she was going on to say more  we neednt magnify the merit mrs william he rejoined slightingly  the people down stairs will be paid in good time i dare say for any little extra service they may have rendered me and perhaps they anticipate no less  i am much obliged to you too  her fingers stopped and she looked at him  i cant be made to feel the more obliged by your exaggerating the case he said  i am sensible that you have been interested in me and i say i am much obliged to you  what more would you have  her work fell on her lap as she still looked at him walking to and fro with an intolerant air and stopping now and then  i say again i am much obliged to you  why weaken my sense of what is your due in obligation by preferring enormous claims upon me  trouble sorrow affliction adversity  one might suppose i had been dying a score of deaths here  do you believe mr edmund she asked rising and going nearer to him that i spoke of the poor people of the house with any reference to myself  to me laying her hand upon her bosom with a simple and innocent smile of astonishment  oh  i think nothing about it my good creature he returned  i have had an indisposition which your solicitudeobserve i say solicitudemakes a great deal more of than it merits and its over and we cant perpetuate it  he coldly took a book and sat down at the table  she watched him for a little while until her smile was quite gone and then returning to where her basket was said gently  mr edmund would you rather be alone  there is no reason why i should detain you here he replied  except said milly hesitating and showing her work  oh the curtain he answered with a supercilious laugh  thats not worth staying for  she made up the little packet again and put it in her basket then standing before him with such an air of patient entreaty that he could not choose but look at her she said  if you should want me i will come back willingly  when you did want me i was quite happy to come there was no merit in it  i think you must be afraid that now you are getting well i may be troublesome to you but i should not have been indeed  i should have come no longer than your weakness and confinement lasted  you owe me nothing but it is right that you should deal as justly by me as if i was a ladyeven the very lady that you love and if you suspect me of meanly making much of the little i have tried to do to comfort your sick room you do yourself more wrong than ever you can do me  that is why i am sorry  that is why i am very sorry  if she had been as passionate as she was quiet as indignant as she was calm as angry in her look as she was gentle as loud of tone as she was low and clear she might have left no sense of her departure in the room compared with that which fell upon the lonely student when she went away  he was gazing drearily upon the place where she had been when redlaw came out of his concealment and came to the door  when sickness lays its hand on you again he said looking fiercely back at him may it be soondie here  rot here  what have you done returned the other catching at his cloak what change have you wrought in me  what curse have you brought upon me  give me back myself  give me back myself exclaimed redlaw like a madman  i am infected  i am infectious  i am charged with poison for my own mind and the minds of all mankind  where i felt interest compassion sympathy i am turning into stone  selfishness and ingratitude spring up in my blighting footsteps  i am only so much less base than the wretches whom i make so that in the moment of their transformation i can hate them  as he spokethe young man still holding to his cloakhe cast him off and struck him  then wildly hurried out into the night air where the wind was blowing the snow falling the clouddrift sweeping on the moon dimly shining and where blowing in the wind falling with the snow drifting with the clouds shining in the moonlight and heavily looming in the darkness were the phantoms words the gift that i have given you shall give again go where you will  whither he went he neither knew nor cared so that he avoided company  the change he felt within him made the busy streets a desert and himself a desert and the multitude around him in their manifold endurances and ways of life a mighty waste of sand which the winds tossed into unintelligible heaps and made a ruinous confusion of  those traces in his breast which the phantom had told him would die out soon were not as yet so far upon their way to death but that he understood enough of what he was and what he made of others to desire to be alone  this put it in his mindhe suddenly bethought himself as he was going along of the boy who had rushed into his room  and then he recollected that of those with whom he had communicated since the phantoms disappearance that boy alone had shown no sign of being changed  monstrous and odious as the wild thing was to him he determined to seek it out and prove if this were really so and also to seek it with another intention which came into his thoughts at the same time  so resolving with some difficulty where he was he directed his steps back to the old college and to that part of it where the general porch was and where alone the pavement was worn by the tread of the students feet  the keepers house stood just within the iron gates forming a part of the chief quadrangle  there was a little cloister outside and from that sheltered place he knew he could look in at the window of their ordinary room and see who was within  the iron gates were shut but his hand was familiar with the fastening and drawing it back by thrusting in his wrist between the bars he passed through softly shut it again and crept up to the window crumbling the thin crust of snow with his feet  the fire to which he had directed the boy last night shining brightly through the glass made an illuminated place upon the ground  instinctively avoiding this and going round it he looked in at the window  at first he thought that there was no one there and that the blaze was reddening only the old beams in the ceiling and the dark walls but peering in more narrowly he saw the object of his search coiled asleep before it on the floor  he passed quickly to the door opened it and went in  the creature lay in such a fiery heat that as the chemist stooped to rouse him it scorched his head  so soon as he was touched the boy not half awake clutching his rags together with the instinct of flight upon him half rolled and half ran into a distant corner of the room where heaped upon the ground he struck his foot out to defend himself  get up said the chemist  you have not forgotten me  you let me alone returned the boy  this is the womans house not yours  the chemists steady eye controlled him somewhat or inspired him with enough submission to be raised upon his feet and looked at  who washed them and put those bandages where they were bruised and cracked asked the chemist pointing to their altered state  the woman did  and is it she who has made you cleaner in the face too  yes the woman  redlaw asked these questions to attract his eyes towards himself and with the same intent now held him by the chin and threw his wild hair back though he loathed to touch him  the boy watched his eyes keenly as if he thought it needful to his own defence not knowing what he might do next and redlaw could see well that no change came over him  where are they he inquired  the womans out  i know she is  where is the old man with the white hair and his son  the womans husband dye mean inquired the boy  ay  where are those two  out  somethings the matter somewhere  they were fetched out in a hurry and told me to stop here  come with me said the chemist and ill give you money  come where and how much will you give  ill give you more shillings than you ever saw and bring you back soon  do you know your way to where you came from  you let me go returned the boy suddenly twisting out of his grasp  im not a going to take you there  let me be or ill heave some fire at you  he was down before it and ready with his savage little hand to pluck the burning coals out  what the chemist had felt in observing the effect of his charmed influence stealing over those with whom he came in contact was not nearly equal to the cold vague terror with which he saw this baby monster put it at defiance  it chilled his blood to look on the immovable impenetrable thing in the likeness of a child with its sharp malignant face turned up to his and its almost infant hand ready at the bars  listen boy he said  you shall take me where you please so that you take me where the people are very miserable or very wicked  i want to do them good and not to harm them  you shall have money as i have told you and i will bring you back  get up come quickly  he made a hasty step towards the door afraid of her returning  will you let me walk by myself and never hold me nor yet touch me said the boy slowly withdrawing the hand with which he threatened and beginning to get up  i will  and let me go before behind or anyways i like  i will  give me some money first then and go  the chemist laid a few shillings one by one in his extended hand to count them was beyond the boys knowledge but he said one every time and avariciously looked at each as it was given and at the donor  he had nowhere to put them out of his hand but in his mouth and he put them there  redlaw then wrote with his pencil on a leaf of his pocketbook that the boy was with him and laying it on the table signed to him to follow  keeping his rags together as usual the boy complied and went out with his bare head and naked feet into the winter night  preferring not to depart by the iron gate by which he had entered where they were in danger of meeting her whom he so anxiously avoided the chemist led the way through some of those passages among which the boy had lost himself and by that portion of the building where he lived to a small door of which he had the key when they got into the street he stopped to ask his guidewho instantly retreated from himif he knew where they were  the savage thing looked here and there and at length nodding his head pointed in the direction he designed to take  redlaw going on at once he followed something less suspiciously shifting his money from his mouth into his hand and back again into his mouth and stealthily rubbing it bright upon his shreds of dress as he went along  three times in their progress they were side by side  three times they stopped being side by side  three times the chemist glanced down at his face and shuddered as it forced upon him one reflection  the first occasion was when they were crossing an old churchyard and redlaw stopped among the graves utterly at a loss how to connect them with any tender softening or consolatory thought  the second was when the breaking forth of the moon induced him to look up at the heavens where he saw her in her glory surrounded by a host of stars he still knew by the names and histories which human science has appended to them but where he saw nothing else he had been wont to see felt nothing he had been wont to feel in looking up there on a bright night  the third was when he stopped to listen to a plaintive strain of music but could only hear a tune made manifest to him by the dry mechanism of the instruments and his own ears with no address to any mystery within him without a whisper in it of the past or of the future powerless upon him as the sound of last years running water or the rushing of last years wind  at each of these three times he saw with horror that in spite of the vast intellectual distance between them and their being unlike each other in all physical respects the expression on the boys face was the expression on his own  they journeyed on for some timenow through such crowded places that he often looked over his shoulder thinking he had lost his guide but generally finding him within his shadow on his other side now by ways so quiet that he could have counted his short quick naked footsteps coming on behinduntil they arrived at a ruinous collection of houses and the boy touched him and stopped  in there he said pointing out one house where there were shattered lights in the windows and a dim lantern in the doorway with lodgings for travellers painted on it  redlaw looked about him from the houses to the waste piece of ground on which the houses stood or rather did not altogether tumble down unfenced undrained unlighted and bordered by a sluggish ditch from that to the sloping line of arches part of some neighbouring viaduct or bridge with which it was surrounded and which lessened gradually towards them until the last but one was a mere kennel for a dog the last a plundered little heap of bricks from that to the child close to him cowering and trembling with the cold and limping on one little foot while he coiled the other round his leg to warm it yet staring at all these things with that frightful likeness of expression so apparent in his face that redlaw started from him  in there said the boy pointing out the house again  ill wait  will they let me in asked redlaw  say youre a doctor he answered with a nod  theres plenty ill here  looking back on his way to the housedoor redlaw saw him trail himself upon the dust and crawl within the shelter of the smallest arch as if he were a rat  he had no pity for the thing but he was afraid of it and when it looked out of its den at him he hurried to the house as a retreat  sorrow wrong and trouble said the chemist with a painful effort at some more distinct remembrance at least haunt this place darkly  he can do no harm who brings forgetfulness of such things here  with these words he pushed the yielding door and went in  there was a woman sitting on the stairs either asleep or forlorn whose head was bent down on her hands and knees  as it was not easy to pass without treading on her and as she was perfectly regardless of his near approach he stopped and touched her on the shoulder  looking up she showed him quite a young face but one whose bloom and promise were all swept away as if the haggard winter should unnaturally kill the spring  with little or no show of concern on his account she moved nearer to the wall to leave him a wider passage  what are you said redlaw pausing with his hand upon the broken stairrail  what do you think i am she answered showing him her face again  he looked upon the ruined temple of god so lately made so soon disfigured and something which was not compassionfor the springs in which a true compassion for such miseries has its rise were dried up in his breastbut which was nearer to it for the moment than any feeling that had lately struggled into the darkening but not yet wholly darkened night of his mindmingled a touch of softness with his next words  i am come here to give relief if i can he said  are you thinking of any wrong  she frowned at him and then laughed and then her laugh prolonged itself into a shivering sigh as she dropped her head again and hid her fingers in her hair  are you thinking of a wrong he asked once more  i am thinking of my life she said with a monetary look at him  he had a perception that she was one of many and that he saw the type of thousands when he saw her drooping at his feet  what are your parents he demanded  i had a good home once  my father was a gardener far away in the country  is he dead  hes dead to me  all such things are dead to me  you a gentleman and not know that  she raised her eyes again and laughed at him  girl said redlaw sternly before this death of all such things was brought about was there no wrong done to you  in spite of all that you can do does no remembrance of wrong cleave to you  are there not times upon times when it is misery to you  so little of what was womanly was left in her appearance that now when she burst into tears he stood amazed  but he was more amazed and much disquieted to note that in her awakened recollection of this wrong the first trace of her old humanity and frozen tenderness appeared to show itself  he drew a little off and in doing so observed that her arms were black her face cut and her bosom bruised  what brutal hand has hurt you so he asked  my own  i did it myself she answered quickly  it is impossible  ill swear i did  he didnt touch me  i did it to myself in a passion and threw myself down here  he wasnt near me  he never laid a hand upon me  in the white determination of her face confronting him with this untruth he saw enough of the last perversion and distortion of good surviving in that miserable breast to be stricken with remorse that he had ever come near her  sorrow wrong and trouble he muttered turning his fearful gaze away  all that connects her with the state from which she has fallen has those roots  in the name of god let me go by  afraid to look at her again afraid to touch her afraid to think of having sundered the last thread by which she held upon the mercy of heaven he gathered his cloak about him and glided swiftly up the stairs  opposite to him on the landing was a door which stood partly open and which as he ascended a man with a candle in his hand came forward from within to shut  but this man on seeing him drew back with much emotion in his manner and as if by a sudden impulse mentioned his name aloud  in the surprise of such a recognition there he stopped endeavouring to recollect the wan and startled face  he had no time to consider it for to his yet greater amazement old philip came out of the room and took him by the hand  mr redlaw said the old man this is like you this is like you sir you have heard of it and have come after us to render any help you can  ah too late too late  redlaw with a bewildered look submitted to be led into the room a man lay there on a trucklebed and william swidger stood at the bedside  too late murmured the old man looking wistfully into the chemists face and the tears stole down his cheeks  thats what i say father interposed his son in a low voice thats where it is exactly  to keep as quiet as ever we can while hes a dozing is the only thing to do  youre right father  redlaw paused at the bedside and looked down on the figure that was stretched upon the mattress  it was that of a man who should have been in the vigour of his life but on whom it was not likely the sun would ever shine again  the vices of his forty or fifty years career had so branded him that in comparison with their effects upon his face the heavy hand of time upon the old mans face who watched him had been merciful and beautifying  who is this asked the chemist looking round  my son george mr redlaw said the old man wringing his hands my eldest son george who was more his mothers pride than all the rest  redlaws eyes wandered from the old mans grey head as he laid it down upon the bed to the person who had recognised him and who had kept aloof in the remotest corner of the room  he seemed to be about his own age and although he knew no such hopeless decay and broken man as he appeared to be there was something in the turn of his figure as he stood with his back towards him and now went out at the door that made him pass his hand uneasily across his brow  william he said in a gloomy whisper who is that man  why you see sir returned mr william thats what i say myself  why should a man ever go and gamble and the like of that and let himself down inch by inch till he cant let himself down any lower  has he done so asked redlaw glancing after him with the same uneasy action as before  just exactly that sir returned william swidger as im told he knows a little about medicine sir it seems and having been wayfaring towards london with my unhappy brother that you see here mr william passed his coatsleeve across his eyes and being lodging up stairs for the nightwhat i say you see is that strange companions come together here sometimeshe looked in to attend upon him and came for us at his request  what a mournful spectacle sir  but thats where it is  its enough to kill my father  redlaw looked up at these words and recalling where he was and with whom and the spell he carried with himwhich his surprise had obscuredretired a little hurriedly debating with himself whether to shun the house that moment or remain  yielding to a certain sullen doggedness which it seemed to be a part of his condition to struggle with he argued for remaining  was it only yesterday he said when i observed the memory of this old man to be a tissue of sorrow and trouble and shall i be afraid tonight to shake it  are such remembrances as i can drive away so precious to this dying man that i need fear for him no  ill stay here  but he stayed in fear and trembling none the less for these words and shrouded in his black cloak with his face turned from them stood away from the bedside listening to what they said as if he felt himself a demon in the place  father murmured the sick man rallying a little from stupor  my boy  my son george said old philip  you spoke just now of my being mothers favourite long ago its a dreadful thing to think now of long ago  no no no returned the old man  think of it  dont say its dreadful  its not dreadful to me my son  it cuts you to the heart father  for the old mans tears were falling on him  yes yes said philip so it does but it does me good  its a heavy sorrow to think of that time but it does me good george oh think of it too think of it too and your heart will be softened more and more  wheres my son william  william my boy your mother loved him dearly to the last and with her latest breath said tell him i forgave him blessed him and prayed for him  those were her words to me  i have never forgotten them and im eightyseven  father said the man upon the bed i am dying i know  i am so far gone that i can hardly speak even of what my mind most runs on  is there any hope for me beyond this bed  there is hope returned the old man for all who are softened and penitent  there is hope for all such  oh he exclaimed clasping his hands and looking up i was thankful only yesterday that i could remember this unhappy son when he was an innocent child  but what a comfort it is now to think that even god himself has that remembrance of him  redlaw spread his hands upon his face and shrank like a murderer  ah feebly moaned the man upon the bed  the waste since then the waste of life since then  but he was a child once said the old man  he played with children  before he lay down on his bed at night and fell into his guiltless rest he said his prayers at his poor mothers knee i have seen him do it many a time and seen her lay his head upon her breast and kiss him  sorrowful as it was to her and me to think of this when he went so wrong and when our hopes and plans for him were all broken this gave him still a hold upon us that nothing else could have given  oh father so much better than the fathers upon earth  oh father so much more afflicted by the errors of thy children take this wanderer back  not as he is but as he was then let him cry to thee as he has so often seemed to cry to us  as the old man lifted up his trembling hands the son for whom he made the supplication laid his sinking head against him for support and comfort as if he were indeed the child of whom he spoke  when did man ever tremble as redlaw trembled in the silence that ensued  he knew it must come upon them knew that it was coming fast  my time is very short my breath is shorter said the sick man supporting himself on one arm and with the other groping in the air and i remember there is something on my mind concerning the man who was here just now father and williamwaitis there really anything in black out there  yes yes it is real said his aged father  is it a man  what i say myself george interposed his brother bending kindly over him  its mr redlaw  i thought i had dreamed of him  ask him to come here  the chemist whiter than the dying man appeared before him obedient to the motion of his hand he sat upon the bed  it has been so ripped up tonight sir said the sick man laying his hand upon his heart with a look in which the mute imploring agony of his condition was concentrated by the sight of my poor old father and the thought of all the trouble i have been the cause of and all the wrong and sorrow lying at my door that   was it the extremity to which he had come or was it the dawning of another change that made him stop  that what i can do right with my mind running on so much so fast ill try to do there was another man here  did you see him  redlaw could not reply by any word for when he saw that fatal sign he knew so well now of the wandering hand upon the forehead his voice died at his lips  but he made some indication of assent  he is penniless hungry and destitute  he is completely beaten down and has no resource at all  look after him  lose no time i know he has it in his mind to kill himself  it was working  it was on his face  his face was changing hardening deepening in all its shades and losing all its sorrow  dont you remember  dont you know him he pursued  he shut his face out for a moment with the hand that again wandered over his forehead and then it lowered on redlaw reckless ruffianly and callous  why dn you he said scowling round what have you been doing to me here  i have lived bold and i mean to die bold  to the devil with you  and so lay down upon his bed and put his arms up over his head and ears as resolute from that time to keep out all access and to die in his indifference  if redlaw had been struck by lightning it could not have struck him from the bedside with a more tremendous shock  but the old man who had left the bed while his son was speaking to him now returning avoided it quickly likewise and with abhorrence  wheres my boy william said the old man hurriedly  william come away from here  well go home  home father returned william  are you going to leave your own son  wheres my own son replied the old man  where why there  thats no son of mine said philip trembling with resentment no such wretch as that has any claim on me  my children are pleasant to look at and they wait upon me and get my meat and drink ready and are useful to me  ive a right to it  im eightyseven  youre old enough to be no older muttered william looking at him grudgingly with his hands in his pockets  i dont know what good you are myself  we could have a deal more pleasure without you  my son mr redlaw said the old man  my son too  the boy talking to me of my son  why what has he ever done to give me any pleasure i should like to know  i dont know what you have ever done to give me any pleasure said william sulkily  let me think said the old man  for how many christmas times running have i sat in my warm place and never had to come out in the cold night air and have made good cheer without being disturbed by any such uncomfortable wretched sight as him there is it twenty william  nigher forty it seems he muttered  why when i look at my father sir and come to think of it addressing redlaw with an impatience and irritation that were quite new im whipped if i can see anything in him but a calendar of ever so many years of eating and drinking and making himself comfortable over and over again  iim eightyseven said the old man rambling on childishly and weakly and i dont know as i ever was much put out by anything  im not going to begin now because of what he calls my son  hes not my son  ive had a power of pleasant times  i recollect onceno i dontno its broken off  it was something about a game of cricket and a friend of mine but its somehow broken off  i wonder who he wasi suppose i liked him  and i wonder what became of himi suppose he died  but i dont know and i dont care neither i dont care a bit  in his drowsy chuckling and the shaking of his head he put his hands into his waistcoat pockets  in one of them he found a bit of holly left there probably last night which he now took out and looked at  berries eh said the old man  ah  its a pity theyre not good to eat  i recollect when i was a little chap about as high as that and out a walking withlet me seewho was i out a walking withno i dont remember how that was  i dont remember as i ever walked with any one particular or cared for any one or any one for me  berries eh  theres good cheer when theres berries  well i ought to have my share of it and to be waited on and kept warm and comfortable for im eightyseven and a poor old man  im eightyseven  eightyseven  the drivelling pitiable manner in which as he repeated this he nibbled at the leaves and spat the morsels out the cold uninterested eye with which his youngest son so changed regarded him the determined apathy with which his eldest son lay hardened in his sin impressed themselves no more on redlaws observation for he broke his way from the spot to which his feet seemed to have been fixed and ran out of the house  his guide came crawling forth from his place of refuge and was ready for him before he reached the arches  back to the womans he inquired  back quickly answered redlaw  stop nowhere on the way  for a short distance the boy went on before but their return was more like a flight than a walk and it was as much as his bare feet could do to keep pace with the chemists rapid strides  shrinking from all who passed shrouded in his cloak and keeping it drawn closely about him as though there were mortal contagion in any fluttering touch of his garments he made no pause until they reached the door by which they had come out  he unlocked it with his key went in accompanied by the boy and hastened through the dark passages to his own chamber  the boy watched him as he made the door fast and withdrew behind the table when he looked round  come he said  dont you touch me  youve not brought me here to take my money away  redlaw threw some more upon the ground  he flung his body on it immediately as if to hide it from him lest the sight of it should tempt him to reclaim it and not until he saw him seated by his lamp with his face hidden in his hands began furtively to pick it up  when he had done so he crept near the fire and sitting down in a great chair before it took from his breast some broken scraps of food and fell to munching and to staring at the blaze and now and then to glancing at his shillings which he kept clenched up in a bunch in one hand  and this said redlaw gazing on him with increased repugnance and fear is the only one companion i have left on earth  how long it was before he was aroused from his contemplation of this creature whom he dreaded sowhether halfanhour or half the nighthe knew not  but the stillness of the room was broken by the boy whom he had seen listening starting up and running towards the door  heres the woman coming he exclaimed  the chemist stopped him on his way at the moment when she knocked  let me go to her will you said the boy  not now returned the chemist  stay here  nobody must pass in or out of the room now  whos that  its i sir cried milly  pray sir let me in  no not for the world he said  mr redlaw mr redlaw pray sir let me in  what is the matter he said holding the boy  the miserable man you saw is worse and nothing i can say will wake him from his terrible infatuation  williams father has turned childish in a moment william himself is changed  the shock has been too sudden for him i cannot understand him he is not like himself  oh mr redlaw pray advise me help me  no  no  no he answered  mr  redlaw  dear sir  george has been muttering in his doze about the man you saw there who he fears will kill himself  better he should do it than come near me  he says in his wandering that you know him that he was your friend once long ago that he is the ruined father of a student heremy mind misgives me of the young gentleman who has been ill what is to be done  how is he to be followed  how is he to be saved  mr redlaw pray oh pray advise me  help me  all this time he held the boy who was halfmad to pass him and let her in  phantoms  punishers of impious thoughts cried redlaw gazing round in anguish look upon me  from the darkness of my mind let the glimmering of contrition that i know is there shine up and show my misery  in the material world as i have long taught nothing can be spared no step or atom in the wondrous structure could be lost without a blank being made in the great universe  i know now that it is the same with good and evil happiness and sorrow in the memories of men  pity me  relieve me  there was no response but her help me help me let me in and the boys struggling to get to her  shadow of myself  spirit of my darker hours cried redlaw in distraction come back and haunt me day and night but take this gift away  or if it must still rest with me deprive me of the dreadful power of giving it to others  undo what i have done leave me benighted but restore the day to those whom i have cursed  as i have spared this woman from the first and as i never will go forth again but will die here with no hand to tend me save this creatures who is proof against mehear me  the only reply still was the boy struggling to get to her while he held him back and the cry increasing in its energy help let me in  he was your friend once how shall he be followed how shall he be saved  they are all changed there is no one else to help me pray pray let me in    chapter iiithe gift reversed    night was still heavy in the sky  on open plains from hilltops and from the decks of solitary ships at sea a distant lowlying line that promised byandby to change to light was visible in the dim horizon but its promise was remote and doubtful and the moon was striving with the nightclouds busily  the shadows upon redlaws mind succeeded thick and fast to one another and obscured its light as the nightclouds hovered between the moon and earth and kept the latter veiled in darkness  fitful and uncertain as the shadows which the nightclouds cast were their concealments from him and imperfect revelations to him and like the nightclouds still if the clear light broke forth for a moment it was only that they might sweep over it and make the darkness deeper than before  without there was a profound and solemn hush upon the ancient pile of building and its buttresses and angles made dark shapes of mystery upon the ground which now seemed to retire into the smooth white snow and now seemed to come out of it as the moons path was more or less beset  within the chemists room was indistinct and murky by the light of the expiring lamp a ghostly silence had succeeded to the knocking and the voice outside nothing was audible but now and then a low sound among the whitened ashes of the fire as of its yielding up its last breath  before it on the ground the boy lay fast asleep  in his chair the chemist sat as he had sat there since the calling at his door had ceasedlike a man turned to stone  at such a time the christmas music he had heard before began to play  he listened to it at first as he had listened in the churchyard but presentlyit playing still and being borne towards him on the night air in a low sweet melancholy strain he rose and stood stretching his hands about him as if there were some friend approaching within his reach on whom his desolate touch might rest yet do no harm  as he did this his face became less fixed and wondering a gentle trembling came upon him and at last his eyes filled with tears and he put his hands before them and bowed down his head  his memory of sorrow wrong and trouble had not come back to him he knew that it was not restored he had no passing belief or hope that it was  but some dumb stir within him made him capable again of being moved by what was hidden afar off in the music if it were only that it told him sorrowfully the value of what he had lost he thanked heaven for it with a fervent gratitude  as the last chord died upon his ear he raised his head to listen to its lingering vibration  beyond the boy so that his sleeping figure lay at its feet the phantom stood immovable and silent with its eyes upon him  ghastly it was as it had ever been but not so cruel and relentless in its aspector he thought or hoped so as he looked upon it trembling  it was not alone but in its shadowy hand it held another hand  and whose was that  was the form that stood beside it indeed millys or but her shade and picture  the quiet head was bent a little as her manner was and her eyes were looking down as if in pity on the sleeping child  a radiant light fell on her face but did not touch the phantom for though close beside her it was dark and colourless as ever  spectre said the chemist newly troubled as he looked i have not been stubborn or presumptuous in respect of her  oh do not bring her here  spare me that  this is but a shadow said the phantom when the morning shines seek out the reality whose image i present before you  is it my inexorable doom to do so cried the chemist  it is replied the phantom  to destroy her peace her goodness to make her what i am myself and what i have made of others  i have said seek her out returned the phantom  i have said no more  oh tell me exclaimed redlaw catching at the hope which he fancied might lie hidden in the words  can i undo what i have done  no returned the phantom  i do not ask for restoration to myself said redlaw  what i abandoned i abandoned of my own free will and have justly lost but for those to whom i have transferred the fatal gift who never sought it who unknowingly received a curse of which they had no warning and which they had no power to shun can i do nothing  nothing said the phantom  if i cannot can any one  the phantom standing like a statue kept its gaze upon him for a while then turned its head suddenly and looked upon the shadow at its side  ah  can she cried redlaw still looking upon the shade  the phantom released the hand it had retained till now and softly raised its own with a gesture of dismissal  upon that her shadow still preserving the same attitude began to move or melt away  stay cried redlaw with an earnestness to which he could not give enough expression  for a moment  as an act of mercy  i know that some change fell upon me when those sounds were in the air just now  tell me have i lost the power of harming her  may i go near her without dread  oh let her give me any sign of hope  the phantom looked upon the shade as he didnot at himand gave no answer  at least say thishas she henceforth the consciousness of any power to set right what i have done  she has not the phantom answered  has she the power bestowed on her without the consciousness  the phantom answered  seek her out  and her shadow slowly vanished  they were face to face again and looking on each other as intently and awfully as at the time of the bestowal of the gift across the boy who still lay on the ground between them at the phantoms feet  terrible instructor said the chemist sinking on his knee before it in an attitude of supplication by whom i was renounced but by whom i am revisited in which and in whose milder aspect i would fain believe i have a gleam of hope i will obey without inquiry praying that the cry i have sent up in the anguish of my soul has been or will be heard in behalf of those whom i have injured beyond human reparation  but there is one thing  you speak to me of what is lying here the phantom interposed and pointed with its finger to the boy  i do returned the chemist  you know what i would ask  why has this child alone been proof against my influence and why why have i detected in its thoughts a terrible companionship with mine  this said the phantom pointing to the boy is the last completest illustration of a human creature utterly bereft of such remembrances as you have yielded up  no softening memory of sorrow wrong or trouble enters here because this wretched mortal from his birth has been abandoned to a worse condition than the beasts and has within his knowledge no one contrast no humanising touch to make a grain of such a memory spring up in his hardened breast  all within this desolate creature is barren wilderness  all within the man bereft of what you have resigned is the same barren wilderness  woe to such a man  woe tenfold to the nation that shall count its monsters such as this lying here by hundreds and by thousands  redlaw shrank appalled from what he heard  there is not said the phantom one of thesenot onebut sows a harvest that mankind must reap  from every seed of evil in this boy a field of ruin is grown that shall be gathered in and garnered up and sown again in many places in the world until regions are overspread with wickedness enough to raise the waters of another deluge  open and unpunished murder in a citys streets would be less guilty in its daily toleration than one such spectacle as this  it seemed to look down upon the boy in his sleep  redlaw too looked down upon him with a new emotion  there is not a father said the phantom by whose side in his daily or his nightly walk these creatures pass there is not a mother among all the ranks of loving mothers in this land there is no one risen from the state of childhood but shall be responsible in his or her degree for this enormity  there is not a country throughout the earth on which it would not bring a curse  there is no religion upon earth that it would not deny there is no people upon earth it would not put to shame  the chemist clasped his hands and looked with trembling fear and pity from the sleeping boy to the phantom standing above him with his finger pointing down  behold i say pursued the spectre the perfect type of what it was your choice to be  your influence is powerless here because from this childs bosom you can banish nothing  his thoughts have been in terrible companionship with yours because you have gone down to his unnatural level  he is the growth of mans indifference you are the growth of mans presumption  the beneficent design of heaven is in each case overthrown and from the two poles of the immaterial world you come together  the chemist stooped upon the ground beside the boy and with the same kind of compassion for him that he now felt for himself covered him as he slept and no longer shrank from him with abhorrence or indifference  soon now the distant line on the horizon brightened the darkness faded the sun rose red and glorious and the chimney stacks and gables of the ancient building gleamed in the clear air which turned the smoke and vapour of the city into a cloud of gold  the very sundial in his shady corner where the wind was used to spin with such unwindy constancy shook off the finer particles of snow that had accumulated on his dull old face in the night and looked out at the little white wreaths eddying round and round him doubtless some blind groping of the morning made its way down into the forgotten crypt so cold and earthy where the norman arches were half buried in the ground and stirred the dull sap in the lazy vegetation hanging to the walls and quickened the slow principle of life within the little world of wonderful and delicate creation which existed there with some faint knowledge that the sun was up  the tetterbys were up and doing  mr tetterby took down the shutters of the shop and strip by strip revealed the treasures of the window to the eyes so proof against their seductions of jerusalem buildings  adolphus had been out so long already that he was halfway on to morning pepper  five small tetterbys whose ten round eyes were much inflamed by soap and friction were in the tortures of a cool wash in the back kitchen mrs tetterby presiding  johnny who was pushed and hustled through his toilet with great rapidity when moloch chanced to be in an exacting frame of mind which was always the case staggered up and down with his charge before the shop door under greater difficulties than usual the weight of moloch being much increased by a complication of defences against the cold composed of knitted worstedwork and forming a complete suit of chainarmour with a headpiece and blue gaiters  it was a peculiarity of this baby to be always cutting teeth whether they never came or whether they came and went away again is not in evidence but it had certainly cut enough on the showing of mrs tetterby to make a handsome dental provision for the sign of the bull and mouth  all sorts of objects were impressed for the rubbing of its gums notwithstanding that it always carried dangling at its waist which was immediately under its chin a bone ring large enough to have represented the rosary of a young nun  knifehandles umbrellatops the heads of walkingsticks selected from the stock the fingers of the family in general but especially of johnny nutmeggraters crusts the handles of doors and the cool knobs on the tops of pokers were among the commonest instruments indiscriminately applied for this babys relief  the amount of electricity that must have been rubbed out of it in a week is not to be calculated  still mrs tetterby always said it was coming through and then the child would be herself and still it never did come through and the child continued to be somebody else  the tempers of the little tetterbys had sadly changed with a few hours  mr and mrs tetterby themselves were not more altered than their offspring  usually they were an unselfish goodnatured yielding little race sharing short commons when it happened which was pretty often contentedly and even generously and taking a great deal of enjoyment out of a very little meat  but they were fighting now not only for the soap and water but even for the breakfast which was yet in perspective  the hand of every little tetterby was against the other little tetterbys and even johnnys handthe patient muchenduring and devoted johnnyrose against the baby  yes mrs tetterby going to the door by mere accident saw him viciously pick out a weak place in the suit of armour where a slap would tell and slap that blessed child  mrs tetterby had him into the parlour by the collar in that same flash of time and repaid him the assault with usury thereto  you brute you murdering little boy said mrs tetterby  had you the heart to do it  why dont her teeth come through then retorted johnny in a loud rebellious voice instead of bothering me  how would you like it yourself  like it sir said mrs tetterby relieving him of his dishonoured load  yes like it said johnny  how would you  not at all  if you was me youd go for a soldier  i will too  there ant no babies in the army  mr tetterby who had arrived upon the scene of action rubbed his chin thoughtfully instead of correcting the rebel and seemed rather struck by this view of a military life  i wish i was in the army myself if the childs in the right said mrs tetterby looking at her husband for i have no peace of my life here  im a slavea virginia slave some indistinct association with their weak descent on the tobacco trade perhaps suggested this aggravated expression to mrs tetterby  i never have a holiday or any pleasure at all from years end to years end  why lord bless and save the child said mrs tetterby shaking the baby with an irritability hardly suited to so pious an aspiration whats the matter with her now  not being able to discover and not rendering the subject much clearer by shaking it mrs tetterby put the baby away in a cradle and folding her arms sat rocking it angrily with her foot  how you stand there dolphus said mrs tetterby to her husband why dont you do something  because i dont care about doing anything mr tetterby replied  i am sure i dont said mrs tetterby  ill take my oath i dont said mr tetterby  a diversion arose here among johnny and his five younger brothers who in preparing the family breakfast table had fallen to skirmishing for the temporary possession of the loaf and were buffeting one another with great heartiness the smallest boy of all with precocious discretion hovering outside the knot of combatants and harassing their legs  into the midst of this fray mr and mrs tetterby both precipitated themselves with great ardour as if such ground were the only ground on which they could now agree and having with no visible remains of their late soft heartedness laid about them without any lenity and done much execution resumed their former relative positions  you had better read your paper than do nothing at all said mrs tetterby  whats there to read in a paper returned mr tetterby with excessive discontent  what said mrs tetterby  police  its nothing to me said tetterby  what do i care what people do or are done to  suicides suggested mrs tetterby  no business of mine replied her husband  births deaths and marriages are those nothing to you said mrs tetterby  if the births were all over for good and all today and the deaths were all to begin to come off tomorrow i dont see why it should interest me till i thought it was a coming to my turn grumbled tetterby  as to marriages ive done it myself  i know quite enough about them  to judge from the dissatisfied expression of her face and manner mrs tetterby appeared to entertain the same opinions as her husband but she opposed him nevertheless for the gratification of quarrelling with him  oh youre a consistent man said mrs tetterby ant you  you with the screen of your own making there made of nothing else but bits of newspapers which you sit and read to the children by the halfhour together  say used to if you please returned her husband  you wont find me doing so any more  im wiser now  bah wiser indeed said mrs tetterby  are you better  the question sounded some discordant note in mr tetterbys breast he ruminated dejectedly and passed his hand across and across his forehead  better murmured mr tetterby  i dont know as any of us are better or happier either  better is it  he turned to the screen and traced about it with his finger until he found a certain paragraph of which he was in quest  this used to be one of the family favourites i recollect said tetterby in a forlorn and stupid way and used to draw tears from the children and make em good if there was any little bickering or discontent among em next to the story of the robin redbreasts in the wood  melancholy case of destitution  yesterday a small man with a baby in his arms and surrounded by halfadozen ragged little ones of various ages between ten and two the whole of whom were evidently in a famishing condition appeared before the worthy magistrate and made the following recitalha  i dont understand it im sure said tetterby i dont see what it has got to do with us  how old and shabby he looks said mrs tetterby watching him i never saw such a change in a man  ah dear me dear me dear me it was a sacrifice  what was a sacrifice her husband sourly inquired  mrs tetterby shook her head and without replying in words raised a complete seastorm about the baby by her violent agitation of the cradle  if you mean your marriage was a sacrifice my good woman said her husband  i do mean it said his wife  why then i mean to say pursued mr tetterby as sulkily and surlily as she that there are two sides to that affair and that i was the sacrifice and that i wish the sacrifice hadnt been accepted  i wish it hadnt tetterby with all my heart and soul i do assure you said his wife  you cant wish it more than i do tetterby  i dont know what i saw in her muttered the newsman im sure certainly if i saw anything its not there now  i was thinking so last night after supper by the fire  shes fat shes ageing she wont bear comparison with most other women  hes commonlooking he has no air with him hes small hes beginning to stoop and hes getting bald muttered mrs tetterby  i must have been half out of my mind when i did it muttered mr tetterby  my senses must have forsook me  thats the only way in which i can explain it to myself said mrs tetterby with elaboration  in this mood they sat down to breakfast  the little tetterbys were not habituated to regard that meal in the light of a sedentary occupation but discussed it as a dance or trot rather resembling a savage ceremony in the occasionally shrill whoops and brandishings of bread and butter with which it was accompanied as well as in the intricate filings off into the street and back again and the hoppings up and down the doorsteps which were incidental to the performance  in the present instance the contentions between these tetterby children for the milkandwater jug common to all which stood upon the table presented so lamentable an instance of angry passions risen very high indeed that it was an outrage on the memory of dr watts  it was not until mr tetterby had driven the whole herd out at the front door that a moments peace was secured and even that was broken by the discovery that johnny had surreptitiously come back and was at that instant choking in the jug like a ventriloquist in his indecent and rapacious haste  these children will be the death of me at last said mrs tetterby after banishing the culprit  and the sooner the better i think  poor people said mr tetterby ought not to have children at all  they give us no pleasure  he was at that moment taking up the cup which mrs tetterby had rudely pushed towards him and mrs tetterby was lifting her own cup to her lips when they both stopped as if they were transfixed  here  mother  father cried johnny running into the room heres mrs william coming down the street  and if ever since the world began a young boy took a baby from a cradle with the care of an old nurse and hushed and soothed it tenderly and tottered away with it cheerfully johnny was that boy and moloch was that baby as they went out together  mr tetterby put down his cup mrs tetterby put down her cup  mr tetterby rubbed his forehead mrs tetterby rubbed hers  mr tetterbys face began to smooth and brighten mrs tetterbys began to smooth and brighten  why lord forgive me said mr tetterby to himself what evil tempers have i been giving way to  what has been the matter here  how could i ever treat him ill again after all i said and felt last night sobbed mrs tetterby with her apron to her eyes  am i a brute said mr tetterby or is there any good in me at all  sophia  my little woman  dolphus dear returned his wife  iive been in a state of mind said mr tetterby that i cant abear to think of sophy  oh  its nothing to what ive been in dolf cried his wife in a great burst of grief  my sophia said mr tetterby dont take on  i never shall forgive myself  i must have nearly broke your heart i know  no dolf no  it was me  me cried mrs tetterby  my little woman said her husband dont  you make me reproach myself dreadful when you show such a noble spirit  sophia my dear you dont know what i thought  i showed it bad enough no doubt but what i thought my little woman  oh dear dolf dont  dont cried his wife  sophia said mr tetterby i must reveal it  i couldnt rest in my conscience unless i mentioned it  my little woman  mrs williams very nearly here screamed johnny at the door  my little woman i wondered how gasped mr tetterby supporting himself by his chair i wondered how i had ever admired youi forgot the precious children you have brought about me and thought you didnt look as slim as i could wish  ii never gave a recollection said mr tetterby with severe selfaccusation to the cares youve had as my wife and along of me and mine when you might have had hardly any with another man who got on better and was luckier than me anybody might have found such a man easily i am sure and i quarrelled with you for having aged a little in the rough years you have lightened for me  can you believe it my little woman  i hardly can myself  mrs tetterby in a whirlwind of laughing and crying caught his face within her hands and held it there  oh dolf she cried  i am so happy that you thought so i am so grateful that you thought so  for i thought that you were common looking dolf and so you are my dear and may you be the commonest of all sights in my eyes till you close them with your own good hands  i thought that you were small and so you are and ill make much of you because you are and more of you because i love my husband  i thought that you began to stoop and so you do and you shall lean on me and ill do all i can to keep you up  i thought there was no air about you but there is and its the air of home and thats the purest and the best there is and god bless home once more and all belonging to it dolf  hurrah  heres mrs william cried johnny  so she was and all the children with her and so she came in they kissed her and kissed one another and kissed the baby and kissed their father and mother and then ran back and flocked and danced about her trooping on with her in triumph  mr and mrs tetterby were not a bit behindhand in the warmth of their reception  they were as much attracted to her as the children were they ran towards her kissed her hands pressed round her could not receive her ardently or enthusiastically enough  she came among them like the spirit of all goodness affection gentle consideration love and domesticity  what are you all so glad to see me too this bright christmas morning said milly clapping her hands in a pleasant wonder  oh dear how delightful this is  more shouting from the children more kissing more trooping round her more happiness more love more joy more honour on all sides than she could bear  oh dear said milly what delicious tears you make me shed  how can i ever have deserved this  what have i done to be so loved  who can help it cried mr tetterby  who can help it cried mrs tetterby  who can help it echoed the children in a joyful chorus  and they danced and trooped about her again and clung to her and laid their rosy faces against her dress and kissed and fondled it and could not fondle it or her enough  i never was so moved said milly drying her eyes as i have been this morning  i must tell you as soon as i can speakmr redlaw came to me at sunrise and with a tenderness in his manner more as if i had been his darling daughter than myself implored me to go with him to where williams brother george is lying ill  we went together and all the way along he was so kind and so subdued and seemed to put such trust and hope in me that i could not help trying with pleasure  when we got to the house we met a woman at the door somebody had bruised and hurt her i am afraid who caught me by the hand and blessed me as i passed  she was right said mr tetterby  mrs tetterby said she was right  all the children cried out that she was right  ah but theres more than that said milly  when we got up stairs into the room the sick man who had lain for hours in a state from which no effort could rouse him rose up in his bed and bursting into tears stretched out his arms to me and said that he had led a misspent life but that he was truly repentant now in his sorrow for the past which was all as plain to him as a great prospect from which a dense black cloud had cleared away and that he entreated me to ask his poor old father for his pardon and his blessing and to say a prayer beside his bed  and when i did so mr redlaw joined in it so fervently and then so thanked and thanked me and thanked heaven that my heart quite overflowed and i could have done nothing but sob and cry if the sick man had not begged me to sit down by himwhich made me quiet of course as i sat there he held my hand in his until he sank in a doze and even then when i withdrew my hand to leave him to come here which mr redlaw was very earnest indeed in wishing me to do his hand felt for mine so that some one else was obliged to take my place and make believe to give him my hand back  oh dear oh dear said milly sobbing  how thankful and how happy i should feel and do feel for all this  while she was speaking redlaw had come in and after pausing for a moment to observe the group of which she was the centre had silently ascended the stairs  upon those stairs he now appeared again remaining there while the young student passed him and came running down  kind nurse gentlest best of creatures he said falling on his knee to her and catching at her hand forgive my cruel ingratitude  oh dear oh dear cried milly innocently heres another of them  oh dear heres somebody else who likes me  what shall i ever do  the guileless simple way in which she said it and in which she put her hands before her eyes and wept for very happiness was as touching as it was delightful  i was not myself he said  i dont know what it wasit was some consequence of my disorder perhapsi was mad  but i am so no longer  almost as i speak i am restored  i heard the children crying out your name and the shade passed from me at the very sound of it  oh dont weep  dear milly if you could read my heart and only knew with what affection and what grateful homage it is glowing you would not let me see you weep  it is such deep reproach  no no said milly its not that  its not indeed  its joy its wonder that you should think it necessary to ask me to forgive so little and yet its pleasure that you do  and will you come again and will you finish the little curtain  no said milly drying her eyes and shaking her head  you wont care for my needlework now  is it forgiving me to say that  she beckoned him aside and whispered in his ear  there is news from your home mr edmund  news  how  either your not writing when you were very ill or the change in your handwriting when you began to be better created some suspicion of the truth however that isbut youre sure youll not be the worse for any news if its not bad news  sure  then theres some one come said milly  my mother asked the student glancing round involuntarily towards redlaw who had come down from the stairs  hush  no said milly  it can be no one else  indeed said milly are you sure  it is not   before he could say more she put her hand upon his mouth  yes it is said milly  the young lady she is very like the miniature mr edmund but she is prettier was too unhappy to rest without satisfying her doubts and came up last night with a little servantmaid  as you always dated your letters from the college she came there and before i saw mr redlaw this morning i saw her  she likes me too said milly  oh dear thats another  this morning  where is she now  why she is now said milly advancing her lips to his ear in my little parlour in the lodge and waiting to see you  he pressed her hand and was darting off but she detained him  mr redlaw is much altered and has told me this morning that his memory is impaired  be very considerate to him mr edmund he needs that from us all  the young man assured her by a look that her caution was not ill bestowed and as he passed the chemist on his way out bent respectfully and with an obvious interest before him  redlaw returned the salutation courteously and even humbly and looked after him as he passed on  he dropped his head upon his hand too as trying to reawaken something he had lost  but it was gone  the abiding change that had come upon him since the influence of the music and the phantoms reappearance was that now he truly felt how much he had lost and could compassionate his own condition and contrast it clearly with the natural state of those who were around him  in this an interest in those who were around him was revived and a meek submissive sense of his calamity was bred resembling that which sometimes obtains in age when its mental powers are weakened without insensibility or sullenness being added to the list of its infirmities  he was conscious that as he redeemed through milly more and more of the evil he had done and as he was more and more with her this change ripened itself within him  therefore and because of the attachment she inspired him with but without other hope he felt that he was quite dependent on her and that she was his staff in his affliction  so when she asked him whether they should go home now to where the old man and her husband were and he readily replied yes being anxious in that regardhe put his arm through hers and walked beside her not as if he were the wise and learned man to whom the wonders of nature were an open book and hers were the uninstructed mind but as if their two positions were reversed and he knew nothing and she all  he saw the children throng about her and caress her as he and she went away together thus out of the house he heard the ringing of their laughter and their merry voices he saw their bright faces clustering around him like flowers he witnessed the renewed contentment and affection of their parents he breathed the simple air of their poor home restored to its tranquillity he thought of the unwholesome blight he had shed upon it and might but for her have been diffusing then and perhaps it is no wonder that he walked submissively beside her and drew her gentle bosom nearer to his own  when they arrived at the lodge the old man was sitting in his chair in the chimneycorner with his eyes fixed on the ground and his son was leaning against the opposite side of the fireplace looking at him  as she came in at the door both started and turned round towards her and a radiant change came upon their faces  oh dear dear dear they are all pleased to see me like the rest cried milly clapping her hands in an ecstasy and stopping short  here are two more  pleased to see her  pleasure was no word for it  she ran into her husbands arms thrown wide open to receive her and he would have been glad to have her there with her head lying on his shoulder through the short winters day  but the old man couldnt spare her  he had arms for her too and he locked her in them  why where has my quiet mouse been all this time said the old man  she has been a long while away  i find that its impossible for me to get on without mouse  iwheres my son williami fancy i have been dreaming william  thats what i say myself father returned his son  i have been in an ugly sort of dream i thinkhow are you father  are you pretty well  strong and brave my boy returned the old man  it was quite a sight to see mr william shaking hands with his father and patting him on the back and rubbing him gently down with his hand as if he could not possibly do enough to show an interest in him  what a wonderful man you are fatherhow are you father  are you really pretty hearty though said william shaking hands with him again and patting him again and rubbing him gently down again  i never was fresher or stouter in my life my boy  what a wonderful man you are father  but thats exactly where it is said mr william with enthusiasm  when i think of all that my fathers gone through and all the chances and changes and sorrows and troubles that have happened to him in the course of his long life and under which his head has grown grey and years upon years have gathered on it i feel as if we couldnt do enough to honour the old gentleman and make his old age easyhow are you father  are you really pretty well though  mr william might never have left off repeating this inquiry and shaking hands with him again and patting him again and rubbing him down again if the old man had not espied the chemist whom until now he had not seen  i ask your pardon mr redlaw said philip but didnt know you were here sir or should have made less free  it reminds me mr redlaw seeing you here on a christmas morning of the time when you was a student yourself and worked so hard that you were backwards and forwards in our library even at christmas time  ha ha  im old enough to remember that and i remember it right well i do though i am eightseven  it was after you left here that my poor wife died  you remember my poor wife mr redlaw  the chemist answered yes  yes said the old man  she was a dear creeturi recollect you come here one christmas morning with a young ladyi ask your pardon mr redlaw but i think it was a sister you was very much attached to  the chemist looked at him and shook his head  i had a sister he said vacantly  he knew no more  one christmas morning pursued the old man that you come here with herand it began to snow and my wife invited the lady to walk in and sit by the fire that is always a burning on christmas day in what used to be before our ten poor gentlemen commuted our great dinner hall  i was there and i recollect as i was stirring up the blaze for the young lady to warm her pretty feet by she read the scroll out loud that is underneath that pictur lord keep my memory green  she and my poor wife fell a talking about it and its a strange thing to think of now that they both said both being so unlike to die that it was a good prayer and that it was one they would put up very earnestly if they were called away young with reference to those who were dearest to them  my brother says the young ladymy husband says my poor wife lord keep his memory of me green and do not let me be forgotten  tears more painful and more bitter than he had ever shed in all his life coursed down redlaws face  philip fully occupied in recalling his story had not observed him until now nor millys anxiety that he should not proceed  philip said redlaw laying his hand upon his arm i am a stricken man on whom the hand of providence has fallen heavily although deservedly  you speak to me my friend of what i cannot follow my memory is gone  merciful power cried the old man  i have lost my memory of sorrow wrong and trouble said the chemist and with that i have lost all man would remember  to see old philips pity for him to see him wheel his own great chair for him to rest in and look down upon him with a solemn sense of his bereavement was to know in some degree how precious to old age such recollections are  the boy came running in and ran to milly  heres the man he said in the other room  i dont want him  what man does he mean asked mr william  hush said milly  obedient to a sign from her he and his old father softly withdrew as they went out unnoticed redlaw beckoned to the boy to come to him  i like the woman best he answered holding to her skirts  you are right said redlaw with a faint smile  but you neednt fear to come to me  i am gentler than i was  of all the world to you poor child  the boy still held back at first but yielding little by little to her urging he consented to approach and even to sit down at his feet  as redlaw laid his hand upon the shoulder of the child looking on him with compassion and a fellowfeeling he put out his other hand to milly  she stooped down on that side of him so that she could look into his face and after silence said  mr redlaw may i speak to you  yes he answered fixing his eyes upon her  your voice and music are the same to me  may i ask you something  what you will  do you remember what i said when i knocked at your door last night  about one who was your friend once and who stood on the verge of destruction  yes  i remember he said with some hesitation  do you understand it  he smoothed the boys hairlooking at her fixedly the while and shook his head  this person said milly in her clear soft voice which her mild eyes looking at him made clearer and softer i found soon afterwards  i went back to the house and with heavens help traced him  i was not too soon  a very little and i should have been too late  he took his hand from the boy and laying it on the back of that hand of hers whose timid and yet earnest touch addressed him no less appealingly than her voice and eyes looked more intently on her  he is the father of mr edmund the young gentleman we saw just now  his real name is longfordyou recollect the name  i recollect the name  and the man  no not the man  did he ever wrong me  yes  ah  then its hopelesshopeless  he shook his head and softly beat upon the hand he held as though mutely asking her commiseration  i did not go to mr edmund last night said millyyou will listen to me just the same as if you did remember all  to every syllable you say  both because i did not know then that this really was his father and because i was fearful of the effect of such intelligence upon him after his illness if it should be  since i have known who this person is i have not gone either but that is for another reason  he has long been separated from his wife and sonhas been a stranger to his home almost from this sons infancy i learn from himand has abandoned and deserted what he should have held most dear  in all that time he has been falling from the state of a gentleman more and more until she rose up hastily and going out for a moment returned accompanied by the wreck that redlaw had beheld last night  do you know me asked the chemist  i should be glad returned the other and that is an unwonted word for me to use if i could answer no  the chemist looked at the man standing in selfabasement and degradation before him and would have looked longer in an ineffectual struggle for enlightenment but that milly resumed her late position by his side and attracted his attentive gaze to her own face  see how low he is sunk how lost he is she whispered stretching out her arm towards him without looking from the chemists face if you could remember all that is connected with him do you not think it would move your pity to reflect that one you ever loved do not let us mind how long ago or in what belief that he has forfeited should come to this  i hope it would he answered  i believe it would  his eyes wandered to the figure standing near the door but came back speedily to her on whom he gazed intently as if he strove to learn some lesson from every tone of her voice and every beam of her eyes  i have no learning and you have much said milly i am not used to think and you are always thinking  may i tell you why it seems to me a good thing for us to remember wrong that has been done us  yes  that we may forgive it  pardon me great heaven said redlaw lifting up his eyes for having thrown away thine own high attribute  and if said milly if your memory should one day be restored as we will hope and pray it may be would it not be a blessing to you to recall at once a wrong and its forgiveness  he looked at the figure by the door and fastened his attentive eyes on her again a ray of clearer light appeared to him to shine into his mind from her bright face  he cannot go to his abandoned home  he does not seek to go there he knows that he could only carry shame and trouble to those he has so cruelly neglected and that the best reparation he can make them now is to avoid them  a very little money carefully bestowed would remove him to some distant place where he might live and do no wrong and make such atonement as is left within his power for the wrong he has done  to the unfortunate lady who is his wife and to his son this would be the best and kindest boon that their best friend could give themone too that they need never know of and to him shattered in reputation mind and body it might be salvation  he took her head between her hands and kissed it and said  it shall be done  i trust to you to do it for me now and secretly and to tell him that i would forgive him if i were so happy as to know for what  as she rose and turned her beaming face towards the fallen man implying that her mediation had been successful he advanced a step and without raising his eyes addressed himself to redlaw  you are so generous he said you ever werethat you will try to banish your rising sense of retribution in the spectacle that is before you  i do not try to banish it from myself redlaw  if you can believe me  the chemist entreated milly by a gesture to come nearer to him and as he listened looked in her face as if to find in it the clue to what he heard  i am too decayed a wretch to make professions i recollect my own career too well to array any such before you  but from the day on which i made my first step downward in dealing falsely by you i have gone down with a certain steady doomed progression  that i say  redlaw keeping her close at his side turned his face towards the speaker and there was sorrow in it  something like mournful recognition too  i might have been another man my life might have been another life if i had avoided that first fatal step  i dont know that it would have been  i claim nothing for the possibility  your sister is at rest and better than she could have been with me if i had continued even what you thought me  even what i once supposed myself to be  redlaw made a hasty motion with his hand as if he would have put that subject on one side  i speak the other went on like a man taken from the grave  i should have made my own grave last night had it not been for this blessed hand  oh dear he likes me too sobbed milly under her breath thats another  i could not have put myself in your way last night even for bread  but today my recollection of what has been is so strongly stirred and is presented to me i dont know how so vividly that i have dared to come at her suggestion and to take your bounty and to thank you for it and to beg you redlaw in your dying hour to be as merciful to me in your thoughts as you are in your deeds  he turned towards the door and stopped a moment on his way forth  i hope my son may interest you for his mothers sake  i hope he may deserve to do so  unless my life should be preserved a long time and i should know that i have not misused your aid i shall never look upon him more  going out he raised his eyes to redlaw for the first time redlaw whose steadfast gaze was fixed upon him dreamily held out his hand  he returned and touched itlittle morewith both his own and bending down his head went slowly out  in the few moments that elapsed while milly silently took him to the gate the chemist dropped into his chair and covered his face with his hands  seeing him thus when she came back accompanied by her husband and his father who were both greatly concerned for him she avoided disturbing him or permitting him to be disturbed and kneeled down near the chair to put some warm clothing on the boy  thats exactly where it is  thats what i always say father exclaimed her admiring husband  theres a motherly feeling in mrs williams breast that must and will have went  ay ay said the old man youre right  my son williams right  it happens all for the best milly dear no doubt said mr william tenderly that we have no children of our own and yet i sometimes wish you had one to love and cherish  our little dead child that you built such hopes upon and that never breathed the breath of lifeit has made you quietlike milly  i am very happy in the recollection of it william dear she answered  i think of it every day  i was afraid you thought of it a good deal  dont say afraid it is a comfort to me it speaks to me in so many ways  the innocent thing that never lived on earth is like an angel to me william  you are like an angel to father and me said mr william softly i know that  when i think of all those hopes i built upon it and the many times i sat and pictured to myself the little smiling face upon my bosom that never lay there and the sweet eyes turned up to mine that never opened to the light said milly i can feel a greater tenderness i think for all the disappointed hopes in which there is no harm  when i see a beautiful child in its fond mothers arms i love it all the better thinking that my child might have been like that and might have made my heart as proud and happy  redlaw raised his head and looked towards her  all through life it seems by me she continued to tell me something  for poor neglected children my little child pleads as if it were alive and had a voice i knew with which to speak to me  when i hear of youth in suffering or shame i think that my child might have come to that perhaps and that god took it from me in his mercy  even in age and grey hair such as fathers it is present  saying that it too might have lived to be old long and long after you and i were gone and to have needed the respect and love of younger people  her quiet voice was quieter than ever as she took her husbands arm and laid her head against it  children love me so that sometimes i half fancyits a silly fancy williamthey have some way i dont know of of feeling for my little child and me and understanding why their love is precious to me  if i have been quiet since i have been more happy william in a hundred ways  not least happy dear in this that even when my little child was born and dead but a few days and i was weak and sorrowful and could not help grieving a little the thought arose that if i tried to lead a good life i should meet in heaven a bright creature who would call me mother  redlaw fell upon his knees with a loud cry  o thou he said who through the teaching of pure love hast graciously restored me to the memory which was the memory of christ upon the cross and of all the good who perished in his cause receive my thanks and bless her  then he folded her to his heart and milly sobbing more than ever cried as she laughed he is come back to himself  he likes me very much indeed too  oh dear dear dear me heres another  then the student entered leading by the hand a lovely girl who was afraid to come  and redlaw so changed towards him seeing in him and his youthful choice the softened shadow of that chastening passage in his own life to which as to a shady tree the dove so long imprisoned in his solitary ark might fly for rest and company fell upon his neck entreating them to be his children  then as christmas is a time in which of all times in the year the memory of every remediable sorrow wrong and trouble in the world around us should be active with us not less than our own experiences for all good he laid his hand upon the boy and silently calling him to witness who laid his hand on children in old time rebuking in the majesty of his prophetic knowledge those who kept them from him vowed to protect him teach him and reclaim him  then he gave his right hand cheerily to philip and said that they would that day hold a christmas dinner in what used to be before the ten poor gentlemen commuted their great dinner hall and that they would bid to it as many of that swidger family who his son had told him were so numerous that they might join hands and make a ring round england as could be brought together on so short a notice  and it was that day done  there were so many swidgers there grown up and children that an attempt to state them in round numbers might engender doubts in the distrustful of the veracity of this history  therefore the attempt shall not be made  but there they were by dozens and scoresand there was good news and good hope there ready for them of george who had been visited again by his father and brother and by milly and again left in a quiet sleep there present at the dinner too were the tetterbys including young adolphus who arrived in his prismatic comforter in good time for the beef  johnny and the baby were too late of course and came in all on one side the one exhausted the other in a supposed state of doubletooth but that was customary and not alarming  it was sad to see the child who had no name or lineage watching the other children as they played not knowing how to talk with them or sport with them and more strange to the ways of childhood than a rough dog  it was sad though in a different way to see what an instinctive knowledge the youngest children there had of his being different from all the rest and how they made timid approaches to him with soft words and touches and with little presents that he might not be unhappy  but he kept by milly and began to love herthat was another as she saidand as they all liked her dearly they were glad of that and when they saw him peeping at them from behind her chair they were pleased that he was so close to it  all this the chemist sitting with the student and his bride that was to be philip and the rest saw  some people have said since that he only thought what has been herein set down others that he read it in the fire one winter night about the twilight time others that the ghost was but the representation of his gloomy thoughts and milly the embodiment of his better wisdom  i say nothing   except this  that as they were assembled in the old hall by no other light than that of a great fire having dined early the shadows once more stole out of their hidingplaces and danced about the room showing the children marvellous shapes and faces on the walls and gradually changing what was real and familiar there to what was wild and magical  but that there was one thing in the hall to which the eyes of redlaw and of milly and her husband and of the old man and of the student and his bride that was to be were often turned which the shadows did not obscure or change deepened in its gravity by the firelight and gazing from the darkness of the panelled wall like life the sedate face in the portrait with the beard and ruff looked down at them from under its verdant wreath of holly as they looked up at it and clear and plain below as if a voice had uttered them were the words   lord keep my memory green
