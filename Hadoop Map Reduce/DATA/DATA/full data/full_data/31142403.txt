31142403	dusty diamonds cut and polished by rm ballantyne  first published 1884    as so often with ballantyne there are two concurrent stories in this book  in one of these we meet two little stray and homeless boys in the vicinity of whitechapel in the eastend of london these two are rescued from the streets trained up and sent to canada to live as part of a farmers family there  the other story concerns the mother of one of the boys with too many children a drinkhabit and a wifebeating and criminal husband plainly theres not much going for her but her eldest daughter manages to bring life together for the family  the bad father on his release from jail deserts his wife which is no bad thing the wife takes the blue ribbon and gives up drinking a couple of welltodo gentlemen take an interest in the family and finally they all emigrate to canada and live happily ever after  of course it is a little more complicated than that with a burglary thrown in as well as a smattering of dogooders and dobaders but for those with an interest in the streetlife of the nineteenth century this will be a very interesting book for you  a note about the author  robert michael ballantyne was born in 1825 and died in 1894  he was educated at the edinburgh academy and in 1841 he became a clerk with the hudson bay company working at the red river settlement in northern canada until 1847 arriving back in edinburgh in 1848  the letters he had written home were very amusing in their description of backwoods life and his family publishing connections suggested that he should construct a book based on these letters  three of his most enduring books were written over the next decade the young fur traders ungava the hudson bay company and were based on his experiences with the hbc  in this period he also wrote the coral island and martin rattler both of these taking place in places never visited by ballantyne  having been chided for small mistakes he made in these books he resolved always to visit the places he wrote about  with these books he became known as a great master of literature intended for teenagers  he researched the cornish mines the london fire brigade the postal service the railways the laying down of submarine telegraph cables the construction of lighthouses the lightship service the lifeboat service south africa norway the north sea fishing fleet ballooning deepsea diving algiers and many more experiencing the lives of the men and women in these settings by living with them for weeks and months at a time and he lived as they lived  he was a very truetolife author depicting the often squalid scenes he encountered with great care and attention to detail  his young readers looked forward eagerly to his next books and through the 1860s and 1870s there was a flow of books from his pen sometimes four in a year all very good reading  the rate of production diminished in the last ten or fifteen years of his life but the quality never failed  he published over ninety books under his own name and a few books for very young children under the pseudonym comus  for todays taste his books are perhaps a little too religious and what we would nowadays call pi  in part that was the way people wrote in those days but more important was the fact that in his days at the red river settlement in the wilds of canada he had been a little dissolute and he did not want his young readers to be unmindful of how they ought to behave as he felt he had been  some of his books were quite short little over 100 pages  these books formed a series intended for the children of poorer parents having less pocketmoney  these books are particularly wellwritten and researched because he wanted that readership to get the very best possible for their money  they were published as six series three books in each series  recreated as an etext by nick hodson september 2003    dusty diamonds cut and polished by rm ballantyne    chapter one  an accident and some of its curious results  every one has heard of those poniesthose shaggy chubby innocentlooking little creaturesfor which the world is indebted we suppose to shetland  well once on a time one of the most innocentlooking chubbiest and shaggiest of shetland poniesa dark brown onestood at the door of a mansion in the westend of london  it was attached to a wickerwork vehicle which resembled a large clothesbasket on small wheels  we do not mean of course that the pony was affectionately attached to it  no the attachment was involuntary and unavoidable by reason of a brandnew yellow leather harness with brass buckles  it objected to the attachment obviously for it sidled this way and straddled that way and whisked its enormous little tail and tossed its rotund little head and stamped its ridiculously small feet and champed its miniature bit as if it had been a warhorse of the largest size fit to carry a wallace a bruce or a richard of the lionheart into the midst of raging battle  and no wonder for many months had not elapsed since that brown creature had kicked up its little heels and twirled its tail and shaken its shaggy mane in all the wild exuberance of early youth and unfettered freedom on the heather hills of its native island  in the fourwheeled basket sat a little girl whom it is useless to describe as beautiful  she was far beyond that  her delicate colour her little straight nose her sparkling teeth her rosebud of a mouth her enormous blue eyes and floods of yellow hairpooh these are not worth mentioning in the same sentence with her expression  it was that which carried all before it and swept up the adoration of manandwomankind as with the besom of fascination  she was the only child of sir richard brandon  sir richard was a knight and a widower  he was knighted not because of personal merit but because he had been mayor of some place sometime or other when some one connected with royalty had something important to do with it little diana was all that this knight and widower had on earth to care for except of course his horses and dogs and guns and club and food  he was very particular as to his food  not that he was an epicure or a gourmand or luxurious or a hard drinker or anything of that sortby no means  he could rough it so he said as well as any man and put up with whatever chanced to be going but when there was no occasion for roughing it he did like to see things well cooked and nicely served and wine you know was not worth drinkingpositively nauseousif it was not of the best  sir richard was a poor mana very poor man  he had only five thousand a yeara mere pittance and he managed this sum in such a peculiar way that he never had anything wherewith to help a struggling friend or to give to the poor or to assist the various religious and charitable institutions by which he was surrounded while at certain intervals in the year he experienced exasperating difficulty in meeting the demands of those torments to society the tradespeoplepeople who ought to be ashamed of themselves for not being willing to supply the nobility and gentry with food and clothing gratuitously  moreover sir richard never by any chance laid anything by  standing by the ponys head and making tender efforts to restrain his waywardness stood a boya street boya city arab  to a londoner any description of this boy would be superfluous but it may be well to state for the benefit of the world at large that the class to which he belonged embodies within its pale the quintessence of rollicking mischief and the sublimate of consummate insolence  this remarkable boy was afflicted with a species of dancenot that of saint vitus but a sort of doubleshuffle with a stamp of the right foot at the endin which he was prone to indulge consciously and unconsciously at all times and the tendency to which he sometimes found it difficult to resist  he was beginning to hum the sharplydefined air to which he was in the habit of performing this dance when little diana said in a silvery voice quite in keeping with her beauty  let go his head boy im quite sure that he cannot bear restraint  it may be remarked here that little di was probably a good judge on that point being herself nearly incapable of bearing restraint  id better not miss replied the boy with profound respect in tone and manner for he had yet to be paid for the job he seems raither frisky an might take a fancy to bolt you know  let his head go i say returned miss diana with a flashing of the blue eyes and a pursing of the rosebud mouth that proved her to be one of adams race after all  vell now dont you think rejoined the boy in an expostulating tone that it would be as veil to vait for the guvnor before givin im is ead  do as i bid you sir said di drawing herself up like an empress  still the street boy held the ponys head and it is probable that he would have come off the victor in this controversy had not dianas dignified action given to the reins which she held a jerk  the brown pony deeming this full permission to go on went off with a bound that overturned the boy and caused the forewheel to strike him on the leg as it passed  springing up with the intention of giving chase to the runaway the little fellow again fell with a sharp cry of pain for his leg was broken  at the same moment sir richard brandon issued from the door of his mansion leisurely and with an air of calm serenity pulling on his gloves  it was one of the knights maxims that under all circumstances a gentleman should maintain an appearance of imperturbable serenity  when however he suddenly beheld the street boy falling and his daughter standing up in her wickerwork chariot holding on to the brown pony like an amazon warrior of ancient times his maxim somehow evaporated  his serenity vanished  so did his hat as he bounded from beneath it and left it far behind in his mad and hopeless career after the runaway  a policeman coming up just as sir richard disappeared went to the assistance of the street boy  not much hurt youngster he said kindly as he observed that the boy was very pale and seemed to be struggling hard to repress his feelings  vell praps i is an praps i aint bobby replied the boy with an unsuccessful attempt at a smile for he felt safe to chaff or insult his foe in the circumstances but vether hurt or not it vont much matter to you vill it  he fainted as he spoke and the look of halfhumorous impudence as well as that of pain gave place to an expression of infantine repose  the policeman was so struck by the unusual sight of a street boy looking innocent and unconscious that he stooped and raised him quite tenderly in his arms  youd better carry him in here said sir richard brandons butler who had come out  i saw it appen and suspect he must be a good deal damaged  sir richards footman backing the invitation the boy was carried into the house accordingly laid on the housemaids bed and attended to by the cook while the policeman went out to look after the runaways  oh what ever shall we do exclaimed the cook as the boy showed symptoms of returning consciousness  send for the doctor suggested the housemaid  no said the butler send for a cab and ave the boy sent home  i fear that master will blame me for givin way to my feelins and wont thank me for bringin im in here  you know he is rather averse to the lower orders  besides the poor boy will be better attended to at ome no doubt  i dare say youd like to go ome wouldnt you he said observing that the boy was looking at him with a rather curious expression  i dessay i should if i could he answered with a mingled glance of mischief and pain but if youll undertake to carry me old cock ill be appy to go  ill send you in a cab my poor boy returned the butler and git a cabman as im acquainted with to take care of you  all right go aead ye cripples returned the boy as the cook approached him with a cup of warm soup  oh aint it prime he said opening his eyes very wide indeed and smacking his lips  i think ill go in for a smashed pin every day o my life for a drop o that stuff  surely it must be wot they drinks in eaven  have ee got much more o the same on and  never mind but you drink away while youve got the chance replied the amiable cook theres the cab coming so youve no time to lose  vell i am sorry i aint able to old more an my pockets wont old it neither bein the wuss for wear  thankee missus  he managed by a strong effort to dispose of a little more soup before the cab drew up  where do you live asked the butler as he placed the boy carefully in the bottom of the cab with his unkempt head resting on a hassock which he gave him to understand was a parting gift from the housemaid  vere do i live he repeated  vy mostly in the streets my last ome was a sugar barrel the one before was a donkeycart but i do sometimes condescend to wisit my parents in their mansion ouse in vitechapel  and what is your name  sir richard may wish to inquire for you perhaps  may he  oh  im sorry i aint got my card to leave but you just tell him johnis it or thomasah  thomas  i knowed it couldnt elp to be one or totheryou just tell your master that my name is robert better known as bobby frog  but ive lots of aliases if that name dont please im  goodbye thomas  farewell and if for ever then you know the rest o the quotation if your eddications not bin neglected wich is probable it was  oh by the way  this assik is the gift of the ousemaid  you observe the answer cabby in case you and i may differ about it ereafter  yes said the amused butler a gift from jessie  ahjus so  an shes tenderearted an ony fifteen  wots er tother name  summers eh  vell its prettier than vinters  tell er ill not forget er  now cabmanome  a few minutes more and bobby frog was on his way to the mansion in whitechapel highly delighted with his recent feast but suffering extremely from his broken limb  meanwhile the brown ponyhaving passed a bold costermonger who stood shouting defiance at it and waving both arms till it was close on him when he stepped quickly out of its wayeluded a drayman and entered on a fine sweep of street where there seemed to be no obstruction worth mentioning  by that time it had left the agonised father far behind  the day was fine the air bracing  the utmost strength of poor little diana and she applied it well made no impression whatever on the ponys tough mouth  influences of every kind were favourable  on the illogical principle probably that being in for a penny justified being in for a pound the pony laid himself out for a glorious run he warmed to his work caused the dust to fly and the clothesbasket to advance with irregular bounds and swayings as he scampered along driving many little dogs wild with delight and two or three cats mad with fear  gradually he drew towards the more populous streets and here of course the efforts on the part of the public to arrest him became more frequent also more decided though not more successful  at last an inanimate object effected what man and boy had failed to accomplish  in a wild effort to elude a demonstrative cabman near the corner of one of the main thoroughfares the brown pony brought the wheels of the vehicle into collision with a lamppost  that lamppost went down before the shock like a tall head of grain before the sickle  the front wheels doubled up into a sudden embrace broke loose and went across the road one into a greengrocers shop the other into a chemists window  thus diversely end many careers that begin on a footing of equality  the hindwheels went careering along the road like a new species of bicycle until brought up by a donkeycart while the basket chariot rolled itself violently round the lamppost like a shattered remnant as if resolved before perishing to strangle the author of all the mischief  as to the pony it stopped and seemed surprised at first by the unexpected finale but the look quickly changedor appeared to changeto one of calm contentment as it surveyed the ruin  but what of the fair little charioteer  truly in regard to her a miracle or something little short of one had occurred  the doctrine that extremes meet contains much truth in ittruth which is illustrated and exemplified more frequently we think than is generally supposed a tremendous accident is often much less damaging to the person who experiences it than a slight one  in little dianas case the extremes had met and the result was absolute safety  she was shot out of her basket carriage after the manner of a skyrocket but the impulse was so effective that instead of causing her to fall on her head and break her pretty little neck it made her perform a complete somersault and alight upon her feet  moreover the spot on which she alighted was opportune as well as admirably suited to the circumstances  at the moment ignorant of what was about to happen policeconstable number 666we are not quite sure of what divisionin all the plenitude of power and blue and sixfeettwo approached the end of a street entering at right angles to the one down which our little heroine had flown  he was a superb specimen of humanity this constable with a chest and shoulders like hercules and the figure of apollo  he turned the corner just as the child had completed her somersault and received her two little feet fairly in the centre of his broad breast driving him flat on his back more effectively than could have been done by the best prizefighter in england  number 666 proved a most effectual buffer for di after planting her blow on his chest sat plump down on his stomach off which she sprang in an agony of consternation exclaiming  oh  i have killed him  ive killed him and burst into tears  no my little lady said number 666 as he rose with one or two coughs and replaced his helmet youve not quite done for me though youve come nearer the mark than any man has ever yet accomplished  come now what can i do for you  youre not hurt i hope  this sally was received with a laugh almost amounting to a cheer by the halfhorrified crowd which had quickly assembled to witness as it expected a fatal accident  hurt oh no im not hurt exclaimed di while tears still converted her eyes into blue lakelets as she looked anxiously up in the face of number 666 but im quite sure you must be hurtawfully  im so sorry  indeed i am for i didnt mean to knock you down  this also was received by the crowd with a hearty laugh while number 666 sought to comfort the child by earnestly assuring her that he was not hurt in the leastonly a little stunned at first but that was quite gone  wot does she mean by knockin of im down asked a small butchers boy who had come on the scene just too late of a small bakers boy who had happily been there from the beginning  she means wot she says replied the small bakers boy with the dignified reticence of superior knowledge she knocked the constable down  wot a leetle gurl knock a sixfoot bobby downwalker  very good youve no call to blieve it unless you like replied the bakers boy with a look of pity at the unbelieving butcher but she did it thoughan thats six month with ard labour if it aint five year  at this point the crowd opened up to let a maniac enter  he was breathless hatless moist and frantic  my child my darling my dear di he gasped  papa responded diana with a little scream and leaping into his arms grasped him in a genuine hug  oh  i say whispered the small butcher its a mellydrammyall for nuffin  my responded the small baker with a solemn look wont the lord lefttenant be down on em for playactin without a licence just  is the pony killed inquired sir richard recovering himself  not in the least sir  ere e is sir all alive an kickin answered the small butcher delighted to have the chance of making himself offensively useful but the hinsurance offices wouldnt ave the closebaskit at no price  shall i order up the remains of your carriage sir  oh  im so glad hes not dead said diana looking hastily up but this policeman was nearly killed and i did it  he saved my life papa  a chorus of voices here explained to sir richard how number 666 had come up in the nick of time to receive the flying child upon his bosom  i am deeply grateful to you said the knight turning to the constable and extending his hand which the latter shook modestly while disclaiming any merit for having merely performed his dutyhe might say involuntarily  will you come to my house said sir richard  here is my card  i should like to see you again and pray see that some one looks after my pony and  and the remains suggested the small butcher seeing that sir richard hesitated  be so good as to call a cab said sir richard in a general way to any one who chose to obey  here you are sir cried a peculiarly sharp cabby who correctly judging from the state of affairs that his services would be required had drawn near to bide his time  sir richard and his little daughter got in and were driven home leaving number 666 to look after the pony and the remains  thus curiously were introduced to each other some of the characters in our tale    chapter two  the irresistible power of love  need we remark that there was a great deal of embracing on the part of di and her nurse when the former returned home  the child was an affectionate creature as well as passionate  the nurse mrs screwbury was also affectionate without being passionate  poor diana had never known a mothers love or care but good steady stout mrs screwbury did what in her lay to fill the place of mother  sir richard filled the place of father pretty much as a lamppost might have done had it owned a child  he illuminated her to some extent explained things in general stiffly and shed a feeble ray around himself but his light did not extend far  he was proud of her however and very fond of herwhen good  when not good he wasor rather had beenin the habit of dismissing her to the nursery  nevertheless the child exercised very considerable and everincreasing influence over her father for although stiff the knight was by no means destitute of natural affection and sometimes observed with moist eyes strong traces of resemblance to his lost wife in the beautiful child  indeed as years advanced he became a more and more obedient father and was obviously on the high road to abject slavery  papa said di while they were at luncheon that day not long after the accident i am so sorry for that poor policeman  it seems such a dreadful thing to have actually jumped upon him and oh you should have heard his poor head hit the pavement and seen his pretty helmet go spinning along like a boys top ever so far  i wonder it didnt kill him  im so sorry  di emphasised her sorrow by laughing for she had a keen sense of the ludicrous and the memory of the spinning helmet was strong upon her just then  it must indeed have been an unpleasant blow replied sir richard gravely but then dear you couldnt help it you knowand i dare say he is none the worse for it now  men like him are not easily injured i fear we cannot say as much for the boy who was holding the pony  oh  i quite forgot about him exclaimed di the naughty boy he wouldnt let go the ponys reins when i bid him but i saw he tumbled down when we set off  yes he has been somewhat severely punished i fear for his disobedience  his leg had been broken  is it not so balls  yes sir replied the butler e as ad is  balls got no farther for diana who had been struck dumb for the moment by the news recovered herself  his leg broken she exclaimed with a look of consternation oh the poor poor boythe dear boy and it was me did that too as well as knocking down the poor policeman  there is no saying to what lengths the remorseful child would have gone in the way of selfcondemnation if her father had not turned her thoughts from herself by asking what had been done for the boy  we sent im ome sir in a cab  im afraid that was a little too prompt returned the knight thoughtfully  a broken leg requires careful treatment i suppose  you should have had him into the house and sent for a doctor  balls coughed  he was slightly chagrined to find that the violation of his own humane feelings had been needless and that his attempt to do as he thought his master would have wished was in vain  i thought sir richard that you didnt like the lower orders to go about the ouse more  again little di interrupted the butler by asking excitedly where the boys home was  in the neighbourood of witechapel miss di  then papa we will go straight off to see him said the child in the tone of one whose mind is fully made up  you and i shall go together wont we good papa  that will do balls you may go  no my dear di i think we had better not  i will write to one of the city missionaries whom i know and ask him to  no but papadear papa we must go  the city missionary could never say how very very sorry i am that he should have broken his leg while helping me  and then i should so like to sit by him and tell him stories and give him his soup and gruel and read to him  poor poor boy we must go papa wont you  not today dear  it is impossible to go today  there now dont begin to cry  perhapsperhaps tomorrowbut think my love you have no idea how dirtyhow very nastythe places are in which our lower orders live  oh yes i have said di eagerly  havent i seen our nursery on cleaning days  a faint flicker of a smile passed over the knights countenance  true darling but the places are far far dirtier than that  then the smells  oh they are very dreadful  whatworse than we have when theres cabbage for dinner  yes much worse than that  i dont care papa  we must go to see the boythe poor poor boy in spite of dirt and smells  and then you knowlet me up on your knee and ill tell you all about it  there  well then you know id tidy the room up and even wash it a little  oh you cant think how nicely i washed up my dolls roomher corner you knowthat day when i spilt all her soup in trying to feed her and then while trying to wipe it up i accidentally burst her and all her inside came outthe sawdust i mean  it was the worst mess i ever made but i cleaned it up as well as jessie herself could have doneso nurse said  but the messes down in whitechapel are much worse than you have described dear expostulated the parent who felt that his powers of resistance were going  so much the better papa replied di kissing her sires lethargic visage  i should like so much to try if i could clean up something worse than my dolls room  and youve promised you know  noonly said perhaps returned sir richard quickly  well thats the same thing and now that its all nicely settled ill go and see nurse  goodbye papa  goodbye dear returned the knight resigning himself to his fate and the newspaper    chapter three  poverty manages to board out her infant for nothing  on the night of the day about which we have been writing a woman dressed in unwomanly rags crept out of the shadow of the houses near london bridge  she was a thin middleaged woman with a countenance from which sorrow suffering and sin had not been able to obliterate entirely the traces of beauty  she carried a bundle in her arms which was easily recognisable as a baby from the careful and affectionate manner in which the womans thin outspread fingers grasped it  hurrying on to the bridge till she reached the middle of one of the arches she paused and looked over  the thames was black and gurgling for it was intensely dark and the tide half ebb at the time  the turbid waters chafed noisily on the stone piers as if the sins and sorrows of the great city had been somehow communicated to them  but the distance from the parapet to the surface of the stream was great  it seemed awful in the womans eyes  she shuddered and drew back  oh for courageonly for one minute she murmured clasping the bundle closer to her breast  the action drew off a corner of the scanty rag which she called a shawl and revealed a small and round yet exceedingly thin face the black eyes of which seemed to gaze in solemn wonder at the scene of darkness visible which was revealed  the woman stood between two lamps in the darkest place she could find but enough of light reached her to glitter in the babys solemn eyes as they met her gaze and it made a pitiful attempt to smile as it recognised its mother  god help me  i cant muttered the woman with a shiver as if an iceblock had touched her heart  she drew the rag hastily over the babys head again pressed it closer to her breast retraced her steps and dived into the shadows from which she had emerged  this was one of the lower orders to whom sir richard brandon had such an objection whom he found it he said so difficult to deal with no wonder for he never tried to deal with them at all in any sense worthy of the name and whom it was he said useless to assist because all he could do in such a vast accumulation of poverty would be a mere drop in the bucket  hence sir richard thought it best to keep the drop in his pocket where it could be felt and do goodat least to himself rather than dissipate it in an almost empty bucket  the bucket however was not quite emptythanks to a few thousands of people who differed from the knight upon that point  the thin woman hastened through the streets as regardless of passersby as they were of her until she reached the neighbourhood of commercial street spitalfields  here she paused and looked anxiously round her  she had left the main thoroughfare and the spot on which she stood was dimly lighted whatever she looked or waited for did not however soon appear for she stood under a lamppost muttering to herself i must git rid of it  better to do so than see it starved to death before my eyes  presently a footfall was heard and a man drew near  the woman gazed intently into his face  it was not a pleasant face  there was a scowl on it  she drew back and let him pass  then several women passed but she took no notice of them  then another man appeared  his face seemed a jolly one  the woman stepped forward at once and confronted him  please sir she began but the man was too sharp for her  come nowyouve brought out that baby on purpose to humbug people with it  dont fancy youll throw dust in my eyes  im too old a cock for that  dont you know that youre breaking the law by begging  im not begging retorted the woman almost fiercely  oh indeed  why do you stop me then  i merely wished to ask if your name is thompson  ah hem ejaculated the man with a broad grin well no madam my name is not thompson  well then rejoined the woman still indignantly you may move on  she had used an expression all too familiar to herself and the man obeying the order with a bow and a mocking laugh disappeared like those who had gone before him  for some time no one else appeared save a policeman  when he approached the woman went past him down the street as if bent on some business but when he was out of sight she returned to the old spot which was near the entrance to an alley  at last the womans patience was rewarded by the sight of a burly little elderly man whose face of benignity was unmistakably genuine remembering the previous mans reference to the baby she covered it up carefully and held it more like a bundle  stepping up to the newcomer at once she put the same question as to name and also asked if he lived in russell square  no my good woman replied the burly little man with a look of mingled surprise and pity my name is not thompson  it is twitter samuel twitter of twitter slime and but he added checking himself under a sudden and rare impulse of prudence why do you ask my name and address  the woman gave an almost hysterical laugh at having been so successful in her somewhat clumsy scheme and without uttering another word darted down the alley  she passed rapidly round by a back way to another point of the same street she had leftwell ahead of the spot where she had stood so long and so patiently that night  here she suddenly uncovered the babys face and kissed it passionately for a few moments  then wrapping it in the ragged shawl with its little head out she laid it on the middle of the footpath full in the light of a lamp and retired to await the result  when the woman rushed away as above related mr samuel twitter stood for some minutes rooted to the spot lost in amazement  he was found in that condition by the returning policeman  constable said he cocking his hat to one side the better to scratch his bald head there are strange people in this region  indeed there are sir  yes but i mean very strange people  well sir if you insist on it i wont deny that some of them are very strange  yes wellgoodnight constable said mr twitter moving slowly forward in a mystified state of mind while the guardian of the night continued his rounds thinking to himself that he had just parted from one of the very strangest of the people  suddenly samuel twitter came to a full stop for there lay the small baby gazing at him with its solemn eyes apparently quite indifferent to the hardness and coldness of its bed of stone  abandoned gasped the burly little man  whether mr twitter referred to the infants moral character or to its being shamefully forsaken we cannot now prove but he instantly caught the bundle in his arms and gazed at it  possibly his gaze may have been too intense for the mild little creature opened a small mouth that bore no proportion whatever to the eyes and attempted to cry but the attempt was a failure  it had not strength to cry  the burly little mans soul was touched to the centre by the sight  he kissed the babys forehead pressed it to his ample breast and hurried away  if he had taken time to think he might have gone to a policeoffice or a night refuge or some such haven of rest for the weary but when twitters feelings were touched he became a man of impulse  he did not take time to thinkexcept to the extent that on reaching the main thoroughfare he hailed a cab and was driven home  the poor mother had followed him with the intention of seeing him home of course the cab put an end to that  she felt comparatively easy however knowing as she did that her child was in the keeping of twitter slime and   that was quite enough to enable her to trace mr twitter out  comforting herself as well as she could with this reflection she sat down in a dark corner on a cold doorstep and covering her face with both hands wept as though her heart would break  gradually her sobs subsided and rising she hurried away shivering with cold for her thin cotton dress was a poor protection against the night chills and her ragged shawl wasgone with the baby  in a few minutes she reached a part of the whitechapel district where some of the deepest poverty and wretchedness in london is to be found turning into a labyrinth of small streets and alleys she paused in the neighbourhood of the court in which was her homeif such it could be called  is it worth while going back to him she muttered  he nearly killed baby and it wouldnt take much to make him kill me  and oh he was so differentonce  while she stood irresolute the man of whom she spoke chanced to turn the corner and ran against her somewhat roughly  hallo is that you he demanded in tones that told too clearly where he had been spending the night  yes ned its me  i was just thinking about going home  home indeedstime to bgoin home  wherev you bin  the babby ll v bin squallin pretty stiff by this time  no fear of baby now returned the wife almost defiantly its gone  gone almost shouted the husband  you havent murdered it have you  no but ive put it in safe keeping where you cant get at it and now i know that i dont care what you do to me  ha well see about that  come along  he seized the woman by the arm and hurried her towards their dwelling  it was little better than a cellar the door being reached by a descent of five or six muchworn steps  to the surprise of the couple the door which was usually shut at that hour stood partly open and a bright light shone within  wastin coal and candle growled the man with an angry oath as he approached  hetty didnt use to be so extravagant remarked the woman in some surprise  as she spoke the door was flung wide open and an overgrown but very handsome girl peered out  oh father i thought it was your voice she said  mother is that you  come in quick  heres bobby brought home in a cab with a broken leg  on hearing this the mans voice softened and entering the room he went up to a heap of straw in one corner whereon our little friend bobby frogthe streetarablay  hallo  bobby wots wrong with ee  you aint used to come to grief said the father laying his hand on the boys shoulder and giving him a rough shake  things oftentimes are not what they seem  the shake was the mans mode of expressing sympathy for he was fond of his son regarding him with some reason as a most hopeful pupil in the ways of wickedness  its o no use father said the boy drawing his breath quickly and knitting his brows you cant stir me up with a long pole now  im past that  what have ee bin runned over  noony run down or knocked down  who did it  ony give me his name an address an as sure as my names ned ill  he finished the sentence with a sufficiently expressive scowl and clenching of a huge fist which had many a time done great execution in the prize ring  it wasnt a he father it was a she  well no matter if i ony had my fingers on her windpipe id squeeze it summat  if you did id bang your nose  she didnt go for to do it apurpose you old grampus retorted bobby intending the remark to be taken as a gentle yet affectionate reproof  a doctors bin an set my leg continued the boy an made it as stiff as a poker wi what e calls splints  he says i wont be able to go about for ever so many weeks  an whos to feed you i wonder doorin them weeks  an who sent for the doctor  was it him as supplied the fire an candle tonight  no father it was me answered hetty who was engaged in stirring something in a small saucepan the loose handle of which was attached to its battered body by only one rivet the other rivet had given way on an occasion when ned frog sent it flying through the doorway after his retreating wife  you see i was paid my wages tonight so i could afford it as well as to buy some coal and a candle for the doctor said bobby must be kept warm  afford it exclaimed ned in rising wrath how can ee say you can afford it wen i avent had enough grog to half screw me an not a brown left  did the doctor ask a fee  no father i offered him one but he wouldnt take it  ahvery good on im  i wonder them fellows has the cheek to ask fees for ony givin advice  wy id give advice myself all day long at a penny an hour an think myself well off too if i got thatbetter off than them as got the advice anyhow  what are you sittin starin at an sulkin there for  this last remark was addressed gruffly to mrs frog who during the previous conversation had seated herself on a low threelegged stool and clasping her hands over her knees gazed at the dirty blank walls in blanker despair  the poor woman realised the situation better than her drunken husband did  as a birdfancier he contributed little almost nothing to the general fund on which this family subsisted  he was a huge powerful fellow and had various methods of obtaining moneysome obvious and others mysteriousbut nearly all his earnings went to the ginpalace for ned was a man of might and could stand an enormous quantity of drink  hetty who worked perhaps we should say slaved for a firm which paid her one shilling a week could not manage to find food for them all  mrs frog herself with her infant to care for had found it hard work at any time to earn a few pence and now bobbys active little limbs were reduced to inaction converting him into a consumer instead of a producer  in short the glaring fact that the family expenses would be increased while the family income was diminished stared mrs frog as blankly in the face as she stared at the dirty blank wall  and her case was worse even than people in better circumstances might imagine for the family lived so literally from hand to mouth that there was no time even to think when a difficulty arose or disaster befell they rented their room from a man who styled it a furnished apartment in virtue of a rickety table a broken chair a wornout sheet or two a dilapidated counterpane four ragged blankets and the infirm saucepan before mentioned besides a few articles of cracked or broken crockery for this accommodation the landlord charged ninepence per day which sum had to be paid every night before the family was allowed to retire to rest  in the event of failure to pay they would have been turned out into the street at once and the door padlocked  thus the necessity for a constant though small supply of cash became urgent and the consequent instability of home very depressing  to preserve his goods from the pawnbroker and prevent a moonlight flitting this landlord had printed on his sheets the words stolen from  and on the blankets and counterpane were stamped the words stop thief  mrs frog made no reply to her husbands gruff question which induced the man to seize an empty bottle as being the best way of rousing her attention  come you let mother alone dad suggested bobby she aint aaggrawatin of you just now  why mother exclaimed hetty who was so busy with bobbys supper and withal so accustomed to the womans looks of hopeless misery that she had failed to observe anything unusual until her attention was thus called to her what ever have you done with the baby  ahyou may well ask that growled ned  even the boy seemed to forget his pain for a moment as he now observed anxiously that his mother had not the usual bundle on her breast  the babys gone she said bitterly still keeping her eyes on the blank wall  gonehowlost killed speak mother burst from hetty and the boy  no only gone to where it will be better cared for than here  come explain old woman said ned again laying his hand on the bottle  as hetty went and took her hand gently mrs frog condescended to explain but absolutely refused to tell to whose care the baby had been consigned  wellit aint a bad riddance after all said the man as he rose and staggering into a corner where another bundle of straw was spread on the floor flung himself down  appropriately drawing two of the stop thief blankets over him he went to sleep  then mrs frog feeling comparatively sure of quiet for the remainder of the night drew her stool close to the side of her son and held such intercourse with him as she seldom had the chance of holding while bobby was in a state of full health and bodily vigour  hetty meanwhile ministered to them both for she was one of those dusty diamonds of what may be styled the eastend diggings of londonnot so rare perhaps as many people may supposewhose lustre is dimmed and intrinsic value somewhat concealed by the neglect and the moral as well as physical filth by which they are surrounded  of course youve paid the ninepence hetty  yes mother  you might ave guessed that said bobby for if she adnt we shouldnt ave bin here  that and the firing and candle with what the doctor ordered has used up all i had earned even though i did some extra work and was paid for it said hetty with a sigh  but i dont grudge it bobbyim only sorry because theres nothing more coming to me till next week  meanwhile there is nothing for this week said mrs frog with a return of the despair as she looked at her prostrate son for all i can manage to earn will barely make up the rentif it does even that and father you know drinks nearly all he makes  god help us  god will help us said hetty sitting down on the floor and gently stroking the back of her mothers hand for he sent the trouble and will hear us when we cry to him  pray to him then hetty for its no use askin me to join you  i cant pray  an dont let your father hear else hell be wild  the poor girl bent her head on her knees as she sat and prayed silently  her mother and brother neither of whom had any faith in prayer remained silent while her father breathing stertorously in the corner slept the sleep of the drunkard    chapter four  samuel twitter astonishes mrs twitter and her friends  in a former chapter we described to some extent the person and belongings of a very poor man with five thousand a year  let us now make the acquaintance of a very rich one with an income of five hundred  he has already introduced himself to the reader under the name of samuel twitter  on the night of which we write mrs twitter happened to have a few friends to tea  and let no one suppose that mrs twitters few friends were to be put off with afternoon teathat miserable invention of modern timesnor with a sham meal of sweet warm water and thin bread and butter  by no means  we have said that samuel twitter was rich and mrs twitter conscious of her husbands riches as well as grateful for them went in for the substantial and luxurious to an amazing extent  unlimited pork sausages and inexhaustible buttered toast balanced with muffins or crumpets was her idea of tea  the liquid was a secondary pointin one sensebut it was always strong  it was the only strong liquid in fact allowed in the house for mr twitter mrs twitter and all the little twitters were members of the blue ribbon army more or less enthusiastic according to their light and capacity  the young twitters descended in a graduated scale from sammy the eldest about sixteen down through molly and willie and fred and lucy to alice the socalled babythough she was at that time a remarkably robust baby of four years  mrs twitters few friends were aware of her tendencies and appreciated her hospitality insomuch that the few bade fair to develop by degrees into many  well mrs twitter had her few friends to tea and conviviality was at its height  the subject of conversation was poverty  mrs loper a weakminded but amiable lady asserted that a large family with 500 pounds a year was a poor family  mrs loper did not know that mrs twitters income was five hundred but she suspected it  mrs twitter herself carefully avoided giving the slightest hint on the subject  of course continued mrs loper i dont mean to say that people with five hundred are very poor you know indeed it all depends on the family  with six children like you now to feed and clothe and educate and with everything so dear as it is now i should say that five hundred was poverty  well i dont quite agree with you mrs loper on that point  to my mind it does not so much depend on the family as on the notions and the capacity to manage in the head of the family  i remember one family just now whose head was cut off suddenly i may say in the prime of life  a hundred and fifty a year or thereabouts was the income the widow had to count on and she was left with five little ones to rear she trained them well gave them good educations made most of their garments with her own hands when they were little and sent one of her boys to college yet was noted for the amount of time she spent in visiting the poor the sick and the afflicted for whom she had always a little to spare out of her limited income  now if wealth is to be measured by results i think we may say that that poor lady was rich she was deeply mourned by a large circle of poor people when she was taken home to the better land  her small means having been judiciously invested by a brother increased a little towards the close of life but she never was what the world esteems rich  mrs twitter looked at a very tall man with a dark unhandsome countenance as if to invite his opinion  i quite agree with you he said helping himself to a crumpet there are some people with small incomes who seem to be always in funds just as there are other people with large incomes who are always hardup the former are really rich the latter really poor  having delivered himself of these sentiments somewhat sententiously mr crackabythat was his nameproceeded to consume the crumpet  there was a general tendency on the part of the other guests to agree with their hostess but one black sheep in the flock objected  he quite agreed of course with the general principle that liberality with small means was beautiful to behold as well as desirable to possessthe liberality not the small meansand that on the other hand riches with a narrow niggardly spirit was abominable but thenand the black sheep came usually to the strongest part of his argument when he said but thenit was an uncommonly difficult thing when everything was up to famine prices and gold was depreciated in value owing to the goldfields and silver was nowhere and coppers were changed into bronzeexceedingly difficult to practise liberality and at the same time to make the two ends meet  as no one clearly saw the exact bearing of the black sheeps argument they all replied with that half idiotic simper with which ignorance seeks to conceal herself and which politeness substitutes for the more emphatic pooh or the inelegant bosh  then applying themselves with renewed zest to the muffins they put about ship nautically speaking and went off on a new tack  mr twitter is rather late tonight i think said mr crackaby consulting his watch which was antique and turnipy in character  he is indeed replied the hostess business must have detained him for he is the very soul of punctuality  that is one of his many good qualities and it is such a comfort for i can always depend on him to the minutebreakfast dinner tea he never keeps us waiting as too many men do except of course when he is unavoidably detained by business  ah yes business has much to answer for remarked mrs loper in a tone which suggested that she held business to be an incorrigibly bad fellow whatever mischief happens with ones husband its sure to be business that did it  pardon me madam objected the black sheep whose name by the way was stickler business does bring about much of the disaster that often appertains to wedded life but mischief is sometimes done by other means such for instance as accidents robberies murders  oh  mr stickler suddenly interrupted a stout smiling lady named larrabel who usually did the audience part of mrs twitters little tea parties how can you suggest such ideas especially when mr twitter is unusually late  mr stickler protested that he had no intention of alarming the company by disagreeable suggestions that he had spoken of accident robbery and murder in the abstract  there youve said it all over again interrupted mrs larrabel with an unwonted frown  but then continued stickler regardless of the interruption a broken leg or a rifled pocket and stunned person or a cut windpipe may be applicable to the argument in hand without being applied to mr twitter  surely said mrs loper who deemed the reply unanswerable  in this edifying strain the conversation flowed on until the evening grew late and the party began to grow alarmed  i do hope nothing has happened to him said mrs loper with a solemnised face  i think not  i have seen him come home much later than thisthough not often said the hostess the only one of the party who seemed quite at ease and who led the conversation back again into shallower channels  as the night advanced however the alarm became deeper and it was even suggested by mrs loper that crackaby should proceed to twitters officea distance of three milesto inquire whether and when he had left while the smiling mrs larrabel proposed to send information to the headquarters of the police in scotland yard because the police knew everything and could find out anything  you have no idea my dear she said how clever they are at scotland yard  would you believe it i left my umbrellar the other day in a cab and i didnt know the number of the cab for numbers wont remain in my head nor the look of the cabman for i never look at cabmen they are so rude sometimes  i didnt even remember the place where i got into the cab for i cant remember places when ive to go to so many so i gave up my umbrellar for lost and was going away when a policeman stepped up to me and asked in a very civil tone if i had lost anything he was so polite and pleasant that i told him of my loss though i knew it would do me no good as he had not seen the cab or the cabman  i think madam he said that if you go down to scotland yard tomorrow morning you may probably find it there  young man said i do you take me for a fool  no madam i dont he replied  or do you take my umbrellar for a fool said i that it should walk down to scotland yard of its own accord and wait there till i called for it  certainly not madam he answered with such a pleasant smile that i half forgave him  nevertheless if you happen to be in the neighbourhood of scotland yard tomorrow he added it might be as well to call in and inquire  thank you said i with a stiff bow as i left him  on the way home however i thought there might be something in it so i did go down to scotland yard next day where i was received with as much civility as if i had been a lady of quality and was taken to a room as full of umbrellas as an eggs full of meatalmost  youd know the umbrellar if you saw it madam said the polite constable who escorted me  know it sir said i yes i should think i would  seven and sixpence it cost menew and ive only had it a weekbrown silk with a plain handlewhy there it is  and there it was sure enough and he gave it to me at once only requiring me to write my name in a book which i did with great difficulty because of my gloves and being so nervous  now how did the young policeman that spoke to me the day before know that my umbrellar would go there and how did it get there they say the days of miracles are over but i dont think so for that was a miracle if ever there was one  the days of miracles are indeed over maam said the black sheep but then that is no reason why things which are in themselves commonplace should not appear miraculous to the uninstructed mind  when i inform you that our laws compel cabmen under heavy penalties to convey left umbrellas and parcels to the policeoffice the miracle may not seem quite so surprising  most people dislike to have their miracles unmasked  mrs larrabel turned from the black sheep to her hostess without replying and repeated her suggestion about making inquiries at scotland yardthus delicately showing that although possibly convinced she was by no means converted  they were interrupted at this point by a hurried knock at the street door  there he is at last exclaimed every one  it is his knock certainly said mrs twitter with a perplexed look but rather peculiarnot so firm as usualthere it is again impatient  i never knew my sam impatient before in all our wedded life youd better open the door dear she said turning to the eldest twitter he being the only one of the six who was privileged to sit up late mary seems to have fallen asleep  before the eldest twitter could obey the maligned mary was heard to open the door and utter an exclamation of surprise and her masters step was heard to ascend the stair rather unsteadily  the guests looked at each other anxiously  it might be that to some mindscertainly to that of the black sheepvisions of violated blueribbonism occurred  as certainly these visions did not occur to mrs twitter  she would sooner have doubted her clergyman than her husband  trustfulness formed a prominent part of her character and her confidence in her sam was unbounded  even when her husband came against the drawingroom door with an awkward bangthe passage being darkopened it with a fling and stood before the guests with a flushed countenance blazing eyes a peculiar deprecatory smile and a dirty ragged bundle in his arms she did not doubt him  forgive me my dear he said gazing at his wife in a manner that might well have justified the black sheeps thought screwed ii business kept me in the office very late and then he cast an imbecile glance at the bundle  what ever have you got there sam asked his wondering wife  goodness me it moves exclaimed mrs loper  live poultry thought the black sheep and visions of police cells and penal servitude floated before his depraved mental vision  yes mrs loper it moves  it is alivethough not very much alive i fear  my dear ive foundfound a babypicked it up in the street not a soul there but me  would have perished or been trodden on if i had not taken it up  see here  he untied the dirty bundle as he spoke and uncovered the round little pinched face with the great solemn eyes which gazed still wonderingly at the assembled company  it is due to the assembled company to add that it returned the gaze with compound interest    chapter five  treats still further of riches poverty babies and police  when mr and mrs twitter had dismissed the few friends that night they sat down at their own fireside with no one near them but the little foundling which lay in the youngest twitters disused cradle gazing at them with its usual solemnity for it did not seem to require sleep they opened up their minds to each other thus  now samuel said mrs twitter the question is what are you going to do with it  well mariar returned her spouse with an assumption of profound gravity i suppose we must send it to the workhouse  you know quite well sam that you dont mean that said mrs twitter the dear little forsaken mite  just look at its solemn eyes  it has been clearly cast upon us sam and it seems to me that we are bound to look after it  what with six of our own mariar  yes sam  isnt there a song which says something about luck in odd numbers  and with only 500 pounds a year objected mr twitter  only five hundred  how can you speak so  we are rich with five hundred  can we not educate our little ones  yes my dear  and entertain our friends  yes my lovewith crumpets and tea  dont forget muffins and bloater paste and german sausage and occasional legs of mutton you ungrateful man  i dont forget em mariar  my recollection of em is powerful i may even say vivid  well continued the lady havent you been able to lend small sums on several occasions to friends  yes my dearand they are still loans murmured the husband  and dont we give a littlei sometimes think too littleregularly to the poor and to the church and havent we got a nestegg laid by in the postoffice savingsbank  all true mariar and all your doing  but for your thrifty ways and economical tendencies and rare financial abilities i should have been bankrupt long ere now  mr twitter was nothing more than just in this statement of his wifes character  she was one of those happily constituted women who make the best and the most of everything and who while by no means turning her eyes away from the dark sides of things nevertheless gave people the impression that she saw only their bright sides  her economy would have degenerated into nearness if it had not been commensurate with her liberality for while on the one hand she was ever anxious almost eager to give to the needy and suffering every penny that she could spare she was on the other hand strictly economical in trifles indeed mrs twitters vocabulary did not contain the word trifle  one of her favourite texts of scripture which was always in her mind and which she had illuminated in gold and hung on her bedroom walls with many other words of god was gather up the fragments that nothing be lost  acting on this principle with all her heart she gathered up the fragments of time so that she had always a good deal of that commodity to spare and was never in a hurry  she gathered up bits of twine and made neat little rings of them which she deposited in a basketa pretty large basketwhich in time became such a repository of wealth in that respect that the six twitters never failed to find the exact size and quality of cordage wanted by themand indeed even after the eldest sammy came to the years of discretion if he had suddenly required a cable suited to restrain a firstrate ironclad his mind would in the first blush of the thing have reverted to mothers basket  if friends wrote short notes to mrs twitterwhich they often did for the sympathetic find plenty of correspondentsthe blank leaves were always torn off and consigned to a scrappaper box and the pile grew big enough at last to have set up a small stationer in business and so with everything that came under her influence at home or abroad she emphatically did what she could to prevent waste and became a living fulfilment of the wellknown proverb for as she wasted not she wanted not  but to return from this digression  well then said mrs twitter dont go and find fault samuel she used the name in full when anxious to be impressive with what providence has given us by putting the word only to it for we are rich with five hundred a year  mr twitter freely admitted that he was wrong and said he would be more careful in future of the use to which he put the word only  but said he we havent a hole or corner in the house to put the poor thing in  to be sure theres the coalcellar and the scuttle might be rigged up as a cradle but  he paused and looked at his wife  the deceiver did not mean all this to be taken as a real objection  he was himself anxious to retain the infant and only made this show of opposition to enlist maria more certainly on his side  not a corner she exclaimed why is there not the whole parlour  do you suppose that a baby requires a fourpost bed and a washhandstand and a fivefoot mirror  couldnt we lift the poor darling in and out in half a minute  besides there is our own room  i feel as if there was an uncomfortable want of some sort ever since our baby was transplanted to the nursery  so we will establish the old bassinet and put the mite there  and what shall we call it maria  call itwhy call itcall itmiteno name could be more appropriate  but my love mite if a name at all is a mansthat is it sounds like a masculine name  call it mita then  and so it was named and thus that poor little waif came to be adopted by that rich family  it seems to be our mission at this time to introduce our readers to various homesthe homes of england so to speak  but let not our readers become impatient while we lead the way to one more home and open the door with our secret latchkey  this home is in some respects peculiar  it is not a poor one for it is comfortable and clean  neither is it a rich one for there are few ornaments and no luxuries about it  over the fire stoops a comely young woman as well as one can judge at least from the rather faint light that enters through a small window facing a brick wall  the wall is only five feet from the window and some previous occupant of the rooms had painted on it a rough landscape with three very green trees and a very blue lake and a swan in the middle thereof sitting on an inverted swan which was meant to be his reflection but somehow seemed rather more real than himself  the picture is better perhaps than the bricks were yet it is not enlivening  the only other objects in the room worth mentioning are a particularly small bookshelf in a corner a cuckooclock on the mantelshelf an engraved portrait of queen victoria on the wall opposite in a gilt frame and a portrait of sir robert peel in a frame of rosewood beside it  on a little table in the centre of the room are the remains of a repast under the table is a very small child probably four years of age near the window is another small but older childa boy of about six or seven  he is engaged in fitting on his little head a great black cloth helmet with a bronze badge and a peak behind as well as before  having nearly extinguished himself with the helmet the small boy seizes a very large truncheon and makes a desperate effort to flourish it  close to the comely woman stands a very tall very handsome and very powerful man who is putting in the uppermost buttons of a policeconstables uniform  behold reader the tableau vivant to which we would call your attention  where dyou go on duty today giles asked the comely young woman raising her face to that of her husband  oxford circus replied the policeman  it is the first time ive been put on fixedpoint duty  thats the reason im able to breakfast with you and the children molly instead of being off at halfpast five in the morning as usual  i shall be on for a month  im glad of it giles for it gives the children a chance of seeing something of you  i wish youd let me look at that cut on your shoulder  do  no no molly returned the man as he pushed his wife playfully away from him  hands off  you know the punishment for assaulting the police is heavy  now then monty to the boy give up my helmet and truncheon  i must be off  not yet daddy cried monty is a pleeceman of the a division number 2 ats me an im goin to catch a tief  i mell im  you smell him do you  where is he dyou think  oh  i know replied the small policemanhere he came close up to his father and getting on tiptoe said in a very audible whisper hes under de table but don tell im i know  his names joe  all right ill keep quiet monty but look alive and nab him quick for i must be off  thus urged the small policeman went on tiptoe to the table made a sudden dive under it and collared his little brother  the arrest however being far more prompt than had been expected the tief refused to be captured  a struggle ensued in the course of which the helmet rolled off a corner of the tablecloth was pulled down and the earthenware teapot fell with a crash to the floor  its my duty i fear said giles to take you both into custody and lock you up in a cell for breaking the teapot as well as the peace but ill be merciful and let you off this time monty if you lend your mother a hand to pick up the pieces  monty agreed to accept this compromise  the helmet and truncheon were put to their proper uses and the merciful policeconstable went out on duty    chapter six  wealth pays a visit to poverty  it was an interesting sight to watch policeconstable number 666 as he went through the performance of his arduous duties that day at the regent circus in oxford street  to those who are unacquainted with london it may be necessary to remark that this circus is one of those great centres of traffic where two main arteries cross and tend to cause so much obstruction that complete stoppages would become frequent were it not for the admirable management of the several members of the police force who are stationed there to keep order  the oxford circus as it is sometimes called is by no means the largest or most crowded of such crossings nevertheless the tide of traffic is sufficiently strong and continuous there to require several policeconstables on constant duty  when men are detailed for such fixedpoint duty they go on it for a month at a time and have different hours from the other men namely from nine in the morning till five in the afternoon  we have said it was interesting to watch our big hero number 666 in the performance of his arduous duties  he occupied the crossing on the city side of the circus  it was a magnificent afternoon and all the metropolitan butterflies were out  busses flowed on in a continuous stream looking like big bullies who incline to use their weight and strength to crush through all obstruction  the drivers of these were for the most part wise men and restrained themselves and their steeds  in one or two instances where the drivers were unwise a glance from the bright eye of giles scott was quite sufficient to keep all right  and giles could only afford to bestow a fragmentary glance at any time on the refractory for almost at one and the same moment he had to check the impetuous hold up a warning hand to the unruly rescue a runaway child from innumerable horselegs pilot a stout but timid lady from what we may call refugeisland in the middle of the roadway to the pavement answer an imbeciles question as to the whereabouts of the tower or saint pauls order a loitering cabby to move on and look out for his own toes as well as give moderate attention to the carriagepoles which perpetually threatened the small of his own back  we should imagine that the premium of insurance on the life of number 666 was fabulous in amount but cannot tell  besides his great height giles possessed a drooping moustache which added much to his dignified appearance  he was also imperturbably grave except when offering aid to a lady or a little child on which occasions the faintest symptoms of a smile floated for a moment on his visage like an april sunbeam  at all other times his expression was that of incorruptible justice and awful immobility  no amount of chaff no quantity of abuse no kind of flattery no sort of threat could move him any more than the seething billows of the mediterranean can move gibraltar  costermongers growled at him hopelessly  irate cabmen saw that their wisdom lay in submission  criminals felt that once in his grasp their case was hopeless just as conversely old ladies felt that once under his protection they were in absolute security  even streetboys felt that references to bobbies coppers and slops questions as to how is ead felt up there who rolled im hout so long whether his mother knew e was hout whether ed sell em a bit of is legs with advice to come down off the ladder or to go ome to bed that all these were utterly thrown away and lost upon giles scott  the garb of the london policeman is not as every one knows founded on the principles of aesthetics  neither has it been devised on utilitarian principles  indeed we doubt whether the originator of it and we are happy to profess ignorance of his name proceeded on any principle whatever except the gratification of a wild and degraded fancy  the colour of course is not objectionable and the helmet might be worse but the tunic is such that the idea of grace or elegance may not consist with it  we mention these facts because giles scott was so wellmade that he forced his tunic to look well and thus added one more to the already numerous exceptions which are said to prove the rule  allow me madam said giles offering his righthand to an elderly female who having screwed up her courage to make a rush got into sudden danger and became mentally hysterical in the midst of a conglomerate of hoofs poles horseheads and wheels  the female allowed him and the result was sudden safety a gasp of relief and departure of hysteria  not yet please said giles holding up a warning righthand to the crowd on refugeisland while with his left waving gently to and fro he gave permission to the mighty stream to flow  now he added holding up the lefthand suddenly  the stream was stopped as abruptly as were the waters of jordan in days of old and the stormstaid crew on refugeisland made a rush for the mainland  it was a trifling matter to most of them that rush but of serious moment to the few whose limbs had lost their elasticity or whose minds could not shake off the memory of the fact that between 200 and 300 lives are lost in london streets by accidents every year and that between 3000 and 4000 are more or less severely injured annually  before the human stream had got quite across an impatient hansom made a push  the eagle eye of number 666 had observed the intention and in a moment his gigantic figure stood calmly in front of the horse whose head was raised high above his helmet as the driver tightened the reins violently  just then a small slipshod girl made an anxious dash from refugeisland lost courage and turned to run back changed her mind got bewildered stopped suddenly and yelled  giles caught her by the arm bore her to the pavement and turned just in time to see the hansom dash on in the hope of being overlooked  vain hope  number 666 saw the number of the hansom booked it in his memory while he assisted in raising up an old gentleman who had been overturned though not injured in endeavouring to avoid it  during the lullfor there are lulls in the rush of london traffic as in the storms of naturegiles transferred the number of that hansom to his notebook thereby laying up a little treat for its driver in the shape of a little trial the next day terminating probably with a fine  towards five in the afternoon the strain of all this began to tell even on the powerful frame of giles scott but no symptom did he show of fatigue and so much reserve force did he possess that it is probable he would have exhibited as calm and unwearied a front if he had remained on duty for eighteen hours instead of eight  about that hour also there came an unusual glut to the traffic in the form of a troop of the horseguards  these magnificent creatures resplendent in glittering steel white plumes and black boots were passing westward  giles stood in front of the arrested stream  a number of people stood as it were under his shadow  refugeisland was overflowing  comments chiefly eulogistic were being freely made and some impatience was being manifested by drivers when a little shriek was heard and a childs voice exclaimed  oh papa papatheres my policemanthe one i so nearly killed hes not dead after all  giles forgot his dignity for one moment and looking round met the eager gaze of little di brandon  another moment and duty required his undivided attention so that he lost sight of her but di took good care not to lose sight of him  we will wait here darling said her father referring to refugeisland on which he stood and when he is disengaged we can speak to him  oh  im so glad hes not dead said little di and praps hell be able to show us the way to my boys home  di had a method of adopting in a motherly way all who in the remotest manner came into her life  thus she not only spoke of our butcher and our baker which was natural but referred to my policeman and my boy ever since the day of the accident  when giles had set his portion of the traffic in harmonious motion he returned to his island and was not sorry to receive the dignified greeting of sir richard brandon while he was delighted as well as amused by the enthusiastic grasp with which di seized his huge hand in both of her little ones and the earnest manner in which she inquired after his health and if she had hurt him much  did they put you to bed and give you hot gruel she asked with touching pathos  no miss they didnt think i was hurt quite enough to require it answered giles his drooping moustache curling slightly as he spoke  i had hoped to see you at my house said sir richard you did not call  thank you sir i did not think the little service i rendered your daughter worth making so much of  i called however the same evening to inquire for her but did not wish to intrude on you  it would have been no intrusion friend returned sir richard with grand condescension  one who has saved my childs life has a claim upon my consideration  a dook e must be said a small street boy in a loud stage whisper to a draymanfor small streetboys are sown broadcast in london and turn up at all places on every occasion or praps he added on reflection es ony a markiss  now then said giles to the drayman with a motion of the hand that caused him to move on while he cast a look on the boy which induced him to move off  by the way constable said sir richard i am on my way to visit a poor boy whose leg was broken on the day my pony ran away  he was holding the pony at the time  he lives in whitechapel somewhere  i have the address here in my notebook  excuse me sir one moment said number 666 going towards a crowd which had gathered round a fallen horse  i happen to be going to that district myself he continued on returning what is the boys name  robertperhaps i should rather say bobby frog answered sir richard  the name is familiar returned the policeman but in london there are so manywhats his address sirroys court near commercial street oh  i know it wellone of the worst parts of london  i know the boy too  he is somewhat noted in that neighbourhood for giving the police trouble  not a badhearted fellow i believe but full of mischief and has been brought up among thieves from his birth  his father is or was a birdfancier and seller of penny articles on the streets besides being a professional pugilist  you will be the better for protection there sir  i would advise you not to go alone  if you can wait for five or ten minutes added giles i shall be off duty and will be happy to accompany you  sir richard agreed to wait  within the time mentioned giles was relieved and entering a cab with his friends drove towards whitechapel  they had to pass near our policemans lodgings on the way  would you object sir stopping at my house for five minutes he asked  certainly not returned the knight i am in no hurry  number 666 stopped the cab leaped out and disappeared through a narrow passage  in less than five minutes a very tall gentlemanly man issued from the same passage and approached them  little di opened her blue eyes to their very uttermost  it was her policeman in plain clothes  she did not like the change at all at first but before the end of the drive got used to him in his new aspectall the more readily that he seemed to have cast off much of his stiffness and reserve with his blue skin  near the metropolitan railway station in whitechapel the cab was dismissed and giles led the father and child along the crowded thoroughfare until they reached commercial street along which they proceeded a short distance  we are now near some of the worst parts of london sir said giles where great numbers of the criminal and most abandoned characters dwell  indeed said sir richard who did not seem to be much gratified by the information  as for di she was nearly crying  the news that her boy was a thief and was born in the midst of such naughty people had fallen with chilling influence on her heart for she had never thought of anything but the storybook poor but honest parents  what large building is that inquired the knight who began to wish that he had not given way to his daughters importunities the one opposite i mean with placards under the windows  that is the wellknown home of industry instituted and managed by miss macpherson and a staff of volunteer workers  they do a deal of good sir in this neighbourhood  ah indeed said sir richard who had never before heard of the home of industry  and pray what particular industry does this miss mac what did you call her  macpherson  the lady you know who sends out so many rescued waifs and strays to canada and spends all her time in caring for the poorest of the poor in the eastend and in preaching the gospel to them  youve often seen accounts of her work no doubt in the christian  wellnno  i read the times but now you mention it i have some faint remembrance of seeing reference to such matters  very selfdenying no doubt and praiseworthy though i must say that i doubt the use of preaching the gospel to such persons  from what i have seen of these lowest people i should think they were too deeply sunk in depravity to be capable of appreciating the lofty and sublime sentiments of christianity  number 666 felt a touch of surprise at these words though he was too wellbred a policeman to express his feelings by word or look  in fact although not preeminently noted for piety he had been led by training and afterwards by personal experience to view this matter from a very different standpoint from that of sir richard  he made no reply however but turning round the corner of the home of industry entered a narrow street which bore palpable evidence of being the abode of deepest poverty  from the faces and garments of the inhabitants it was also evidently associated with the deepest depravity  as little di saw some of the residents sitting on their doorsteps with scratched faces swelled lips and cheeks and dishevelled hair and beheld the children in halfnaked condition rolling in the kennel and extremely filthy she clung closer to her fathers side and began to suspect there were some phases of life she had never seenhad not even dreamt of  what the knights thoughts were we cannot tell for he said nothing but disgust was more prominent than pity on his fine countenance  those who sat on the doorsteps or lolled with a dissipated air against the doorposts seemed to appreciate him at his proper value for they scowled at him as he passed  they recognised number 666 however perhaps by his bearing and gave him only a passing glance of indifference  you said it would be dangerous for me to come here by myself said sir richard turning to giles as he entered another and even worse street are they then so violent  many of them are among the worst criminals in london sir  here is the court of which you are in search roys court  as he spoke ned frog staggered out of his own doorway clenched his fists and looked with a vindictive scowl at the strangers  a second glance induced him to unclench his fists and reel round the corner on his way to a neighbouring grogshop  whatever other shops may decay in that region the grogshops like noxious weeds always flourish  the court was apparently much deserted at that hour for the men had not yet returned from their workwhatever that might beand most of the women were within doors  this is the house continued giles descending the few steps and tapping at the door i have been here before  they know me  the door was opened by hetty and for the first time since entering those regions of poverty and crime little di felt a slight rise in her spirits for through hettys face shone the bright spirit within albeit the shining was through some dirt and dishevelment good principle not being able altogether to overcome the depressing influences of extreme poverty and suffering  is your mother at home hetty  oh yes sir  mother heres mr scott  come in sir  we are so glad to see you and  she stopped and gazed inquiringly at the visitors who followed  ive brought some friends of bobby to inquire for him  sir richard brandonmrs frog  number 666 stood aside and with something like a smile on his face ceremoniously presented wealth to poverty  wealth made a slightly confused bow to poverty and poverty looking askance at wealth dropt a mild courtesy  vell now im a dutchman if it aint the hangel exclaimed a voice in the corner of the small room before either wealth or poverty could utter a word  oh its my boy exclaimed di with delight forgetting or ignoring the poverty dirt and extremely bad air as she ran forward and took hold of bobbys hand  it was a preeminently dirty hand and formed a remarkable contrast to the little hands that grasped it  the small street boy was for the first time in his life bereft of speech  when that faculty returned he remarked in language which was obscure to di  vell if this aint a go  what is a go asked di with innocent surprise  instead of answering bobby frog burst into a fit of laughter but stopped rather suddenly with an expression of pain  oh old on  i say  this wont do  doctor e said i musnt larf cause it shakes the leg too much  but you know wots a cove to do ven a hangel comes to him and axes sitch rum questions  again he laughed and again stopped short in pain  im so sorry  does it feel very painful  you cant think how constantly ive been thinking of you since the accident for it was all my fault  if i hadnt jumped up in such a passion the pony wouldnt have run away and you wouldnt have been hurt  im so very very sorry and i got dear papa to bring me here to tell you so and to see if we could do anything to make you well  again bobby was rendered speechless but his mind was active  wot  i aint dreamin am i  as a hangel really come to my bedside all the vay from the vestend an brought er dear pavich means the guvnor i fancyall for to tell mea kid whose life is spent in movin onthat shes wery wery sorry ive got my leg broke an that shes bin an done it an she would like to know if she can do hanythink asll make me vell  but it aint true  its a big lie  im dreamin thats all  ive been took to hospital an got dlirious thats wot it is  ill try to sleep  with this end in view he shut his eyes and remained quite still for a few seconds and when di looked at his pinched and pale face in this placid condition the tears would overflow their natural boundary and sobs would rise up in her pretty throat but she choked them back for fear of disturbing her boy  presently the boy opened his eyes  wot are you there yet he asked  oh yes  did you think i was going away she replied with a look of innocent surprise  i wont leave you now  ill stay here and nurse you if papa will let me  i have slept once on a shakedown when i was forced by a storm to stay all night at a juvnile party  so if youve a corner here it will do nicely  my dear child interrupted her amazed father you are talking nonsense  anddo keep a little further from the bed  there may be you knowinfection  oh you neednt fear infection here sir said mrs frog somewhat sharply  we are poor enough god knows though i have seen better times but we keep ourselves pretty clean though we cant afford to spend much on soap when food is so dear and money so scarceso very scarce  forgive me my good woman said sir richard hastily i did not mean to offend but circumstances would seem to favour the ideaofof  and here wealthalthough a bank director and chairman of several boards and capable of making a neat if weakly speech on economic laws and the currency when occasion requiredwas dumb before poverty indeed though he had often theorised about that stricken creature he had never before fairly hunted her down run her into her den and fairly looked her in the face  the fact is mrs frog said giles scott coming to the rescue sir richard is anxious to know something about your affairsyour family you know and your means ofby the way where is baby he said looking round the room  shes gone lost said mrs frog  lost repeated giles with a significant look  ay lost repeated mrs frog with a look of equal significance  bless me how did you lose your child asked sir richard in some surprise  oh sir that often happens to us poor folk  were used to it said mrs frog in a half bantering half bitter tone  sir richard suddenly called to mind the factwhich had not before impressed him though he had read and commented on itthat 11835 children under ten years of age had been lost that year and it was no exceptional year as police reports will show in the streets of london and that 23 of these children were never found  he now beheld as he imagined one of the losers of the lost ones and felt stricken  well now said giles to mrs frog lets hear how you get along what does your husband do  he mostly does nothin but drink  sometimes he sells little birds sometimes he sells penny watches or bootlaces in cheapside an turns in a little that way but it all goes to the grogshop none of it comes here  then he has a mill now an again  a mill said sir richardis it a snuff or flour  hes a professional pugilist explained giles  an hes employed at a musichall continued mrs frog to call out the songs an keep order  an bobby always used to pick a few coppers by runnin messages sellin matches and odd jobs  but hes knocked over now  and yourself  how do you add to the general fund asked sir richard becoming interested in the household management of poverty  well i char a bit an wash a bit sir when im well enoughwhich aint often  an sometimes i lights the jews fires for em an clean up their earths on saturdayswich is their sundays sir  but hetty works like a horse  its she as keeps us from the workus sir  shes got employment at a slop shop and by workin ard all day manages to make about one shillin a week  i beg your pardonhow much  one shillin sir  ah you mean one shilling a day i suppose  no sir i mean one shillin a week  mr scott there knows that im tellin whats true  giles nodded and sir richard said haahem having nothing more lucid to remark on such an amazing financial problem as was here set before him  but continued mrs frog poor hetty has had a sad disappointment this week  oh mother interrupted hetty dont trouble the gentleman with that perhaps he wouldnt understand it for of course he hasnt heard about all the outs and ins of slopwork  pardon me my good girl said sir richard i have not as you truly remark studied the details of slopwork minutely but my mind is not unaccustomed to financial matters  pray let me hear about this  a savage growling something between a mastiff and a man outside the door here interrupted the visitor and a hand was heard fumbling about the latch  as the hand seemed to lack skill to open the door the foot considerately took the duty in hand and burst it open whereupon the huge frame of ned frog stumbled into the room and fell prostrate at the feet of sir richard who rose hastily and stepped back  the pugilist sprang up doubled his ever ready fists and glaring at the knight asked savagely  who the  he was checked in the utterance of a ferocious oath for at that moment he encountered the grave eye of number 666  relaxing his fists he thrust them into his coatpockets and with a subdued air staggered out of the house  my usband sir said mrs frog in answer to her visitors inquiring glance  oh is that his usual mode of returning home  no sir answered bobby from his corner for he was beginning to be amused by the succession of surprises which wealth was receiving e dont always come in so  sometimes e sends is ead first an the feet come afterwards  in any case the furnitures apt to suffer not to mention the inabitants but youve saved us tonight sir or raither mr scott as saved both us an you  poor little di who had been terribly frightened clung closer to her fathers arm on hearing this  perhaps said sir richard it would be as well that we should go in case mr frog should return  he was about to say goodbye when di checked him and despite her fears urged a short delay  we havent heard you know about the slops yet  do stop just one minute dear papa  i wonder if its like the beeftea nurse makes for me when im ill  its not that kind of slops darling but readymade clothing to which reference is made  but you are right  let us hear about it miss hetty  the idea of miss being applied to hetty and slops compared to beeftea proved almost too much for the brokenlegged boy in the corner but he put strong constraint on himself and listened  indeed sir i do not complain said hetty quite distressed at being thus forcibly dragged into notice  i am thankful for what has been sentindeed i amonly it was a great disappointment particularly at this time when we so much needed all we could make amongst us  she stopped and had difficulty in restraining tears  go on hetty said her mother and dont be afraid  bless you hes not goin to report what you say  i know that mother  well sir this was the way on it  they sometimes  excuse mewho are they  i beg pardon sir iid rather not tell  very well  i respect your feelings my girl  some slopmaking firm i suppose  go on  yes sir  wellthey sometimes gives me extra work to do at home  it do come pretty hard on me after goin through the regular days work from early mornin till night but then you see it brings in a little more moneyand im strong thank god  sir richard looked at hettys thin and colourless though pretty face and thought it possible that she might be stronger with advantage  of late continued the girl ive bin havin extra work in this way and last week i got twelve childrens ulsters to make up  this job when finished would bring me six and sixpence  how much  six and sixpence sir  for the whole twelve asked sir richard  yes sirthat was sixpence halfpenny for makin up each ulster  its not much sir  no murmured wealth in an absent manner sixpence halfpenny is not much  but when i took them back continued hettyand here the tears became again obstreperous and difficult to restrainthe master said hed forgot to tell me that this order was for the colonies that he had taken it at a very low price and that he could only give me three shillins for the job  ofof course three shillins is better the nothin but after workin hard for such a long long time an expectin six it was  here the tears refused to be pent up any longer and the poor girl quietly bending forward hid her face in her hand  come i think we will go now said sir richard rising hastily goodnight mrs frog i shall probably see you againat leastyou shall hear from me  now disay goodnight to your boy  in a few minutes sir richard stood outside taking in deep draughts of the comparatively fresher air of the court  the old screw growled bobby when the door was shut  e didnt leave us so much as a single bobnot even a brown though e pretends that six of em aint much  dont be hard on him bobby said hetty drying her eyes he spoke very kind you know an praps he means to help us afterwards  spoke kind retorted the indignant boy i tell ee wot hetty youre far too soft an forgivin  i spose thats wot they teaches you in sundayschool at george yardeh  vill speakin kind feed us vill it clothe us vill it pay for our lodgins  the door opened at that moment and number 666 reentered  the gentleman sent me back to give you this mrs frog laying a sovereign on the rickety table  he said he didnt like to offer it to you himself for fear of hurting your feelings but i told him he neednt be afraid on that score  was i right missis  look well after it now an see that ned dont get his fingers on it  giles left the room and mrs frog taking up the piece of gold fondled it for some time in her thin fingers as though she wished to make quite sure of its reality  then wrapping it carefully in a piece of old newspaper she thrust it into her bosom  bobby gazed at her in silence up to this point and then turned his face to the wall  he did not speak but we cannot say that he did not pray for mentally he said i beg your parding old genlmn an i ony pray that a lot of fellers like you may come ere sometimes to urt our feelins in that vay  at that moment hetty bent over the bed and softly kissing her brothers dirty face whispered yes bobby thats what they teach me in sundayschool at george yard  thereafter wealth drove home in a cab and poverty went to bed in her rags    chapter seven  bicycling and its occasional results  it is pleasant to turn from the smoke and turmoil of the city to the fresh air and quiet of the country  to the man who spends most of his time in the heart of london going into the countryeven for a short distanceis like passing into the fields of elysium  this was at all events the opinion of stephen welland and stephen must have been a good judge for he tried the change frequently being exceedingly fond of bicycling and occasionally taking what he termed long spins on that remarkable instrument  one morning early in the summertime young welland he was only eighteen mounted his iron horse in the neighbourhood of kensington and glided away at a leisurely pace through the crowded streets arrived in the suburbs of london he got up steam to use his own phrase and went at a rapid pace until he met a chum by appointment  this chum was also mounted on a bicycle and was none other than our friend samuel twitter juniorknown at home as sammy and by his companions as sam  isnt it a glorious day sam said welland as he rode up and sprang off his steed  magnificent answered his friend also dismounting and shaking hands why stephen what an enormous machine you ride  yes its pretty high48 inches  my legs are long you see  well where are we to run today  wherever you like said sam only let it be a short run not more than forty miles for ive got an appointment this afternoon with my old dad which i cant get off  thatll do very well said welland so we can go round by  here he described a route by country road and village which we pretend not to remember  it is sufficient to know that it represented the required short run of forty milessuch is the estimate of distance by the youth of the present day  now then off we go said welland giving his wheelhe quite ignored the existence of the little thing at the backa shove putting his left foot on the treadle and flinging his right leg gracefully over  young twitter followed suit but sammy was neither expert nor graceful true he could ride easily and travel long distances but he could only mount by means of the somewhat clumsy process of hopping behind for several yards  once up however he went swiftly enough alongside his tall companion and the two friends thereafter kept abreast  oh isnt it a charming sensation to have the cool air fanning ones cheeks and feel the soft tremor of the wheel and see the trees and houses flow past at such a pace  it is the likest thing to flying i ever felt said welland as they descended a slight incline at probably fifteen miles an hour  it is delightful replied sam but i say we better put on the brakes here a bit  it gets much steeper further down  instead of applying the brake however young welland in the exuberance of his joy threw his long legs over the handles and went down the slope at railway speed ready as he remarked for a jump if anything should go wrong  twitter was by no means as bold as his friend but being ashamed to show the white feather he quietly threw his shorter legs over the handles and thus the two perchedfrom a foreandaft point of view upon nothing went in triumph to the bottom of the hill  a long stretch of smooth level road now lay before them  it required the merest touch on the treadles to send them skimming along like skaters on smooth ice or swallows flying low  like gentle ghosts they fleeted along with little more than a muffled sound for their axles turned in ballsockets and their warning bells were silent save when touched  onward they went with untiring energy mile after mile passing everything on the waypedestrians equestrians carts and gigs driving over the level ground with easy force taking the hills with a rush to keep up the pace and descending on the other sides at what welland styled a lightning run  now they were skimming along a road which skirted the margin of a canal the one with hands in his coatpockets the other with his arms crossed and both steering with their feet now passing under a railwayarch and giving a wild shout partly to rouse the slumbering echoes that lodged there and partly to rouse the spirit of a small dog which chanced to be passing under itin both cases successfully  anon they were gliding over a piece of exposed ground on which the sun beat with intense light causing their shadows to race along with them  again they were down in a hollow gliding under a row of trees where they shut off a little of the steam and removed their caps the better to enjoy the grateful shade  soon they were out in the sunshine again the spokes of their wheels invisible as they topped a small eminence from the summit of which they took in one comprehensive view of undulating lands with villages scattered all round farmhouses here and there green fields and flowering meadows traversed by rivulet or canal with cattle sheep and horses gazing at them in silent or startled wonder and birds twittering welcome from the trees and hedgerows everywhere  now they were crossing a bridge and nearing a small town where they had to put hands to the handles again and steer with precaution for little dogs had a tendency to bolt out at them from unexpected corners and poultry is prone to lose its heads and rush into the very jaws of danger in a cackling effort to avoid it  stray kittens and pigs too exhibited obstinate tendencies and only gave in when it was nearly too late for repentance  little children also became sources of danger standing in the middle of roads until perceiving a possible catastrophe they dashed wildly asidealways to the very side on which the riders had resolved to passand escaped by absolute miracle  presently they came to a steep hill  it was not steep enough to necessitate dismounting but it rendered a rush inadvisable  they therefore worked up slowly and on gaining the top got off to breathe and rest a while  that was a glorious run wasnt it sam said welland flicking the dust from his knees with his handkerchief  what dye say to a glass of beer  cant do it stephen im blue ribbon  oh nonsense  why not do as i dodrink in moderation  well i didnt think much about it when i put it on said sam who was a very sensitive and not very strongminded youth the rest of us did it you know by fathers advice and i joined because they did  welland laughed rather sarcastically at this but made no rejoinder and sam who could not stand being laughed at said  well come ill go in for one glass  ill be my own doctor and prescribe it medicinally  besides its an exceptional occasion this for it is awfully hot  its about the best run i ever had in the same space of time said welland on quitting the beer shop  firstrate returned sam i wish my old dad could ride with us  he would enjoy it so  couldnt we bring him out on a horse  he could ride that i suppose  never saw him on a horse but once said sam and that time he fell off  but its worth suggesting to him  better if he got a tricycle said welland  i dont think that would do for hes too old for long rides and too shortwinded  now stephen im not going to run down this hill  we must take it easy for its far too steep  nonsense man its nothing to speak of see ill go first and show you the way  he gave the treadle a thrust that sent him off like an arrow from a bow  stay theres a caravan or something at the bottomwild beasts show i think  stop hold on  but sam twitter shouted in vain  wellands was a joyous spirit apt to run away with him  he placed his legs over the handles for security and allowed the machine to run  it gathered speed as it went for the hill became steeper insomuch that the rider once or twice felt the hindwheel rise and had to lean well back to keep it on the ground the pace began to exceed even wellands idea of pleasure but now it was too late to use the brake for well did he know that on such a slope and going at such a pace the slightest check on the front wheel would send him over  he did not feel alarmed however for he was now near the bottom of the hill and half a minute more would send him in safety on the level road at the foot  but just at the foot there was a sharpish turn in the road and welland looked at it earnestly  at an ordinary pace such a turn could have been easily taken but at such a rate as he had by that time attained he felt it would require a tremendous lean over to accomplish it  still he lost no confidence for he was an athlete by practice if not by profession and he gathered up his energies for the moment of action  the people of the caravanwhoever they werehad seen him coming and beginning to realise his danger to some extent had hastily cleared the road to let him pass  welland considered the rate of speed felt rather than calculated the angle of inclination leaned over boldly until the tire almost slipped sideways on the road and came rushing round with a magnificent sweep when horrible sight a slight ridge of what is called roadmetal crossed the entire road from side to side  a drain or water pipe had recently been repaired and the new ridge had not yet been worn down by traffic  there was no time for thought or change of action  another moment and the wheel was upon it the crash came and the rider went off with such force that he was shot well in advance of the machine as it went with tremendous violence into the ditch  if wellands feet had been on the treadles he must have turned a complete somersault  as it was he alighted on his feet but came to the ground with such force that he failed to save himself  one frantic effort he made and then went down headlong and rolled over on his back in a state of insensibility  when sam twitter came to the bottom of the hill with the brake well applied he was able to check himself in time to escape the danger and ran to where his friend lay  for a few minutes the unfortunate youth lay as if he had been dead then his blood resumed its flow and when the eyes opened he found sam kneeling on one side of him with a smelling bottle which some lady had lent him and a kindlyfaced elderly man with an irongrey beard kneeling on the other side and holding a cup of water to his lips  thats right stephen look up said sam who was terribly frightened youre not much hurt are you  hurt old fellow eh sighed stephen why should i be hurt  where am i  what has happened  take a sip my young friend it will revive you said the man with the kindly face  you have had a narrow escape but god has mercifully spared you  try to move now gentlywe must see that no bones have been broken before allowing you to rise  by this time welland had completely recovered and was anxious to rise all the more that a crowd of children surrounded him among whom he observed several ladies and gentlemen but he lay still until the kindly stranger had felt him all over and come to the conclusion that no serious damage had been done  oh  im all right thank you said the youth on rising and affecting to move as though nothing had happened but he was constrained to catch hold of the stranger rather suddenly and sat down on the grass by the roadside  i do believe ive got a shake after all he said with a perplexed smile and sigh  but he added looking round with an attempt at gaiety i suspect my poor bicycle has got a worse shake  do look after it sam and see how it is  twitter soon returned with a crestfallen expression  its done for stephen  im sorry to say the whole concern seems to be mashed up into a kind of wirefencing  is it past mending sam  past mending by any ordinary blacksmith certainly  no one but the maker can doctor it and i should think it would take him a fortnight at least  what is to be done said stephen with some of his companions regret of tone  what a fool i was to take such a hillspoilt such a glorious day toofor you as well as myself sam  im very sorry but that wont mend matters  are you far from home gentlemen asked the man with the irongrey beard who had listened to the conversation with a look of sympathy  ay much too far to walk said welland  dyou happen to know how far off the nearest railway station is  three miles answered the stranger and in your condition you are quite unfit to walk that distance  im not so sure of that replied the youth with a pitiful look  i think im game for three miles if i had nothing to carry but myself but i cant leave my bicycle in the ditch you know  of course you cant rejoined the stranger in a cheery tone and i think we can help you in this difficulty  i am a london city missionary  my name is john seaward  we have as you see brought out a number of our sundayschool children to give them a sight of gods beautiful earth poor things theyve been used to bricks mortar and stone all their lives hitherto  now if you choose to spend the remainder of the day with us we will be happy to give you and the injured bicycle a place in our vans till we reach a cabstand or a railway station  what say you  it will give much pleasure to me and the teachers  welland glanced at his friend  you see sam theres no help for it old boy  youll have to return alone  unless your friend will also join us said the missionary  you are very kind said sam but i cannot stay as i have an engagement which must be kept  never mind stephen  ill just complete the trip alone and comfort myself with the assurance that i leave you in good hands  so goodbye old boy  goodbye twitter said stephen grasping his friends hand  twitter repeated the missionary i heard your friend call you sam just now  excuse my askingare you related to samuel twitter of twitter slime and company in the city  im his eldest son said sam  then i have much pleasure in making your acquaintance returned the other extending his hand for although i have never met your father i know your mother well  she is one of the best and most regular teachers in our sundayschools  is she not hetty he said turning to a sweetfaced girl who stood near him  indeed she is i was her pupil for some years and now i teach one of her old classes replied the girl  i work in the neighbourhood of whitechapel sir continued the missionary and most of the children here attend the institution in george yard  well i shall tell my mother of this unexpected meeting said sam as he remounted his bicycle  goodbye stephen  dont romp too much with the children  adieu sam and dont break your neck on the bicycle  in a few minutes sam twitter and his bicycle were out of sight    chapter eight  a great and memorable day  when young stephen welland was conducted by john seaward the missionary into a large field dotted with trees close to where his accident had happened he found that the children and their guardians were busily engaged in making arrangements for the spending of an enjoyable day  and then he also found that this was not a mere monster excursion of ordinary sundayschools but one of exceedingly poor children whose garments faces and general condition told too surely that they belonged to the lowest grade in the social scale  yes said the missionary in reply to some question from welland the agency at george yard to which i have referred has a wideembracing influencethough but a small lump of leaven when compared with the mass of corruption around it  this is a flock of the ragged and utterly forlorn to many of whom green fields and fresh air are absolutely new but we have other flocks besides these  indeed  well now i look at them more carefully i see that their garments do speak of squalid poverty  i have never before seen such a ragged crew though i have sometimes encountered individuals of the class on the streets  hm coughed the missionary with a peculiar smile  they are not so ragged as they were  neither are they as ragged as they will be in an hour or two  what do you mean  i mean that these very rough little ones have to receive peculiar treatment before we can give them such an outing as they are having today  as you see swings and seesaws have been put up here toys are now being distributed and a plentiful feast will ere long be forthcoming through the kindness of a christian gentleman whose heart the lord has inclined to consider the poor but before we could venture to move the little band much of their ragged clothing had to be stitched up to prevent it falling off on the journey and we had to make them move carefully on their way to the trainfor vans have brought us only part of the way  now that they are here our minds are somewhat relieved but i suspect that the effect of games and romping will undo much of our handiwork  come let us watch them  the youth and the missionary advanced towards a group of the children whose souls for the time being were steeped in a seesaw  this instrument of delight consisted of a strong plank balanced on the trunk of a noble tree which had been recently felled with many others to thin the woods of the philanthropists park  it was an enormous seesaw such as the ragged creatures had never before seenperhaps never conceived of their experiences in such joys having been hitherto confined to small bits of broken plank placed over empty beer barrels or backyard fences  no fewer than eight children were able to find accommodation on it at one and the same time besides one of the bigger boys to straddle in the centre and it required the utmost vigilance on the part of a young man teacher at one end of the machine and hetty frog at the other end to prevent the little ragamuffins at either extremity from being forced off  already the missionarys anticipation in regard to the undoing of their labour had begun to be verified  there were at least four of the eight whose nether garments had succumbed to the effort made in mounting the plank and various patches of fleshcolour revealed the fact that the poor little wearers were innocent of flannels  but it was summertime and the fact had little effect either on wearers or spectators  the missionary however was not so absorbed in the present but that he felt impelled to remark to welland that is their winter as well as summer clothing  the bicyclist said nothing in reply but the remark was not lost upon him  now dick swiller said the young man teacher i see what youre up to  you mustnt do it  richard swiller who was a particularly rugged as well as ragged boy of about thirteen not being in the habit of taking advice did do it that is he sent his end of the plank up with such violence that the other end came to the ground with a shock which caused those who sat there to gasp while it all but unseated most of those who were on the higher end  indeed one very small and pinched but intelligent little boy named by his companions blobby who looked as if time through the influence of privation and suffering had been dwindling instead of developing himactually did come off with a cry of alarm which however changed into a laugh of glee when he found himself in his teachers arms instead of lying busted on the ground as he afterwards expressed it when relating the incident to an admiring audience of fellow ragamuffins in the slums of spitalfields  blobby was immediately restored to his lost position and swiller was degraded besides being made to stand behind a large tree for a quarter of an hour in forced inaction so that he might have time to meditate on the evil consequences of disobedience  take care robin said hetty to a very small but astonishingly energetic fellow at her end of the seesaw who was impressed with the notion that he was doing good service by wriggling his own body up and down if you go on so youll push lilly snow off  robin unlike dick was obedient  he ceased his efforts and thereby saved the last button which held his much too small waistcoat across his bare bosom  what a sweet face the child she calls lilly snow hasif it were only clean observed welland  a little soap and water with a hair brush would make her quite beautiful  yes she is very pretty said the missionary and the kindly smile with which he had been watching the fun vanished as he added in a sorrowful voice her case is a very sad one dear child  her mother is a poor but deserving woman who earns a little now and then by tailoring but she has been crushed for years by a wicked and drunken husband who has at last deserted her  we know not where he is perhaps dead  five times has her home been broken up by him and many a time has she with her little one been obliged to sit on doorsteps all night when homeless  little lilly attends our sundayschool regularly and hetty is her teacher  it is not long since hetty herself was a scholar and i know that she is very anxious to lead lilly to the lord  the sufferings and sorrows to which this poor child has been exposed have told upon her severely and i fear that her health will give way  a day in the country like this may do her good perhaps  as the missionary spoke little lilly threw up her arms and uttered a cry of alarm  robin although obedient was short of memory and his energetic spirit being too strong for his excitable little frame he had recommenced his wriggling with the effect of bursting the last button off his waistcoat and thrusting lilly off the plank  she was received however on hettys breast who fell with her to the ground  not hurt hetty exclaimed the missionary running forward to help the girl up  oh no sir replied hetty with a short laugh as she rose and placed lilly on a safer part of the seesaw  come here hetty said john seaward and rest a while  you have done enough just now let some one else take your place  after repairing the buttonless waistcoat with a pin and giving its owner a caution hetty went and sat down on the grass beside the missionary  how is bobby asked the latter i have not found a moment to speak to you till now  thank you sir hes better much better  i fear he will be well too soon  how so  thats a strange remark my girl  it may seem strange sir butyou knowfathers very fond of bobby  well hetty thats not a bad sign of your father  oh but sir father sits at his bedside when hes sober an has such long talks with him about robberies and burglaries and presses him very hard to agree to go out with him when hes well  i cant bear to hear it for dear bobby seems to listen to what he says though sometimes he refuses and defies him to do his worst especially when he  stay dear girl  it is very very sad but dont tell me anything more about your father  tell it all to jesus hetty  he not only sympathises with but is able to saveeven to the uttermost  yes thank god for that uttermost said the poor girl clasping her hands quickly together  oh i understood that when he saved me and i will trust to it now  and the gentleman who called on youhas he been again asked the missionary  no sir he has only come once but he has sent his butler three or four times with some money for us and always with the message that it is from miss diana to be divided between bobby and me  unfortunately father chanced to be at home the first time he came and got it all so we got none of it  but he was out the other times  the butler is an oldish man and a very strange one  he went about our court crying  crying  hetty thats a curious condition for an oldish butler to be in  oh of course i dont mean cryin out like a baby said hetty looking down with a modest smile but i saw tears in his eyes and sometimes they got on his cheeks  i cant think whats the matter with him  whatever mr seaward thought on this point he said nothing but asked if bobby was able to go out  oh yes he was quite able to walk about now with a little help hetty said and she had taken several walks with him and tried to get him to speak about his soul but he only laughed at that and said he had too much trouble with his body to think about his soulthere was time enough for that  they were interrupted at this point by a merry shout of glee and looking up found that young welland had mounted the seesaw taken lilly snow in front of him had dick swiller reinstated to counterbalance his extra weight and was enjoying himself in a most hilarious manner among the fluttering rags  assuredly the fluttering rags did not enjoy themselves a whit less hilariously than he  in this condition he was found by the owner of the grounds george brisbane esquire of lively hall who accompanied by his wife and a tall dignified friend with a little girl approached the seesaw  i am glad you enjoy yourself so much my young friend he said to welland to which of the ragged schools may you belong  in much confusionfor he was rather shywelland made several abortive efforts to check the seesaw which efforts dick swiller resisted to the uttermost to the intense amusement of a little girl who held mrs brisbanes hand  at last he succeeded in arresting it and leaped off  i beg pardon he said taking off his cap to the lady as he advanced for intruding uninvited on  pray dont speak of intrusion interrupted mr brisbane extending his hand if you are here as mr seawards friend you are a welcome guest your only intrusion was among the little ones but as they seem not to resent it neither do i  welland grasped the proffered hand  thank you very much he returned but i can scarcely lay claim to mr seawards friendship  the fact is i am here in consequence of an accident to my bicycle  oh then you are one of the poor unfortunates after all said the host  come you are doubly welcome  not hurt much i hope  no thats all right  but dont let me keep you from your amusements remember we shall expect you at the feast on the lawn  you see sir richard he added turning to his dignified friend when we go in for this sort of thing we dont do it by halves  to have any lasting effect it must make a deep impression  so we have got up all sorts of amusements as you observe and shall have no fewer than two good feeds come let us visit some otherwhy what are you gazing at so intently  he might well ask the question for sir richard brandon had just observed hetty frog and she unaccustomed to such marked attention was gazing in perplexed confusion on the ground  at the same time little di having caught sight of her quitted mrs brisbane ran towards her with a delighted scream and clasping her hand in both of hers proclaimed her the sister of my boy  hettys was not the nature to refuse such affection  though among the poorest of the poor and clothed in the shabbiest and most patchy of garments which in her case however were neat clean and well mended she was rich in a loving disposition so that forgetting herself and the presence of others she stooped and folded the little girl in her arms  and when the soft brown hair and pale pretty face of poverty were thus seen as it were comingling with the golden locks and rosy cheeks of wealth even sir richard was forced to admit to himself that it was not after all a very outrageous piece of impropriety  oh  im so glad to hear that hes much better and been out too  i would have come to see him again long long ago but p  she checked herself for mrs screwbury had carefully explained to her that no good girl ever said anything against her parents and little di had swallowed the lesson for when not led by passion she was extremely teachable  and oh she continued opening her great blue lakelets to their widest state of solemnity you havent the smallest bit of notion how i have dreamt about my boyand my policeman too  i never can get over the feeling that they might both have been killed and if they had you know it would have been me that did it only think  i would have beena murderer  praps theyd have hanged me  but they werent killed dear said hetty unable to restrain a smile at the awful solemnity of the child and the terrible fate referred to  noim so glad but i cant get over it continued di while those near to her stood quietly by unable to avoid overhearing even if they had wished to do so  and they do such strange things in my dreams continued di you cant think  only last night i was in our basketcartthe dreamone you know not the real oneand the dreampony ran away again and gave my boy such a dreadful knock that he fell flat down on his back tumbled over two or three times and rose upa policeman  not my policeman you know but quite another one that i had never seen before  but the very oddest thing of all was that it made me so angry that i jumped with all my might on to his breast and when i got there it wasnt the policeman but the pony and it was deadquite dead for i had killed it and i wasnt sorry at allnot a bit  this was too much for hetty who burst into a laugh and sir richard thought it time to go and see the games that were going on in other parts of the field accompanied by welland and the missionary while hetty returned to her special pet lilly snow  and truly if one touch of nature makes the whole world kin there were touches of nature enough seen that day among these outcasts of society to have warranted their claiming kin with the whole world  leapfrog was greatly in favour because the practitioners could abandon themselves to a squirrelandcat sort of bound on the soft grass which they had never dared to indulge in on the london pavements  it was a trying game however to the rags which not only betrayed their character to the eye by the exhibition of fleshtints through numerous holes but addressed themselves also to the ears by means of frequent and explosive rendings  pins however were applied to the worst of these with admirable though temporary effect and the fun became faster and more furiousespecially so when the points of some of the pins touched up the fleshtints unexpectedly  on these occasions the touches of nature became strongly pronounced expressing themselves generally in a yell  another evidence of worldly kinship was that the touchedup ones instead of attributing the misfortune to accident were prone to turn round with fierce scowl and doubled fists under the impression that a guilty comrade was in rear  the proceedings were totally arrested for one hour at midday when unlimited food was issued and many of the forlorn ones began to feel the rare sensation of being stuffed quite full and rendered incapable of wishing for more  but this was a mere interlude  like little giants refreshed they rose up again to playto swing to leap to wrestle to ramble to gather flowers to roll on the grass to bask in the gladdening sunshine and in some cases to thank god for all his mercies in spite of the latent feeling of regret that there was so little of all that enjoyment in the slums and dark courts and filthy backstreets of the monster city  of course all the pins were extracted in this second act of the play and innumerable new and gaping wounds were introduced into the clothing insomuch that all ordinary civilised people except philanthropists would have been shocked with the appearance of the little ones  but it was during the third and closing act of the play that the affair culminated  the scene was laid on the lawn in front of mr brisbanes mansion  enter at one end of the lawn a band of small and dirty but flushed and happy boys and girls in rags which might appropriately be styled ribbons  at the other end of the lawn a train of domestics bearing trays with tea cakes buns pies fruits and other delectable things to which the ragged army sits down  enter host and hostess with sir richard friends and attendants  hostafter asking a blessingmy little friends this afternoon we meet to eat and only one request have i to makethat you shall do your duty well  small boy in ribbonsvont i just no platter shall return to my

thrusts the remnant of food therein and puts it on  enter the brass band of the neighbouring village the bandsmen being boys which plays a selection of airs and sends a few of the smaller ragamuffins to sleep  sir richard brandon confidentially to his friendit is an amazing sight  hostwould that it were a more common sight  enter more domestics with more tea buns and fruit but the army is glutted and the pockets are brought into requisition much pinning being a necessary consequence  lilly snow softlyits like eaven  hetty remonstratinglyoh  lilly eaven is quite different  dick swillerim sorry for it  couldnt be much appier to my mind  hostnow dear boys and girls before we close the proceedings of this happy day my excellent friend your missionary mr seaward will say a few words  john seaward steps to the front and says a few wordssays them so well too so simply so kindly yet so heartily that the army is roused to a pitch of great enthusiasm but we leave this speech to the readers imagination after whichexeunt omnes  and as the curtain of night falls on these ragged ones scattered now many of them to varied homes of vice and filth and misery the heavy eyelids close to open again perchance in ecstatic dreams of food and fun and green fields fresh air and sunshine which impress them more or less with the idea embodied in the aphorism that god made the country but man made the town    chapter nine  how the poor are succoured  i am obliged to you mr seaward for coming out of your way to see me said sir richard brandon while little di brought their visitor a chair  i know that your time is fully occupied and would not have asked you to call had not my friend mr brisbane assured me that you had to pass my house daily on your way toto business  no apology sir richard pray  i am at all times ready to answer a call whether of the poor or the rich if by any means i may help my lords cause  the knight thought for a moment that he might claim to be classed among the poor seeing that his miserable pittance of five thousand barely enabled him to make the two ends meet but he only said  ever since we had the pleasure of meeting at that gathering of ragged children my little girl here has been asking so many questions about poor peoplethe lower orders i meanwhich i could not answer that i have asked you to call that we may get some information about them you see diana is an eccentric little puss di opened her eyes very wide at this wondering what eccentric could mean and she has got into a most unaccountable habit of thinking and planning about poor people  a good habit sir richard said the missionary  blessed are they that consider the poor  sir richard acknowledged this remark with a little bow  now we should like to ask if you have no objection what is your chief object in the mission atwhat did you say its nameah  george yard  to save souls said mr seaward  ohahprecisely said the knight taken somewhat aback by the nature and brevity of the answer that of course but i meant how do you proceed  what is the method and what the machinery that you put in motion  perhaps said the missionary drawing a small pamphlet from his pocket this will furnish you with all the information you desire  you can read it over to miss diana at your leisureand dont return it i have plenty more  meanwhile i may briefly state that the mission premises are in george yard high street whitechapel one of the worst parts of the east of london where the fire of sin and crime rages most fiercely where the soldiers of the cross are comparatively few and would be overwhelmed by mere numbers were it not that they are invincible carrying on the war as they do in the strength of him who said lo i am with you alway  in the old coaching days continued mr seaward this was a great centre a startingpoint for mailcoaches  for nigh thirty years the mission has been there  the black horse was a publichouse in george yard once known to the magistrates as one of the worst ginshops and resort of thieves and nurseries of crime in london  that publichouse is now a shelter for friendless girls and a place where sick children of the poor are gratuitously fed  from this point the missionary went off into a graphic account of incidents illustrative of the great work done by the mission and succeeded in deeply interesting both diana and her father though the latter held himself well in hand knowing as he was fond of remarking that there were two sides to every question  checking his visitor at one point he said you have mentioned ragged schools and the good that is done by them but why should not the schoolboards look after such children  because sir richard the schoolboards cannot reach them  there are upwards of 150000 people in london who have never lived more than three months in one place  no law reaches this class because they do not stay long enough in any neighbourhood for the schoolboard authorities to put the law into operation  now nearly three hundred of the children of these wanderers meet in our free ragged day schools twice a day for instruction  here we teach them as efficiently as we can in secular matters and of course they are taught the word of god and told of jesus the saviour of sinners but our difficulties are great for children as well as parents are often in extremest poverty the former suffering from hunger even when sent to schooland they never stay with us long  let me give you an instance  one morning a mother came and begged to have her children admitted she had just left the workhouse  three children in rags that did not suffice to cover much less to protect them stood by her side  she did not know where they were to sleep that night but hoped to obtain a little charing and earn enough to obtain a lodging somewhere  she could not take the children with her while seeking workwould we take them in for if not they would have to be left in the streets and as they were very young they might lose themselves or be run over  we took them in fed sympathised with and taught them  in the afternoon the mother returned weary hungry dejected  she had failed to obtain employment and took the children away to apply for admission to a casual ward  what is a casual ward mr missionary asked di  seaward my lovehis name is not missionary said sir richard  a casual ward answered the visitor is an exceedingly plain room with rows of very poor beds mere wooden frames with canvas stretched on them in which any miserable beggars who choose to submit to the rules may sleep for a night after eating a bit of bread and a basin of gruel for all which they pay nothing  it is a very poor and comfortless placeat least you would think it soand is meant to save poor people from sleeping perhaps dying in the streets  do some people sleep in the streets asked di in great surprise  yes dear im sorry to say that many do  dyou mean on the stones in their nightdresses asked the child with increasing surprise  yes love said her father but in their ordinary clothes not in their nightdressesthey have no nightdresses  little di had now reached a pitch of surprise which rendered her dumb so the missionary continued  here is another case  a poor widow called once and said she would be so grateful if we would admit her little girl and boy into the schools she looked clean and tidy and the children had not been neglected  she could not afford to pay for them as she had not a penny in the world and applied to us because we made no charge  the children were admitted and supplied with a plain but nourishing meal while their mother went away to seek for work  we did not hear how she sped but she had probably taken her case to god and found him faithful for she had said before going away i know that god is the father of the fatherless and the husband of the widow  again another poor woman came  her husband had fallen sick  till within a few days her children had been at a school and paid for but now the breadwinner was illmight never recoverand had gone to the hospital  these children were at once admitted and in each case investigation was made to test the veracity of the applicants  of course continued the missionary i have spoken chiefly about the agencies with which i happen to have come personally in contact but it must not be supposed that therefore i ignore or am indifferent to the other grand centres of influence which are elsewhere at work in london such as for instance the various agencies set agoing and superintended by dr barnardo whose home for working and destitute boys in stepney causeway is a shelter from which thousands of rescued little ones go forth to labour as honest and useful members of society instead of dying miserably in the slums of london or growing up to recruit the ranks of our criminal classes  these agencies besides rescuing destitute and neglected children include homes for destitute girls and for little boys in ilford and jersey an infirmary for sick children of the destitute classes in stepney orphan homes ragged and day schools free dinnertable to destitute children mission halls coffee palaces and in short a grand network of beneficent agenciesevangelistic temperance and medicalfor the conduct of which is required not far short of one hundred pounds a day  even sir richard brandon with all his supposed financial capacities seemed struck with the magnitude of this sum  and where does dr barnardo obtain so large an amount he asked  from the voluntary gifts of those who sympathise with and consider the poor replied seaward  then he added there is that noble work carried on by miss rye of the emigration home for destitute little girls at the avenue house peckham from which a stream of destitute little ones continually flows to canada where they are much wanted and who if allowed to remain here would almost certainly be lost  strong testimony to the value of this work has been given by the bishops of toronto and niagara and other competent judges  let me mention a case of one of miss ryes little ones which speaks for itself  a little girl of six was deserted by both father and mother  oh poor little thing exclaimed the sympathetic di with an amazing series of pitiful curves about her eyebrows  yes poor indeed responded seaward  the mother forsook her first then her father took her on the tramp but the little feet could not travel fast enough so he got tired of her and offered her to a workhouse  they refused her so the tramping was continued and at last baby was sold for three shillings to a stranger man  on taking his purchase home however the man found that his wife was unwilling to receive her he therefore sent poor little baby adrift in the streets of london  what a shame cried di with flashing orbs  was it not  but when father and mother cast this little one off the lord cared for it  an inspector of police who found it took it to his wife and she carried it to miss ryes home where it was at once received and cared for and doubtless this little foundling girl is now dwelling happily and usefully with a canadian family  how nice exclaimed di her eyes lips and teeth bearing eloquent witness to her satisfaction  but no doubt you have heard of miss ryes work as well as that of miss annie macpherson at the home of industry and perhaps contributed to  no interrupted sir richard quickly i do not contribute but pray mr seaward are there other institutions of this sort in london  oh yes there are several it would take me too long to go into the details of the various agencies we have for succouring the poor  there is among others the church of england central home for waifs and strays with a receiving house for boys in upper clapton and one for girls in east dulwich with the archbishop of canterbury for its president  possibly you may have heard of the strangers rest in saint george street ratcliff highway where as far as man can judge great and permanent good is being constantly done to the souls of sailors  a sailor once entered this rest considerably the worse for drink  he was spoken to by christian friends and asked to sign the pledge  he did so and has now been steadfast for years  returning from a long voyage lately he went to revisit the rest and there at the bibleclass prayed  part of his prayer wasgod bless the strangers rest  o lord we thank thee for this place and we shall thank thee to all eternity  this is a sample of the feeling with which the place is regarded by those who have received blessing there  in the same street only a few doors from this rest is the sailors welcome home  this is more of a home than the other for it furnishes lodging and unintoxicating refreshment while its devoted soulloving manager miss child and her assistant workers go fearlessly into the very dens of iniquity and do all they can to bring sailors to jesus and induce them to take the pledge against strong drink in which work they are through gods blessing wonderfully successful  these two missions work as it were into each others hands  in the rest are held prayermeetings and bibleclasses and when these are dismissed the sailors find the open door of the welcome home ready to receive them and the inmates there seek to deepen the good influence that has been brought to bear at the meetingsand this in the midst of one of the very worst parts of london where temptation to every species of evil is rampant on the righthand and on the left before and behind  but sir richard although i say that a grand and extensive work of salvation to soul body and spirit is being done to thousands of men and women and children by the agencies which i have mentioned and by many similar agencies which i have not now time to mention as well as by the band of city missionaries to which i have the honour to belong i would earnestly point out that these all put together only scratch the surface of the vast mass of corruption which has to be dealt with in this seething world of london the population of which is as you are aware equal to that of all scotland and very specially would i remark that the work is almost exclusively carried on by the voluntary contributions of those who consider the poor  the little tract which i have given you will explain much of the details of this great work as carried on in the george yard mission when you have read that if you desire it i will call on you again meanwhile engagements compel me to take my leave  after luncheon that day sir richard drew his chair to the window but instead of taking up the newspaper and recommending his little one to visit the nursery he said  come here di  you and i will examine this pamphletthis little bookand ill try to explain it for reports are usually very dry  di looked innocently puzzled  should reports always be wet papa  sir richard came nearer to the confines of a laugh than he had reached for a long time past  no lovenot exactly wet buthmyou shall hear  draw the stool close to my knee and lay your head on it  with his large hand on the golden tresses sir richard brandon began to examine the record of work done in the george yard mission  what is this he said  toy classeswhy this must be something quite in your way di  oh yes im sure of that for i adore toys  tell me about it  these toy classes are for the cheerless and neglected said the knight frowning in a businesslike way at the pamphlet  sometimes so many as eighty neglected little ones attend these classes  on one occasion only one of these had boots on which were very old much too large and both lefts  when they were seated toys and scrapbooks were lent to them  there were puzzles and toybricks and many other things which kept them quite happy for an hour  of course the opportunity was seized to tell them about jesus and his love  a blessed lesson which they would not have had a chance of learning at homeif they had homes but many of them had none  when it was time to go they saidcant we stay longer  the beginning of this class was interesting said sir richard continuing to read  the thought arosegather in the most forlorn and wretched children those who are seldom seen to smile or heard to laugh there are many such who require christian sympathy  the thought was immediately acted on  a little barefooted ragged boy was sent into the streets to bring in the children  soon there was a crowd round the schooldoor  the most miserable among the little ones were admitted the proceedings commenced with prayerthen the toys were distributed the dirty little hands became active and the dirty little faces began to look happy  when the toys were gathered up some could not be found so at the next meeting some of the bigger children were set to watch the smaller ones  presently one little detective said please teacher teddys got a horse in his pocket and another said that sally had an elephant in her pinafore  occasion was thus found to show the evil of stealing and teach the blessedness of honesty  they soon gave up pilfering and they now play with the toys without desiring to take them away  how nice said di  go on papa  what can this be continued sir richard quotingwild flowers of the forest day nursery  oh  i seevery good idea  ill not read it di ill tell you about it  there are many poor widows you must know and women whose husbands are bad who have no money to buy food and shelter for themselves and little ones except what they can earn each day  but some of these poor women have babies and they cant work you know with babies in their arms neither can they leave the babies at home with no one to look after them except perhaps little sisters or brothers not much older than themselves so they take their babies to this cradlehome and each pays only twopence for which small sum her baby is taken in washed clothed warmed fed and amused by kind nurses who keep it till the mother returns from her work to get it back again  isnt that good  oh yes assented di with all her heart  and i read here continued her father that thousands of the infants of the poor die every year because they have not enough food or enough clothing to keep them warm  oh what a pity exclaimed di the tears of ready sympathy rushing hot into her upturned eyes  so you see continued sir richard who had unconsciously as it were become a pleader for the poor if there were a great many nurseries of this kind all over london a great many little lives would be saved  and why are there not a great many nurseries of that kind papa  well i suppose it is because there are no funds  no what papa  not enough of money dear  oh what a pity  i wish i had lots and lots of money and then wouldnt i have cradlehomes everywhere  sir richard knowing that he had lots and lots of money but had not hitherto contributed one farthing to the object under consideration thought it best to change the subject by going on with the george yard record  but we will not conduct the reader through it allinteresting though the subject certainly is  suffice it to say that he found the account classed under several heads  under feeding the hungry for instance he learned that many poor children are entirely without food sometimes for a whole day so that only two courses are open to them to steal food and become criminals or drift into sickness and die from which fate many hundreds are annually rescued by timely aid at george yard the supplies for which are sent by liberalminded christians in all ranks of lifefrom mr crackaby with his 150 pounds a year up through mr brisbane and his class to the present earl of shaftesburywho by the way has taken a deep interest and lent able support to this particular mission for more than a quarter of a century but the name of sir richard brandon did not appear on the roll of contributors  he had not studied the lower orders much except from a politicoeconomicalargumentative afterdinnerportwiney point of view  under the head of clothing necessitous children he found that some of the little ones presented themselves at the schooldoor in such a network of rags probably infected as to be unfit even for a ragged school  they were therefore taken in had their garments destroyed and were supplied with new clothes  also that about 1000 children between the ages of three and fourteen years were connected with the institutionscattered among the various works of usefulness conducted for the young  under work among lads he found that those big boys whom one sees idling about corners of streets fancying themselves men smoking with obvious dislike and pretended pleasure and on the highroad to the jail and the gallowsthat those boys were enticed into classes opened for carpentry turning fretwork and other attractive industrial pursuits including even printing at a press supplied by lord shaftesbury  this in connection with evening classes for reading writing and arithmeticthe whole leading up to the grand object and aim of allthe salvation of souls  under other heads he found that outcast boys were received sheltered sent to industrial homes or returned to friends and parents that temperance meetings were held and drunkards male and female sought out prayed for lovingly reasoned with and reclaimed from this perhaps the greatest curse of the land that juvenile bands of hope were formed on the ground of prevention being better than cure that lodginghouses where the poorest of the poor and the lowest of the low do congregate were visited and the gospel proclaimed to ears that were deaf to nearly every good influence that mothers meetings were heldone of them at that old headquarters of sin the black horse where counsel and sympathy were mingled with a clothing club and a biblewoman that there were a working mens benefit society bibleclasses sundayschool a sewingclass a mutual labour loan society a shelter for homeless girls a library an invalid childrens dinner a bathroom and lavatory a flower mission andhear it ye who fancy that a penny stands very low in the scale of financial littlenessa farthing bank all this freeconducted by an unpaid band of considerably over a hundred christian workers male and femaleand leavening the foundations of society without which and similar missions there would be very few leavening influences at all and the superstructure of society would stand a pretty fair chance of being burst up or blown to atomsthough the superstructure is not very willing to believe the fact  in addition to all this sir richard learned to his great amazement that the jews wont light their fires on the sabbathdaythat is on our saturdaythat they wont even poke it and that this abstinence is the immediate cause of a source of revenue to the unjewish poor whom the jews hire to light and poke their fires for them  and lastly sir richard brandon learned that mr george holland who had managed that mission for more than quarter of a century was resolved in the strength of the lord to seek out the lost and rescue the perishing even though he sir richard and all who resembled him should refuse to aid by tongue or hand in the glorious work of rescuing the poor from sin and its consequences    chapter ten  balls bobby sir richard and giles appear on the stage  as from the sublime to the ridiculous there is but a step so from the diningroom to the kitchen there is but a stair  let us descend the stair and learn that while sir richard was expounding the subject of the poor to little di mr balls the butler was engaged on the same subject in the servants hall  i cannot tell you said balls what a impression the sight o these poor people made on me  la  mr balls said the cook who was not unacquainted with low life in london having herself been born within sound of bowbells youve got no occasion to worrit yourself about it  it as never bin different  that makes it all the worse cook returned balls standing with his back to the fireplace and his legs wide apart if it was only a temporary depression in trade or the repeal of the corn laws that did it one could stand it but to think that such a state of things always goes on is something fearful  you know im a countrybred man myself and aint used to the town or to such awful sights of squalor it almost made me weep i do assure you  one room that i looked into had a mother and two children in it and i declare to you that the little boy was going about stark naked and his sister was only just a slight degree better  praps they was goin to bed suggested mrs screwbury  no nurse they wasnt they was playing about evidently in their usual costumefor that evenin at least  i would not have believed it if i had not seen it  and the mother was so tattered and draggled and dirtywhich also was the room  was that in the court where the frogs live asked jessie summers  it was and a dreadful court tooshocking  by the way mr balls asked the cook is there any chance o that brat of a boy bobby as they call him coming here  i cant think why master has offered to take such a creeter into his service  no cook there is no chance  i forgot to tell you about that little matter  the boy was here yesterday and he refusedabsolutely declined a splendid offer  im glad to hear it returned the cook  tell us about it mr balls said jessie summers with a reproachful look at the other  im quite fond of that boyhes such a smart fellow and wouldnt be badlooking if hed only wash his face and comb his hair  hes smart enough no doubt but impudence is his strong point rejoined the butler with a laugh  the way he spoke to the master beats everything  ive sent for you my boy said sir richard in his usual dignified kindly way to offer you the situation of undergardener in my establishment  oh thats wot you wants with me is it said the boy as bold as brass indeed i may say as bold as gunmetal for his eyes an teeth glittered as he spoke and he said it with the air of a dook  master didnt quite seem to like it but i saw he laid restraint on himself and said you have to thank my daughter for this offer  thank you miss said the boy turnin to miss di with a low bow imitatin sir richards manner i thought as much as he could  of course continued the master rather sharply i offer you this situation out of mere charity  oh you do do you said the extraordinary boy in the coolest manner but wot if i objec to receive charity  ven i olds a orse i expecs to be paid for so doin same as you expecs to be paid wen you attends a boardmeetin to grin an do nuffin  come come boy said sir richard gettin redder in the face than i ever before saw him i am not accustomed to low pleasantry and  an i aint accustomed broke in the boy to igh hinsults  do you think that every gent what years a coat an pants with oles in em is a beggar  for some moments master seemed to be struck speechless an i feared that in spite of his wellknown gentleness of character hed throw the inkstand at the boys head but he didnt he merely said in a low voice i would dismiss you at once boy were it not that i have promised my daughter to offer you employment and you can see by her looks how much your unnatural conduct grieves her  an this was true for poor miss di sat there with her hands clasped her eyes full of tears her eyebrows disappearin among her hair with astonishment and her whole appearance the very pictur of distress however continued sir richard i still make you the offer though i doubt much whether you will be able to retain the situation  your wages will  please sir pleaded the boy dont mention the wages  i couldnt stand that  indeed i couldnt it would really be too much for me  why what do you mean says master  i mean says impudence that i agree with you  i dont think i could retain the sitivation cause wy  in the fust place i aint got no talent at gardenin  the ony time i tried it was wen i planted a toolip in a flowerpot an wen i dug it up to see ow it was agittin on a cove told me id planted it upside down  however i wasnt goin to be beat by that cove so i say to im jack i says i planted it so a purpus an wen it sprouts im agoin to ang it up to see if it wont grow through the ole in the bottom  in the second place i couldnt retain the sitivation cause i dont intend to take it though you was to offer me six thousand no shillins an no pence no farthins a year as salary  i rally did think master would ha dropt out of his chair at that  as for miss di she was so tickled that she gave a sort of hysterical laugh  balls said master show him out and he pulled up short but i knew he meant to say have an eye on the greatcoats and umbrellas so i showed the boy out an he went downstairs quite quiet but the last thing i saw of him was performin a sort of minstrel dance at the end of the street just before he turned the corner and disappeared  imprence exclaimed the cook  naughty ungrateful boy said mrs screwbury  but it was plucky of him said jessie summers  i would call it cheeky said balls i cant think what put it into his head to go on so  if mr balls had followed bobby frog in spirit watched his subsequent movements and listened to his remarks perhaps he might have understood the meaning of his conduct a little better  after he had turned the corner of the street as above mentioned bobby trotted on for a short space and then coming to a full stop executed a few steps of the minstrel dance at the end of which he brought his foot down with tremendous emphasis on the pavement and said  yes ive bin an done it  i knowd i was game for a good deal but i did not think i was up to that  one never knows wot es fit for till e tries  wotll hetty think i wonder  what hetty thought he soon found out for he overtook her on the thames embankment on her way home  bobby was fond of that route though a little out of his way because he loved the running water though it was muddy and the sight of steamers and barges  well bobby she said laying her hand on his shoulder where have you been  to see old swallowdthepoker hetty  what took you there asked the girl in surprise  my legs  you dont suppose ive set up my carriage yet do you  come you know what i mean  vell then i went because i was sent for an wot dye think the old genlman hoffered me the sitivation of undergardener  you dont say so  oh  bobby what a lucky boyan what a kind gentleman  tell me all about it now said hetty pressing her hand more tenderly on her brothers shoulder  what wages is he to give you  no wages wotsomever  hetty looked into her brothers face with an expression of concerned surprise  she knew some tradespeople who made her work hard for so very little that it was not difficult to believe in a gentleman asking her brother to work for nothin  still she had thought better of sir richard and expected to hear something more creditable to him  ah you may look but i do assure you he is to give me no wages an im to do no work  here bobby executed a few steps of his favourite dance but evidently from mere habit and unconsciously for he left off in the middle and seemed to forget the salient point of emphasis with his foot  what do you mean bobbybe earnest like a dear boy for once  earnest exclaimed the urchin with vehemence  i never was more in earnest in my life  you should ave seen swallowdthepoker wen i refused to ave it  refused it  ayrefused it  come hetty ill explain  the boy dropped his facetious tone and manner while he rapidly ran over the chief points of his interview with sir richard  but why did you refuse so good an offer asked hetty still unable to repress her surprise  because of daddy  daddy  ay daddy  you know hes fond o me is daddy and dye know though praps you maynt believe it im raither fond o him but es a bad un is daddy  hes bent on mischief you see an es set his art on my elpin of im  but i wont elp imthats flat  now what dye think hetty here he dropped his voice to almost a whisper and looked solemn dad wants to make use o me to commit a burglary on swallowdthepokers ouse  you dont mean it bobby  but i do hetty  dad found out from that rediklous butler that goes veepin around our court like a leeky pump that the old genlman was goin to hoffer me this sitivation an es bin wery ard on me to accept it so that i may find out the ways o the ouse where the plate an waluables lay let im in some fine dark night an elp im to carry off the swag  a distressed expression marked poor hettys reception of this news but she said never a word  now you wont tell hetty said the boy with a look of real anxiety on his face  its not so much his killin me i cares about but i wouldnt bring daddy to grief for any money  id raither elp im than that  youll not say a word to nobody  no bobby i wont say a word  vell you see continued the boy ven id made myself so disagreeable that the old genlman would ave nothin to do with me i came straight away an ere i am but it was a trial let me tell you specially ven e come to mention wagesan sitch a eavenly smell o roasted wittles come up from the kitchen too at the moment but i ad only to look at miss di to make me as stubborn as a nox or a hass  wot thinks i to myself betray that hangelno never yet if i was to go into that ouse i know id do it for daddys got sitch a wheedlin way with im wen e likes that i couldnt old hout longso i giv old swallowedthepoker sitch a lot o cheek that i thought ed kick me right through the winder  he was considerable astonished as well as riled i can tell you an miss dis face was a pictur but the old butler was the sight  hed got is face screwed up into sitch a state o surprise that it looked like a eightday clock with a gamboil  now hetty im goin to tell ee whatll take your breath away  ive made up my mind to go to canada  hetty did on hearing this look as if her breath had been taken away when it returned sufficiently she said  bobby what put that into your head  the ome of hindustry said bobby with a mysterious look  the home of industry repeated the girl in surprise for she knew that institution well having frequently assisted its workers in their labour of love  yes thats the nameome of hindustry what sends off so many ragged boys to canada under miss macpherson  ay bobby it does a great deal more than that returned the girl sending off poor boys and girls to canada is only one branch of its work  if youd bin to its teameetins for the destitute as i have an its clothin meetins and its mothers meetins an  ow dye know i avent bin at em all asked the boy with an impudent look  well you know you couldnt have been at the mothers meetings bobby  oh for the matter o that no more could you  true but ive heard of them all many and many a time but come tell me all about it  how did you come to go near the home of industry at all after refusing so often to go with me  vell i didnt go because of bein axed to go you may be sure o that but my little dosser tim lumpy you remember im  the cove wi the nose like a button an no body to speak ofall legs an arms like a uman winmill vell you must know theyve nabbed im an given im a rigout o noo slops an theyre goin to send im to canada  so i appened to be down near the ome one day three weeks past an i see lumpy agoin in  allo says i  allo says e an then e told me all about it  does they feed you well  i axed  oh dont they just said e  theres to be a blow hout this wery night said e i wonder says i if theyd let me in for im uncommon ungry i tell you ad nuffin to heat since last night  just as i said that a lot o fellers like me came tumblin up to the doorso i sneaked in wi the restfor i thought theyd kick me hout if they knowed id come without inwitation  well and what then asked hetty  here our little streetarab began to tell in his own peculiar language and style how that he went in and found a number of ladies in an upper room with forms set and hot tea and bread to be hadas much as they could stufffor nothing that the boys were very wild and unruly at first but that after the chief lady had prayed they became better and that when halfadozen nice little girls were brought in and had sung a hymn or two they were quite quiet and ready to listen  like many other people this city arab did not like to speak out freely even to his sister on matters that touched his feelings deeply but he said enough to let the eager and thankful hetty know that not only had jesus and his love been preached to the boys but she perceived that what had been said and sung had made an unusual impression though the little ragged waif sought to conceal it under the veil of cool pleasantry and she now recognised the fact that the prayers which she had been putting up for many a day in her brothers behalf had been answered  oh  im so happy she said and unable to restrain herself flung her arms round bobbys neck and kissed him  it was evident that the little fellow rather liked this though he pretended that he did not  come old gal he said brusquely none o that sort o thing  i cant stand it  dont you see the popilation is lookin at us in surprise besides youve bin an crushed all my shirt front  but continued hetty as they walked on again im not happy to hear that you are goin to canada  what ever will i do without you bobby  poor girl she could well afford to do without him in one sense for he had hitherto been chiefly an object of anxiety and expense to her though also an object of love  im sorry to think of goin too hetty for your sake an mothers but for daddys sake and my own i must go  you see i cant old hout agin im  wen e makes up is mind to a thing you know e sticks to it for es a tough un an es got sitch a wheedlin sort o way with im that i cant elp givin in amost  so you see itll be better for both of us that i should go away  but ill come back you know hetty with a fortinsee if i dontan then oh wont i keep a carridge an a ridin oss for daddy an feed mother an you on plumduff an pork sassengers to breakfast dinner an supper with ice cream for a relish  poor hetty did not even smile at this prospect of temporal felicity she felt that in the main the boy was right and that the only chance he had of escaping the toils in which her father was wrapping him by the strange union of affection and villainy was to leave the country  she knew also that thanks to the home of industry and its promoters the sending of a ragged friendless penniless london waif clothed and in his right mind to a new land of bright and hopeful prospects was an event brought within the bounds of possibility  that night bob frog stood with his dosser ie his friend tim lumpy discussing their future prospects in the partial privacy of a railwayarch  they talked long and for waifs earnestlyboth as to the land they were about to quit and that to which they were going and the surprising fact might have been noted by a listenerhad there been any such present save a homeless catthat neither of the boys perpetrated a joke for the space of at least ten minutes  vy observed little frog at length you seem to ave got all the fun drove out o you lumpy  not a bit on it returned the other with a hurt look as though he had been charged with some serious misdemeanour but it do seem sitch a shabby thing to go an forsake my blind old mother  but yer blind old mother wants you to go said bobby an says shell be well looked arter by the ladies of the ome and that she wouldnt stand in the way o your prospecs  besides she aint yer mother  this was true  tim lumpy had neither father nor mother nor relative on earth and the old woman who out of sheer pity had taken him in and allowed him to call her mother was a widow at the lowest possible round of that social ladder at the top of whichfiguratively speakingsits her gracious majesty the queen  mrs lumpy had found him on her doorstep weeping and in rags at the early age of five years she had taken him in and fed him on part of a penny loaf which formed the sole edible substance for her own breakfast  she had mended his rags to the extent of her ability but she had not washed his face having no soap of her own and not caring to borrow from neighbours who were in the same destitute condition  besides she had too hard a battle to fight with an everpresent and pressing foe to care much about dirt and no doubt deemed a wash of tears now and then sufficient lumpy himself seemed to agree with her as to this for he washed himself in that fashion frequently  having sought for his parents in vain with the aid of the police mrs lumpy quietly kept the boy on gave him her surname prefixed that of timothy answered to the call of mother and then left him to do very much as he pleased  in these circumstances it was not surprising that little tim soon grew to be one of the pests of his alley  tim was a weakeyed boy and remarkably thin being as his friend had said composed chiefly of legs and arms  there must have been a good deal of brain also for he was keenwitted as people soon began to find out to their cost  tim was observant also  he observed on nearing the age of ten years that in the great river of life which daily flowed past him there were certain faces which indicated tender and kindly hearts coupled with defective brainaction and a good deal of selfwill  he became painfully shrewd in reading such faces and on wet days would present himself to them with his bare little red feet and halfnaked body rain water doing duty for tears running from his weak bloodshot eyes and falsehoods of the most pitiable complex and impudent character pouring from his thin blue lips whilst awful solemnity seemed to shine on his visage  the certain result wascoppers  these kindly ones have unwittingly of course changed a text of scripture and for the words consider the poor read throw coppers to the poor  you see it is much easier to relieve ones feelings by giving away a few pence than to take the trouble of visiting inquiring about and otherwise considering the poor  at all events it would seem so for tim began to grow comparatively rich and corrupted still more deeply associates who were already buried sufficiently in the depths of corruption  at last little tim was met by a lady who had befriended him more than once and who asked him why he preferred begging in the streets to going to the ragged school where he would get not only food for the body but for the soul  he replied that he was hungry and his mother had no victuals to give him so he had gone out to beg  the lady went straight to mrs lumpy found the story to be true and that the poor halfblind old woman was quite unable to support the boy and herself  the lady prevailed on the old woman to attend the meetings for poor aged and infirm women in miss macphersons beehive and little tim was taken into the home for destitute little boys under ten years of age  it was not all smooth sailing in that home after tim lumpy entered it being utterly untamed tim had many a sore struggle ere the temper was brought under control  one day he was so bad that the governess was obliged to punish him by leaving him behind while the other boys went out for a walk  when left alone the ladysuperintendent tried to converse with him about obedience but he became frightfully violent and demanded his rags that he might return again to the streets finally he escaped rushed to his old home in a paroxysm of rage and then getting on the roof declared to the assembled neighbours that he would throw himself down and dash out his brains  in this state a biblewoman found him  after offering the mental prayer lord help me she entreated him to come down and join her in a cup of tea with his old mother  the invitation perhaps struck the little rebel as having a touch of humour in it  at all events he accepted it and forthwith descended  over the tea the biblewoman prayed aloud for him and the poor boy broke down burst into tears and begged forgiveness  soon afterwards he was heard tapping at the door of the homegentle and subdued  thus was this waif rescued and he now discussed with his former comrade the prospect of transferring themselves and their powers mental and physical to canada  diverging from this subject to bobbys father and his dark designs tim asked if ned frog had absolutely decided to break into sir richard brandons house and bobby replied that he had that his father had wormed out of the butler who was a soft stupid sort of cove where the plate and valuables were kept and that he and another man had arranged to do it  is the partikler night fixed asked tim  yes its to be the last night o this month  why not give notice asked tim  cause i wont peach on daddy said bob frog stoutly  little tim received this with a quite right old dosser and then proposed that the meeting should adjourn as he was expected back at the home by that time  two weeks or so after that policeconstable number 666 was walking quietly along one of the streets of his particular beat in the westend with that stateliness of step which seems to be inseparable from place power and six feet two  it was a quiet street such as wealth loves to inhabit  there were few carriages passing along it and fewer passengers  number 666 had nothing particular to dothe inhabitants being painfully wellbehaved and the sun high  his mind therefore roamed about aimlessly sometimes bringing playfully before him a small abode not very far distant where a pretty woman was busy with household operations and a ferocious policeman about three feet high was taking into custody an incorrigible criminal of still smaller size  a little boy with very long arms and legs might have been seen following our friend giles scott until the latter entered upon one of those narrow paths made by builders on the pavements of streets when houses are undergoing repairs  watching until giles was half way along it the boy ran nimbly up and accosted him with a familiar  well old man ow are you  pretty bobbish thank you returned the constable for he was a goodnatured man and rather liked a little quiet chaff with streetboys when not too much engaged with duty  well now are you aweer that theres agoin to be a burglairy committed in this ere quarter asked the boy thrusting both hands deep into his pockets and bending his body a little back so as to look more easily up at his tall friend  ah indeed well no i didnt know it for i forgot to examine the books at scotland yard this morning but ive no doubt its entered there by your friend whos goin to commit it  no it aint entered there said the boy with a manner and tone that rather surprised number 666 and id advise you to git out your notebook an clap down wot im agoin to tell ye  you know the ouse of sir richard brandon  yes i know it  well that ouse is to be cracked on the 31st night o this month  how dyou know that lad asked giles moving towards the end of the barricade so as to get nearer to his informant  no use bobby said tim big as you are you cant nab me  believe me or not as you like but i advise you to look arter that there ouse on the 31st if you valley your repitation  tim went off like a congreve rocket dashed down a side street sloped into an alley and melted into a wilderness of bricks and mortar  of course giles did not attempt to follow but some mysterious communications passed between him and his superintendent that night before he went to bed    chapter eleven  sir richard and mr brisbane discuss and di listens  my dear sir said sir richard brandon over a glass of sherry one evening after dinner to george brisbane esquire of lively hall the management of the poor is a difficult a very difficult subject to deal with  it is unquestionably assented brisbane so difficult that i am afraid some of our legislators are unwilling to face it but it ought to be faced for there is much to be done in the way of improving the poorlaws which at present tend to foster pauperism in the young and bear heavily on the aged  meanwhile philanthropists find it necessary to take up the case of the poor as a private enterprise  pardon me brisbane there i think you are in error  everything requisite to afford relief to the poor is provided by the state  if the poor will not take advantage of the provision or the machinery is not well oiled and worked by the officials the remedy lies in greater wisdom on the part of the poor and supervision of officialsnot in further legislation  but what do you mean by our poorlaws bearing heavily on the aged  i mean that the old people should be better cared for simply because of their age  great age is a sufficient argument of itself i think for throwing a veil of oblivion over the past and extending charity with a liberal pitying hand because of present distress and irremediable infirmities  whatever may be the truth with regard to paupers and workhouses in general there ought to be a distinct refuge for the aged which should be attractivenot repulsive as at present and age without reference to character or antecedents should constitute the title to enter it  god pity the aged poor is often my prayer and enable us to feel more for them in the dreary pitiful termination of their career  but my dear sir returned sir richard you would have old paupers crowding into such workhouses or refuges as you call them by the thousand  well better that they should do so than that they should die miserably by thousands in filthy and empty roomssometimes without fire or food or physic or a single word of kindness to ease their sad descent into the grave  but then brisbane as i said it is their own faultthey have the workhouse to go to  but then as i said sir richard the workhouse is rendered so repulsive to them that they keep out of it as long as they can and too often keep out so long that it is too late and their end is as i have described  however until things are better arranged we must do what we can for them in a private way  indeed scripture teaches distinctly the necessity for private charity by such words asthe poor ye have always with you and blessed are they who consider the poor  dont you agree with me mr welland  stephen wellandwho since the day of his accident had become intimate with mr brisbane and sir richardreplied that although deeply interested in the discussion going on his knowledge of the subject was too slight to justify his holding any decided opinion  take another glass of sherry said sir richard pushing the decanter towards the young man it will stir your brain and enable you to see your way more clearly through this knotty point  no more thank you sir richard  come comefill your glass said the knight you and i must set an example of moderate drinking to brisbane as a counterblast to his blueribbonism  welland smiled and refilled his glass  nay i never thrust my opinions on that point on people said brisbane with a laugh but if you will draw the sword and challenge me i wont refuse the combat  no no brisbane  please spare us  i resheath the sword and need not that you should go all over it again  i quite understand that you are no bigot that you think the bible clearly permits and encourages total abstinence in certain circumstances though it does not teach it that although a total abstainer yourself you do not refuse to give drink to your friends if they desire itand all that sort of thing but pray let it pass and i wont offend again  ah sir richard you are an unfair foe  you draw your sword to give me a wound through our young friend and then sheath it before i can return on you  however you have stated my position so well that i forgive you and shake hands  but to return to the matter of private charity are you aware how little suffices to support the poorhow very far the mere crumbs that fall from a rich mans table will go to sustain them i now just take the glass of wine which welland has swallowedagainst his expressed wish observe and merely to oblige you sir richard  its value is say sixpence  excuse me i do not of course refer to its real value but to its recognised restaurantvalue  well i happened the other day to be at a meeting of old women at the beehive in spitalfields there were some eighty or a hundred of them  with dim eyes and trembling fingers they were sewing garments for the boys who are to be sent out to canada  such feeble workers could not find employment elsewhere but by liberal hearts a plan has been devised whereby many an aged one past work can earn a few pence  twopence an hour is the pay  they are in the habit of meeting once a week for three hours and thus earn sixpence  many of these women i may remark are true christians  i wondered how far such a sum would go and how the poor old things spent it  one woman sixtythree years of age enlightened me  she was a feeble old creature suffering from chronic rheumatism and a dislocated hip  when i questioned her she saidi have difficulties indeed but i tell my father all  sometimes when im very hungry and have nothing to eat i tell him and i know he hears me for he takes the feeling away and it only leaves me a little faint  but how do you spend the sixpence that you earn here  i asked  well sir she said sometimes when very hardup i spend part of it this wayi buy a haporth o tea a haporth o sugar a haporth o drippin a haporth o wood and a pennorth o bread  sometimes when better off than usual i get a heap of coals at a time perhaps quarter of a hundredweight because i save a farthing by getting the whole quarter an that lasts me a long time and wi the farthing i mayhap treat myself to a drop o milk  sometimes too i buy my pennorth o wood from the coopers and chop it myself for i can make it go further that way  so you see welland continued brisbane your glass of sherry would have gone a long way in the domestic calculations of a poor old woman who very likely once had sons who were as fond of her and as proud of her as you now are of your own mother  it is very sad that any class of human beings should be reduced to so low an ebb returned the young man seriously  yes and it is very difficult said sir richard to reduce ones mental action so as to fully understand the exact bearing of such minute monetary arrangements especially for one who is accustomed to regard the subject of finance from a different standpoint  but the saddest thing of all to me and the most difficult to understand resumed brisbane is the state of mind and feeling of those professing christians who with ample means give exceedingly little towards the alleviation of such distress take little or no interest in the condition of the poor and allow as much waste in their establishments as would if turned to account become streamlets of absolute wealth to many of the destitute  this latter remark was a thrust which told pretty severely on the host all the more so perhaps that he knew brisbane did not intend it as a thrust at all for he was utterly ignorant of the fact that his friend seldom gave anything away in charity and even found it difficult to pay his way and make the two ends meet with his poor little five thousand a yearfor you see if a man has to keep up a fairly large establishment with a town and country house and have his yacht and a good stable and indulge in betting and give frequent dinners and take shootings in scotland and amuse himself with jewellery etcetera why he must pay for it you know  the greatest trouble of these poor women i found continued brisbane is their rent which varies from 2 shillings to 3 shillings a week for their little rooms and it is a constant struggle with them to keep out of the house so greatly dreaded by the respectable poor  one of them told me she had lately saved up a shilling with which she bought a pair of specs and was greatly comforted thereby for they helped her fading eyesight  i thought at the time what a deal of good might be done and comfort given if people whose sight is changing would send their disused spectacles to the home of industry in commercial street spitalfields for the poor  by the way your sight must have changed more than once sir richard  have you not a pair or two of disused spectacles to spare  well yes i have a pair or two but they have gold rims which would be rather incongruous on the noses of poor people dont you think  oh by no means  we could manage to convert the rims into blue steel and leave something over for sugar and tea  well ill send them said sir richard with a laugh  by the way you mentioned a plan whereby those poor women were enabled to do useful work although too old for much  what plan might that be  it is a very simple plan answered brisbane and consists chiefly in the work being apportioned according to ability  worn garments and odds and ends of stuff are sent to the beehive from all parts of the country by sympathising friends  these are heaped together in one corner of the room where the poor old things work  down before this mass of stuff are set certain of the company who have large constructive powers  these skilfully contrive cut out alter and piece together all kinds of clothing including the house slippers and glengarry caps worn by the little rescued boys  even handkerchiefs and babies long frocks are conjured out of a petticoat or muslin lining  the work thus selected and arranged is put into the hands of those who though not skilful in originating have the plodding patience to carry out the designs of the more ingenious and so garments are produced to cover the shivering limbs of any destitute child that may enter the refuge as well as to complete the outfits of the little emigrants  well brisbane i freely confess said sir richard that you have roused a degree of interest in poor old women which i never felt before and it does seem to me that we might do a good deal more for them with our mere superfluities and castoff clothing  do the old women receive any food on these working nights besides the pence they earn  no i am sorry to say they do notat least not usually  you see it takes a hundred or more sixpences every monday merely to keep that sewingclass going and more than once there has been a talk of closing it for want of funds but the poor creatures have pleaded so pitifully that they might still be allowed to attend even though they should work at halfprice that it has been hitherto continued  you see it is a matter of no small moment for those women merely to spend three hours in a room with a good fire besides which they delight in the hymns and prayers and the loving counsel and comfort they receive  it enables them to go out into the cold even though hungry with more heart and trust in god as they limp slowly back again to their fireless grates and bare cupboards  the day on which i visited the place i could not bear the thought of this so i gave a sovereign to let them have a good meal  this sufficed  large kettles are always kept in readiness for such occasions  these were put on immediately by the matron  the elder girls in training on the floor above set to work to cut thick slices of bread and butter the tea urns were soon brought down and in twenty minutes i had the satisfaction of seeing the whole hundred eating heartily and enjoying a hot meal  my own soul was fed toofor the words came to me i was an hungered and ye gave me meat and one old woman sitting near me said i have a long walk home and have been casting over in my mind all the afternoon whether i could spare a penny for a cup of tea on the way  how good the lord is to send this  with large round glittering eyes and parted lips and heightened colour and varying expression sat little di brandon at her fathers elbow almost motionless her little hands clasped tight and uttering never a word but gazing intently at the speakers and drinking it all in while sorrow surprise sympathy indignation and intense pity stirred her little heart to its very centre  in the nursery she retailed it all over with an eager face and rapid commentary to the sympathetic mrs screwbury and finally in bed presided over millions of old women who made up mountains of old garments devoured fields of buttered bread and drank oceans of steaming tea    chapter twelve  sammy twitters fall  we must turn now to samuel twitter senior  that genial old man was busy one morning in the nursery amusing little mita who had by that time attained to what we may style the dawnofintelligence period of life and was what mrs loper mr crackaby and mr stickler called engaging  mariar shouted mr twitter to his amiable spouse who was finishing her toilet in the adjoining room  shes makin faces at meyes shes actually attempting to laugh  the darling came from the next room in emphatic tones  mariar  well dear  is sammy down in the parlour  i dont know  why  because hes not in his roomtumtiiddidytootooyou charming thing  it must be understood that the latter part of this sentence had reference to the baby not to mrs twitter  having expended his affections and all his spare time on mitawho to do her justice made faces enough at him to repay his attentions in fullmr twitter descended to the breakfast parlour and asked the domestic if she had seen sammy yet  no sir i haint  are you sure hes not in his room  well no sir but i knocked twice and got no answer  very odd sammy didnt use to be late nor to sleep so soundly said mr twitter ascending to the attic of his eldest son  obtaining no reply to his knock he opened the door and found that the room was empty  more than that he discovered to his surprise and alarm that sammys bed was unruffled so that sammy himself must have slept elsewhere  in silent consternation the father descended to his bedroom and said mariar sammys gone  dead exclaimed mrs twitter with a look of horror  no no not dead but gonegone out of the house  did not sleep in it last night apparently  poor mrs twitter sank into a chair and gazed at her husband with a stricken face  up to that date the family had prospered steadily and may we not add deservedly their children having been trained in the knowledge of god their duties having been conscientiously discharged their sympathies with suffering humanity encouraged and their general principles carried into practical effect  the consequence was that they were a wellordered and loving family  there are many such in our land families which are guided by the spirit and the word of god  the sudden disappearance therefore of the eldest son of the twitter family was not an event to be taken lightly for he had never slept out of his own particular bed without the distinct knowledge of his father and mother since he was born and his appearance at the breakfasttable had been hitherto as certain as the rising of the sun or the winding of the eightday clock by his father every saturday night  in addition to all this sammy was of an amiable disposition and had been trustworthy so that when he came to the years of discretionwhich his father had fixed at fifteenhe was allowed a latchkey as he had frequently to work at his employers books till a lateish hour sometimes eleven oclockafter the family including the domestic had gone to rest  now samuel said mrs twitter with a slight return of her wonted energy there can be only two explanations of this  either the dear boy has met with an accident or  well mariar why do you pause  because it seems so absurd to think of much more to talk of his going wrong or running away  the first thing ive got to do samuel is to go to the policeoffice report the case and hear what they have to advise  the very thing i was thinking of mariar but dont it strike you it might be better that i should go to the station  no samuel the station is near  i can do that while you take a cab go straight away to his office and find out at what hour he left  now go we have not a moment to lose  mary this was the next in order to sammy will look after the childrens breakfast  make haste  mr twitter made hastemade it so fast that he made too much of it overshot the mark and went downstairs head foremost saluting the front door with a rap that threw that of the postman entirely into the shade  but twitter was a springy as well as an athletic man  he arose undamaged made no remark to his more than astonished children and went his way  mrs twitter immediately followed her husbands example in a less violent and eccentric manner  the superintendent of police received her with that affable display of grave goodwill which is a characteristic of the force  he listened with patient attention to the rather incoherent tale which she told with much agitationunbosoming herself to this officer to a quite unnecessary extent as to private feelings and opinions and somehow feeling as if he were a trusted and confidential friend though he was an absolute strangersuch is the wonderful influence of power in selfpossessed repose over weakness in distressful uncertainty  having heard all that the good lady had to say with scarcely a word of interruption having put a few pertinent and relevant questions and noted the replies the superintendent advised mrs twitter to calm herself for that it would soon be all right to return home and abide the issue of his exertions to make herself as easy in the circumstances as possible and finally sent her away with the first ray of comfort that had entered her heart since the news of sammys disappearance had burst upon her like a thunderclap  what a thing it is she muttered to herself on her way home to put things into the hands of a manone you can feel sure will do everything sensibly and well and without fuss  the good lady meant no disparagement to her sex by thisfar from it she referred to a manly man as compared with an unmanly one and she thought for one moment rather disparagingly about the salute which her samuels bald pate had given to the door that morning  probably she failed to think of the fussy manner in which she herself had assaulted the superintendent of police for it is said that people seldom see themselves  but mrs twitter was by no means bitter in her thoughts and her conscience twitted her a little for having perhaps done samuel a slight injustice  indeed she had done him injustice for that estimable little man went about his inquiries after the lost sammy with a lump as big as a walnut on the top of his head and with a degree of persistent energy that might have made the superintendent himself envious  not been at the office for two days sir exclaimed mr twitter repeatingin surprised indignation for he could not believe itthe words of sammys employer who was a merchant in the hardware line  no sir said the hardware man whose face seemed as hard as his ware  doyoumeantotellme said twitter with deliberate solemnity that my son samuel has not been in this office for two days  that is precisely what i mean to tell you returned the hardware man and i mean to tell you moreover that your son has been very irregular of late in his attendance and that on more than one occasion he has come here drunk  drunk repeated twitter almost in a shout  yes sir drunkintoxicated  the hardware man seemed at that moment to mr twitter the hardestware man that ever confronted him  he stood for some moments aghast and speechless  are you aware sir he said at last in impressive tones that my son samuel wears the blue ribbon  the hardware man inquired with an expression of affected surprise what that had to do with the question and further gave it as his opinion that a bit of blue ribbon was no better than a bit of red or green ribbon if it had not something better behind it  this latter remark although by no means meant to soothe had the effect of reducing mr twitter to a condition of sudden humility  there sir said he i entirely agree with you but i had believed indeed it seems to me almost impossible to believe otherwisethat my poor boy had religious principle behind his blue ribbon  this was said in such a meek tone and with such a woebegone look as the conviction began to dawn that sammy was not immaculatethat the hardware man began visibly to soften and at last a confidential talk was established in which was revealed such a series of irregularities on the part of the erring son that the poor fathers heart was crushed for the time and as it were trodden in the dust  in his extremity he looked up to god and found relief in rolling his care upon him  as he slowly recovered from the shock twitters brain resumed its wonted activity  you have a number of clerks i believe he suddenly asked the hardware man  yes i havefour of them  would you object to taking me through your warehouse as if to show it to me and allow me to look at your clerks  certainly not  come along  on entering they found one tying up a parcel one writing busily one reading a book and one balancing a ruler on his nose  the latter on being thus caught in the act gave a short laugh returned the ruler to its place and quietly went on with his work  the reader of the book started endeavoured to conceal the volume in which effort he was unsuccessful and became very red in the face as he resumed his pen  the employer took no notice and mr twitter looked very hard at the hardware in the distant end of the warehouse just over the desk at which the clerks sat  he made a few undertoned remarks to the master and then crossing over to the desk said  mr dobbs may i have the pleasure of a few minutes conversation with you outside  ccertainly sir replied dobbs rising with a redder face than ever and putting on his hat  will you be so good as to tell me mr dobbs said twitter in a quiet but very decided way when outside where my son samuel twitter spent last night  twitter looked steadily in the clerks eyes as he put this question  he was making a bold stroke for success as an amateur detective and as is frequently the result of bold strokes he succeeded  eh youryourson ssamuel stammered dobbs looking at twitters breastpin and then at the ground while varying expressions of guilty shame and defiance flitted across his face  he had a heavy somewhat sulky face with indecision of character stamped on it  mr twitter saw that and took advantage of the latter quality  my poor boy he said dont attempt to deceive me  you are guilty and you know it  stay dont speak yet  i have no wish to injure you on the contrary i pray god to bless and save you but what i want with you at this moment is to learn where my dear boy is  if you tell me no further notice shall be taken of this matter i assure you  doesdoeshe know anything about this asked dobbs glancing in the direction of the warehouse of the hardware man  no nothing of your having led sammy astray if thats what you mean at least not from me and you may depend on it he shall hear nothing if you only confide in me  of course he may have his suspicions  well sir said dobbs with a sigh of relief hes in my lodgings  having ascertained the address of the lodgings the poor father called a cab and soon stood by the side of a bed on which his son sammy lay sprawling in the helpless attitude in which he had fallen down the night before after a season of drunken riot  he was in a heavy sleep with his still innocentlooking features tinged with the first blight of dissipation  sammy said the father in a husky voice as he shook him gently by the arm but the poor boy made no answereven a roughish shake failed to draw from him more than the grumbled desire let me alone  oh  god spare and save him murmured the father in a still husky voice as he fell on his knees by the bedside and prayedprayed as though his heart were breaking while the object of his prayer lay apparently unconscious through it all  he rose and was standing by the bedside uncertain how to act when a heavy tread was heard on the landing the door was thrown open and the landlady announcing a gentleman sir ushered in the superintendent of police who looked at mr twitter with a slight expression of surprise  you are here before me i see sir he said  yes but how did you come to find out that he was here  well i had not much difficulty  you see it is part of our duty to keep our eyes open replied the superintendent with a peculiar smile and i have on several occasions observed your son entering this house with a companion in a condition which did not quite harmonise with his blue ribbon so after your good lady explained the matter to me this morning i came straight here  thank youthank you  it is very kind  iyouit could not have been better managed  mr twitter stopped and looked helplessly at the figure on the bed  perhaps said the superintendent with much delicacy of feeling you would prefer to be alone with your boy when he awakes  if i can be of any further use to you you know where to find me  goodday sir  without waiting for a reply the considerate superintendent left the room  oh  sammy sammy speak to me my dear boyspeak to your old father he cried turning again to the bed and kneeling beside it but the drunken sleeper did not move  rising hastily he went to the door and called the landlady  ill go home missis he said and send the poor lads mother to him  very well sir ill look well after im till she comes  twitter was gone in a moment and the old landlady returned to her lodgers room  there to her surprise she found sammy up and hastily pulling on his boots  in truth he had been only shamming sleep and although still very drunk was quite capable of looking after himself  he had indeed been asleep when his fathers entrance awoke him but a feeling of intense shame had induced him to remain quite still and then having commenced with this unspoken lie he felt constrained to carry it out  but the thought of facing his mother he could not bear for the boy had a sensitive spirit and was keenly alive to the terrible fall he had made at the same time he was too cowardly to face the consequences  dressing himself as well as he could he rushed from the house in spite of the earnest entreaties of the old landlady so that when the distracted mother came to embrace and forgive her erring child she found that he had fled  plunging into the crowded thoroughfares of the great city and walking swiftly along without aim or desire eaten up with shame and rendered desperate by remorse the now reckless youth sought refuge in a low grogshop and called for a glass of beer  well i say youre comcomin it raither strong aint you young feller said a voice at his elbow  he looked up hastily and saw a bleareyed youth in a state of drivelling intoxication staring at him with the expression of an idiot  thats no business of yours replied sam twitter sharply  well thash true taint no bbusnish o mine  iim pretty far gone mself i allow but i aint quite got the llength o drinkin in a ppublic ouse wi th blblue ribbn on  the fallen lad glanced at his breast  there it wasforgotten desecrated  he tore it fiercely from his buttonhole amid the laughter of the bystandersmost of whom were women of the lowest gradeand dashed it on the floor  thash rightyoure a berrer feller than i took you for said the sot at his elbow  to avoid further attention sammy took his beer into a dark corner and was quickly forgotten  he had not been seated more than a few minutes when the door opened and a man with a mild gentle yet manly face entered  have a glass ol feller said the sot the instant he caught sight of him  thank you nonot today replied john seaward for it was our city missionary on what he sometimes called a fishing excursionfishing for men  i have come to give you a glass today friends  well thats friendly said a gruff voice in a secluded box out of which next minute staggered ned frog  come what ist to be old man  a lookingglass replied the missionary picking out a tract from the bundle he held in his hand and offering it to the exprizefighter but the tract is not the glass i speak of friend here it is in the word of that god who made us allmade the throats that swallow the drink and the brains that reel under it  here he read from a small bible but they also have erred through wine and through strong drink are out of the way  bah said ned flinging the tract on the floor and exclaiming as he left the place with a swing i dont drink wine old man cant afford anything better than beer though sometimes when im in luck i have a drop of old tom  there was a great burst of ribald laughter at this and numerous were the witticisms perpetrated at the expense of the missionary but he took no notice of these for a time occupying himself merely in turning over the leaves of his bible  when there was a lull he said  now dear sisters turning to the women who with a more or less drunken aspect and slatternly air were staring at him for sisters of mine you are having been made by the same heavenly father i wont offer you another glassnot even a lookingglassfor the one i have already held up to you will do if gods holy spirit opens your eyes to see yourselves in it but ill give you a better object to look at  it is a saviourone who is able to save you from the drink and from sin in every form  you know his name well most of you it is jesus and that name means saviour for he came to save his people from their sins  at this point he was interrupted by one of the women who seemed bent on keeping up the spirit of banter with which they had begun  she asked him with a leer if he had got a wife  no he said but i have got a great respect and love for women because ive got a mother and if ever there was a woman on the face of this earth that deserves the love of a son that woman is my mother sister he added turning to one of those who sat on a bench near him with a thin puny curlyhaired boy wrapped up in her ragged shawl the best prayer that i could offer up for youand i do offer itis that the little chap in your arms may grow up to bless his mother as heartily as i bless mine but that can never be so long as you love the strong drink and refuse the saviour  at that moment a loud cry was heard outside  they all rose and ran to the door where a woman in the lowest depths of depravity with her eyes bloodshot her hair tumbling about her halfnaked shoulders and her ragged garments draggled and wet had fallen in her efforts to enter the publichouse to obtain more of the poison which had already almost destroyed her  she had cut her forehead and the blood flowed freely over her face as the missionary lifted her  he was a powerful man and could take her up tenderly and with ease  she was not much hurt however  after seaward had bandaged the cut with his own handkerchief she professed to be much better  this little incident completed the good influence which the missionarys words and manner had previously commenced  most of the women began to weep as they listened to the words of love encouragement and hope addressed to them  a few of course remained obdurate though not unimpressed  all this time young sam twitter remained in his dark corner with his head resting on his arms to prevent his being recognised  well did he know john seaward and well did seaward know him for the missionary had long been a fellowworker with mrs twitter in george yard and at the home of industry  the boy was very anxious to escape seawards observation  this was not a difficult matter  when the missionary left after distributing his tracts sammy rose up and sought to hide himselffrom himself had that been possiblein the lowest slums of london    chapter thirteen  tells of some curious and vigorous peculiarities of the lower orders  now it must not be supposed that mrs frog having provided for her baby and got rid of it remained thereafter quite indifferent to it  on the contrary she felt the blank more than she had expected and her motherly heart began to yearn for it powerfully  to gratify this yearning to some extent she got into the habit of paying frequent visits sometimes by night and sometimes by day to the street in which samuel twitter lived and tried to see her baby through the stone walls of the house  her eyes being weak as well as her imagination she failed in this effort but the mere sight of the house where little matty was sufficed to calm her maternal yearnings in some slight degree  by the way that name reminds us of our having omitted to mention that baby frogs real name was matilda and her pet name matty so that the name of mita fixed on by the twitters was not so wide of the mark as it might have been  one night mrs frog feeling the yearning strong upon her put on her bonnet and shawlthat is to say the bundle of dirty silk pasteboard and flowers which represented the one and the soiled tartan rag that did duty for the other  where are ye off to old woman asked ned who having been recently successful in some little job was in high good humour  im goin round to see mrs tibbs ned  dyou want me  no ony im goin that way too so well walk together  mrs frog we regret to say was not particular as to the matter of truth  she had no intention of going near mrs tibbs but having committed herself made a virtue of necessity and resolved to pay that lady a visit  the conversation by the way was not sufficiently interesting to be worthy of record  arrived at twitters street an idea struck mrs frog  ned said she im tired  well old girl youd better cut home  i think i will ned but first ill sit down on this step to rest a bit  all right old girl said ned who would have said the same words if she had proposed to stand on her head on the stepso easy was he in his mind as to how his wife spent her time if you sit for halfanhour or so ill be back to see you ome again  im ony goin to bundles shop for a bit o baccy  aint i purlite now  dont it mind you of the courtin days  ah  ned exclaimed the wife while a sudden gush of memory brought back the days when he was handsome and kindbut ned was gone and the slightly thawed spring froze up again  she sat down on the cold step of a door which happened to be somewhat in the shade and gazed at the opposite windows  there was a light in one of them  she knew it well  she had often watched the shadows that crossed the blind after the gas was lighted and once she had seen some one carrying something which looked like a baby  it might have been a bundle of soiled linen or undarned socks but it might have been matty and the thought sent a thrill to the forlorn creatures heart  on the present occasion she was highly favoured for soon after ned had left the shadows came again on the blind and came so near it as to be distinctly visible  yes there could be no doubt now it was a baby and as there was only one baby in that house it followed that the baby was her babylittle matty  here was something to carry home with her and think over and dream about  but there was more in store for her  the baby to judge from the shadowy action of its fat limbs on the blind became what she called obstropolous  more than that it yelled and its mother heard the yellfaintly it is true but sufficiently to send a thrill of joy to her longing heart  then a sudden fear came over her  what if it was ill and they were trying to soothe it to rest  how much better she could do that if she only had the baby  oh fool that i was to part with her she murmured but no  it was best  she would surely have bin dead by this time  the sound of the little voice however had roused such a tempest of longing in mrs frogs heart that under an irresistible impulse she ran across the road and rang the bell  the door was promptly opened by mrs twitters domestic  isis the baby well stammered mrs frog scarce knowing what she said  youve nothink to do wi the baby that i knows on returned mrs twitters domestic who was not quite so polite as her mistress  no honey said mrs frog in a wheedling tone rendered almost desperate by the sudden necessity for instant invention but the doctor said i was to ask if baby had got over it or if e was to send round thethei forget its nameat once  what doctor sent you asked mrs twitter who had come out of the parlour on hearing the voices through the doorway and with her came a clear and distinct yell which mrs frog treasured up in her thinly clad but warm bosom as though it had been a strain from paradise  there must surely be some mistake my good woman for my baby is quite well  oh thank you thank youyes there must have been some mistake said mrs frog scarce able to restrain a laugh of joy at the success of her scheme as she retired precipitately from the door and hurried away  she did not go far however but on hearing the door shut turned back and took up her position again on the doorstep  poor mrs frog had been hardened and saddened by sorrow and suffering and poverty and bad treatment nevertheless she was probably one of the happiest women in london just then  my baby she said quoting part of mrs twitters remarks with a sarcastic laugh no madam shes not your baby yet  as she sat reflecting on this agreeable fact a heavy step was heard approaching  it was too slow for that of ned  she knew it wella policeman  there are hardhearted policemen in the forcenot many indeed but nothing is perfect in this world and there are a few hardhearted policemen  he who approached was one of these  move on he said in a stern voice  please sir im tired  ony restin a bit while i wait for my usband pleaded mrs frog  come move on repeated the unyielding constable in a tone that there was no disputing  indeed it was so strong that it reached the ears of ned frog himself who chanced to come round the corner at the moment and saw the policeman as he imagined maltreating his wife  ned was a man who while he claimed and exercised the right to treat his own wife as he pleased was exceedingly jealous of the interference of others with his privileges  he advanced therefore at once and planted his practised knuckles on the policemans forehead with such power that the unfortunate limb of the law rolled over in one direction and his helmet in another  as every one knows the police sometimes suffer severely at the hands of roughs and on this occasion that truth was verified but the policeman who had been knocked down by this prizefighter was by no means a feeble member of the force  recovering from his astonishment in a moment he sprang up and grappled with ned frog in such a manner as to convince that worthy he had his work cut out for him  the tussle that ensued was tremendous and mrs frog retired into a doorway to enjoy it in safety  but it was brief  before either wrestler could claim the victory a brother constable came up and ned was secured and borne away to a not unfamiliar cell before he could enjoy even one pipe of the baccy which he had purchased  thus it came to pass that when a certain comrade expected to find ned frog at a certain mansion in the westend prepared with a set of peculiar tools for a certain purpose ned was in the enjoyment of board and lodging at her majestys expense  the comrade however not being aware of neds incarceration and believing no doubt that there was honour among thieves was true to his day and hour  he had been engaged down somewhere in the country on business and came up by express train for this particular job hence his ignorance as to his partners fate  but this burglar was not a man to be easily balked in his purpose  ned must be ill or got a haccident o some sort he said to a very little but sharp boy who was to assist in the job  howsever you an mell go at it alone sniveller  wery good bunky replied sniveller ow is it to be  by the winder through the door down the chimbly up the spoutor wot  the larder windy my boy  sorry for that said sniveller  why  cause it is so ard to go past the nice things an smell em all without darin to touch em till i lets you in  couldnt you let me ave a feed first  unpossible said the burglar  wery good returned the boy with a sigh of resignation  now while these two were whispering to each other in a box of an adjoining tavern three policeconstables were making themselves at home in the premises of sir richard brandon  one of these was number 666  it is not quite certain even to this day how and where these men were stationed for their proceedingsthough not deeds of evilwere done in the dark at least in darkness which was rendered visible only now and then by bullseye lanterns  the only thing that was absolutely clear to the butler mr thomas balls was that the mansion was given over entirely to the triumvirate to be dealt with as they thought fit  of course they did not know when the burglars would come nor the particular point of the mansion where the assault would be delivered therefore number 666 laid his plans like a wise general posted his troops where there was most likelihood of their being required and kept himself in reserve for contingencies  about that wee short hour of which the poet burns writes a small boy was lifted by a large man to the sill of the small window which lighted sir richard brandons pantry  to the surprise of the small boy he found the window unfastened  theyve bin an forgot it he whispered  git in was the curt reply  sniveller got in dropped to his extreme length from the sill let go his hold and came down lightly on the floornot so lightly however but that a wooden stool placed there was overturned and falling against a blue plate broke it with a crash  sniveller became as one petrified and remained so for a considerable time till he imagined all danger from sleepers having been awakened was over  he also thought of thieving cats and thanked them mentally  he likewise became aware of the near presence of pastry  the smell was delicious but a sense of duty restrained him  number 666 smiled to himself to think how well his trap had acted but the smile was lost in darkness  meanwhile the chief operator bunky went round to the back door sniveller who had been taught the geography of the mansion from a wellexecuted plan proceeded to the same door inside  giles could have patted his little head as he carefully drew back the bolts and turned the key  another moment and bunky on his stocking soles stood within the mansion  yet another moment and bunky was enjoying an embrace that squeezed most of the wind out of his body strong though he was for number 666 was apt to forget his excessive power when duty constrained him to act with promptitude  now then show a light said giles quietly  two bullseyes flashed out their rich beams at the word and lit up a tableau of three in attitudes faintly resembling those of the laocoon without the serpents  fetch the bracelets said giles  at these words the bullseyes converged and sniveller bolting through the open door vanishedhe was never heard of more  then followed two sharp clicks succeeded by a sigh of relief as number 666 relaxed his arms  you neednt rouse the household unless you feel inclined my man said giles to bunky in a low voice  bunky did not feel inclined  he thought it better on the whole to let the sleeping dogs lie and wisely submitted to inevitable fate  he was marched off to jail while one of the constables remained behind to see the house made safe and acquaint sir richard of his deliverance from the threatened danger  referring to this matter on the following day in the servants hall thomas balls filled a foaming tankard of gingerbeerfor strange to say he was an abstainer though a butlerand proposed in a highly eulogistic speech the health and prosperity of that admirable body of men the metropolitan police with which toast he begged to couple the name of number 666    chapter fourteen  number 666 off duty  some time after the attempt made upon sir richard brandons house giles scott was seated at his own fireside helmet and truncheon laid aside uniform taken off and a free and easy suit of plain clothes put on  his pretty wife sat beside him darning a pair of very large socks  the juvenile policeman and the incorrigible criminal were sound asleep in their respective cribs the one under the print of the queen the other under that of sir robert peel  giles was studying a small book of instructions as to the duties of policeconstables and pretty molly was commenting on the same for she possessed that charming quality of mind and heart which induces the possessor to take a sympathetic and lively interest in whatever may happen to be going on  they expect pretty hard work of you giles remarked molly with a sigh as she thought of the prolonged hours of absence from home and the frequent night duty  why moll you wouldnt have me wish for easy work at my time of life would you replied the policeman looking up from his little book with an amused smile  somebody must always be taking a heavy lift of the hard work of this world and if a big hulking fellow like me in the prime o life dont do it who will  true giles but surely you wont deny me the small privilege of wishing that you had a little less to do and a little more time with your family  you menespecially you scotchmenare such an argumentative set that a poor woman cant open her lips to say a word but you pounce upon it and make an argument of it  now molly there you go again assuming my duties  why do you take me so sharp  isnt takingup the special privilege of the police  am i not entitled said molly ignoring her husbands question to express regret that your work should include coming home now and then with scratched cheeks and swelled noses and black eyes  come now returned giles you must admit that i have fewer of these discomforts than most men of the force owing no doubt to little men being unable to reach so highand dyou know its the little men who do most damage in life theyre such a pugnacious and perverse generation  as to swelled noses these are the fortune of war at least of civil war like oursand black eyes why my eyes are black by nature  if they were of a heavenly blue like yours molly you might have some ground for complaint when they are blackened  and then there is such dreadful tear and wear of clothes continued molly just look at that now  she held up to view a sock with a hole in its heel large enough to let an orange through  why molly do you expect that i can walk the streets of london from early morning till late at night protect life and property and preserve public tranquillity as this little book puts it besides engaging in numerous scuffles and street rows without making a hole or two in my socks  ah  giles if you had only brain enough to take in a simple idea its not the making of holes that i complain of  it is the making of such awfully big ones before changing your socks  there now dont let us get on domestic matters  you have no head for these but tell me something about your little book  i am specially interested in it you see because the small policeman in the crib over there puts endless questions about his duties which i am quite unable to answer and you know it is a good thing for a child to grow up with the idea that father and mother know everything  just so molly  i hope youll tell your little recruit that the first and foremost duty of a good policeman is to obey orders  let me see then if i can enlighten you a bit  but tell me first gilesfor i really want to knowhow many are there of you altogether and when was the force established on its present footing and who began it and in short all about it  its so nice to have you for once in a way for a quiet chat like this  you have laid down enough of heads molly to serve for the foundation of a small volume  however ill give it you hot since you wish it and ill begin at the end instead of the beginning  what would you say now to an army of eleven thousand men  i would say it was a very large one though i dont pretend to much knowledge about the size of armies said molly commencing to mend another hole about the size of a turnip  well that in round numbers is the strength of the metropolitan police force at the present timeand not a man too much let me tell you for what with occasional illnesses and accidents men employed on special duty and men off dutyas i am just nowthe actual available strength of the force at any moment is considerably below that number yes it is a goodly army of picked and stalwart men no selfpraise intended but then consider what we have to do  we have to guard and keep in order the population of the biggest city in the world a population greater than that of the whole of scotland  oh of course you are sure to go to scotland for your illustrations as if there was no such place as england in the world quietly remarked molly with a curl of her pretty lip  ah  molly dear you are unjust  it is true i go to scotland for an illustration but didnt i come to england for a wife  now dont go frowning at that hole as if it couldnt be bridged over  it is the worst hole you ever made said the despairing wife holding it up to view  you make a worsted hole of it then moll and itll be all right besides you dont speak truth for i once made a worse hole in your heart  you never did sir  go on with your stupid illustrations said molly  well then let me seewhere was i  in scotland of course  ah yes  the population of all scotland is under four millions and that of londonthat is of the area embraced in the metropolitan police district is estimated at above four million seven hundred thousandin round numbers  of course i give it you all in round numbers  i dont mind how round the numbers are giles so long as theyre all square remarked the little wife with much simplicity  well just think of that number for our army to watch over and that populationnot all of it you know but part of itsucceedsin spite of us in committing during one year no fewer than 25000 principal offences such as murders burglaries robberies thefts and suchlike what they would accomplish if we were not ever on the watch i leave you to guess  last year for instance 470 burglaries as we style housebreaking by night were committed in london  the wonder is that there are not more when you consider the fact that the number of doors and windows found open by us at night during the twelve months was nearly 26000  the total loss of property by theft during the year is estimated at about 100000 pounds  besides endeavouring to check crime of such magnitude we had to search after above 15000 persons who were reported lost and missing during the year about 12000 of whom were children  oh the poor darlings said molly twisting her sympathetic eyebrows  ay and we found 7523 of these darlings continued the practical giles and 720 of the adults  of the rest some returned home or were found by their friends but 154 adults and 23 children have been lost altogether  then we found within the twelve months 54 dead bodies which we had to take care of and have photographed for identification during the same period and remember that the record of every twelve months is much the same we seized over 17000 stray dogs and returned them to their owners or sent them to the dogs home  we arrested over 18000 persons for being drunk and disorderly  we inspected all the public vehicles and horses in london  we attended to 3527 accidents which occurred in the streets 127 of which were fatal  we looked after more than 17000 articles varying in value from 0 pence to 1500 pounds which were lost by a heedless public during the year about 10000 of which articles were restored to the owners  we had to regulate the street traffic inspect common lodginghouses attend the police and other courts to give evidence and many other things which it would take me much too long to enumerate and puzzle your pretty little head to take in  no it wouldnt said molly looking up with a bright expression i have a wonderful head for figuresespecially for handsome manly figures  go on giles  then look at what is expected of us continued number 666 not noticing the last remark  we are told to exercise the greatest civility and affability towards every onehigh and low rich and poor we are expected to show the utmost forbearance under all circumstances to take as much abuse and as many blows as we can stand without inflicting any in return to be capable of answering almost every question that an ignorantnot to say arrogantpublic may choose to put to us to be ready singlehanded and armed only with our truncheons and the majesty of the law to encounter burglars furnished with knives and revolvers to plunge into the midst of drunken maddened crowds and make arrests in the teeth of tremendous odds to keep an eye upon strangers whose presence may seem to be less desirable than their absence to stand any amount of unjust and ungenerous criticism without a word of reply to submit quietly to the abhorrence and chaff of boys labourers cabmen omnibus drivers tramps and fast young men to have a fair knowledge of the three rs and a smattering of law so as to conduct ourselves with propriety at fires fairs fights and races besides acting wisely as to mad dogs german bands which are apt to produce mad men organgrinders furious drivers and all other nuisances in addition to all which we must be men of good character good standingas to inchesgood proportions physically and good sense in short we are expected to beand blamed if we are notas near to a state of perfection as it is possible for mortal man to attain on this side the grave and all for the modest sum which you are but too well aware is the extent of our income  is one of the things expected of you asked molly to have an exceedingly high estimate of yourselves  nay molly dont you join the ranks of those who are against us  it will be more than criminal if you do  you are aware that i am giving the opinion expressed by men of position who ought to know everything about the force  that we fulfil the conditions required of us not so badly is proved by the fact that last year out of the whole 12000 there were 215 officers and 1225 men who obtained rewards for zeal and activity while only one man was discharged and four men were fined or imprisoned  i speak not of number oneor i should say number 666 for myself i am ready to admit that i am the most insignificant of the force  o giles what a barefaced display of mock modesty  nay molly i can prove it  everything in this world goes by contrast doesnt it then is there a man in the whole force except myself i ask whose wife is so bright and beautiful and good and sweet that she reduces him to mere insignificance by contrast  theres something in that giles replied molly with gravity but go on with your lecture  ive nothing more to say about the force returned giles if i have not said enough to convince you of our importance and of the debt of gratitude that you and the public of london owe to us you are past conviction and  you are wrong giles as usual i am never past conviction you have only to take me before the police court in the morning and any magistrate will at once convict me of stupidity for having married a scotchman and a policeman  i think it must be time to go on my beat for you beat me hollow said number 666 consulting his watch  no no giles please sit still  it is not every day that i have such a chance of a chat with you  such a chance of pitching into me you mean returned giles however before i go i would like to tell you just one or two facts regarding this great london itself which needs so much guarding and such an army of guardians  you know that the metropolitan district comprises all the parishes any portion of which are within 15 miles of charing crossthis area being 688 square miles  the rateable value of it is over twentysix million eight hundred thousand pounds sterling see as you say youve a good head for figures theres the sum on a bit of paper for you26800000 pounds  during last year 26170 new houses were built forming 556 new streets and four new squaresthe whole covering a length of 86 miles  the total number of new houses built during the last ten years within this area has been 162525 extending over 500 miles of streets and squares  stay i cant stand it cried molly dropping her sock and putting her fingers in her ears  why not old girl  because it is too much for me why even your figure is a mere nothing to such sums  then returned giles youve only got to stick me on to the end of them to make my information ten times more valuable  but are you quite sure that what you tell me is true giles  quite sure my girlat least as sure as i am of the veracity of colonel henderson who wrote the last police report  at this point the chat was interrupted by the juvenile policeman in the crib under sir robert peel  whether it was the astounding information uttered in his sleepy presence or the arduous nature of the duty required of him in dreams we cannot tell but certain it is that when number 666 uttered the word report there came a crash like the report of a great gun and number 2 of the a division having fallen overboard was seen on the floor pommelling some imaginary criminal who stoutly refused to be captured  giles ran forward to the assistance of number 2 as was his duty and took him up in his arms  but number 2 had awakened to the fact that he had hurt himself and notwithstanding the blandishments of his father who swayed him about and put him on his broad shoulders and raised his curly head to the ceiling he refused for a long time to be comforted at last he was subdued and returned to the crib and the land of dreams  now molly i must really go said giles putting on his uniform  i hope number 2 wont disturb you again  goodbye lass for a few hours he added buckling his belt  here look do you see that little spot on the ceiling  yeswell said molly looking up  giles took unfair advantage of her stooped and kissed the pretty little face received a resounding slap on the back and went out to attend to his professional duties with the profound gravity of an incapable magistrate  there was a bright intelligent little streetarab on the opposite side of the way who observed giles with mingled feelings of admiration envy and hatred as he strode sedately along the street like an imperturbable pillar  he knew number 666 personally had seen him under many and varied circumstance and had imagined him under many others not unfrequently as hanging by the neck from a lamppostbut never even in the most daring flights of his juvenile fancy had he seen him as he has been seen by the reader in the bosom of his poor but happy home    chapter fifteen  mrs frog sinks deeper and deeper  nobody cares said poor mrs frog one raw afternoon in november as she entered her miserable dwelling where the main pieces of furniture were a rickety table a broken chair and a heap of straw while the minor pieces were so insignificant as to be unworthy of mention  there was no fire in the grate no bread in the cupboard little fresh air in the room and less light though there was a broken unlighted candle stuck in the mouth of a quart bottle which gave promise of light in the futurelight enough at least to penetrate the november fog which had filled the room as if it had been endued with a pitying desire to throw a veil over such degradation and misery  we say degradation for mrs frog had of late taken to the bottle as a last solace in her extreme misery and the expression of her face as she cowered on a low stool beside the empty grate and drew the shred of tartan shawl round her shivering form showed all too clearly that she was at that time under its influence  she had been down to the river again more than once and had gazed into its dark waters until she had very nearly made up her mind to take the desperate leap but god in mercy had hitherto interposed  at one time a policeman had passed with his weary move onthough sometimes he had not the heart to enforce his order  more frequently a little babyface had looked up from the river with a smile and sent her away to the wellknown street where she would sit in the familiar doorstep watching the shadows on the windowblind until cold and sorrow drove her to the ginpalace to seek for the miserable comfort to be found there  whatever that comfort might amount to it did not last long for on the night of which we write she had been to the palace had got all the comfort that was to be had out of it and returned to her desolate home more wretched than ever to sit down as we have seen and murmur almost fiercely nobody cares  for a time she sat silent and motionless while the deepening shadows gathered round her as if they had united with all the rest to intensify the poor creatures woe  presently she began to mutter to herself aloud  whats the use o your religion when it comes to this  what sort of religion is in the hearts of these she pursed her lips and paused for an expressive word but found none these rich folk in their silks and satins and broadcloth with more than they can use an feedin their pampered cats and dogs on what would be wealth to the likes o me religion bah  she stopped for a voice within her said as plainly as if it had spoken out who gave you the sixpence the other day and looked after you with a tender pitying glance as you hurried away to the ginshop without so much as stopping to say thank you  she wore silks didnt she  ah but theres not many like that replied the poor woman mentally for the powers of good and evil were fighting fiercely within her just then  how do you know there are not many like that demanded the voice  well but all the rich are not like that said mrs frog  the voice made no reply to that  again she sat silent for some time save that a low moan escaped her occasionally for she was very cold and very hungry having spent the last few pence which might have given her a meal in drink and the reaction of the poison helped to depress her  the evil spirit seemed to gain the mastery at this point to judge from her muttered words  nothing to eat nothing to drink no work to be got hetty laid up in hospital ned in prison bobby gone to the bad again instead of goin to canada andnobody cares  what about baby asked the voice  this time it was mrs frogs turn to make no reply in a few minutes she seemed to become desperate for rising hastily she went out shut the door with a bang locked it and set out on the familiar journey to the ginshop  she had not far to go  it was at the corner  if it had not been at that corner there was one to be found at the nextand the nextand the next again and so on all round so that rushing past as people sometimes do when endeavouring to avoid a danger would have been of little or no avail in this case  but there was a very potent influence of a negative kind in her favour  she had no money  recollecting this when she had nearly reached the door she turned aside and ran swiftly to the old doorstep where she sat down and hid her face in her hands  a heavy footstep sounded at her side the next moment  she looked quickly up  it was a policeman  he did not apply the expected wordsmove on  he was a man under whose blue uniform beat a tender and sympathetic heart  in fact he was number 666changed from some cause that we cannot explain and do not understandfrom the metropolitan to the city police force  his number also had been changed but we refuse to be trammelled by police regulations  number 666 he was and shall remain in this tale to the end of the chapter  instead of ordering the poor woman to go away giles was searching his pockets for a penny when to his intense surprise he received a blow on the chest and then a slap on the face  poor mrs frog misjudging his intentions and roused to a fit of temporary insanity by her wrongs and sorrows sprang at her supposed foe like a wildcat  she was naturally a strong woman and violent passion lent her unusual strength  oh it was pitiful to witness the struggle that ensuedto see a woman forgetful of sex and everything else striving with all her might to bite scratch and kick while her hair tumbled down and her bonnet and shawl falling off made more apparent the insufficiency of the rags with which she was covered  strong as he was giles received several ugly scratches and bites before he could effectually restrain her  fortunately there were no passersby in the quiet street and therefore no crowd assembled  my poor woman said giles when he had her fast do keep quiet  im going to do you no harm  god help you i was goin to give you a copper when you flew at me so  come youd better go with me to the station for youre not fit to take care of yourself  whether it was the tender tone of giless voice or the words that he uttered or the strength of his grasp that subdued mrs frog we cannot tell but she gave in suddenly hung down her head and allowed her captor to do as he pleased  seeing this he carefully replaced her bonnet on her head drew the old shawl quite tenderly over her shoulders and led her gently away  before they had got the length of the main thoroughfare however a female of a quiet respectable appearance met them  mrs frog she exclaimed in amazement stopping suddenly before them  if you know her maam perhaps you may direct me to her home  i know her well said the female who was none other than the biblenurse who visited the sick of that district if you have not arrested her forfor  oh no madam interrupted giles i have not arrested her at all but she seems to be unwell and i was merely assisting her  oh then give her over to me please  i know where she lives and will take care of her  giles politely handed his charge over and went on his way sincerely hoping that the next to demand his care would be a man  the biblewoman drew the arm of poor mrs frog through her own and in a few minutes stood beside her in the desolate home  nobody cares muttered the wretched woman as she sank in apathy on her stool and leaned her head against the wall  you are wrong dear mrs frog  i care for one else i should not be here  many other christian people would care too if they knew of your sufferings but above all god cares  have you carried your troubles to him  why should i  he has long ago forsaken me  is it not dear friend that you have forsaken him  jesus says as plain as words can put it come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest  you tell me it is of no use to go to him and you dont go and then you complain that he has forsaken you  where is my friend hetty  in hospital  indeed  i have been here several times lately to inquire but have always found your door locked  your husband  hes in prison and bobbys gone to the bad said mrs frog still in a tone of sulky defiance  i see no sign of food said the biblenurse glancing quickly round are you hungry  hungry exclaimed the woman fiercely ive tasted nothin at all since yesterday  poor thing said the biblenurse in a low tone comecome with me i dont say more  you cannot speak while you are famishing  stay first one word she paused and looked up  she did not kneel she did not clasp her hands or shut her eyes but with one hand on the doorlatch and the other grasping the poor womans wrist she prayed  god bless and comfort poor mrs frog for jesus sake  then she hurried without uttering a word to the institution in george yard  the door happened to be open and the figure of a man with white hair and a kind face was seen within  entering the biblenurse whispered to this man  another moment and mrs frog was seated at a long deal table with a comfortable fire at her back a basin of warm soup and a lump of loaf bread before her  the biblenurse sat by and looked on  somebody cares a little dont you think she whispered when the starving woman made a brief pause for breath  yes thank god answered mrs frog returning to the meal as though she feared that some one might still snatch it from her thin lips before she got it all down  when it was finished the biblenurse led mrs frog into another room  you feel betterstronger she asked  yes much betterthank you and quite able to go home  there is no occasion for you to go home tonight you may sleep there pointing to a corner but i would like to pray with you now and read a verse or two  mrs frog submitted while her friend read to her words of comfort pleaded that pardon and deliverance might be extended and gave her loving words of counsel  then the poor creature lay down in her corner drew a warm blanket over her and slept with a degree of comfort that she had not enjoyed for many a day  when it was said by mrs frog that her son bobby had gone to the bad it must not be supposed that any very serious change had come over him  as that little waif had once said of himself when in a penitent mood he was about as bad as he could be so couldnt grow much badder  but when his sister lost her situation in the firm that paid her such splendid wages and fell ill and went into hospital in consequence he lost heart and had a relapse of wickedness  he grew savage with regard to life in general and committed a petty theft which although not discovered necessitated his absence from home for a time  it was while he was away that the scene which we have just described took place  on the very next day he returned and it so happened that on the same day hetty was discharged from hospital cured  that is to say she left the place a thin tottering pallid shadow but with no particular form of organic disease about her  she and her mother had received some food from one who cared for them through the biblenurse  mother youve been drinkin again said hetty looking earnestly at her parents eyes  well dear pleaded mrs frog what could i do  you had all forsaken me and i had nothin else to comfort me  oh mother darling mother cried hetty do promise me that you will give it up  i wont get ill or leave you againgod helping me but it will kill me if you go on  do promise  its of no use hetty  of course i can easily promise but i cant keep my promise  i know i cant  hetty knew this to be too true  without the grace of god in the heart she was well aware that human efforts must fail sooner or later  she was thinking what to reply and praying in her heart for guidance when the door opened and her brother bobby swaggered in with an air that did not quite accord with his filthy fluttering rags unwashed face and hands bare feet and unkempt hair  vell mother ow are ye  hallo  hetty wy wot a shadder youve become  oh  i say them nusses at the hospital must ave stole all your flesh an blood from you for theyve left nothin but the bones and skin  he went up to his sister put an arm round her neck and kissed her this was a very unusual display of affection  it was the first time bobby had volunteered an embrace though he had often submitted to one with dignified complacency and hetty being weak burst into tears  hallo  i say stop that now young gal he said with a look of alarm im always took bad ven i see that sort o thing i cant stand it  by way of mending matters the poor girl endeavouring to be agreeable gave a hysterical laugh  come thats better though it aint much to boast ofand he kissed her again  finding that although for the present they were supplied with a small amount of food hetty had no employment and his mother no money our city arab said that he would undertake to sustain the family  but oh  bobby dear dont steal again  no hetty i wont ill vork  i didnt go for to do it apurpose but i was overtook someowi seed the umbrellar standin handy you know andetceterer  but im sorry i did it an i wont do it again  swelling with great intentions robert frog thrust his dirty little hands into his trouser pocketsat least into the holes that once contained themand went out whistling  soon he came to a large warehouse where a portly gentleman stood at the door  planting himself in front of this man and ceasing to whistle in order that he might speak he said  was you in want of a and sir  no i wasnt replied the man with a glance of contempt  sorry for that returned bobby cause im in want of a sitivation  what can you do asked the man  oh hanythink  ah i thought so i dont want hands who can do anything i prefer those who can do something  bobby frog resumed his whistling at the exact bar where he had left off and went on his way  he was used to rebuffs and didnt mind them but when he had spent all the forenoon in receiving rebuffs had made no progress whatever in his efforts and began to feel hungry he ceased the whistling and became grave  this looks serious he said pausing in front of a pastrycooks shop window  but for that there plate glass wot a blow hout i might ave beggin might be tried with advantage  its agin the law no doubt but it aint a sin  yes ill try beggin  but our arab was not a natural beggar if we may say so  he scorned to whine and did not even like to ask  his spirit was much more like that of a highwayman than a beggar  proceeding to a quiet neighbourhood which seemed to have been forgotten by the police he turned down a narrow lane and looked out for a subject as a privateer might search among narrows for a prize  he did not search long  an old lady soon hove in sight  she seemed a suitable old lady welldressed little gentle whitehaired a tottering gait and a benign aspect  bobby went straight up and planted himself in front of her  please maam will you oblige me with a copper  the poor old lady grew pale  without a word she tremblingly yet quickly pulled out her purse took therefrom a shilling and offered it to the boy  oh marm said bobby who was alarmed and consciencesmitten at the result of his scheme i didnt mean for to frighten you  indeed i didnt an i wont ave your money at no price  saying which he turned abruptly round and walked away  boy boy boy called the old lady in a voice so entreating though tremulous that bobby felt constrained to return  youre a most remarkable boy she said putting the shilling back into her purse  im sorry to say marm that youre not the ony indiwidooal as olds that opinion  what do you mean by your conduct boy  i mean marm that im wery ard up  uncommon ard up that ive tried to git vork an cant git it so that im redooced to beggary but i aint a ighway robber marm by no means an dont want to frighten you hout o your money if you aint willin to give it  the little tremulous old lady was so pleased with this reply that she took halfacrown out of her purse and put it into the boys hand  he looked at her in silent surprise  it aint a copper marm  i know that  it is halfacrown and i willingly give it you because you are an honest boy  but marm said bobby still holding out the piece of silver on his palm i aint a honest boy  im a thief  tut tut dont talk nonsense i dont believe you  vel now this beats all that i ever did come across  eres a old ooman as i tells as plain as mud that im a thief an nobodys better able to give a opinion on that pint than myself yet she wont believe it  no i wont said the old lady with a little nod and a smile so put the money in your pocket for youre an honest boy  vell its pleasant to ear that anyow returned bobby placing the silver coin in a vest pocket which was always kept in repair for coins of smaller value  where do you live boy  i should like to come and see you  my residence marm aint a mansion in the vestend  no nor yet a willa in the subarbs  im afeard marm that i live in a district that aint quite suitable for the likes of you to wisit  but  here bobby paused for at the moment his little friend tim lumpy recurred to his memory and a bright thought struck him  well boy why do you pause  i was ony thinkin marm that if you wants to befriend us poor boys they calls us waifs an strays an all sorts of unpurlite namesyouve ony got to send a sov or two to miss annie macpherson ome of hindustry commercial street spitalfields an youll be the means o doin a world o goodas i eard a old genlm with a white choker on say the wery last time i was down there avin a blow out o bread an soup  i know the lady and the institution well my boy said the old lady and will act on your advice but  ere she finished the sentence bobby frog had turned and fled at the very top of his speed  stop stop stop exclaimed the old lady in a weakly shout  but the remarkable boy would neither stop nor stay  he had suddenly caught sight of a policeman turning into the lane and forthwith took to his heels under a vague and not unnatural impression that if that limb of the law found him in possession of a halfcrown he would refuse to believe his innocence with as much obstinacy as the little old lady had refused to believe his guilt  on reaching home he found his mother alone in a state of amused agitation which suggested to his mind the idea of old tom  wot bin at it again mother  no no bobby but somethins happened which amuses me much an i cant keep it to myself no longer so ill tell it to you bobby  fire away then mother an remember that the law dont compel no one to criminate hisself  you know bob that a good while ago our matty disappeared  i saw that the dear child was dyin for want o food an warmth an fresh air so i thinks to myself why shouldnt i put er out to board wi rich people for nothink  a wery correct notion an cleverer than i gave you credit for  im glad to ear it too for i feared sometimes that youd bin an done it  oh  bobby how could you ever think that  well i put the baby out to board with a family of the name of twitter  now it seems all unbeknown to me mrs twitter is a great helper at the george yard ragged schools where our hetty has often seen her but as weve bin used never to speak about the work there as your father didnt like it of course i knowd nothin about mrs twitter bein given to goin there  well it seems shes very free with her money and gives a good deal away to poor people  shes not the only one thought the boy so what does the biblenurse do when she hears about poor hettys illness but goes off and asks mrs twitter to try an git her a situation  oh  i know hetty says mrs twitter at once that nice girl that teaches one o the sundayschool classes  send her to me  i want a nurse for our baby thats for matty bob  what our baby exclaimed the boy with a sudden blaze of excitement  yesour baby  she calls it hers  well now said bobby after recovering from the fit of laughter and thighslapping into which this news had thrown him if this dont beat cockfightin all to nuffin why mother hettyll know baby the moment she claps eyes on it  of course she will said mrs frog it is really very awkward an i cant think what to do  im half afraid to tell hetty  oh dont tell herdont tell her cried the boy whose eyes sparkled with mischievous glee  itll be sich fun  if i ad ony the chance to stand beind a door an see the meetin i wouldnt exchange itno not for a feed of pork sassengers an suet pudn  i must go an tell this to tim lumpy  itll bust imthats my ony fear but i must tell im wotever be the consikences  with this stern resolve to act regardless of results bob frog went off in search of his little friend whose departure for canada had been delayed from some unknown cause much to bobs satisfaction  he found tim on his way to the beehive and was induced not only to go with him but to decide finally to enter the institution as a candidate for canada  being wellknown both as to person and circumstances he was accepted at once taken in washed cropped and transformed as if by magic    chapter sixteen  sir richard visits the beehive and sees many surprising things  my dear mrs loper said mrs twitter over a cup of tea it is very kind of you to say so and i really do think you are right we have done full justice to our dear wee mita  who would ever have thought remembering the thin starved sickly child she was the night that sam brought her in that she would come to be such a plump rosy lovely child  i declare to you that i feel as if she were one of my own  she is indeed a very lovely infant returned mrs loper  dont you think so mrs larrabel  the smiling lady expanded her mouth and said very  but continued mrs twitter i really find that the entire care of her is too much for me for although dear mary assists me her studies require to be attended to and do you know babies interfere with studies dreadfully  not that i have time to do much in that way at present  i think the bible is the only book i really study now so you see ive been thinking of adding to our establishment by getting a new servanta sort of nursery governess you knowa cheap one of course  sam quite agrees with me and as it happens i know a very nice little girl just nowa very very poor girlwho helps us so nicely on sundays in george yard and has been recommended to me as a most deserving creature  i expect her to call tonight  be cautious mrs twitter said mrs loper  these very poor girls from the slums of whitechapel are sometimes dangerous and excuse me rather dirty  of course if you know her that is some security but i would advise you to be very cautious  thank you my dear said mrs twitter i usually am very cautious and will try to be so on this occasion  i mean her to be rather a sort of nursery governess than a servantthat is probably the girl  she referred to a rather timid knock at the front door  in another second the domestic announced hetty frog who entered with a somewhat shy air and seemed fluttered at meeting with unexpected company  come in hetty my dear im glad to see you  my friends here know that you are a helper in our sundayschools  sit down and have a cup of tea  you know why i have sent for you  yes mrs twitter  itit is very kind  our biblenurse told me and i shall be so happy to come becausebut i fear i have interrupted you ii can easily come back  no interruption at all my dear  here take this cup of tea  and a crumpet added mrs larrabel who sympathised with the spirit of hospitality  yes take a crumpet and let me hear about your last place  poor hetty who was still very weak from her recent illness and would gladly have been excused sitting down with two strangers felt constrained to comply and was soon put at her ease by the kindly tone and manner of the hostess  she ran quickly over the chief points of her late engagements and roused without meaning to do so the indignation of the ladies by the bare mention of the wages she had received for the amount of work done  well my dear said the homely mrs twitter we wont be so hard on you here  i want you to assist me with my sewing and darningof which i have a very great dealand help to take care of baby  very well maam said hetty when do you wish me to begin my duties  oh tomorrowafter breakfast will do  it is too late tonight  but before you go i may as well let you see the little one you are to have charge of  i hear she is awake  there could be no doubt upon that point for the very rafters of the house were ringing at the moment with the yells which issued from an adjoining room  come this way hetty  mrs loper and mrs larrabel having formed a good opinion of the girl looked on with approving smiles  the smiles changed to glances of surprise however when hetty having looked on the baby uttered a most startling scream while her eyes glared as though she saw a ghostly apparition  seizing the baby with unceremonious familiarity hetty struck mrs twitter dumb by turning it on its face pulling open its dress glancing at a bright red spot on its back and uttering a shriek of delight as she turned it round again and hugged it with violent affection exclaiming oh my blessed matty  the childs name is not matty it is mita said mrs twitter on recovering her breath  what do you mean girl  her name is not mita it is matty returned hetty with a flatness of contradiction that seemed impossible in one so naturally gentle  mrs twitter stood aghastbereft of the power of speech or motion mrs loper and mrs larrabel were similarly affected  they soon recovered however and exclaimed in chorus what can she mean  forgive me maam said hetty still holding on to baby who seemed to have an idea that she was creating a sensation of some sort without requiring to yell forgive my rudeness maam but i really couldnt help it for this is my longlost sister matilda  sister matilda echoed mrs loper  longlost sister matilda repeated mrs larrabel  thisisyourlonglost sister matilda rehearsed mrs twitter like one in a dream  the situation was rendered still more complex by the sudden entrance of mr twitter and his friend crackaby  whatwhatwhats to do now mariar  sister matilda shouted all three with a gasp  lunatics every one of em murmured crackaby  it is perhaps scarcely necessary to add that a full explanation ensued when the party became calmer that mrs twitter could not doubt the veracity of hetty frog but suspected her sanity that mrs frog was sent for and was recognised at once by mr twitter as the poor woman who had asked him such wild and unmeaning questions the night on which he had found the baby and that mr and mrs twitter mrs loper mrs larrabel and crackaby came to the unanimous conclusion that they had never heard of such a thing before in the whole course of their united liveswhich lives when united as some statisticians would take a pride in recording formed two hundred and fortythree years  poor mrs twitter was as inconsolable at the loss of her baby as mrs frog was overjoyed at the recovery of hers  she therefore besought the latter to leave little mita alias matty with her just for one night longer only one nightand then she might come for her in the morning for you know it would have been cruel to remove the child from her warm crib at that hour to a cold and comfortless lodging  of course mrs frog readily consented  if mrs frog had known the events that lay in the womb of the next few hours she would sooner have consented to have had her righthand cut off than have agreed to that most reasonable request  but we must not anticipate  a few of our dramatis personae took both an active and an inactive part in the events of these hours  it is therefore imperative that we should indicate how some of them came to be in that region  about five of the clock in the afternoon of the day in question sir richard brandon his daughter and idol diana and his young friend stephen welland sat in the diningroom of the westend mansion concluding an early and rather hasty dinner  that something was pending was indicated by the fact that little di sat accoutred in her hat and cloak  we shall have to make haste said sir richard rising for i should not like to be late and it is a long drive to whitechapel  when do they begin asked welland  they have tea at six i believe and then the meeting commences at seven but i wish to be early that i may have a short conversation with one of the ladies of the home  oh it will be so nice and such fun to see the dear little boys  how many are going to start for canada tonight papa  about fifty or sixty i believe but im not sure  they are sent off in batches of varying size from time to time  is the demand for them so great asked welland i should have thought that canadian farmers and others would be afraid to receive into their dwellings what is often described as the scum of the london streets  they were afraid at first i am told but soon discovered that the little fellows who came from miss macphersons home had been subjected to such good training and influences before leaving that they almost invariably turned out valuable and trustworthy workmen  no doubt there are exceptions in this as in every other case but the demand is it seems greater than the supply  it is however a false idea that little waifs and strays however dirty or neglected are in any sense the scum of london  youth in all circumstances is cream and only turns into scum when allowed to stagnate or run to waste  come now let us be off  mr seaward the city missionary is to meet us after the meeting and show you and me something of those who have fallen very low in the social scale  brisbane who is also to be at the meeting will bring di home  by the way have you heard anything yet about that poor comrade and fellowclerk of yourstwitter i think was his name who disappeared so suddenly  nothing whatever  i have made inquiries in all directionsfor i had a great liking for the poor fellow  i went also to see his parents but they seemed too much cut up to talk on the subject at all and knew nothing of his whereabouts  ah it is a very sad casevery said sir richard as they all descended to the street  we might perhaps call at their house tonight in passing  entering a cab they drove away  from the foregoing conversation the reader will have gathered that the party were about to visit the beehive or home of industry and that sir richard through the instrumentality of little di and the city missionary had actually begun to think about the poor  it was a special night at the beehive  a number of diamonds with some of their dust rubbed offnamely a band of little boys rescued from the streets and from a probable life of crime were to be assembled there to say farewell to such friends as took an interest in them  the hive had been a huge warehouse  it was now converted with but slight structural alteration into a great centre of light in that morally dark region from which emanated gospel truth and christian influence and in which was a refuge for the poor the destitute the sinsmitten and the sorrowful  not only poverty but sininrags was sure of help in the beehive  it had been set agoing to bring not the righteous but sinners to repentance  when sir richard arrived he found a large though lowroofed room crowded with people many of whom to judge from their appearance were like himself diamondseekers from the westend while others were obviously from the eastend and had the appearance of men and women who had been but recently unearthed  there were also city missionaries and other workers for god in that humblelooking hall  among them sat mr john seaward and george brisbane esquire  placing di and welland near the latter sir richard retired to a corner where one of the ladies of the establishment was distributing tea to all comers  where are your boys may i ask said the knight accepting a cup of tea  over in the left corner answered the lady  you can hardly see them for the crowd but they will stand presently  at that moment as if to justify her words a large body of boys rose up at a sign from the superintending genius of the place and began to sing a beautiful hymn in soft tuneful voices  it was a goodly array of dusty diamonds and a few of them had already begun to shine  surely said sir richard in a low voice these cannot be the ragged dirty little fellows you pick up in the streets  indeed they are returned the lady  butbut they seem to me quite respectable and cleanly fellows not at all likewhy how has the change been accomplished  by the united action sir of soap and water needles and thread scissors castoff garments and love  sir richard smiled  perchance the reader may also smile nevertheless this statement embodied probably the whole truth  when an unkempt dirty ragged little savage presents himself or is presented at the refuge or is picked up in the streets his case is promptly and carefully inquired into  if he seems a suitable characterthat is one who is utterly friendless and parentless or whose parents are worse than dead to himhe is received into the home and the work of transformationboth of body and soulcommences  first he is taken to the lavatory and scrubbed outwardly clean  his elfin locks are cropped close and cleansed  his rags are burned and a new suit made by the old women workers is put upon him after which perhaps he is fed  then he is sent to a doctor to see that he is internally sound in wind and limb  if passed by the doctor he receives a brief but important training in the rudiments of knowledge  in all of these various processes love is the guiding principle of the operator love to god and love to the boy  he is made to understand and to feel that it is in the name of jesus for the love of jesus and in the spirit of jesusnot of mere philanthropythat all this is done and that his body is cared for chiefly in order that the soul may be won  little wonder then that a boy or girl whose past experience has been the tender mercies of the worldand that the roughest part of the worldshould become somewhat respectable as sir richard put it under such new and blessed influences  suddenly a tiny shriek was heard in the midst of the crowd and a sweet little voice exclaimed as if its owner were in great surprise  oh oh there is my boy  a hearty laugh from the audience greeted this outburst and poor di shrinking down tried to hide her pretty face on wellands ready arm her remark was quickly forgotten in the proceedings that followedbut it was true  there stood in the midst of the group of boys little bobby frog with his face washed his hair cropped and shining his garments untattered and himself looking as meek and respectable as the best of them beside him stood his fast friend tim lumpy  bobby was not however one of the emigrant band  having joined only that very evening and been cropped washed and clothed for the first time he was there merely as a privileged guest  tim also was only a guest not having quite attained to the dignity of a fullfledged emigrant at that time  at the sound of the sweet little voice bobby frogs meek look was replaced by one of bright intelligence not unmingled with anxiety as he tried unavailingly to see the child who had spoken  we do not propose to give the proceedings of this meeting in detail interesting though they were  other matters of importance claim our attention  it will be sufficient to say that mingled with the semiconversational pleasantly freeandeasy intercourse that ensued there were most interesting short addresses from the ladysuperintendents of the sailors welcome home and of the strangers rest both of ratcliff highway also from the chief of the ragged schools in george yard and several city missionaries as well as from city merchants who found time and inclination to traffic in the good things of the life to come as well as in those of the life that now is  before the proceedings had drawn to a close a voice whispered  it is time to go sir richard  it was the voice of john seaward  following him sir richard and welland went out  it had grown dark by that time and as there were no brilliantly lighted shops near the place seemed gloomy but the gloom was nothing to that of the filthy labyrinths into which seaward quickly conducted his followers  you have no occasion to fear sir said the missionary observing that sir richard hesitated at the mouth of one very dark alley  it would indeed hardly be safe were you to come down here alone but most of em know me  i remember being told by one of the greatest roughs i ever knew that at the very corner where we now stand he had many and many a time knocked down and robbed people  that man is now an earnest christian and like paul goes about preaching the name which he once despised  at the moment a dark shadow seemed to pass them and a gruff voice said goodnight sir  was that the man you were speaking of asked sir richard quickly  oh no sir replied seaward with a laugh thats what he was once like indeed but not what he is like now  his voice is no longer gruff  take care of the step gentlemen as you pass here so now we will go into this lodging  it is one of the common lodginghouses of london which are regulated by law and under the supervision of the police  each man pays fourpence a night here for which he is entitled to a bed and the use of the kitchen and its fire to warm himself and cook his food  if he goes to the same lodging every night for a week he becomes entitled to a free night on sundays  the room into which they now entered was a long low chamber which evidently traversed the whole width of the building for it turned at a right angle at the inner end and extended along the back to some extent  it was divided along one side into boxes or squares after the fashion of some eatinghouses with a small table in the centre of each box but the partitions being little higher than those of a churchpew the view of the whole room was unobstructed  at the inner angle of the room blazed a coalfire so large that a sheep might have been easily roasted whole at it  gas jets fixed along the walls at intervals gave a sufficient light to the place  this was the kitchen of the lodginghouse and formed the sittingroom of the place and here was assembled perhaps the most degraded and miserable set of men that the world can produce  they were not all of one class by any means nor were they all criminal though certainly many of them were  the place was the last refuge of the destitute the social sink into which all that is improvident foolish reckless thriftless or criminal finally descends  sir richard and welland had put on their oldest greatcoats and shabbiest wideawakes they had also put off their gloves and rings and breastpins in order to attract as little attention as possible but nothing that they could have done could have reduced their habiliments to anything like the garments of the poor creatures with whom they now mingled  if they had worn the same garments for months or years without washing them and had often slept in them out of doors in dirty places they might perhaps have brought them to the same level but not otherwise  some of the people however were noisy enough  many of them were smoking and the coarser sort swore and talked loud  those who had once been in better circumstances sat and moped or spoke in lower tones or cooked their victuals with indifference to all else around or ate them in abstracted silence while not a few laid their heads and arms on the tables and apparently slept  for sleeping in earnest there were rooms overhead containing many narrow beds with scant and coarse covering which however the law compelled to be clean  one of the rooms contained seventy such beds  little notice was taken of the westend visitors as they passed up the room though some dark scowls of hatred were cast after them and a few glanced at them with indifference  it was otherwise in regard to seaward  he received many a goodnight sir as he passed and a kindly nod greeted him here and there from men who at first looked as if kindness had been utterly eradicated from their systems  one of those whom we have described as resting their heads and arms on the tables looked hastily up on hearing the visitors voices with an expression of mingled surprise and alarm  it was sammy twitter with hands and visage filthy hair dishevelled eyes bloodshot cheeks hollow and garments beyond description disreputable  he seemed the very embodiment of woe and degradation  on seeing his old friend welland he quickly laid his head down again and remained motionless  welland had not observed him  you would scarcely believe it sir said the missionary in a low tone nearly all classes of society are occasionally represented here you will sometimes find merchants lawyers doctors military men and even clergymen who have fallen step by step chiefly in consequence of that subtle demon drink until the common lodginghouse is their only home  heaven help me said sir richard my friend brisbane has often told me of this but i have never quite believed itcertainly never realised ituntil tonight  and even now i can hardly believe it  i see no one here who seems as if he ever had belonged to the classes you name  do you see the old man in the last box in the room on the lefthand side sitting alone asked seaward turning his back to the spot indicated  yes  well that is a clergyman  i know him well  you would never guess it from his wretched clothing but you might readily believe it if you were to speak to him  that i will not do returned the other firmly  you are right sir said seaward i would not advise that you shouldat least not here or now  i have been in the habit of reading a verse or two of the word and giving them a short address sometimes about this hour  have you any objection to my doing so now  it wont detain us long  none in the world pray my good sir dont let me disarrange your plans  perhaps added the missionary you would say a few words to  no no interrupted the other quickly no they are preaching to me just now mr seaward a very powerful sermon i assure you  during the foregoing conversation young wellands thoughts had been very busy ay and his conscience had not been idle for when mention was made of that great curse strong drink he vividly recalled the day when he had laughed at sam twitters blue ribbon and felt uneasy as to how far his conduct on that occasion had helped sam in his downward career  my friends said the missionary aloud we will sing a hymn  some of those whom he addressed turned towards the speaker others paid no attention whatever but went on with their cooking and smoking  they were used to it as ordinary churchgoers are to the service  the missionary understood that well but was not discouraged because he knew that his labour in the lord should not be in vain  he pulled out two small hymnbooks and handed one to sir richard the other to welland  sir richard suddenly found himself in what was to him a strange and uncomfortable position called on to take a somewhat prominent part in a religious service in a low lodginghouse  the worst of it was that the poor knight could not sing a note however his deficiency in this respect was more than compensated by john seaward who possessed a telling tuneful voice with a grateful heart to work it  young welland also could sing well and joined heartily in that beautiful hymn which tells of the wonderful words of life  after a brief prayer the missionary preached the comforting gospel and tried with all the fervour of a sympathetic heart to impress on his hearers that there really was hope for the hopeless and rest for the weary in jesus christ  when he had finished stephen welland surprised him as well as his friend sir richard and the audience generally by suddenly exclaiming in a subdued but impressive voice which drew general attention  friends i had no intention of saying a word when i came here but god forgive me i have committed a sin which seems to force me to speak and warn you against giving way to strong drink  i hadnay i havea dear friend who once put on the blue ribbon  here he related the episode at the roadside tavern and his friends terrible fall and wound up with the warning  fellowmen fellowsinners beware of being laughed out of good resolvesbeware of strong drink  i know not where my comrade is now he may be dead but i think not for he has a mother and father who pray for him without ceasing  still better as you have just been told he has an advocate with god who is able and willing to save him to the uttermost  forgive me mr seaward for speaking without being asked i could not help it  no need to ask forgiveness of me mr welland  you have spoken on the lords side and i have reason to thank you heartily  while this was being said those who sat near the door observed that a young man rose softly and slunk away like a criminal with a face ashy pale and his head bowed down  on reaching the door he rushed out like one who expected to be pursued  it was young sam twitter  few of the inmates of the place observed him none cared a straw for him and the incident was no doubt quickly forgotten  we must hasten now if we are to visit another lodginghouse said seaward as they emerged into the comparatively fresh air of the street for it grows late and riotous drunken characters are apt to be met with as they stagger home  no i have had enough for one night said sir richard  i shall not be able to digest it all in a hurry  ill go home by the metropolitan if you will conduct me to the nearest station  come along then  this way  they had not gone far and were passing through a quiet side street when they observed a poor woman sitting on a doorstep  it was mrs frog who had returned to sit on the old familiar spot and watch the shadows on the blind either from the mere force of habit or because this would probably be the last occasion on which she could expect to enjoy that treat  a feeling of pity entered sir richards soul as he looked on the poorly clothed forlorn creature  he little knew what rejoicing there was in her heart just thenso deceptive are appearances at times  he went towards her with an intention of some sort when a very tall policeman turned the corner and approached  why giles scott exclaimed the knight holding out his hand which giles shook respectfully you seem to be very far away from your beat tonight  no sir not very far for this is my beat now  i have exchanged into the city for reasons that i need not mention  at this point a belated and halftipsy man passed with his donkeycart full of unsold vegetables and rubbish  hallo you big bluecoatboy he cried politely to giles wot dye call that  giles had caught sight of that at the same moment and darted across the street  why its fire he shouted  run young fellow you know the firestation  i know it shouted the donkeyman sobered in an instant as he jumped off his cart left it standing dashed round the corner and disappeared while number 666 beat a thundering tattoo on samuel twitters front door    chapter seventeen  things become too hot for the twitter family  before the thunder of giles scotts first rap had ceased a pane of glass in one of the lower windows burst and out came dense volumes of smoke with a red tongue or two piercing them here and there showing that the fire had been smouldering long and had got well alight  it was followed by an appalling shriek from mrs frog who rushed forward shouting oh baby baby  hold her sir said giles to young welland who sprang forward at the same moment  welland was aware of the immense value of prompt obedience and saw that giles was well fitted to command  he seized mrs frog and held her fast while giles knowing that there was no time to stand on ceremony stepped a few paces back ran at the door with all his might and applied his foot with his great weight and momentum to it  as the oak is shattered by the thunderbolt so was samuel twitters door by the foot of number 666  but the bold constable was met by a volume of black smoke which was too much even for him  it drove him back half suffocated while at the same time it drove the domestic out of the house into his arms  she had rushed from the lower regions just in time to escape death  a single minute had not yet elapsed and only halfadozen persons had assembled with two or three policemen who instantly sought to obtain an entrance by a back door  hold her sir richard said welland handing the struggling mrs frog over  the knight accepted the charge while welland ran to the burning house which seemed to be made of tinder it blazed up so quickly  giles was making desperate efforts to enter by a window which vomited fire and smoke that defied him  an upper window was thrown open and samuel twitter appeared in his nightdress shouting frantically  stephen welland saw that entrance or egress by lower window or staircase was impossible  he had been a noted athlete at school  there was an iron spout which ran from the street to the roof  he rushed to that and sprang up more like a monkey than a man  pitch over blankets roared giles as the youth gained a window of the first floor and dashed it in  the donkeycart shouted welland in reply and disappeared  giles was quick to understand  he draggedalmost liftedthe donkey and cart on to the pavement under the window where mr twitter stood waving his hands and yelling  the poor man had evidently lost his reason for the time and was fit for nothing  a hand was seen to grasp his neck behind and he disappeared  at the same moment a blanket came fluttering down and welland stood on the windowsill with mrs twitter in his arms and a sheet of flame following  the height was about thirty feet  the youth steadied himself for one moment as if to take aim and dropped mrs twitter as he might have dropped a bundle  she not only went into the vegetable cart with a bursting shriek but right through it and reached the pavement unhurtthough terribly shaken  four minutes had not yet elapsed  the crowd had thickened and a dull rumbling which had been audible for half a minute increased into a mighty roar as the fieryred engine with its brasshelmeted heroes dashed round the corner and pulled up with a crash seeming to shoot the men off  these swarmed for a few seconds about the hose water plug and nozzles  at the same instant the great fireescape came rushing on the scene like some antediluvian monster but by that time giles had swept away the debris of the donkeycart with mrs twitter imbedded therein and had stretched the blanket with five powerful volunteers to hold it  jump sir jump he cried  samuel twitter jumpedunavoidably for welland pushed himjust as the hiss and crackle of the waterspouts began  he came down in a heap rebounded like indiarubber and was hurled to one side in time to make way for one of his young flock  the children the children screamed mrs twitter disengaging herself from the vegetables  where are they asked a brasshelmeted man quietly as the head of the escape went crashing through an upper window  the top floor all of em theretop flooor  nonooo some on the second flooor yelled mr twitter  i say topfloooor repeated the wife  you forgetbabybaiby roared the husband  a wild shriek was mrs twitters reply  the quiet man with the brass helmet had run up the escape quite regardless of these explanations  at the same time top windows were opened up and little nightdressed figures appeared at them all apparently making faces for their cries were drowned in the shouts below  from these upper windows smoke was issuing but not yet in dense suffocating volumes  the quiet man of the escape entered a second floor window through smoke and flames as though he were a salamander  the crowd below gave him a lusty cheer for it was a great surging crowd by that time nevertheless it surged within bounds for a powerful body of police kept it back leaving free space for the firemen to work  a moment or two after the quiet fireman had entered the nightdressed little ones disappeared from the other windows and congregated as if by magic at the window just above the head of the escape  almost simultaneously the flyladder of the escapeused for upper windowswas swung out and when the quiet fireman had got out on the windowsill with little lucy in his arms and little alice held by her dress in his teeth its upper rounds touched his knees as if with a kiss of recognition  he descended the flyladder and shoved the two terrified little ones somewhat promptly into the canvas shoot where a brother fireman was ready to pilot them together xxx to the ground  molly being big had to be carried by herself but willie and fred went together  during all this time poor mrs frog had given herself over to the one idea of screaming baby baieby and struggling to get free from the two policemen who had come to the relief of sir richard and who tenderly restrained her  in like manner mr and mrs twitter although not absolutely in need of restraint went about wringing their hands and making such confused and contradictory statements that no one could understand what they meant and the firemen quietly went on with their work quite regardless of their existence  policeman said sam twitter looking up in the face of number 666 with a piteous expression and almost weeping with vexation nobody will listen to me  i would go up myself but the firemen wont let me and my dear wife has such an idea of sticking to truth that when they ask her is your baby up there she yells no not our baby and before she can explain she gasps and then i try to explain and that so bamboozles  is your baby there demanded number 666 vehemently  yes it is cried twitter without the slightest twinge of conscience  what room  that one pointing to the left side of the house on the first floor  just then part of the roof gave way and fell into the furnace of flame below leaving visible the door of the very room to which twitter had pointed  a despairing groan escaped him as he saw it for now all communication seemed cut off and the men were about to pull the escape away to prevent its being burned while more engines having arrived something like a mountain torrent of water was descending on the devoted house  stop lads a moment said giles springing upon the escape  he might have explained to the firemen what he had learned but that would have taken time and every second just then was of the utmost value  he was up on the windowsill before they well understood what he meant to do  the heat was intolerable  a very lake of fire rolled beneath him  the door of the room pointed out by twitter was oppositefortunately on the side furthest from the centre of fire but the floor was gone  only two great beams remained and the one giles had to cross was more than half burned through  it was a fragile bridge on which to pass over an abyss so terrible  but heroes do not pause to calculate  giles walked straight across it with the steadiness of a ropedancer and burst in the scarred and splitting door  the smoke here was not too dense to prevent his seeing  one glance revealed baby frog lying calmly in her crib as if asleep  to seize her wrap her in the blankets and carry her to the door of the room was the work of a moment but the awful abyss now lay before him and it seemed to have been heated seven times  the beam too was by that time rekindling with the increased heat and the burden he carried prevented giles from seeing and balancing himself so well  he did not hesitate but he advanced slowly and with caution  a dead silence fell on the awestricken crowd whose gaze was concentrated now on the one figure  the throbbing of the engines was heard distinctly when the roar of excitement was thus temporarily checked  as giles moved along the beam cracked under his great weight  the heat became almost insupportable  his boots seemed to shrivel up and tighten round his feet  hes gone  no hes not gasped some of the crowd as the tall smoke and flame encompassed him and he was seen for a moment to waver  it was a touch of giddiness but by a violent impulse of the will he threw it off and at the same time bounded to the window sending the beam which was broken off by the shock hissing down into the lake of fire  the danger was past and a loud continuous enthusiastic cheer greeted gallant number 666 as he descended the chute with the baby in his arms and delivered it alive and well and more solemn than ever to its motherits own mother  when sir richard brandon returned home that night he found it uncommonly difficult to sleep  when after many unsuccessful efforts he did manage to slumber his dreams reproduced the visions of his waking hours with many surprising distortions and mixingsone of which distortions was that all the paupers in the common lodginghouses had suddenly become rich while he sir richard had as suddenly become poor and a beggar in filthy rags with nobody to care for him and that these enriched beggars came round him and asked him in quite a facetious way how he liked it  next morning when the worthy knight arose he found his unrested brain still busy with the same theme  he also found that he had got food for meditation and for discussion with little di not only for some time to come but for the remainder of his hours    chapter eighteen  the ocean and the new world  doctors tell us that change of air is usually beneficial often necessary nearly always agreeable  relying on the wisdom of this opinion we propose now to give the reader who has followed us thus far a change of airby shifting the scene to the bosom of the broad atlanticand thus blow away the cobwebs and dust of the city  those who have not yet been out upon the great ocean cannot conceive and those who have been out on it may not have seenthe splendours of a luminous fog on a glorious summer morning  the prevailing ideas in such circumstances are peace and liquidity the only solid object visible above below or around being the ship on which you stand  everything else is impalpable floating soft and of a light bright silvery grey  the air is warm the sea is glass it is circular too like a disc and the line where it meets with the sky is imperceptible your little bark is the centre of a great crystal ball the limit of which is immensity  as we have said peace liquidity luminosity softness and warmth prevail everywhere and the fog or rather the silvery hazefor it is dry and warm as well as brighthas the peculiar effect of deadening sound so that the quiet little noises of shipboard rather help than destroy the idea of that profound tranquillity which suggests irresistibly to the religious mind the higher and sweeter idea of the peace of god  but although intensely still there is no suggestion of death in such a scene  it is only that of slumber for the ocean undulates even when at rest and sails flap gently even when there is no wind  besides this on the particular morning to which we call attention a species of what we may call still life was presented by a mighty iceberga peaked and towering mountain of snowy white and emerald bluewhich floated on the sea not a quarter of a mile off on the starboard bow  real life also was presented to the passengers of the noble bark which formed the centre of this scene in the form of gulls floating like great snowflakes in the air and flocks of active little divers rejoicing unspeakably on the water  the distant cries of these added to the harmony of nature and tended to draw the mind from mere abstract contemplation to positive sympathy with the joys of other animals besides onesself  the only discordant sounds that met the ears of those who voyaged in the bark ocean queen were the cacklings of a creature in the hencoops which had laid an egg or thought it had done so or wished to do so or having been seasick up to that time perhaps endeavoured to revive its spirits by recalling the fact that it once did so and might perhaps do so again  by the way there was also one other discord in the form of a pugnacious baby which whimpered continuously and from some unaccountable cause refused to be comforted  but that was a discord which as in some musical chords seemed rather to improve the harmony at least in its mothers ears  the ocean queen was an emigrant ship  in her capacious hull besides other emigrants there were upwards of seventy diamonds from the beehive in spitalfields on their way to seek their fortunes in the lands that are watered by such grand freshwater seas as lakes superior and huron and michigan and ontario and such rivers as the ottawa and the saint lawrence  robert frog and tim lumpy were among those boys so changed for the better in a few months that as the former remarked their own mothers wouldnt know em and not only improved in appearance but in spirit ay and even to some small extent in languageso great had been the influence for good brought to bear on them by christian women working out of love to god and souls  aint it lovely said tim  splendacious replied bob  the reader will observe that we did not say the language had at that time been much improved only to some small extent  ive seen picturs of em bob said tim leaning his arms on the vessels bulwarks as he gazed on the sleeping sea wen a genlman came to george yard with a magic lantern but i never thought they was so big or that the holes in em was so blue  nor i neither said bob  they referred of course to the iceberg the seams and especially the caverns in which graduated from the lightest azure to the deepest indigo  why i do believe continued bobby as the haze grew a little thinner that theres rivers of water runnin down its sides just like as if it was a mountain o loafsugar wi the firebrigade apumpin on it  an see theres waterfalls too bigger i do blieve than the one i once saw at a pantomime  ay an far prettier too said tim  bobby frog did not quite see his way to assent to that  the waterfalls on the iceberg were bigger he admitted than those in the pantomime but then there was not so much glare and glitter around them  an im fond of glare an glitter he remarked with a glance at his friend  so am i bob but  at that instant the dinnerbell rang and the eyes of both glittered they almost glaredas they turned and made for the companionhatch bob exclaiming ah thats the thing that im fond of glare an glitters all wery well in its way but it cant old a candle to grub  timothy lumpy seemed to have no difference of opinion with his friend on that point  indeed the other sixtyeight boys seemed to be marvellously united in sentiment about it for without an exception they responded to that dinnerbell with a promptitude quite equal to that secured by military discipline  there was a rattling of feet on decks and ladderways for a few seconds and then all was quiet while a blessing was asked on the meal  for many years miss annie macpherson has herself conducted parties of such boys to canada but the party of which we write happened to be in charge of a gentleman whom we will name the guardian he was there to keep order of course but in truth this was not a difficult matter for the affections of the boys had been enlisted and they had already learned to practise selfrestraint  that same day a whale was seen  it produced a sensation among the boys that is not easily described  considerately and as if on purpose it swam round the ship and displayed its gigantic proportions then it spouted as though to show what it could do in that line and then as if to make the performance complete and reduce the westminster aquarium to insignificance it tossed its mighty tail on high brought it down with a clap like thunder and finally dived into its native ocean followed by a yell of joyful surprise from the rescued waifs and strays  there were little boys perhaps even big ones in that band who that day received a lesson of faith from the whale  it taught them that pictures even extravagant ones represent great realities  the whale also taught them a lesson of error as was proved by the remark of one waif to a brother stray  i say piggie it aint ard now to blieve that the whale swallered jonah  youre right konky  strange interlacing of error with error traversed by truth in this sublunary sphere  piggie was wrong in admitting that  konky was right for as every one knows or ought to know it was not a whale at all that swallowed jonah but a great fish which was prepared for the purpose  but the voyage of the ocean queen was not entirely made up of calms and luminous fogs and bergs and whales and food  a volume would be required to describe it all  there was much foul weather as well as fair during which periods a certain proportion of the little flock being not very good sailors sank to depths of misery which they had never before experiencednot even in their tattered daysand even those of them who had got their sealegs on were not absolutely happy  i say piggie asked the waif before mentioned of his chum or dosser konky ow long dee think little mouse will go on at his present rate o heavin  i cant say answered the stray with a serious air i aint studied the uman frame wery much but i should say ell bust by tomorrow if e goes on like es bin doin  a tremendous sound from little mouse who lay in a neighbouring bunk seemed to justify the prophecy  but little mouse did not bust  he survived that storm and got his sealegs on before the next one  the voyage however was on the whole propitious and what with schoollessons and biblelessons and hymnsinging and romping and games of various kinds instituted and engaged in by the guardian the time passed profitably as well as pleasantly so that there were perhaps some feelings of regret when the voyage drew to an end and they came in sight of that great land which the norsemen of old discovered which columbus rediscovering introduced to the civilised world and which we think ought in justice to have been named columbia  and now a new era of life began for those rescued waifs and strays those eastend diamonds from the great london fields  canadawith its mighty lakes and splendid rivers its great forests and rich lands its interesting past prosperous present and hopeful futureopened up to view  but there was a shadow on the prospect not very extensive it is true but dark enough to some of them just then for here the hitherto united band was to be gradually disunited and dispersed and friendships that had begun to ripen under the sunshine of christian influence were to be broken up perhaps for ever  the guardian too had to be left behind by each member as he was severed from his fellows and sent to a new home among total strangers  still there were to set off against these things several points of importance  one of these was that the guardian would not part with a single boy until the character of his wouldbe employer was inquired into and his intention to deal kindly and fairly ascertained  another point was that each boy when handed over to an employer was not to be left thereafter to care for himself but his interests were to be watched over and himself visited at intervals by an emissary from the beehive so that he would not feel friendless or forsaken even though he should have the misfortune to fall into bad hands  the guardian also took care to point out that amid all these leavetakings and partings there was one who would never leave nor forsake them and to whom they were indebted for the first helping hand when they were in their rags and misery and forsaken of man  at last the great gulf of saint lawrence was entered and here the vessel was beset with ice so that she could not advance at a greater rate than two or three miles an hour for a considerable distance  soon however those fields of frozen sea were passed and the end of the voyage drew near  then was there a marvellous outbreak of pens ink and paper for the juvenile flock was smitten with a sudden desire to write home before going to the interior of the new land  it was a sad truth that many of the poor boys had neither parent nor relative to correspond with but these were none the less eager in their literary work for had they not miss macpherson and the ladies of the home to write to  soon after that the party landed at the farfamed city of quebec each boy with his bag containing change of linen and garments a rug etcetera and there under a shed thanks were rendered to god for a happy voyage and prayer offered for future guidance  then the guardian commenced business  he had momentous work to do  the home of industry and its work are wellknown in canada  dusty diamonds sent out from the beehive were by that time appreciated and therefore coveted for the western land is vast and the labourers are comparatively few  people were eager to get the boys but the character of intending employers had to be inquired into and this involved care then the suitability of boys to situations had to be considered however this was finally got over and a few of the reclaimed waifs were left at quebec  this was the beginning of the dispersion  i dont like it at all said bobby frog to his friend tim lumpy that evening in the sleeping car of the railway train that bore them onward to montreal theyll soon be partin you an me an thatll be worse than wallerin in the mud of vitechapel  bobby said this with such an expression of serious anxiety that his little friend was quite touched  i hope not bob he replied  what dee say to axin our guardian to put us both into the same sitivation  bobby thought that this was not a bad idea and as they rolled along these two little waifs gravely discussed their future prospects  it was the same with many others of the band though not a few were content to gaze out of the carriage windows pass a running commentary on the new country and leave their future entirely to their guardian  soon however the busy little tongues and brains ceased to work and ere long were steeped in slumber  at midnight the train stopped and great was the sighing and groaning and earnest were the requests to be let alone for a batch of the boys had to be dropped at a town by the way  at last they were aroused and with their bags on their shoulders prepared to set off under a guide to their various homes  soon the sleepiness wore off and when the train was about to start the reality of the parting seemed to strike home and the final handshakings and good wishes were earnest and hearty  thus little by little the band grew less and less  montreal swallowed up a good many  while there the whole band went out for a walk on the heights above the reservoir with their guardian guided by a young scotsman  thats a jollylookin ouse tim said bob frog to his friend  the scotsman overheard the remark  yes said he it is a nice house and a good jolly man owns it  he began life as a poor boy  and do you see that other villathe white one with the green veranda among the trees  that was built by a man who came out from england just as you have done only without anybody to take care of him god however cared for him and now you see his house he began life without a penny but he had three qualities which will make a man of any boy no matter what circumstances he may be placed in he was truthful thorough and trustworthy  men knew that they might believe what he said be sure of the quality of what he did and could rely upon his promises  there was another thing much in his favour he was a total abstainer  drink in this country ruins hundreds of men and women just as in england  shun drink boys as you would a serpent  i wouldnt shun a drink o water just now if i could get it whispered bobby to his friend for im uncommon thirsty  at this point the whole band were permitted to disperse in the woods where they went about climbing and skipping like wild squirrels for these novel sights and scents and circumstances were overwhelmingly delightful after the dirt and smoke of london  when pretty well breathedour waifs were grown too hardy by that time to be easily exhaustedthe guardian got them to sit round him and sing that sweet hymn  shall we gather at the river  and tears bedewed many eyes for they were reminded that there were yet many partings in store before that gathering should take place  and now the remnant of the bandstill a goodly numberproceeded in the direction of the far west  all night they travelled and reached belleville where they were received joyfully in the large house presented as a free gift to miss macpherson by the council of the county of hastings  it served as a distributing home and centre in canada for the little ones till they could be placed in suitable situations and to it they might be returned if necessary or a change of employer required it  this belleville home was afterwards burned to the ground and rebuilt by sympathising canadian friends  but we may not pause long here  the far west still lies before us  our gradually diminishing band must push on  its the sea exclaimed the boy who had been named little mouse alias robbie dell  no it aint said konky who was a good deal older its a lake  ontario said the guardian one of the noble freshwater seas of canada  onward ever onward is the watchword just nowdropping boys like seedcorn as they go  woods and fields and villas and farms and wastelands and forests and water fly past in endless variety and loveliness  a panoramy without no end exclaimed tim lumpy after one of his long gazes of silent admiration  wot a diffrence murmured bobby frog  wouldnt mother an daddy an hetty like it just  the city of toronto came in sight  the wise arrangements for washing in canadian railwaycars had been well used by the boys and pocketcombs also  they looked clean and neat and wonderfully solemn as they landed at the station  but their fame had preceded them  an earnest crowd came to see the boys among whom were some eager to appropriate  ill take that lad said one bluff farmer stepping forward and pointing to a boy whose face had taken his fancy  and i want six boys for our village said another  i want one to learn my business said a third and ill learn him as my own son  here are my certificates of character from my clergyman and the mayor of the place i belong to  i like the looks of that little fellow said another pointing to bob frog and should like to have him  does you my tulip said bobby whose natural tendency to insolence had not yet been subdued an dont you vish you may get im  it is but justice to bobby however to add that this remark was made entirely to himself  to all these flattering offers the guardian turned a deaf ear until he had passed through the crowd and marshalled his boys in an empty room of the depot  then inquiries were made the boys characters and capacities explained suitability on both sides considered the needs of the soul as well as the body referred to and pressed and finally the party went on its way greatly reduced in numbers  thus they dwindled and travelled westward until only our friend bobby tim konky and little mouse remained with the guardian whose affections seemed to intensify as fewer numbers were left on which they might concentrate  soon the little mouse was caught  a huge backwoods farmer who could have almost put him in his coatpocket took a fancy to him  the fancy seemed to be mutual for after a tearful farewell to the guardian the mouse went off with the backwoodsman quite contentedly  then konky was disposed of  a hearty old lady with a pretty daughter and a slim son went away with him in triumph and the band was reduced to two  i do believe whispered bob to tim that hes goin to let us stick together after all  you are right my dear boy said the guardian who overheard the remark  a family living a considerable distance off wishes to have two boys  i have reason to believe that they love the lord jesus and will treat you well  so as i knew you wished to be together i have arranged for your going to live with them  as the journey drew to a close the guardian seemed to concentrate his whole heart on the little waifs whom he had conducted so far and he gave them many words of counsel besides praying with and for them  at last towards evening the train rushed into a grand pinewood  it soon rushed out of it again and entered a beautiful piece of country which was diversified by lakelet and rivulet hill and vale with rich meadow lands in the hollows where cattle browsed or lay in the evening sunshine  the train drew up sharply at a small roadside station  there was no one to get into the cars there and no one to get out except our two waifs  on the road beyond stood a wagon with a couple of spanking bays in it  on the platform stood a broadshouldered deepchested shortlegged farmer with a face like the sun and a wideawake on the back of his bald head  mr merryboy i presume said the guardian descending from the car  the same  glad to see you  are these my boys  he spoke in a quick hearty offhand manner but bobby and tim hated him at once for were they not on the point of leaving their last and best friend and was not this man the cause  they turned to their guardian to say farewell and even to their own surprise burst into tears  god bless you dear boys he said while the guard held open the door of the car as if to suggest haste goodbye  it wont be very long i think before i see you again  farewell  he sprang into the car the train glided away and the two waifs stood looking wistfully after it with the first feelings of desolation that had entered their hearts since landing in canada  my poor lads said mr merryboy laying a hand on the shoulder of each come along with me  home is only six miles off and ive got a pair of spanking horses that will trundle us over in no time  the tone of voice to say nothing of home and spanking horses improved matters greatly  both boys thought as they entered the wagon that they did not hate him quite so much as at first  the bays proved worthy of their masters praise  they went over the road through the forest in grand style and in little more than half an hour landed bobby and tim at the door of their canadian home  it was dark by that time and the ruddy light that shone in the windows and that streamed through the door as it opened to receive them seemed to our waifs like a gleam of celestial light    chapter nineteen  at home in canada  the family of mr merryboy was a small one  besides those who assisted him on the farmand who were in some cases temporary servantshis household consisted of his wife his aged mother a female servant and a small girl  the latter was a diamond from the london diggings who had been imported the year before  she was undergoing the process of being polished and gave promise of soon becoming a very valuable gem it was this that induced her employer to secure our two masculine gems from the same diggings  mrs merryboy was a vigorous hearty ablebodied lady who loved work very much for the mere exercise it afforded her who like her husband was constitutionally kind and whose mind was of that serious type which takes concern with the souls of the people with whom it has to do as well as with their bodies  hence she gave her waif a daily lesson in religious and secular knowledge she reduced work on the sabbathdays to the lowest possible point in the establishment and induced her husband who was a little shy as well as bluff and offhand to institute family worship besides hanging on her walls here and there sweet and striking texts from the word of god  old mrs merryboy the mother must have been a merry girl in her youth for even though at the age of eighty and partially deaf she was extremely fond of a joke practical or otherwise and had her face so seamed with the lines of appreciative humour and her nutcracker mouth so set in a smile of amiable fun and her coalblack eyes so lit up with the fires of unutterable wit that a mere glance at her stirred up your sources of comicality to their depths while a steady gaze usually resulted in a laugh in which she was sure to join with an apparent belief that whatever the joke might be it was uncommonly good  she did not speak much  her looks and smiles rendered speech almost unnecessary  her figure was unusually diminutive  little martha the waif was one of those mild reticent tiny things that one feels a desire to fondle without knowing why  her very small face was always and as bobby remarked awfully grave yet a ready smile must have lurked close at hand somewhere for it could be evoked by the smallest provocation at any time but fled the instant the provoking cause ceased  she seldom laughed but when she did the burst was a hearty one and over immediately  her brown hair was smooth her brown eyes were gentle her red mouth was small and round  obedience was ingrained in her nature  original action seemed never to have entered her imagination  she appeared to have been born with the idea that her sphere in life was to do as she was directed  to resist and fight were to her impossibilities  to be defended and kissed seemed to be her natural perquisites  yet her early life had been calculated to foster other and far different qualities as we shall learn ere long  tim lumpy took to this little creature amazingly  she was so little that by contrast he became quite big and felt so  when in marthas presence he absolutely felt big and like a lion a roaring lion capable of defending her against all comers  bobby was also attracted by her but in a comparatively mild degree  on the morning after their arrival the two boys awoke to find that the windows of their separate little rooms opened upon a magnificent prospect of wood and water and that the partition of their apartment consisting of a single plankwall with sundry knots knocked out they were not only able to converse freely but to peep at each other awkwardlyfacts which they had not observed the night before owing to sleepiness  i say tim said bob you seem to have a jolly place in there  firstrate replied tim an much the same as your own  i had a good squint at you before you awoke  isnt the place splendacious  yes tim it is  ive been lookin about all the mornin for adam an eve but cant see em nowhere  what dee mean  why that weve got into the garden of eden to be sure  oh stoopid returned tim dont you know that they was both banished from eden  so they was  i forgot that  well it dont much matter for theres a prettier girl than eve here  dont you see her  martha i think they called herdown there by the summerouse feedin the hanimals or givin em their names  there you go again you ignorant booby said tim it wasnt eve as gave the beasts their names  it was adam  an wots the difference i should like to know wasnt they both made one flesh  however i think little martha would have named em better if shed bin there  what a funny little thing she is  funny returned tim contemptuously shes a trump  during the conversation both boys had washed and rubbed their faces till they absolutely shone like rosy apples  they also combed and brushed their hair to such an extent that each mass lay quite flat on its little head and bade fair to become solid for the guardians loving counsels had not been forgotten and they had a sensation of wishing to please him even although absent  presently the house which had hitherto been very quiet began suddenly to resound with the barking of a little dog and the noisy voice of a huge man  the former rushed about saying goodmorning as well as it could with tail and tongue to every one including the household cat which resented the familiarity with arched back and demoniacal glare the latter stamped about on the wooden floors and addressed similar salutations right and left in tones that would have suited the commander of an army  there was a sudden stoppage of the hurricane and a pleasant female voice was heard  i say bob thats the missus whispered tim through a knothole  then there came another squall which seemed to drive madly about all the echoes in the corridors above and in the cellars below  again the noise ceased and there came up a sound like a wheezy squeak  i say tim thats the old un whispered bob through the knothole  bob was right for immediately on the wheezy squeak ceasing the hurricane burst forth in reply  yes mother thats just what i shall do  youre always right  i never knew such an old thing for wise suggestions  ill set both boys to milk the cows after breakfast  the sooner they learn the better for our new girl has too much to do in the house to attend to that besides shes either clumsy or nervous for she has twice overturned the milkpail  but after all i dont wonder for that red cow has several times showed a desire to fling a hindleg into the girls face and stick a horn in her gizzard  the boys wont mind that you know  pity that marthas too small for the work but shell growshell grow  yes shell grow franky replied the old lady with as knowing a look as if the richest of jokes had been cracked  the look was of course lost on the boys above and so was the reply because it reached them in the form of a wheezy squeak  oh  i say  did you ever  milk the keows  ony think whispered bob  ay an wont i do it with my mouth open too an learn ow to send the stream upards said tim  their comments were cut short by the breakfastbell at the same time the hurricane again burst forth  hallo ladsboys  youngsters  are you upah here you are goodmorning and as tidy as two pins  thats the way to get along in life  come now sit down  wheres martha  oh here we are  sit beside me little one  the hurricane suddenly fell to a gentle breeze while part of a chapter of the bible and a short prayer were read  then it burst forth again with redoubled fury checked only now and then by the unavoidable stuffing of the venthole  youve slept well dears i hope said mrs merryboy helping each of our waifs to a splendid fried fish  sitting there partially awestricken by the novelty of their surroundings they admitted that they had slept well  get ready for work then said mr merryboy through a rather large mouthful  no time to lose  eateat wellfor theres lots to do  no idlers on brankly farm i can tell you  and we dont let young folk lie abed till breakfasttime every day  we let you rest this morning bob and tim just by way of an extra refresher before beginning  here tuck into the bread and butter little man itll make you grow  more tea susy to his wife  why mother youre eating nothingnothing at all  i declare youll come to live on air at last  the old lady smiled benignly as though rather tickled with that joke and was understood by the boys to protest that she had eaten more than enough though her squeak had not yet become intelligible to them  if you do take to living on air mother said her daughterinlaw we shall have to boil it up with a bit of beef and butter to make it strong  mrs merryboy senior smiled again at this though she had not heard a word of it  obviously she made no pretence of hearing but took it as good on credit for she immediately turned to her son put her hand to her right ear and asked what susy said  in thunderous tones the joke was repeated and the old lady almost went into fits over it insomuch that bob and tim regarded her with a spice of anxiety mingled with their amusement while little martha looked at her in solemn wonder  twelve months experience had done much to increase marthas love for the old lady but it had done nothing to reduce her surprise for martha as yet did not understand a joke  this of itself formed a subject of intense amusement to old mrs merryboy who certainly made the most of circumstances if ever woman did  have some more fish bob said mrs merryboy junior  bob accepted more gratefully  so did tim with alacrity  what sort of a home had you in london tim asked mrs merryboy  well maam i hadnt no home at all  no home at all boy what do you mean  you must have lived somewhere  oh yes maam i always lived somewheres but it wasnt nowheres in partikler  you see id neither father nor mother an though a good old ooman did take me in she couldnt purvide a bed or blankets an her ome was stuffy so i preferred to live in the streets an sleep of a night wen i couldnt pay for a lodgin in empty casks and under wegitable carts in covent garden market or in empty sugar ogsheads  i liked the ogsheads best wen i was ungry an that was most always cause i could sometimes pick a little sugar that was left in the cracks an oles wen they adnt bin cleaned out aready  also i slep under railwayarches and on doorsteps  but sometimes i ad raither disturbed nights cause the coppers wouldnt let a feller sleep in sitch places if they could elp it  who are the coppers asked the good lady of the house who listened in wonder to tims narration  the coppers maam thethepleece  oh the police  yes maam  where in the world did they expect you to sleep asked mrs merryboy with some indignation  thats best known to themselves maam returned tim praps we might ave bin allowed to sleep on the thames if wed ad a mind to or on the hatmosphere but never avin tried it on i cant say  did you lead the same sort of life bob asked the farmer who had by that time appeased his appetite  pretty much so sir replied bobby though i wasnt quite so ard up as tim havin both a father and mother as well as a ome  but they was costly possessions so i was forced to give em up  what you dont mean that you forsook them said mr merryboy with a touch of severity  no sir but father forsook me and the rest of us by gettin into the stone jugwery much agin my earnest advicean mother an sister both thought it was best for me to come out here  the two waifs being thus encouraged came out with their experiences pretty freely and made such a number of surprising revelations that the worthy backwoodsman and his wife were lost in astonishment to the obvious advantage of old mrs merryboy who regarding the varying expressions of face around her as the result of a series of excellent jokes went into a state of chronic laughter of a mild type  have some more bread and butter and tea bob and some more sausage said mrs merryboy under a sudden impulse  bob declined  yes that london streetarab absolutely declined food so did tim lumpy  now my lads are you quite sure said mr merryboy that youve had enough to eat  they both protested with some regret that they had  you couldnt eat another bite if you was to try could you  vell sir said bob with a spice of the old country insolence strong upon him theres no sayin what might be accomplished with a heffort but the consikences you know might be serious  the farmer received this with a thunderous guffaw and bidding the boys follow him went out  he took them round the farm buildings commenting on and explaining everything showed them cattle and horses pigs and poultry barns and stables and then asked them how they thought theyd like to work there  uncommon was bobby frogs prompt reply delivered with emphasis  fust rate was tim lumpys sympathetic sentiment  well then the sooner we begin the better  dyou see that lot of cordwood lying tumbled about in the yard bob  yes sir  you go to work on it then and pile it up against that fence same as you see this one done  an lets see how neatly youll do it  dont hurry  what we want in canada is not so much to see work done quickly as done well  taking tim to another part of the farm he set him to remove a huge heap of stones with a barrow and shovel and leaving them returned to the house  both boys set to work with a will  it was to them the beginning of life they felt that and were the more anxious to do well in consequence  remembering the farmers caution they did not hurry but tim built a cone of stones with the care and artistic exactitude of an architect while bobby piled his billets of wood with as much regard to symmetrical proportion as was possible in the circumstances  about noon they became hungry but hunger was an old foe whom they had been well trained to defy so they worked on utterly regardless of him  thereafter a welcome sound was heardthe dinnerbell  having been told to come in on hearing it they left work at once ran to the pump washed themselves and appeared in the diningroom looking hot but bright and jovial for nothing brightens the human countenance so much by gladdening the heart as the consciousness of having performed duty well  from the first this worthy couple who were childless received the boys into their home as sons and on all occasions treated them as such martha mild her surname was derived from her character had been similarly received and treated  well lads said the farmer as they commenced the mealwhich was a second edition of breakfast tea included but with more meat and vegetableshow did you find the work pretty hardeh  oh no sir nothink of the kind said bobby who was resolved to show a disposition to work like a man and think nothing of it  ah good  ill find you some harder work after dinner  bobby blamed himself for having been so prompt in reply  the end of this month too ill have you both sent to school continued the farmer with a look of hearty goodwill that tim thought would have harmonised better with a promise to give them jamtart and cream  its vacation time just now and the schoolmasters away for a holiday  when he comes back youll have to cultivate mind as well as soil my boys for ive come under an obligation to look after your education and even if i hadnt id do it to satisfy my own conscience  the couleurderose with which bob and tim had begun to invest their future faded perceptibly on hearing this  the viands however were so good that it did not disturb them very much  they ate away heartily and in silence  little martha was not less diligent for she had been busy all the morning in the dairy and kitchen playing rather than working at domestic concerns yet in her play doing much real work and acquiring useful knowledge as well as an appetite  after dinner the farmer rose at once  he was one of those who find it unnecessary either to drink or smoke after meals  indeed strong drink and tobacco were unknown in his house and curiously enough nobody seemed to be a whit the worse for their absence  there were some people indeed who even went the length of asserting that they were all the better for their absence  now for the hard work i promised you boys come along    chapter twenty  occupations at brankly farm  the farmer led our two boys through a deliciously scented pinewood at the rear of his house to a valley which seemed to extend and widen out into a multitude of lesser valleys and clumps of woodland where lakelets and rivulets and waterfalls glittered in the afternoon sun like shields and bands of burnished silver  taking a ball of twine from one of his capacious pockets he gave it to bobby along with a small pocketbook  have you got claspknives he asked  yes sir said both boys at once producing instruments which were very much the worse for wear  very well now here is the work i want you to do for me this afternoon  dyou see the creek down in the hollow yonderabout half a mile off  yes yes sir  well go down there and cut two sticks about ten feet long each tie strings to the small ends of them fix hooks that youll find in that pocketbook to the lines  the creek below the fall is swarming with fish youll find grasshoppers and worms enough for bait if you choose to look for em  go and see what you can do  a reminiscence of ancient times induced bobby frog to say walkeer to himself but he had too much wisdom to say it aloud  he did however venture modestly to remark  i knows nothink about fishin sir  never cotched so much as a eel in  when i give you orders obey them interrupted the farmer in a tone and with a look that sent bobby and tim to the rightabout doublequick they did not even venture to look back until they reached the pool pointed out and when they did look back mr merryboy had disappeared  vell i say began bobby but tim interrupted him with now bob you must git off that abit youve got o puttin vs for doubleus wasnt we told by the genlmn that gave us a partin haddress that wed never git on in the noo world if we didnt mind our ps and qs an here you are as regardless of your vs as if theyd no connection wi the alphabet  pretty cove you are to find fault wi me retorted bob wen youre far wuss wi your haitchesadroppin of em wen you shouldnt ought to an stickin of em in where you oughtnt should to  go along an cut your stick as master told you  the sticks were cut pieces of string were measured off and hooks attached thereto  then grasshoppers were caught impaled and dropped into a pool  the immediate result was almost electrifying to lads who had never caught even a minnow before  bobbys hook had barely sunk when it was seized and run away with so forcibly as to draw a tremendous hi hallo ho  ive got im from the fisher  hoy hurroo responded tim sove i  both boys blazing with excitement held on  the fish bursting apparently with even greater excitement rushed off  hell smash my stick cried bob  the twines sure to go cried tim  hold ooon  this command was addressed to his fish which leaped high out of the pool and went wriggling back with a heavy splash  it did not obey the order but the hook did which came to the same thing  a tenpounder if hes a ounce said tim  you tell that to the horsehi ho stop that will you  but bobbys fish was what himself used to betroublesome to deal with it would not stop that  it kept darting from side to side and leaping out of the water until in one of its bursts it got entangled with tims fish and the boys were obliged to haul them both ashore together  splendid exclaimed bobby as they unhooked two fine trout and laid them on a place of safety at em again  at them they went and soon had two more fish but the disturbance created by these had the effect of frightening the others  at all events at their third effort their patience was severely tried for nothing came to their hooks to reward the intense gaze and the nervous readiness to act which marked each boy during the next halfhour or so  at the end of that time there came a change in their favour for little martha mild appeared on the scene  she had been sent she said to work with them  to play with us you mean suggested tim  no father said work the child returned simply  its jolly work then  but i say old ooman dyou call mr merryboy father asked bob in surprise  yes ive called him father ever since i came  an whos your real father  i have none  never had one  an your mother  never had a mother either  well you air a curiosity  hallo  bob dont forget your purliteness said tim  come mumpy father calls you mumpy doesnt he  yes  then so will i  well mumpy as i was goin to say you may come an work with my rod if you like an well make a game of it  well play at work  let me see where shall we be  in the garden of eden suggested bob  the very thing said tim ill be adam an youll be eve mumpy  very well said martha with ready assent  she would have assented quite as readily to have personated jezebel or the witch of endor  and ill be cain said bobby moving his line in a manner that was meant to be persuasive  oh said martha with much diffidence cain was wicked wasnt he  well my dear eve said tim bobby frog is wicked enough for halfadozen cains  in fact you cant cane him enough to pay him off for all his wickedness  bah go to bed said cain still intent on his line which seemed to quiver as if with a nibble  as for eve being as innocent of punappreciation as her great original probably was she looked at the two boys in pleased gravity  hi  cains got another bite cried adam while eve went into a state of gentle excitement and fluttered near with an evidently strong desire to help in some way  hallo got im again shouted tim as his rod bent to the water with jerky violence out o the way eve else youll get shoved into gihon  euphrates you stoopid said cain turning his beehive training to account  having lost his fish you see he could afford to be critical while he fixed on another bait  but tim cared not for rivers or names just then having hooked a real wopper which gave him some trouble to land  when landed it proved to be the finest fish of the lot much to eves satisfaction who sat down to watch the process when adam renewed the bait  now bobby frog not having as yet been quite reformed and perhaps having imbibed some of the spirit of his celebrated prototype with his name felt a strong impulse to give tim a gentle push behind  for tim sat in an irresistibly tempting position on the bank with his little boots overhanging the dark pool from which the fish had been dragged  tim said bob  adam if you pleaseor call me father if you prefer it  well then father since i havent got an abel to kill im only too appy to have a adam to souse  saying which he gave him a sufficient impulse to send him off  eve gave vent to a treble shriek on beholding her husband struggling in the water and cain himself felt somewhat alarmed at what he had done he quickly extended the butt of his rod to his father and dragged him safe to land to poor eves inexpressible relief  what dee mean by that bob demanded tim fiercely as he sprang towards his companion  cain if you pleaseor call me son if you prefers it cried bob as he ran out of his friends way but dont be waxy father adam with your own darlin boy  i couldnt elp it  youd ha done just the same to me if youd had the chance  come shake ands on it  tim lumpy was not the boy to cherish bad feeling  he grinned in a ghastly manner and shook the extended hand  i forgive you cain but please go an look for abel an pitch into him wen next you git into that state o mind for its agin commonsense as well as history to pitch into your old father so saying which tim went off to wring out his dripping garments after which the fishing was resumed  wot a remarkable difference said bobby breaking a rather long silence of expectancy as he glanced round on the splendid landscape which was all aglow with the descending sun tween these ere diggins an commercial road or george yard or ratcliff ighway  aint it tim  before tim could reply mr merryboy came forward  capital he exclaimed on catching sight of the fish well done lads well done  we shall have a glorious supper tonight  now mumpy you run home and tell mother to have the big fryingpan ready  shell want your help  ha he added turning to the boys as martha ran off with her wonted alacrity i thought youd soon teach yourselves how to catch fish  its not difficult here  and what do you think of martha my boys  shes a trump said bobby with decision  fust rate said tim bestowing his highest conception of praise  quite true lads though why you should say fust instead of firstrate tim is more than i can understand  however youll get cured of suchlike queer pronunciations in course of time  now i want you to look on little mumpy as your sister and shes a good deal of your sister too in reality for she came out of that same great nest of good and bad rich and poorlondon  has she told you anything about herself yet  nothin sir answered bob cept that when we axedasked i meani axask your pardingshe said shed neither father nor mother  ah poor thing thats too true  come pick up your fish and ill tell you about her as we go along  the boys strung their fish on a couple of branches and followed their new master home  martha came to us only last year said the farmer  shes a little older than she looks having been somewhat stunted in her growth by bad treatment i suppose and starvation and cold in her infancy  no one knows who was her father or mother  she was found in the streets one day when about three years of age by a man who took her home and made use of her by sending her to sell matches in publichouses  being small very intelligent for her years and attractively modest she succeeded i suppose in her sales and i doubt not the man would have continued to keep her if he had not been taken ill and carried to hospital where he died  of course the mans lodging was given up the day he left it  as the man had been a misanthropethats a hater of everybody ladsnobody cared anything about him or made inquiry after him  the consequence was that poor martha was forgotten strayed away into the streets and got lost a second time  she was picked up this time by a widow lady in very reduced circumstances who questioned her closely but all that the poor little creature knew was that she didnt know where her home was that she had no father or mother and that her name was martha  the widow took her home made inquiries about her parentage in vain and then adopted and began to train her which accounts for her having so little of that slang and knowledge of london low life that you have so much of you rascals  the lady gave the child the pet surname of mild for it was so descriptive of her character  but poor martha was not destined to have this mother very long  after a few years she died leaving not a sixpence or a rag behind her worth having  thus little mumpy was thrown a third time on the world but god found a protector for her in a friend of the widow who sent her to the refugethe beehive as you call itwhich has been such a blessing to you my lads and to so many like you and along with her the 10 pounds required to pay her passage and outfit to canada  they kept her for some time and trained her and then knowing that i wanted a little lass here they sent her to me for which i thank god for shes a dear little child  the tone in which the last sentence was uttered told more than any words could have conveyed the feelings of the bluff farmer towards the little gem that had been dug out of the london mines and thus given to him  reader they are prolific mines those eastend mines of london  if you doubt it go hear and see for yourself  perhaps it were better advice to say go and dig or help the miners  need it be said that our waifs and strays grew and flourished in that rich canadian soil  it need not  one of the most curious consequences of the new connection was the powerful affection that sprang up between bobby frog and mrs merryboy senior  it seemed as if that jovial old lady and our london waif had fallen in love with each other at first sight  perhaps the fact that the lady was intensely appreciative of fun and the young gentleman wonderfully full of the same had something to do with it  whatever the cause these two were constantly flirting with each other and bob often took the old lady out for little rambles in the wood behind the farm  there was a particular spot in the woods near a waterfall of which this curious couple were particularly fond and to which they frequently resorted and there under the pleasant shade with the roar of the fall for a symphony bob poured out his hopes and fears reminiscences and prospects into the willing ears of the little old lady who was so very small that bob seemed quite a big man by contrast  he had to roar almost as loud as the cataract to make her hear but he was well rewarded  the old lady it is true did not speak much perhaps because she understood little but she expressed enough of sympathy by means of nods and winks with her brilliant black eyes and smiles with her toothless mouth to satisfy any boy of moderate expectations  and bobby was satisfied  so also were the other waifs and strays not only with old granny but with everything in and around their home in the new world    chapter twenty one  treats of altered circumstances and blueribbonism  once again we return to the great city and to mrs frogs poor lodging  but it is not poor now for the woman has at last got riches and joy such riches as the ungodly care not for and a joy that they cannot understand  it is not all riches and joy however  the master has told us that we shall have much tribulation  what then  are we worse off than the unbelievers  do they escape the tribulation  it is easy to prove that the christian has the advantage of the worldling for while both have worries and tribulation without fail the one has a little joy along with thesenay much joy if you choosewhich however will end with life if not before while the other has joy unspeakable and full of glory which will increase with years and end in absolute felicity  let us look at mrs frogs room now and listen to her as she sits on one side of a cheerful fire sewing while hetty sits on the other side similarly occupied and matty alias mita lies in her crib sound asleep  it is the same room the same london atmosphere which no moral influence will ever purify and pretty much the same surroundings for mrs frogs outward circumstances have not altered much in a worldly point of view  the neighbours in the court are not less filthy and violent  one drunken nuisance has left the next room but another almost as bad has taken his place  nevertheless although not altered much things are decidedly improved in the poor pitiful dwelling whereas in time past it used to be dirty now it is clean  the table is the same table obviously for you can see the crack across the top caused by neds great fist on that occasion when failing rather in force of argument while laying down the law he sought to emphasise his remarks with an effective blow but a craftsman has been at work on the table and it is no longer rickety  the chair too on which mrs frog sits is the same identical chair which missed the head of bobby frog that time he and his father differed in opinion on some trifling matter and smashed a panel of the door but the chair has been to see the doctor and its constitution is stronger now  the other chair on which hetty sits is a distinct innovation  so is babys crib  it has replaced the heap of straw which formerly sufficed and there are two low bedsteads in corners which once were empty  besides all this there are numerous articles of varied shape and size glittering on the walls such as saucepans and potlids etcetera which are made to do ornamental as well as useful duty being polished to the highest possible degree of brilliancy  everywhere there is evidence of order and care showing that the inmates of the room are somehow in better circumstances  let it not be supposed that this has been accomplished by charity  mrs samuel twitter is very charitable undoubtedly  there can be no question as to that but if she were a hundred times more charitable than she is and were to give away a hundred thousand times more money than she does give she could not greatly diminish the vast poverty of london  mrs twitter had done what she could in this case but that was little in a money point of view for there were others who had stronger claims upon her than mrs frog  but mrs twitter had put her little finger under mrs frogs chin when her lips were about to go under water and so figuratively she kept her from drowning  mrs twitter had put out a hand when mrs frog tripped and was about to tumble and thus kept her from falling  when mrs frog weary of life was on the point of rushing once again to london bridge with a purpose mrs twitter caught the skirt of her ragged robe with a firm but kindly grasp and held her back thus saving her from destruction but best of all when the poor woman under the influence of the spirit of god ceased to strive with her maker and cried out earnestly what must i do to be saved  mrs twitter grasped her with both hands and dragged her with tender violence towards the fold but not quite into it  for mrs twitter was a wise unselfish woman as well as good  at a certain point she ceased to act and said mrs frog go to your own hetty and she will tell you what to do  and mrs frog went and hetty with joyful surprise in her heart and warm tears of gratitude in her eyes pointed her to jesus the saviour of mankind  it was nothing new to the poor woman to be thus directed  it is nothing new to almost any one in a christian land to be pointed to christ but it is something new to many a one to have the eyes opened to see and the will influenced to accept  it was so now with this poor selfwilled and longtriedor rather longresistingwoman the spirits time had come and she was made willing  but now she had to face the difficulties of the new life  consciencenever killed and now revivedbegan to act  i must work she said internally and conscience nodded approval  i must drink less she said but conscience shook her head  it will be very hard you see she continued apologetically for a poor woman like me to get through a hard day without just one glass of beer to strengthen me  conscience did all her work by looks alone  she was naturally dumb but she had a grand majestic countenance with great expressive eyes and at the mention of one glass of beer she frowned so that poor mrs frog almost trembled  at this point hetty stepped into the conversation  all unaware of what had been going on in her mothers mind she said suddenly mother im going to a meeting tonight will you come  mrs frog was quite willing  in fact she had fairly given in and become biddable like a little childthough after all that interesting creature does not always or necessarily convey the most perfect idea of obedience  it was a rough meeting composed of rude elements in a large but ungilded hall in whitechapel  the people were listening intently to a powerful speaker  the theme was strong drink  there were opponents and sympathisers there  it is the greatest curse i think in london said the speaker as hetty and her mother entered  bah exclaimed a powerful man beside whom they chanced to sit down ive drank a lot ont an dont find it no curse at all  silence cried some in the audience  i tell ee its all barn wot es talkin said the powerful man  put im out cried some of the audience  but the powerful man had a powerful look and a great bristly jaw and a fierce pair of eyes which had often been blackened and still bore the hues of the last fight no one therefore attempted to put him out so he snapped his fingers at the entire meeting said bah again with a look of contempt and relapsed into silence while the speaker heedless of the slight interruption went on  why its a blue ribbon meeting hetty whispered mrs frog  yes mother whispered hetty in reply thats one of its names but its real title i heard one gentleman say is the gospeltemperance association you see theyre very anxious to put the gospel first and temperance second temperance bein only one of the fruits of the gospel of jesus  the speaker went on in eloquent strains pleading the great causenow drawing out the sympathies of his hearers then appealing to their reason sometimes relating incidents of deepest pathos at other times convulsing the audience with touches of the broadest humour insomuch that the man who said bah modified his objections to pooh and ere long came to that turningpoint where silence is consent  in this condition he remained until reference was made by the speaker to a man not such a bad fellow too when soberwho under the influence of drink had thrown his big shoe at his wifes head and cut it so badly that she was even thenwhile he was addressing themlying in hospital hovering between life and death  thats me cried the powerful man jumping up in a state of great excitement mingled with indignation while he towered head and shoulders above the audience though how you come for to ear ont beats me holler  an it shows ow lies git about for shes not gone to the hospital an it wasnt shoes at all but boots i flung at er an they only just grazed er thank goodness an sent the cat flyin through the winder  so  a burst of laughter with mingled applause and cheers cut off the end of the sentence and caused the powerful man to sit down in much confusion quite puzzled what to think of it all  my friend said the speaker when order had been restored you are mistaken  i did not refer to you at all never having seen or heard of you before but there are too many men like youmen who would be good men and true if they would only come to the saviour who would soon convince them that it is wise to give up the drink and put on the blue ribbon  let it not be supposed my friends that i say it is the duty of every one to put on the blue ribbon and become a total abstainer there are circumstances in which a little wine may be advisable  why the apostle paul himself when timothys stomach got into a chronic state of disease which subjected him apparently to frequent infirmities advised him to take a little wine but he didnt advise him to take many quarts of beer or numerous glasses of brandy and water or oceans of old tom or to get daily fuddled on the poisons which are sold by many publicans under these names  still less did paul advise poor dyspeptic timothy to become his own medical man and prescribe all these medicines to himself whenever he felt inclined for them  yes there are the old and the feeble and the diseased who may observe i dont say who do for i am not a doctor but who may require stimulants under medical advice  to these we do not speak and to these we would not grudge the small alleviation to their sad case which may be found in stimulants but to the young and strong and healthy we are surely entitled to say to plead and to entreatput on the blue ribbon if you see your way to it  and by the young we mean not only all boys and girls but all men and women in the prime of life ay and beyond the prime if in good health  surely you will all admit that the young require no stimulants  are they not superabounding in energy do they not require the very oppositesedatives and do they not find these in constant and violent muscular exercise  with many similar and other arguments did the speaker seek to influence the mass of human beings before him taking advantage of every idea that cropped up and every incident in the meeting that occurred to enforce his advicenamely total abstinence for the young and the healthy until he had stirred them up to a state of considerable enthusiasm then he said  i am glad to see you enthusiastic  nothing great can be done without enthusiasm  you may potter along the even tenor of your way without it but youll never come to much good and youll never accomplish great things without it  what is enthusiasm  is it not seeing the length breadth height depth and bearing of a good thing and being zealously affected in helping to bring it about  there are many kinds of enthusiasts though but one quality of enthusiasm  weak people show their enthusiasm too much on the surface  powerful folk keep it too deep in their hearts to be seen at all  what then are we to scout it in the impulsive because too obvious to undervalue it in the reticent because almost invisible  nay let us be thankful for it in any form for the thing is good though the individuals manner of displaying it may be faulty  let us hope that the too gushing may learn to clap on the breaks a littlea very little but far more let us pray that the reticent and the selfpossessed and the ohdearnoyoullnever catchmedoingthatsortofthing people may be enabled to get up more steam  better far in my estimation the wild enthusiast than the selfpossessed and selfsufficient cynic  just look at your gentlemanly cynic goodnatured very likely for hes mightily pleased with himself and excessively wise in regard to all things sublunary  why even he has enthusiasm though not always in a good cause  follow him to the races  watch him while he sees the sleek and beautiful creatures straining every muscle and his own favourite drawing ahead inch by inch until it bids fair to win  is that our cynic bending forward on his steed with gleaming eyes and glowing cheek and partly open mouth and quickcoming breath and so forgetful of himself that he swings off his hat and gives vent to a lusty cheer as the favourite passes the winningpost  but follow him still further  dont let him go  hold on to his horses tail till we see him safe into his club and wait there till he has dined and gone to the opera  there he sits immaculate in dress and bearing in the stalls  it is a huge audience  a great star is to appear  the star comes onmusic such as might cause the very angels to bend and listen  the sweet singer exerts herself her rich voice swells in volume and sweeps round the hall filling every ear and thrilling every heart until unable to restrain themselves the vast concourse rises en masse and with waving scarf and kerchief thunders forth applause and what of our cynic  there he is the wildest of the wildfor he happens to love musicshouting like a maniac and waving his hat regardless of the fact that he has broken the brim and that the old gentleman whose corns he has trodden on frowns at him with savage indignation  yes continued the speaker the whole world is enthusiastic when the keynote of each individual or class of individuals is struck and shall we be ashamed of our enthusiasm for this little bit of heavenly blue which symbolises the great fact that those who wear it are racing with the demon drink to save men and women ourselves included perhaps from his clutches racing with despair to place hope before the eyes of those who are blindly rushing to destruction racing with time to snatch the young out of the way of the destroyer before he lays hand on them and singingay shoutingsongs of triumph and glory to god because of the tens of thousands of souls and bodies already saved because of the bright prospect of the tens of thousands more to follow because of the innumerable voices added to the celestial choir and the glad assurance that the hymns of praise thus begun shall not die out with our feeble frames but will grow stronger in sweetness as they diminish in volume until the river crossed they shall burst forth again with indescribable intensity in the new song  some people tell us that these things are not true  others say they wont last  my friends i know and many of you know that they are true and even if they were not to last have we not even now ground for praise  shall we not rejoice that the lifeboat has saved some because others have refused to embark and perished  but we dont admit that these things wont last  very likely in the apostolic days some of the unbelievers said of them and their creed how long will it last  if these objectors be now able to take note of the worlds doings they have their answer from father time himself for does he not say christianity has lasted nearly nineteen hundred years and is the strongest moral motivepower in the world today  the blue ribbon my friends or what it represents is founded on christianity therefore the principles which it represents are sure to stand  who will come now and put it on  i will shouted a strong voice from among the audience and up rose the powerful man who began the evening with bah and pooh  he soon made his way to the platform amid uproarious cheering and donned the blue  hetty whispered mrs frog in a low timid voice i think i would like to put it on too  if the voice had been much lower and more timid hetty would have heard it for she sat there watching for her mother as one might watch for a parent in the crisis of a dread disease  she knew that no power on earth can change the will and she had waited and prayed till the arrow was sent home by the hand of god  come along mother she saidbut said no more for her heart was too full  mrs frog was led to the platform to which multitudes of men women and children were pressing and the little badge was pinned to her breast  thus did that poor woman begin her christian course with the fruit of selfdenial  she then set about the work of putting her house in order  it was uphill work at first and very hard but the promise did not fail her lo  i am with you alway  in all her walk she found hetty a guardian angel  i must work hetty dear she said for it will never do to make you support us all but what am i to do with baby  there is no one to take charge of her when i go out  i am quite able to keep the whole of us mother seeing that i get such good pay from the lady i work for but as you want to work i can easily manage for baby  you know ive often wished to speak of the infant nursery in george yard  before you sent matty away i wanted you to send her there but hetty paused  go on dear  i was mad agin you an your religious ways wasnt that it said mrs frog  well mother it dont matter now thank god  the infant nursery you know is a part of the institution there  the hearts of the people who manage it were touched by the death of so many thousands of little ones every year in london through want and neglect so they set up this nursery to enable poor widowed mothers and others to send their babies to be cared fornursed fed and amused in nice airy roomswhile the mothers are at work  they charge only fourpence a day for this and each baby has its own bag of clothing brush and comb towel and cot they will keep matty from halfpast seven in the morning till eight at night for you so that will give you plenty of time to work wont it mother  it will indeed hetty and all for fourpence a day say you  yes the ordinary charge is fourpence but widows get it for twopence for each child and perhaps they may regard a deserted wife as a widow  there is a fine of twopence per hour for any child not taken away after eight so youll have to be up to time mother  mrs frog acted on this advice and thus was enabled to earn a sufficiency to enable her to pay her daily rent to clothe and feed herself and child to give a little to the various missions undertaken by the institutions near her to put a little now and then into the farthing bank and even to give a little in charity to the poor  now reader you may have forgotten it but if you turn back to near the beginning of this chapter you will perceive that all we have been writing about is a huge digression for which we refuse to make the usual apology  we return again to mrs frog where we left her sitting beside her cheerful fire sewing and conversing with hetty  i cant bear to think of im hetty said mrs frog  you an me sittin here so comfortable with as much to eat as we want an to spare while your poor father is in a cold cell  hes bin pretty bad to me of late its true wi that drink but he wasnt always like that hetty even you can remember him before he took to the drink  yes mother i can and bless the lord he may yet be better than he ever was  when is his time up  this day three weeks  the twelve months will be out then  we must pray for im hetty  yes mother  i am always prayin for him  you know that  there was a touch of anxiety in the tones and faces of both mother and daughter as they talked of the father for his homecoming might perhaps nay probably would be attended with serious consequences to the renovated household  they soon changed the subject to one more agreeable  isnt bobbys letter a nice one mother said hetty and so well written though the spellin might have been better but then hes had so little schoolin  it just makes my heart sing returned mrs frog  read it again to me hetty  ill never tire o hearin it  i only wish it was longer  the poor mothers wish was not unnatural for the letter which bobby had written was not calculated to tax the readers patience and as hetty hinted there was room for improvement not only in the spelling but in the writing  nevertheless it had carried great joy to the mothers heart  we shall therefore give it verbatim et literatim  brankly farmkanada  deer mutrer wen i left you i promisd to

said mrs frog wiping away a tear with the sock she was darning in preparation for her husbands return  yes mother  bless the people that sent im out to canada said hetty for he would never have got on here  there came a tap to the door as she spoke and mrs twitter entering was received with a hearty welcome  i came mrs frog she said accepting the chairfor there was even a third chairwhich hetty placed for her to ask when your husband will be home again  good mrs twitter carefully avoided the risk of hurting the poor womans feelings by needless reference to jail  i expect him this day three weeks maam replied mrs frog  that will do nicely returned mrs twitter  you see my husband knows a gentleman who takes great pleasure in getting conin getting men like ned you know into places and giving them a chance ofof getting on in life you understand  yes maam we must all try to git on in life if we would keep in life said mrs frog sadly  well there is a situation open just now which the gentlemanthe same gentleman who was so kind in helping us after the fire you see we all need help of one another mrs frogwhich the gentleman said he could keep open for a month but not longer so as i happened to be passing your house tonight on my way to the yard to the mothers meeting i thought id just look in and tell you and ask you to be sure and send ned to me the moment he comes home  i will maam and god bless you for thinkin of us so much  remember now said mrs twitter impressively before he has time to meet any of his old comrades  tell him if he comes straight to me he will hear something that will please him very much  i wont tell you what  that is my message to him  and now how is my mita  oh  i need not ask  there she lies like a little angel  mrs twitter rose and went to the crib but did not disturb the little sleeper i wish i saw roses on her little cheeks and more fat mrs frog  mrs frog admitted that there was possible improvement in the direction of roses and fat but feared that the air it would have been more correct to have said the smoke and smells of the court went against roses and fat somehow  she was thankful however to the good lord for the health they all enjoyed in spite of local disadvantages  ah sighed mrs twitter if we could only transport you all to canada  oh maam exclaimed mrs frog brightening up suddenly weve had such a nice letter from our bobby  let her see it hetty  yes and so nicely written too remarked hetty with a beaming face as she handed bobbys production to the visitor though he doesnt quite understand yet the need for capital letters  never mind hetty so long as he sends you capital letters returned mrs twitter perpetrating the first pun she had been guilty of since she was a baby and truly this is a charming letter though short  yes its rather short but it might have been shorter said mrs frog indulging in a truism  mrs twitter was already late for the mothers meeting but she felt at once that it would be better to be still later than to disappoint mrs frog of a little sympathy in a matter which touched her feelings so deeply  she sat down therefore and read the letter over slowly commenting on it as she went along in a pleasant sort of way which impressed the anxious mother with not quite the belief but the sensation that bobby was the most hopeful immigrant which canada had received since it was discovered  now mind send ned up at once said the amiable lady when about to quit the little room  yes mrs twitter i will goodnight    chapter twenty two  ned frogs experiences and sammy twitters woes  but ned frog with strong drink combined rendered fruitless all the efforts that were put forth in his behalf at that time  when discharged with a lot of other jailbirds none of whom however he knew he sauntered leisurely homeward wondering whether his wife was alive and if so in what condition he should find her  it may have been that better thoughts were struggling in his breast for ascendency because he sighed deeply once or twice which was not a usual mode with ned of expressing his feelings  a growl was more common and more natural considering his character  drawing nearer and nearer to his old haunts yet taking a roundabout road as the moth is drawn to the candle or as water descends to its level he went slowly on having little hope of comfort in his home and not knowing very well what to do  as he passed down one of the less frequented streets leading into whitechapel he was arrested by the sight of a purse lying on the pavement  to become suddenly alive pick it up glance stealthily round and thrust it into his pocket was the work of an instant  the saunter was changed into a steady businesslike walk  as he turned into commercial street ned met number 666 full in the face  he knew that constable intimately but refrained from taking notice of him and passed on with an air and expression which were meant to convey the idea of infantine innocence  guilty men usually overreach themselves giles noted the air and suspected guilt but not being in a position to prove it walked gravely on with his stern eyes straight to the front  in a retired spot ned examined his find  it contained six sovereigns four shillings threepence a metropolitan railway return ticket several cuttings from newspapers and a recipe for the concoction of a cheap and wholesome pudding along with a card bearing the name of mrs samuel twitter written in ink and without any address  youre in luck ned he remarked to himself as he examined these treasures  now old boy you avent stole this ere purse so you aint a thief you dont know were mrs st lives so you cant find er to return it to er  besides its more than likely she wont feel the want of itwereas i feels in want of it wery much indeed  of course its my dooty to and it over to the plice but in the first place i refuse to ave any communication wi the plice friendly or otherwise in the second place i ad no and in makin the laws so i dont feel bound to obey em thirdly im both ungry an thirsty an ere you ave the remedy for them afflictions so fourthlyere goes  having thus cleared his conscience ned committed the cash to his vest pocket and presented the purse with its remaining contents to the rats in a neighbouring sewer  almost immediately afterwards he met an irishman an old friend  terence my boy well met he said offering his hand  hooroo  ned frog sure i thought ye was in limbo  you thought right terry only halfanhour out  come along ill stand you somethin for the sake of old times  by the way have you done that job yet  what job  why the dynamite job of course  no ive gin that up returned the irishman with a look of contempt to tell you the honest truth i dont believe that the way to right ireland is to blow up england  but theres an englishman youll find at the swan an anchora sneakin blackguard as would sell his own mother for dhrinkhell help you if you wants to have a hand in the job  im off it  notwithstanding this want of sympathy on that point the two friends found that they held enough in common to induce a prolonged stay at the publichouse from which ned finally issued rather late at night and staggered homewards  he met no acquaintance on the way and was about to knock at his own door when the sound of a voice within arrested him  it was hetty praying  the poor wife and daughter had given up hope of his returning at so late an hour that night and had betaken themselves to their usual refuge in distress  ned knew the sound well and it seemed to rouse a demon in his breast for he raised his foot with the intention of driving in the door when he was again arrested by another sound  it was the voice of little matty who awaking suddenly out of a terrifying dream set up a shrieking which at once drowned all other sounds  ned lowered his foot thrust his hands into his pockets and stood gazing in a state of indecision at the broken pavement for a few minutes  no peace there he said sternly  prayin an squallin dont suit me so goodnight to ee all  with that he turned sharp round and staggered away resolving never more to return  is that you ned frog inquired a squalid dirtylooking woman thrusting her head out of a window as he passed  no taint said ned fiercely as he left the court  he went straight to a low lodginghouse but before entering tied his money in a bit of rag and thrust it into an inner pocket of his vest which he buttoned tight and fastened his coat over it  paying the requisite fourpence for the nights lodging he entered and was immediately hailed by several men who knew him but being in no humour for good fellowship he merely nodded and went straight up to his lowly bed  it was one of seventy beds that occupied the entire floor of an immense room  police supervision had secured that this room should be well ventilated and that the bedding should be reasonably clean though far from cleanlooking and ned slept soundly in spite of drink for as we have said before he was unusually strong  next day having thought over his plans in bed and being a man of strong determination he went forth to carry them into immediate execution  he went to a lofty tenement in the neighbourhood of dean and flower street one of the poorest parts of the city and hired a garret which was so high up that even the staircase ended before you reached it and the remainder of the upward flight had to be performed on a ladder at the top of which was a trapdoor the only entrance to neds new home  having paid a weeks rent in advance he took possession furnished the apartment with one old chair one older table one bundle of straw in a sack one extremely old blanket and one brandnew pipe with a corresponding ounce or two of tobacco  then he locked the trapdoor put the key in his pocket and descended to the street where at birdfair he provided himself with sundry little cages and a few birds having conveyed these with some food for himself and the little birds to his lodging he again descended to the street and treated himself to a pint of beer  while thus engaged he was saluted by an old friend the owner of a low musichall who begged for a few minutes conversation with him outside  ned he said im glad i fell in with you for im uncommon ard up just now  i never lends money said ned brusquely turning away  old on ned i dont want yer money bless yer  i wants to give you money  oh thats quite another story fire away old man  well you see im ard up as i said for a man to keep order in my place  the last man i ad was a good un e was  six futt one in is socks an as strong as a orse but by ill luck one night a sailorchap that was bigger than im come in to the all an they ad a row an my man got sitch a lickin that he ad to go to hospital an es been there for a week an wont be out they say for a month or more  now ned will you take the job  the pays good an the funs considerable  sos the fightin sometimes but youd put a stop to that you know  an then youll ave all the day to yourself to do as you like  im your man said ned promptly  thus it came to pass that the pugilist obtained suitable employment as a peacemaker and keeper of order for a time at least in one of those disreputable places of amusement where the unfortunate poor of london are taught lessons of vice and vanity which end often in vexation of spirit not only to themselves but to the strata of society which rest above them  one night ned betook himself to this temple of vice and on the way was struck by the appearance of a man with a barrowa sort of bookstall on wheelswho was pushing his way through the crowded street  it was the man who at the temperance meeting had begun with bah and pooh and had ended by putting on the blue ribbon  he had once been a comrade of ned frog but had become so very respectable that his old chum scarcely recognised him  hallo  reggie north can that be you  north let down his barrow wheeled round and held out his hand with a hearty how are ee old man  wy youre lookin well close cropped an comfortable eh  livin at her majestys expense lately  where dee live now ned  id like to come and see you  ned told his old comrade the locality of his new abode  but i say north how respectable you are  whats come over you not become a travellin bookseller have you  thats just what i am ned  well theres no accountin for taste  i hope it pays  ay pays splendidlypays the seller of the books and pays the buyers better  hows that asked ned in some surprise going up to the barrow oh i see bibles  yes ned bibles the word of god  will you buy one  no thank ee said ned drily  here ill make you a present o one then returned north thrusting a bible into the others hand you cant refuse it of an old comrade goodnight  ill look in on you soon  you neednt trouble yourself ned called out as his friend went off and he felt half inclined to fling the bible after him but checked himself  it was worth money so he put it in his pocket and went his way  the hall was very full that night a new comic singer of great promise having been announced and oh it was sad to see the youths of both sexes little more than big boys and girls who went there to smoke and drink and enjoy ribald songs and indecent jests  we do not mean to describe the proceedings  let it suffice to say that after one or two songs and a dance had been got through ned part of whose duty it was to announce the performances rose and in a loud voice said  signor twittorini will now sing  the signor stepped forward at once and was received with a roar of enthusiastic laughter for anything more lugubrious and woebegone than the expression of his face had never been seen on these boards before there was a slight look of shyness about him too which increased the absurdity of the thing and it was all so natural as one halftipsy woman remarked  so it wasintensely naturalfor signor twittorini was no other than poor sammy twitter in the extremest depths of his despair halfstarved halfmad yet ashamed to return to his fathers house the miserable boy had wandered in bye streets and slept in low lodginghouses as long as his funds lasted  then he tried to get employment with only partial success until at last recollecting that he had been noted among his companions for a sweet voice and a certain power of singing seriocomic songs he thought of a low musichall into which he had staggered one evening when drunkas much with misery as with beer  the manager on hearing a song or two at once engaged him and brought him out  as poor sammy knew nothing about acting it was decided that he should appear in his own garments which being shabbygenteel were pretty well suited for a great italian singer in low society  but sammy had overrated his own powers  after the first burst of applause was over he stood gazing at the audience with his mouth half open vainly attempting to recollect the song he meant to sing and making such involuntary contortions with his thin visage that a renewed burst of laughter broke forth  when it had partially subsided sammy once more opened his mouth gave vent to a gasp burst into tears and rushed from the stage  this was the climax  it brought down the house  never before had they seen such an actor  he was inimitable and the people made the usual demand for an encore with tremendous fervour expecting that signor twittorini would repeat the scene probably with variations and finish off with the promised song  but poor sammy did not respond  i seeyou can improvise said the manager quite pleased and ive no objection when its well done like that but youd better go on now and stick to the programme  i cant sing said sammy in passionate despair  come come young feller i dont like actin off the stage an the audience is gittin impatient  but i tell you i cant sing a note repeated sam  what  dye mean to tell me youre not actin  i wish i was cried poor sam glancing upward with tearful eyes and clasping his hands  come now  youve joked enough  go on and do your part said the puzzled manager  but i tell you im not joking  i couldnt sing just now if you was to give me ten thousand pounds  it might have been the amount of the sum stated or the tone in which it was statedwe know notbut the truth of what sam said was borne so forcibly in upon the manager that he went into a violent passion sprang at sams throat hustled him towards a back door and kicked him out into a back lane where he sat down on an empty packing case covered his face with his hands bowed his head on his knees and wept  the manager returned on the stage and with a calm voice and manner which proved himself to be a very fair actor stated that signor twittorini had met with a sudden disasternot a very serious one which however rendered it impossible for him to reappear just then but that if sufficiently recovered he would appear towards the close of the evening  this with a very significant look and gesture from ned frog quieted the audience to the extent at least of inducing them to do nothing worse than howl continuously for ten minutes after which they allowed the performances to go on and saved the keeper of order the trouble of knocking down a few of the most unruly  ned was the first to quit the hall when all was over  he did so by the back door and found sam still sitting on the doorstep  whats the matter with ye youngster he said going up to him youve made a pretty mess of it tonight  i couldnt help itindeed i couldnt  perhaps ill do better next time  better ha ha  you couldnt ha done betterif youd ony gone on but why do ye sit there  because ive nowhere to go to  theres plenty o common lodginouses aint there  yes but i havent got a single rap  well then aint there the casual ward  why dont you go there youll git bed and board for nothin there  having put this question and received no answer ned turned away without further remark  hardened though ned was to suffering there was something in the fallen boys face that had touched this fallen man  he turned back with a sort of remonstrative growl and reentered the back lane but signor twittorini was gone  he had heard the managers voice and fled  a policeman directed him to the nearest casual ward where the lowest stratum of abject poverty finds its nightly level  here he knocked with trembling hand  he was received he was put in a lukewarm bath and washed he was fed on gruel and a bit of breadquite sufficient to allay the cravings of hunger he was shown to a room in which appeared to be a row of corpsesso dead was the silenceeach rolled in a covering of some dark brown substance and stretched out stiff on a trestle with a canvas bottom  one of the trestles was empty he was told he might appropriate it  are they dead he asked looking round with a shudder  not quite replied his jailer with a short laugh but deadbeat most of emtired out i should say and disinclined to move  sam twitter fell on the couch drew the coverlet over him and became a brown corpse like the rest while the guardian retired and locked the door to prevent the egress of any who might chance to come to life again  in the morning sam had a breakfast similar to the supper was made to pick oakum for a few hours by way of payment for hospitality and left with a feeling that he had at last reached the lowest possible depth of degradation  so he had in that direction but there are other and varied depths in londondepths of crime and of sickness as well as of suffering and sorrow  aimlessly he wandered about for another day almost fainting with hunger but still so ashamed to face his father and mother that he would rather have died than done so  some touch of pathos or gruff tenderness mayhap in ned frogs voice induced him to return at night to the scene of his discreditable failure and await the pugilists coming out  he followed him a short way and then running forward said  oh sir  im very low  hallo  signor twittorini again said ned wheeling round sternly what have i to do with your being low  ive been low enough myself at times an nobody helped  ned checked himself for he knew that what he said was false  i think im dying said sam leaning against a house for support  well if you do die youll be well out of it all replied ned bitterly  whats your name  twitter replied sam forgetting in his woe that he had not intended to reveal his real name  twittertwitter  ive heard that name before  why yes  fathers name samueleh  mother alivegot cards with mrs samuel twitter on em an no address  yesyes  how do you come to know asked sam in surprise  never you mind that youngster but you come along wi me  ive got a sort o right to feed you  ha ha come along  sam became frightened at this sudden burst of hilarity and shrank away but ned grasped him by the arm and led him along with such decision that resistance he felt would be useless  in a few minutes he was in neds garret eating bread and cheese with ravenous satisfaction  have some beer said ned filling a pewter pot  nononono said sam shuddering as he turned his head away  well youngster returned ned with a slight look of surprise please yourself and heres your health  he drained the pot to the bottom after which dividing his straw into two heaps and throwing them into two corners he bade sam lie down and rest  the miserable boy was only too glad to do so  he flung himself on the little heap pointed out and the last thing he remembered seeing before the sweet restorer embraced him was the huge form of ned frog sitting in his own corner with his back to the wall the pewter pot at his elbow and a long clay pipe in his mouth    chapter twenty three  hopes revive  mr thomas balls butler to sir richard brandon standing with his legs wide apart and his hands under his coat tails in the servants hall delivered himself of the opinion that things was comin to a wonderful pass when sir richard brandon would condescend to go visitin of a low family in whitechapel  but the family is no more low than you are mr balls objected jessie summers who being not very high herself felt that the remark was slightly personal  of course not my dear replied balls with a paternal smile  i did not for a moment mean that mr samuel twitter was low in an offensive sense but in a social sense  sir richard you know belongs to the hupper ten an he as not been used to associate with people so much further down in the scale  whether hes right or whether hes wrong aint for me to say  i merely remark that things being as they are the master as come to a wonderful pass  its all along of miss diana said mrs screwbury  that dear child as taken the firm belief into her pretty ead that all people are equal in the sight of their maker and that we should look on each other as brothers and sisters and you know she can twist sir richard round her little finger and shes taken a great fancy to that twitter family ever since shes been introduced to them at that ome of industry by mr welland who used to be a great friend of their poor boy that ran away and mrs twitter goes about the ome and among the poor so much and can tell her so many stories about poor people that shes grown quite fond of her  but we aint all equal mrs screwbury said the cook recurring with some asperity to a former remark an nothink you or anybody else can ever say will bring me to believe it  quite right cook said balls  for instance no one would ever admit that i was as good a cook as you are or that you was equal to mrs screwbury as a nurse or that any of us could compare with jessie summers as a ousemaid or that i was equal to sir richard in the matters of edication or station or wealth  no it is in the more serious matters that concern our souls that we are equal and i fear that when death comes hes not very particular as to who it is hes cuttin down when hes got the order  a ring at the bell cut short this learned discourse  thats for the cab remarked mr balls as he went out  now while these things were taking place at the westend in the eastend the twitters were assembled round the social board enjoying themselvesthat is to say enjoying themselves as much as in the circumstances was possible  for the cloud that sammys disappearance had thrown over them was not to be easily or soon removed  since the terrible day on which he was lost a settled expression of melancholy had descended on the once cheery couple which extended in varying degree down to their youngest  allusion was never made to the erring one yet it must not be supposed he was forgotten  on the contrary sammy was never out of his parents thoughts  they prayed for him night and morning aloud and at all times silently  they also took every possible step to discover their boys retreat by means of the ordinary police as well as detectives whom they employed for the purpose of hunting sammy up but all in vain  it must not be supposed however that this private sorrow induced mrs twitter selfishly to forget the poor or intermit her labours among them  she did not for an hour relax her efforts in their behalf at george yard and at commercial street  at the twitter social boardwhich by the way was spread in another house not far from that which had been burnedsat not only mr and mrs twitter and all the little twitters but also mrs loper who had dropped in just to make inquiries and mrs larrabel who was anxious to hear what news they had to tell and mr crackaby who was very sympathetic and mr stickler who was oracular  thus the small table was full  mariar my dear said mr twitter referring to some remarkable truism which his wife had just uttered we must just take things as we find em  the world is not goin to change its course on purpose to please us  things might be worse you know and when the spoke in your wheel is at its lowest there must of necessity be a rise unless it stands still altogether  youre right mr twitter  i always said so remarked mrs loper adopting all these sentiments with a sigh of resignation  if we did not submit to fortune when it is adverse why then wed have tohave to  succumb to it suggested mrs larrabel with one of her sweetest smiles  no mrs larrabel i never succumbfrom principle i never do so  the last thing that any woman of good feeling ought to do is to succumb  i would bow to it  quite right maam quite right said stickler who now found time to speak having finished his first cup of tea and second muffin to bow is to say the least of it polite and simple and is always safe for it commits one to nothing but then suppose that fortune is impolite and refuses to return the bow what i ask you would be the result  as mrs loper could not form the slightest conception what the result would be she replied with a weak smile and a request for more sausage  these remarks although calculated to enlist the sympathies of crackaby and excite the mental energies of twitter had no effect whatever on those gentlemen for the latter was deeply depressed and his friend crackaby felt for him sincerely  thus the black sheep remained victorious in argumentwhich was not always the case  poor twitter  he was indeed at that time utterly crestfallen for not only had he lost considerably by the firehis house having been uninsuredbut business in the city had gone wrong somehow  a few heavy failures had occurred among speculators and as these had always a row of minor speculators at their backs like a row of childs bricks which only needs the fall of one to insure the downcome of all behind it there had been a general tumble of speculative bricks tailing off with a number of unspeculative ones such as tailors grocers butchers and shopkeepers generally  mr twitter was one of the unspeculative unfortunates but he had not come quite down  he had only been twisted uncomfortably to one side just as a toy brick is sometimes seen standing up here and there in the midst of surrounding wreck  mr twitter was not absolutely ruined  he had only got into difficulties  but this was a small matter in his and his good wifes eyes compared with the terrible fall and disappearance of their beloved sammy  he had always been such a good obedient boy and as his mother said so sensitive  it never occurred to mrs twitter that this sensitiveness was very much the cause of his fall and disappearance for the same weakness or cowardice that rendered him unable to resist the playful banter of his drinking comrades prevented him from returning to his family in disgrace  you have not yet advertised i think said crackaby  no not yet answered twitter we cannot bear to publish it  but we have set several detectives on his track  in fact we expect one of them this very evening and i shouldnt wonder if that was him he added as a loud knock was heard at the door  please maam said the domestic mr wellands at the door with another gentleman  e says e wont come ine merely wishes to speak to you for a moment  oh bid em come in bid em come in said mrs twitter in the exuberance of a hospitality which never turned any one away and utterly regardless of the fact that her parlour was extremely small  another moment and stephen welland entered apologising for the intrusion and saying that he merely called with sir richard brandon on their way to the beehive meeting to ask if anything had been heard of sam  come in and welcome do said mrs twitter to sir richard whose face had become a not unfamiliar one at the beehive meetings by that time  and miss diana too  im so glad youve brought her  sit down dear  not so near the door  to be sure there aint much room anywhere else butget out of the way stickler  the black sheep hopped to one side instantly and di was accommodated with his chair  stickler was one of those toadies who worship rank for its own sake  if a lamppost had been knighted stickler would have bowed down to it  if an ass had been what he styled barrowknighted he would have lain down and let it walk over himperhaps would even have solicited a passing kickcertainly would not have resented one  allow me sir richard he said with some reference to the knights hat  hush stickler said mrs twitter  the black sheep hushed while the bustling lady took the hat and placed it on the sideboard  your stick sir richard said stickler permit  hold your tongue stickler said mrs twitter  the black sheep held his tonguebetween his teethand wished that some day he might have the opportunity of punching mrs twitters head without if possible her knowing who did it  though thus reduced to silence he cleared his throat in a demonstratively subservient manner and awaited his opportunity  sir richard was about to apologise for the intrusion when another knock was heard at the outer door and immediately after the city missionary john seaward came in  he evidently did not expect to see company but after a cordial salutation to every one said that he had called on his way to the meeting  you are heartily welcome  come in said mrs twitter looking about for a chair come sit beside me mr seaward on the stool  youll not object to a humble seat i know  i am afraid said sir richard that the meeting has much to answer for in the way of flooding you with unexpected guests  oh dear no sir i love unexpected gueststhe more unexpected the more imolly dear to her eldest girl take all the children upstairs  mrs twitter was beginning to get confused in her excitement but the last stroke of generalship relieved the threatened block and her anxieties at the same time  but what of sam asked young welland in a low tone any news yet  none said the poor mother suddenly losing all her vivacity and looking so pitifully miserable that the sympathetic di incontinently jumped off her chair ran up to her and threw her arms round her neck  dear darling child said mrs twitter returning the embrace with interest  but i have brought you news said the missionary in a quiet voice which produced a general hush  news echoed twitter with sudden vehemence  oh  mr seaward exclaimed the poor mother clasping her hands and turning pale  yes continued seaward as all here seem to be friends i may tell you that sam has been heard of at last  he has not indeed yet been found but he has been seen in the company of a man wellknown as a rough disorderly character but who it seems has lately put on the blue ribbon so we may hope that his influence over sam will be for good instead of evil  an expression of intense thankfulness escaped from the poor mother on hearing this but the father became suddenly much excited and plied the missionary with innumerable questions which however resulted in nothing for the good reason that nothing more was known  at this point the company were startled by another knock and so persuaded was mrs twitter that it must be sammy himself that she rushed out of the room opened the door and almost flung herself into the arms of number 666  iibeg your pardon mr scott i thought that  no harm done maam said giles  may i come in  certainly and most welcome  when the tall constable bowed his head to pass under the ridiculously small doorway and stood erect in the still more ridiculously small parlour it seemed as though the last point of capacity had been touched and the walls of the room must infallibly burst out  but they did not  probably the house had been built before domiciles warranted to last twenty years had come into fashion  you have found him exclaimed mrs twitter clasping her hands and looking up in giless calm countenance with tearful eyes  yes maam i am happy to tell you that we have at last traced him  i have just left him  and does he know you have come here  is he expecting us asked the poor woman breathlessly  oh dear no maam i rather think that if he knew i had come here he would not await my return for the young gentleman does not seem quite willing to come home  indeed he is not quite fit excuse me  how dyou know hes not willing demanded mr twitter who felt a rising disposition to stand up for sammy  because i heard him say so sir  i went into the place where he was to look for some people who are wanted and saw your son sitting with a wellknown rough of the name of north who has become a changed man however and has put on the blue ribbon  i knew north well and recognised your son at once  north seemed to have been trying to persuade your boy to return bless him bless him from mrs twitter for i heard him say as i passedoh no no no i can never return home  where is he  take me to him at once  my bonnet and shawl molly  pardon me maam said giles  it is not a very fit place for a ladythough there are some ladies who go to low lodginghouses regularly to preach but unless you go for that purpose it  yes my dear it would be quite out of place interposed twitter come it is my duty to go to this place  can you lead me to it mr scott  oh and i should like to go tooso much so very much  it was little di who spoke but her father said that the idea was preposterous  pardon me sir richard said mr seaward this happens to be my night for preaching in the common lodginghouse where mr scott says poor sam is staying  if you choose to accompany me there is nothing to prevent your little daughter going  of course it would be as well that no one whom the boy might recognise should accompany us but his father might go and stand at the door outside while the owner of the lodging might be directed to tell sam that some one wishes to see him  your plan is pretty good but i will arrange my plans myself said mr twitter who suddenly roused himself to action with a degree of vigour that carried all before it  go and do your own part mr seaward give no directions to the proprietor of the lodging and leave sammy to me  i will have a cab ready for him and his mother in the cab waiting with a suit of his own clothes  are you ready  quite ready said the missionary amused as well as interested by the good mans sudden display of resolution  mrs twitter also was reduced to silence by surprise as well as by submission  sir richard agreed to go and take di with him if giles promised to hold himself in readiness within call  you see he said i have been in similar places before now butnot with my little child  as for loper larrabel crackaby stickler and companyfeeling that it would be improper to remain after the host and hostess were gone that it would be equally wrong to offer to go with them and quite inappropriate to witness the homecomingthey took themselves off but each resolved to flutter unseen in the neighbourhood until he or she could make quite sure that the prodigal had returned  it was to one of the lowest of the common lodginghouses that sam twitter the younger had resorted on the night he had been discovered by number 666  that day he had earned sixpence by carrying a carpet bag to a railway station  one penny he laid out in bread one penny in cheese with the remaining fourpence he could purchase the right to sit in the lodginghouse kitchen and to sleep in a bed in a room with thirty or forty homeless ones like himself  on his way to this abode of the destitute he was overtaken by a huge man with a little bit of blue ribbon in his buttonhole  hallo young feller exclaimed the man youre the chap that was livin wi ned frog the night i called to see imeh  sam twitter aint you  yes said young sam blushing scarlet with alarm at the abruptness of the question  yes i am  ttwitter is my name  youre the man that gave him the bible are you not whom he turned out of his house for tryin to speak to him about his soul  the same young feller  thats me an reggie north is my name  hed ave ad some trouble to turn me out once though but ive given up quarrellin and fightin now havin enlisted under the banner of the prince of peace replied the man who was none other than our biblesalesman the man who contributed the memorable speechbah and pooh at the gospeltemperance meeting  where are you going  sam who never could withhold information or retain a secret if asked suddenly gave the name of the common lodginghouse to which he was bound  well im going there too so come along  sam could not choose but go with the man  he would rather have been alone but could not shake him off  entering they sat down at a table together near the kitchen fire and north pulling out of his pocket a small loaf cut it in two and offered sam half  several men were disputing in the box or compartment next to them and as they made a great noise attracting the attention of all around north and his friend sam were enabled the more easily to hold confidential talk unnoticed by putting their heads together and chatting low as they ate their frugal meal  what made you leave ned asked north  how did you know id left him  why because if you was still with him you wouldnt be here  this was so obvious that sam smiled but it was a sad apology for a smile  i left him because he constantly offered me beer and ive got such an awful desire for beer now somehow that i cant resist it so i came away  and theres no chance of any one offering me beer in this place  not much said north with a grin  but young feller and there was something earnestly kind in the mans manner here if you feel an awful desire for drink youd better put on this  he touched his bit of blue ribbon  no use returned sam sorrowfully i once put it on andandive broke the pledge  thats bad no doubt but what then returned north are we never to tell the truth any more cause once we told a lie  are we never to give up swearin cause once we uttered a curse  the lord is able to save us no matter how much we may have sinned  why sin is the very thing he saves us fromif well only come to him  sam shook his head but the manner of the man had attracted him and eventually he told all his story to him  reggie north listened earnestly but the noise of the disputants in the next box was so great that they rose intending to go to a quieter part of the large room the words they heard at the moment however arrested them  the speaker was for such a place a comparatively welldressed man and wore a topcoat  he was discoursing on poverty and its causes  it is nothing more nor less he said with emphasis than the absence of equality that produces so much poverty  hear hear cried several voices mingled with which however were the scoffing laughs of several men who knew too well and bitterly that the cause of their poverty was not the absence of equality but drink with improvidence  what right asked the man somewhat indignantly what right has sir crossly cowel for instance the great capitalist to his millions that e dont know what to do with when were starvin  hear he didnt earn these millions they was left to im by his father an he didnt earn em nor did his grandfather or his greatgrandfather and so back an back to the time of the robber who came over with williamthe greatest robber of allan stole the money or cattle from our forefathers  hear hear an what right has lord lorrumdoddy to the thousands of acres of land hes got  ha you may say that from an outrageously miserablelooking man who seemed too wretched to think and only spoke for a species of pastime what right has he i say to his lands  the ministers of religion too are to be blamed for they toady the rich and uphold the unjust system  my friends it is these rich capitalists and landowners who oppress the people  what right have they i ask again to their wealth when the inmates of this house and thousands of others are illfed and in rags  if i had my way hear hear and a laugh i would distribute the wealth of the country and have no poor people at all such as i see before mesuch as this poor fellow laying his hand on the shoulder of the outrageously miserable man who said just so feebly but seemed to shrink from his touch  do i not speak the truth he added looking round with the air of a man who feels that he carries his audience with him  well mister i aint just quite clear about that said reggie north rising up and looking over the heads of those in front of him  there was an immediate and complete silence for north had both a voice and a face fitted to command attention  im not a learned man you see an haint studied the subjec but isnt there a line in the bible which says blessed are they that consider the poor  now it do seem to me that if we was all equally rich there would be no poor to consider an no rich to consider em  there was a considerable guffaw at this and the argumentative man was about to reply but north checked him with  old on sir i aint done yet  you said that sir cowley cross  crossly cowel cried his opponent correcting  i ax your pardon sir crossly cowelthat e ad no right to is millions cause e didnt earn em and because is father left em to im  now i ad a grandmother with one eye poor thingbut of coorse thats nothin to do wi the argimentan she was left a fi pun note by er father as ad a game legthough thats nothin to do wi the argiment neither  now what puzzles me is that if sir cowcross  a great shout of laughter interrupted north here for he looked so innocently stupid that most of the audience saw he was making game of the social reformer  what puzzles me is continued north that if sir crossly cowel as no right to is millions my old grandmother ad no right to er fi pun note  hear hear and applause i dont know nothin about that there big thief willum you mentioned nor yet lord lorrumdoddy not bein ighly connected you see mates but no doubt this gentleman believes in is principles  of course i does said the social reformer indignantly  well then resumed north suddenly throwing off his sheepish look and sternly gazing at the reformer while he pointed to the outrageously miserable man who had neither coat vest shoes nor socks do you see that man  if you are in earnest take off your coat and give it to him what right have you to two coats when he has none  the reformer looked surprised and the proposal was received with loud laughter all the more that he seemed so little to relish the idea of parting with one of his coats in order to prove the justice of his principles and his own sincerity  to give his argument more force reggie north took a sixpence from his pocket and held it up  see here mates when i came to this house i said to myself the lord as given me success today in sellin his wordyou know some of you that im a seller of bibles and testaments  ay ay old boy  we know you said several voices  and i wasnt always that added north  thats true anyhow said a voice with a laugh  well  for what i was i might thank drink and a sinful heart  for what i am i thank the lord  but as i was goin to say i came here intendin to give this sixpenceit aint much but its all i can spareto some poor feller in distress for i practise what i preach and i meant to do it in a quiet way  but it seems to me that seein whats turned up ill do more good by givin it in a public wayso there it is old man and he put the sixpence on the table in front of the outrageously miserable man who could hardly believe his eyes  the change to an outrageously jovial man with the marks of misery still strong upon him was worthy of a pantomime and spoke volumes for small though the sum might seem to sir crossly cowel or lord lorrumdoddy it represented a full instead of an empty stomach and a peaceful instead of a miserable night to one wreck of humanity  the poor man swept the little coin into his pocket and rose in haste with a thank ee to go out and invest it at once but was checked by north  stop stop my fine fellow  not quite so fast  if youll wait till ive finished my little business here ill take you to where youll get some warm grub for nothin and maybe an old coat too  encouraged by such brilliant prospects the now joviallymiserable man sat down and waited while north and sam went to a more retired spot near the door where they resumed the confidential talk that had been interrupted  the first thing you must do my boy said north kindly is to return to your fathers ouse an that advice cuts two wayseavenward an earthward  oh no no no i can never return home replied sam hurriedly and thinking only of the shame of returning in his wretched condition to his earthly father  it was at this point that the couple had come under the sharp stern eye of number 666 who as we have seen went quietly out and conveyed the information direct to the twitter family    chapter twenty four  the returning prodigal  for a considerable time the bibleseller plied sam with every argument he could think of in order to induce him to return home and he was still in the middle of his effort when the door opened and two young men of gentlemanly appearance walked in bearing a portable harmonium between them  they were followed by one of the ladies of the beehive who devote all their timeand may we not add all their heartsto the rescue of the perishing  along with her came a tall sweetfaced girl  she was our friend hetty frog who after spending her days at steady work spent some of her night hours in labours of love  hetty was passionately fond of music and had taught herself to play the harmonium sufficiently to accompany simple hymns  after her came the missionary whose kind face was familiar to most of the homeless ones there  they greeted him with goodnatured familiarity but some of their faces assumed a somewhat vinegar aspect when the tall form of sir richard brandon followed seaward  a bloated haristocrat growled one of the men  got a smart little darter anyhow remarked another as di holding tight to her fathers hand glanced from side to side with looks of mingled pity and alarm  for poor little di had a not uncommon habit of investing everything in couleur de rose and the stern reality which met her had not the slightest tinge of that colour  di had pictured to herself clean rags and picturesque poverty  the reality was dirty rags and disgusting poverty  she had imagined sorrowful faces  had she noted them when the missionary passed she might indeed have seen kindly looks but when her father passed there were only scowling faces nearly all of which were unshaven and dirty  di had not thought at all of stubbly beards or dirt  neither had she thought of smells or of stifling heat that it was not easy to bear  altogether poor little di was taken down from a height on that occasion to which she never again attained because it was a false height  in after years she reached one of the true heightswhich was out of sight higher than the false one  there was something very businesslike in these missionaries for there was nothing of the simply amateur in their worklike the visit of di and her father  they were familiar with the eastend mines knew where splendid gems and rich gold were to be found and went about digging with the steady persistence of the labourer coupled however with the fire of the enthusiast  they carried the harmonium promptly to the most conspicuous part of the room planted it there opened it placed a stool in front of it and one of the brightest diamonds from that minein the person of hetty frogsat down before it  simply and in sweet silvery tones she sangcome to the saviour  the others joinedeven sir richard brandon made an attempt to singas he had done on a previous occasion but without much success musically speaking  meanwhile john seaward turned up the passage from which he had prepared to speak that evening  and so eloquent with natures simplicity was the missionary that the party soon forgot all about the twitters while the comforting gospel was being urged upon the unhappy creatures around  but we must not forget the twitters  they are our text and sermon just now  young sam twitter had risen with the intention of going out when the missionary entered for words of truth only cut him to the heart  but his companion whispered him to wait a bit  soon his attention was riveted  while he sat there spellbound a shabbygenteel man entered and sat down beside him  he wore a broad wideawake very much slouched over his face and a coat which had once been fine but now bore marks of having been severely handledas if recently rubbed by a drunken wearer on whitewashed and dirty places  the mans hands were not so dirty however as one might have expected from his general appearance and they trembled much  on one of his fingers was a gold ring  this incongruity was lost on sam who was too much absorbed to care for the new comer and did not even notice that he pushed somewhat needlessly close to him  these things were not however lost on reggie north who regarded the man with some surprise not unmixed with suspicion  when after a short time however this man laid his hand gently on that of sam and held it the boy could no longer neglect his eccentricities he naturally made an effort to pull the hand away but the stranger held it fast  having his mind by that time entirely detached from the discourse of the missionary sam looked at the stranger in surprise but could not see his face because of the disreputable wideawake which he wore  but great was his astonishment not to say alarm when he felt two or three warm tears drop on his hand  again he tried to pull it away but the strange man held it tighter still further he bent his head over it and kissed it  a strange unaccountable thrill ran through the boys frame  he stooped looked under the brim of the hat and beheld his father  sammydear dear sammy whispered the man in a husky voice  but sammy could not reply  he was thunderstruck  neither could his father speak for he was choking  but reggie north had heard enough  he was quickwitted and at once guessed the situation  now then old genlmn he whispered dont you go an make a fuss if youre wise  go out as quiet as you came in an leave this young un to me  its all right  im on your side  samuel twitter senior was impressed with the honesty of the mans manner and the wisdom of his advice  letting go the hand after a parting squeeze he rose up and left the room  two minutes later north and sammy followed  they found the old father outside who again grasped his sons hand with the words sammy my boydear sammy but he never got further than that  number 666 was there too  youll find the cab at the end of the street sir he said and next moment sammy found himself borne alongnot unwillinglyby north and his father  a cab door was opened  a female form was seen with outstretched arms  mother  sammydarling  the returning prodigal disappeared into the cab  mr twitter turned round  thank you  god bless you whoever you are he said fumbling in his vest pocket having forgotten that he represented an abject beggar and had no money there  no thanks to me sir  look higher said the bibleseller thrusting the old gentleman almost forcibly into the vehicle  now then cabby drive on  the cabby obeyed  having already received his instructions he did not drive home  where he drove to is a matter of small consequence  it was to an unknown house and a perfect stranger to sammy opened the door mrs twitter remained in the cab while sammy and his father entered the house the latter carrying a bundle in his hand  they were shown into what the boy must have consideredif he considered anything at all just thena preposterously small room  the lady of the house evidently expected them for she said the bath is quite ready sir  now sammydear boy said mr twitter off with your ragsand ggit into that bbath  obviously mr twitter did not speak with ease  in truth it was all he could do to contain himself and he felt that his only chance of bearing up was to say nothing more than was absolutely necessary in short ejaculatory phrases  sammy was deeply touched and began to wash his dirty face with a few quiet tears before taking his bath  now then sammylook sharp  you didnt usetobesoslow eh  no father  i suppose ititis want of habit  i havent undressed much of late  this very nearly upset poor mr twitter  he made no reply but assisted his son to disrobe with a degree of awkwardness that tended to delay progress  itits not too hoteh  oh no father  itsitsvvery nice  go at it with a will sammy  head and all my boydown with it  and dont spare the soap  lots of soap here sammyno end of soap  the truth of which mr twitter proceeded to illustrate by covering his son with a lather that caused him quickly to resemble whipped cream  oh hold on father its getting into my eyes  my boydear sammyforgive me  i didnt quite know what i was doing never mind  down you go again sammyhead and all  thats it  now thats enough out you come  oh father said the poor boy while invisible tears trickled over his wet face as he stepped out of the bath its so good of you to forgive me so freely  forgive you my son forgive why idid he could say no more but suddenly clasped sammy to his heart thereby rendering his face and person soapsuddy and wet to a ridiculous extent  unclasping his arms and stepping back he looked down at himself  you dirty boy what dyou mean by it  its your own fault daddy replied sam with a hysterical laugh as he enveloped himself in a towel  a knock at the bathroom door here produced dead silence  please sir said a female voice the lady in the cab sends to say that shes gettin impatient  tell the lady in the cab to drive about and take an airing for ten minutes replied mr twitter with reckless hilarity  yes sir  now my boy heres your toggery said the irrepressible father hovering round his recovered son like a moth round a candleyour best suit sammy the one you used to wear only on sundays you extravagant fellow  sammy put it on with some difficulty from want of practice and after combing out and brushing his hair he presented such a changed appearance that none of his late companions could have recognised him his father after fastening up his coat with every button in its wrong hole and causing as much delay as possible by assisting him to dress finally hustled him downstairs and into the cab where he was immediately reenveloped by mrs twitter  he was not permitted to see any one that night but was taken straight to his room where his mother comforted prayed with fed and fondled him and then allowed him to go to bed  next morning earlybefore breakfastmrs twitter assembled all the little twitters and put them on chairs in a rowaccording to order for mrs twitters mind was orderly in a remarkable degree  they ranged from right to left thus  molly willie fred lucy and alicewith alices doll on a dolls chair at the left flank of the line  now children said mrs twitter sitting down in front of the row with an aspect so solemn that they all immediately made their mouths very small and their eyes very largein which respect they brought themselves into wonderful correspondence with alices doll  now children your dear brother sammy has come home  oh how nice  where has he been  what has he seen  why has he been away so long  how jolly were the various expressions with which the news was received  silence  the stillness that followed was almost oppressive for the little twitters had been trained to prompt obedience  to say truth they had not been difficult to train for they were all essentially mild  now remember when he comes down to breakfast you are to take no notice whatever of his having been awayno notice at all  are we not even to say goodmorning or kiss him mamma asked little alice with a look of wonder  dear child you do not understand me  we are all charmed to see sammy back and so thankfulso gladthat he has come and we will kiss him and say whatever we please to him except here she cast an awful eye along the line and dropped her voice except ask him wherehe hasbeen  maynt we ask him how he liked it mamma said alice  liked what child  where he has been mamma  no not a word about where he has been only that we are so glad so very glad to see him back  fred who had an argumentative turn of mind thought that this would be a rather demonstrative though indirect recognition of the fact that sammy had been somewhere that was wrong but having been trained to unquestioning obedience fred said nothing  now dolly whispered little alice bending down member datyoure so glad sammys come back mustnt say morenot a word more  it is enough for you to know my darlings continued mrs twitter that sammy has been wandering and has come back  listen dolly you hear  sammys been wandering an come back  dats nuff for you  you see dears continued mrs twitter with a slightly perplexed look caused by her desire to save poor sammys feelings and her anxiety to steer clear of the slightest approach to deception you see sammy has been long away and has been very tired and wont like to be troubled with too many questions at breakfast you know so i want you all to talk a good deal about anything you likeyour lessonsfor instance when he comes down  before we say goodmorning mamma or after asked alice who was extremely conscientious  darling child exclaimed the perplexed mother youll never take it in  what i want to impress on you is  she stopped suddenly and what it was she meant to impress we shall never more clearly know for at that moment the foot of sammy himself was heard on the stair  now mind children not a wordnotaword  the almost preternatural solemnity induced by this injunction was at once put to flight by sammy at whom the whole family flew with one accord and a united shriekpulling him down on a chair and embracing him almost to extinction  fortunately for sammy and his anxious mother that which the most earnest desire to obey orders would have failed to accomplish was brought about by the native selfishness of poor humanity for the first burst of welcome over alice began an elaborate account of her dollys recent proceedings which seemed to consist of knocking her head against articles of furniture punching out her own eyes and flattening her own nose while fred talked of his latest efforts in shipbuilding willie of his hopes in regard to soldiering and lucy of her attempts to draw and paint  mr and mrs twitter contented themselves with gazing on sammys somewhat worn face and lying in watch so that when alice or any of the young members of the flock seemed about to stray on the forbidden ground they should be ready to descend like two wolves on the fold remorselessly change the subject of conversation and carry all before them  thus tenderly was that prodigal son received back to his fathers house    chapter twenty five  canada againand surprising news  it is most refreshing to those who have been long cooped up in a city to fly on the wings of steam to the country and take refuge among the scents of flowers and fields and trees  we have said this or something like it before and remorselessly repeat itfor it is a grand truism  let us then indulge ourselves a little with a glance at the farm of brankly in canada  lake ontario with its expanse of boundless blue rolls like an ocean in the far distance  we can see it from the hilltop where the sweetsmelling redpines grow  at the bottom of the hill lies brankly itself with its orchards and homestead and fields of golden grain and its little river with the little sawmill going as pertinaciously as if it like the river had resolved to go on for ever  cattle are there sheep are there horses and wagons are there wealth and prosperity are there above all happiness is there because there also dwells the love of god  it is a good many years reader since you and i were last here  then the farm buildings and fences were brandnew  now although of course not old they bear decided traces of exposure to the weather  but these marks only give compactness of look and unity of tone to everything improving the appearance of the place vastly  the fences which at first looked blank and staring as if wondering how they had got there are now more in harmony with the fields they enclose  the plants which at first struggled as if unwillingly on the dwellinghouse now cling to it and climb about it with the affectionate embrace of old friends  everything is improvedwell no not everything  mr merryboys legs have not improved  they will not move as actively as they were wont to do  they will not go so far and they demand the assistance of a stick  but mr merryboys spirit has improvedthough it was pretty good before and his tendency to universal philanthropy has increased to such an extent that the people of the district have got into a way of sending their bad men and boys to work on his farm in order that they may become good  mrs merryboy however has improved in every way and is more blooming than ever as well as a trifle stouter but mrs merryboy senior although advanced spiritually has degenerated a little physically  the few teeth that kept her nose and chin apart having disappeared her mouth has also vanished though there is a decided mark which tells where it wasespecially when she speaks or smiles  the hair on her forehead has become as pure white as the winter snows of canada wrinkles on her visage have become the rule not the exception but as they all run into comical twists and play in the forms of humour they may perhaps be regarded as a physical improvement  she is stone deaf now but this also may be put to the credit side of her account for it has rendered needless those awkward efforts to speak loud and painful attempts to hear which used to trouble the family in days gone by  it is quite clear however when you look into grannys coalblack eyes that if she were to live to the age of methuselah she will never be blind nor illnatured nor less pleased with herself her surroundings and the whole order of things created  but who are these that sit so gravely and busily engaged with breakfast as though they had not the prospect of another meal that year  two young men and a young girl  one young man is broad and powerful though short with an incipient moustache and a fluff of whisker  the other is rather tall slim and gentlemanly and still beardless  the girl is little neat wellmade at the budding period of life brownhaired browneyed round softjust such a creature as one feels disposed to pat on the head and say my little pet  why these are two waifs and a stray  dont you know them  look again  is not the stout fellow our friend bobby frog the slim one tim lumpy and the girl martha mild  but who in all london would believe that these were children who had bean picked out of the gutter nobodyexcept those good samaritans who had helped to pick them up and who could show you the photographs of what they once were and what they now are  mr merryboy although changed a little as regards legs was not in the least deteriorated as to lungs  as granny mrs merryboy and the young people sat at breakfast he was heard at an immense distance off gradually making his way towards the house  something seems to be wrong with father this morning i think said mrs merryboy junior listening  granny observing the action pretended to listen and smiled  hes either unusually jolly or unusually savagea little more tea mother said tim lumpy pushing in his cup  tim being fatherandmotherless called mr merryboy father and the wife mother  so did martha but bobby frog remembering those whom he had left at home loyally declined though he did not object to call the elder mrs merryboy granny  something for good or evil must have happened said bobby laying down his knife and fork as the growling sound drew nearer  at last the door flew open and the storm burst in  and we may remark that mr merryboys stormy nature was if possible a little more obtrusive than it used to be for whereas in former days his toes and heels did most of the rattlingthunder business the stick now came into play as a prominent creator of dinnot only when flourished by hand but often on its own account and unexpectedly when propped clumsily in awkward places  hallo good people all how are ee morningmorning  boys dee know that the sawmills come to grief  no are you in earnest father cried tim jumping up  in earnest  of course i am  pretty engineers you are  sawed its own bed in two or burst itself  dont know which and whats more i dont care  come martha my bantam chicken lets have a cup of tea  bother that stick it cant keep its legs much better than myself  how are you mother  glorious weather isnt it  mr merryboy ignored deafness  he continued to speak to his mother just as though she heard him  and she continued to nod and smile and makebelieve to hear with more demonstration of face and cap than ever  after all her total loss of hearing made little difference her sentiments being what bobby frog in his early days would have described in the words wots the hodds so long as youre appy  but bobby had now ceased to drop or misapply his aitchesthough he still had some trouble with his rs  as he was chief engineer of the sawmill having turned out quite a mechanical genius he ran down to the scene of disaster with much concern on hearing the old gentlemans report  and truly when he and tim reached the picturesque spot where at the waters edge among fine trees and shrubs the mill stood clearly reflected in its own dam they found that the mischief done was considerable  the machinery by which the frame with its log to be sawn was moved along quarterinch by quarterinch at each stroke was indeed all right but it had not been made selfregulating  the result was that on one of the attendant workmen omitting to do his duty the saw not only ripped off a beautiful plank from a log but continued to crosscut the end of the heavy framework and then proceeded to cut the iron which held the log in its place  the result of course was that the iron refused to be cut and savagely revenged itself by scraping off flattening down turning up and otherwise damaging the teeth of the saw  hm that comes of haste muttered bob as he surveyed the wreck  if i had taken time to make the whole affair complete before setting the mill to work this would not have happened  never mind bob we must learn by experience you know said tim examining the damage done with a critical eye  luckily we have a spare saw in the store  run and fetch it said bob to the man in charge of the mill whose carelessness had caused the damage and who stared silently at his work with a look of horrified resignation  when he was gone bob and tim threw off their coats rolled up their sleeves to the shoulder and set to work with a degree of promptitude and skill which proved them to be both earnest and capable workmen  the first thing to be done was to detach the damaged saw from its frame  there said bob as he flung it down you wont use your teeth again on the wrong subject for some time to come  have we dry timber heavy enough to mend the frame tim  plentymore than we want  well you go to work on it while i fix up the new saw  to work the two went accordinglyadjusting screwing squaring sawing planing mortising until the dinnerbell called them to the house  so soon exclaimed bob dinner is a great bother when a man is very busy  dye think so bob  well now i look on it as a great comfort specially when youre hungry  ah but thats because you are greedy tim  you always were too fond o your grub  come bob no slang  you know that mother doesnt like it  by the way talkin of mothers is it on wednesday or thursday that you expect your mother  thursday my boy replied bob with a bright look  ha that will be a day for me  so it will bob im glad for your sake returned tim with a sigh which was a very unusual expression of feeling for him  his friend at once understood its significance  tim my boy im sorry for you  i wish i could split my mother in two and give you half of her  yes said tim somewhat absently it is sad to have not one soul in the world related to you  but there are many who care for you as much as if they were relations said bob taking his friends arm as they approached the house  come along come along youngsters shouted mr merryboy from the window the dinners gettin cold and grannys gettin in a passion look sharp  if you knew what news i have for you youd look sharper  what news sir asked bob as they sat down to a table which did not exactly groan with viandsit was too strong for thatbut which was heavily weighted therewith  i wont tell you till after dinnerjust to punish you for being late besides it might spoil your appetite  but suspense is apt to spoil appetite father isnt it said tim who well accustomed to the old farmers eccentricities did not believe much in the news he professed to have in keeping  well then you must just lose your appetites for i wont tell you said mr merryboy firmly  it will do you goodeh mother wont a touch of starvation improve them bring back the memory of old times eh  the old lady observing that her son was addressing her shot forth such a beam of intelligence and goodwill that it was as though a gleam of sunshine had burst into the room  i knew youd agree with meha ha you always do mother cried the farmer flinging his handkerchief at a small kitten which was sporting on the floor and went into fits of delight at the attention  after dinner the young men were about to return to their sawmill when mr merryboy called them back  what would you say boys to hear that sir richard brandon with a troop of emigrants is going to settle somewhere in canada  i would think hed gone mad sir or changed his nature responded bob  well as to whether hes gone mad or not i cant tellhe may have changed his nature who knows  thats not beyond the bounds of possibility  anyway he is coming  ive got a letter from a friend of mine in london who says he read it in the papers  but perhaps you may learn more about it in that  he tossed a letter to bob who eagerly seized it  from sister hetty he cried and tore it open  the complete unity and unanimity of this family was well illustrated by the fact that bob began to read the letter aloud without asking leave and without apology  dearest bob it ran you will get this letter only a mail before our arrival  i had not meant to write again but cannot resist doing so to give you the earliest news about it  sir richard has changed his mind you know in my last i told you he had helped to assist several poor families from this quarteras well as mother and me and matty  he is a real friend to the poor for he doesnt merely fling coppers and old clothes at them but takes trouble to find out about them and helps them in the way that seems best for each  its all owing to that sweet miss di who comes so much about here that shes almost as wellknown as giles scott the policeman or our missionary  by the way giles has been made an inspector lately and has got no end of medals and a silver watch and other testimonials for bravery in saving people from fires and canals and cart wheels andhes a wonderful man is giles and they say his son is to be taken into the force as soon as hes old enough  hes big enough and sensible enough already and looks twice his age  after all if he can knock people down and take people up and keep order what does it matter how young he is  but im wandering i always do wander bob when i write to you  well as i was saying sir richard has changed his mind and has resolved to emigrate himself with miss di and a whole lot of friends and workpeople  he wants as he says to establish a colony of likeminded people and so you may be sure that all who have fixed to go with him are followers of the lord jesusand not ashamed to say so  as i had already taken our passages in the amazon steamer  the amazon interrupted mr merryboy with a shout why that steamer has arrived already  so it has said bob becoming excited their letter must have been delayed and they must have come by the same steamer that brought it why theyll be here immediately  perhaps tonight exclaimed mrs merryboy  oh how nice murmured martha her great brown eyes glittering with joy at the near prospect of seeing that hetty about whom she had heard so much  impossible said tim lumpy coming down on them all with his wetblanket of commonsense  they would never come on without dropping us a line from quebec or montreal to announce their arrival  thats true tim said mr merryboy but youve not finished the letter bobgo on  mother mother what a variety of faces you are making  this also was true for old mrs merryboy seeing that something unusual was occurring had all this time been watching the various speakers with her coalblack eyes changing aspect with their varied expressions and wrinkling her visage up into such inexpressible contortions of sympathetic goodwill that she really could not have been more sociable if she had been in full possession and use of her five senses  as i had already continued bob reading taken our passages in the amazon steamer sir richard thought it best that we should come on before along with his agent who goes to see after the land so that we might have a good long stay with you and dear mr and mrs merryboy who have been so kind to you before going on to brandonwhich i believe is the name of the place in the backwoods where sir richard means us all to go to  i dont know exactly where it isand i dont know anybody who does but thats no matter  enough for mother and matty and me to know that its within a few hundred miles of you which is very different from three thousand miles of an ocean  youll also be glad to hear that mr twitter with all his family is to join this band  it quite puts me in mind of the story of the pilgrim fathers that i once heard in dear mr hollands meeting hall long ago i wish he could come too and all his people with him and all the ladies from the beehive  wouldnt that be charming  but thenwho would be left to look after london  no it is better that they should remain at home  poor mr twitter never quite got the better of his fire you see so he sold his share in his business and is getting ready to come  his boys and girls will be a great help to him in canada instead of a burden as they have been in londonthe younger ones i mean of course for molly and sammy and willie have been helping their parents for a long time past  i dont think mrs twitter quite likes it and im sure shes almost breaking her heart at the thought of leaving george yard  it is said that their friends mrs loper mrs larrabel stickler and crackaby want to join but i rather think sir richard isnt very keen to have them  mr stephen welland is also coming  one of sir richards friends mr brisbane i think got him a good situation in the mint thats where all the money is coined you knowbut on hearing of this expedition to canada he made up his mind to go there instead so he gave up the mintvery unwillingly however i believe for he wanted very much to go into the mint  now no more at present from your loving and much hurried sister for im in the middle of packing hetty  now while bob frog was in the act of putting hettys letter in his pocket a little boy was seen on horseback galloping up to the door  he brought a telegram addressed to mr robert frog  it was from montreal and ran thus we have arrived and leave this on tuesday forenoon  why theyre almost here now cried bob  harness up my boy and off you gonot a moment to lose cried mr merryboy as bob dashed out of the room  take the bays bob he added in a stentorian voice thrusting his head out of the window and the biggest wagon  dont forget the rugs  ten minutes later and bob frog with tim lumpy beside him was driving the spanking pair of bays to the railway station    chapter twenty six  happy meetings  it was to the same railway station as that at which they had parted from their guardian and been handed over to mr merryboy years before that bobby frog now drove  the train was not due for half an hour  tim said bob after they had walked up and down the platform for about five minutes how slowly time seems to fly when ones in a hurry  doesnt it assented tim crawls like a snail  tim said bob after ten minutes had elapsed what a difficult thing it is to wait patiently when ones anxious  isnt it assented tim so hard to keep from fretting and stamping  tim said bob after twenty minutes had passed i wonder if the two or three dozen people on this platform are all as uncomfortably impatient as i am  perhaps they are said tim but certainly possessed of more power to restrain themselves  tim said bob after the lapse of fiveandtwenty minutes did you ever hear of such a long halfhour since you were born  never replied the sympathetic tim except once long ago when i was starving and stood for about that length of time in front of a confectioners window till i nearly collapsed and had to run away at last for fear i should smash in the glass and feed  tim ill take a look round and see that the bays are all right  youve done that four times already bob  well ill do it five times tim  theres luck you know in odd numbers  there was a sharpish curve on the line close to the station  while bob frog was away the train being five minutes before its time came thundering round the curve and rushed alongside the platform  bob ran back of course and stood vainly trying to see the people in each carriage as it went past  oh what a sweet eager face exclaimed tim gazing after a young girl who had thrust her head out of a firstclass carriage  let alone sweet faces timthis way  the third classes are all behind  by this time the train had stopped and great was the commotion as friends and relatives met or said goodbye hurriedly and bustled into and out of the carriagescommotion which was increased by the cheering of a fresh band of rescued waifs going to new homes in the west and the hissing of the safety valve which took it into its head at that inconvenient moment to let off superfluous steam  some of the people rushing about on that platform and jostling each other would have been the better for safety valves poor bobby frog was one of these  not there he exclaimed despairingly as he looked into the last carriage of the train  impossible said tim weve only missed them walk back  they went back looking eagerly into carriage after carriagebob even glancing under the seats in a sort of wild hope that his mother might be hiding there but no one resembling mrs frog was to be seen  a commotion at the front part of the train more pronounced than the general hubbub attracted their attention  oh where is hewhere is he cried a female voice which was followed up by the female herself a respectable elderly woman who went about the platform scattering people right and left in a fit of temporary insanity where is my bobby where is he i say  oh why wont people git out o my way  git out o the way shoving a sluggish man forcibly where are you bobby  boooooby  it was mrs frog  bob saw her but did not move  his heart was in his throat  he could not move  as he afterwards said he was struck all of a heap and could only stand and gaze with his hands clasped  out o the way young man cried mrs frog brushing indignantly past him in one of her erratic bursts  oh  bobbywhere has that boy gone to  mother gasped bob  who said that cried mrs frog turning round with a sharp look as if prepared to retort youre another on the shortest notice  mother again said bob unclasping his hands and holding them out  mrs frog had hitherto regardless of the wellknown effect of time kept staring at heads on the level which bobbys had reached when he left home  she now looked up with a startled expression  can itis itoh  bo she got no further but sprang forward and was caught and fervently clasped in the arms of her son  tim fluttered round them blowing his nose violently though quite free from cold in the headwhich complaint indeed is not common in those regions  hetty who had lost her mother in the crowd now ran forward with matty bob saw them let go his mother and received one in each arm squeezing them both at once to his capacious bosom  mrs frog might have fallen though that was not probable but tim made sure of her by holding out a hand which the good woman grasped and laid her head on his breast quite willing to make use of him as a convenient post to lean against while she observed the meeting of the young people with a contented smile  tim observed that meeting too but with very different feelings for the sweet eager face that he had seen in the firstclass carriage belonged to hetty  longcontinued love to human souls had given to her face a sweetnessand sympathy with human spirits and bodies in the depths of poverty sorrow and deep despair had invested it with a pitiful tenderness and refinementwhich one looks for more naturally among the innocent in the higher ranks of life  poor tim gazed unutterably and his heart went on in such a way that even mrs frogs attention was arrested  looking up she asked if he was took bad  oh dear no  by no means said tim quickly  youre tremblin so she returned an it aint coldbut your colours all right  i suppose its the natur o you canadians  but only to think that my bobby she added quitting her leaningpost and again seizing her son that my bobby should ave growd up an his poor mother knowed nothink about it  i cant believe my eyesit aint like bobby a bit yet someow i know its im  why youve growd into a gentleman you ave  and you have grown into a flatterer said bob with a laugh  but come mother this way ive brought the wagon for you  look after the luggage timoh  i forgot  this is tim hettytim lumpy  you remember you used to see us playing together when we were city arabs  hetty looked at tim and remembering bobbys strong love for jesting did not believe him  she smiled however and bowed to the tall goodlooking youth who seemed unaccountably shy and confused as he went off to look after the luggage  here is the wagon come along said bob leading his mother out of the station  the waggin boy i dont see no waggin  why there with the pair of bay horses  you dont mean the carridge by the fence do you  well yes only we call them wagons here  an you calls the osses bay osses do you  well now i would call em beautiful osses but i suppose bay means the same thing here  youve got strange ways in canada  yes mother and pleasant ways too as i hope you shall find out ere long  get in now  take care  now then hettycome matty  how difficult to believe that such a strapping young thing can be the squalling matty i left in london  matty laughed as she got in by way of reply for she did not yet quite believe in her big brother  do you drive tim ill stay inside said bob  in another moment the spanking bays were whirling the wagon over the road to brankly farm at the rate of ten miles an hour  need it be said that the amiable merryboys did not fail of their duty on that occasion  that hetty and matty took violently to browneyed martha at first sight having heard all about her from bob long agoas she of them that mrs merryboy was we may say one glowing beam of hospitality that mrs frog was so to speak one blazing personification of amazement which threatened to become chronicthere was so much that was contrary to previous experience and she was so slow to take it in that mr merryboy became noisier than ever and that what between his stick and his legs to say nothing of his voice he managed to create in one day hubbub enough to last ten families for a fortnight that the domestics and the dogs were sympathetically joyful that even the kitten gave unmistakeable evidences of unusual hilarity though some attributed the effect to surreptitiouslyobtained cream and finally that old granny became something like a chinese image in the matter of nodding and gazing and smirking and wrinkling so that there seemed some danger of her terminating her career in a gush of universal philanthropyneed all this be said we ask  we think not therefore we wont say it  but it was not till bob frog got his mother all to himself under the trees near the waterfall down by the river that drove the still unmended sawmill that they had real and satisfactory communion  it would have been interesting to have listened to these twowith memories and sympathies and feelings towards the saviour of sinners so closely intertwined yet with knowledge and intellectual powers in many respects so far apart  but we may not intrude too closely  towards the end of their walk bob touched on a subject which had been uppermost in the minds of both all the time but from which they had shrunk equally the one being afraid to ask the other disinclined to tell  mother said bob at last what about father  ah  bobby replied mrs frog beginning to weep gently i knowd ye would come to thatyou was always so fond of im an he was so fond o you too indeed  i know it mother interrupted bob but have you never heard of him  never  i might ave praps if hed bin took an tried under his own name but you know he had so many aliases an the old ouse we used to live in we was obliged to quit so praps he tried to find us and couldnt  may god help himdear father said the son in a low sad voice  id never ave left im bobby if he adnt left me  you know that an if i thought he was alive and knowd were he was id go back to im yet but  the subject was dropped here for the new mill came suddenly into view and bob was glad to draw his mothers attention to it  see we were mending that just before we got the news you were so near us  come ill show it to you  tim lumpy and i made it all by ourselves and i think youll call it a firstclass article  by the way how came you to travel firstclass  oh thats all along of sir richard brandon  hes sitch a liberal gentleman an said that as it was by his advice we were goin to canada he would pay our expenses and hes so grand that he never remembered there was any other class but first when he took the tickets an when he was showd what hed done he laughed an said he wouldnt alter it an we must go all the way firstclass  hes a strange man but a good un  by this time they had reached the platform of the damaged sawmill and bob pointed out with elaborate care the details of the mill in all its minute particulars commenting specially on the fact that most of the telling improvements on it were due to the fertile brain and inventive genius of tim lumpy  he also explained the different kinds of sawsthe ripping saw and the crosscut saw and the circular saw and the eccentric sawjust as if his mother were an embryo millwright for he felt that she took a deep interest in it all and mrs frog listened with the profound attention of a civil engineer and remarked on everything with such comments asoh indeed ah well now aint it wonderful amazin an you made it all too  oh  bobbyand other more or less appropriate phrases  on quitting the mill to return to the house they saw a couple of figures walking down another avenue so absorbed in conversation that they did not at first observe bob and his mother or take note of the fact that matty being a bouncing girl had gone after butterflies or some such childalluring insects  it was tim lumpy and hetty frog  and no wonder that they were absorbed for was not their conversation on subjects of the profoundest interest to bothgeorge yard whitechapel commercial street spitalfields and the sailors home and the rests and all the other agencies for rescuing poor souls in monstrous london and the teachers and school companions whom they had known there and never could forget  no wonder we say that these two were absorbed while comparing notes and still less wonder that they were even more deeply absorbed when they got upon the theme of bobby frogso much loved nay almost worshipped by both  at last they observed mrs frogs scarlet shawlwhich was very conspicuousand her son and tried to look unconscious and wondered with quite needless surprise where matty could have gone to  bobby frog being a sharp youth noted these things but made no comment to any one for the air of canada had somehow invested this waif with wonderful delicacy of feeling  although bob and his mother left off talking of ned frog somewhat abruptly as well as sorrowfully it does not follow that we are bound to do the same  on the contrary we now ask the reader to leave brankly farm rather abruptly and return to london for the purpose of paying ned a visit    chapter twenty seven  a strange visit and its results  edward frog birdfancier pugilist etcetera and the etcetera represents an unknown quantity has changed somewhat like the rest for a few years have thinned the shortcropped though once curly locks above his knotted forehead besides sprinkling them with grey  but in other respects he has not fallen offnay he has rather improved owing to the peculiar system of diet and discipline and regularity of life to which during these years he has been subjected  when ned returned from what we may style his outing he went straight to the old court with something like a feeling of anxiety in his heart but found the old home deserted and the old door which still bore deep marks of his knuckle on the upper panels and his boots on the lower was padlocked  he inquired for mrs frog but was told she had left the place long agoand no one knew where she had gone  with a heavy heart ned turned from the door and sauntered away friendless and homeless  he thought of making further inquiries about his family but at the corner of the street smelt the old shop that had swallowed up so much of his earnings  if id ony put it all in the savins bank he said bitterly stopping in front of the ginpalace id ave bin well off today  an old comrade turned the corner at that moment  what  ned frog he cried seizing his hand and shaking it with genuine goodwill  well this is good luck  come along old boy  it was pleasant to the desolate man to be thus recognised  he went along like an ox to the slaughter though unlike the ox he knew well what he was going to  he was treated  he drank beer  other old friends came in  he drank gin  if good resolves had been coming up in his mind earlier in the day he forgot them now  if better feelings had been struggling for the mastery he crushed them now  he got drunk  he became disorderly  he went into high street whitechapel with a view to do damage to somebody  he succeeded  he tumbled over a barrow and damaged his own shins  he encountered number 666 soon after and through his influence passed the night in a police cell  after this ned gave up all thought of searching for his wife and family  better let em alone he growled to himself on being discharged from the policeoffice with a caution  but as we have said or hinted elsewhere ned was a man of iron will he resolved to avoid the publichouse to drink in moderation and to do his drinking at home  being as powerful and active as ever he had been he soon managed in the capacity of a common labourer to scrape enough money together to enable him to retake his old garret which chanced to be vacant  indeed its situation was so airy and it was so undesirable that it was almost always vacant  he bought a few cages and birds found that the old manager of the low musichall was still at work and ready to employ him and thus fell very much into his old line of life  one night as he was passing into his place of businessthe musichalla man saw him and recognised him  this was a city missionary of the john seaward type who chanced to be fishing for souls that night in these troubled waters  there are many such fishermen about thank god doing their grand work unostentatiously and not only rescuing souls for eternity but helping more perhaps than even the best informed are aware of to save london from tremendous evil  what it was in ned frog that attracted this man of god we know note but after casting his lines for some hours in other places he returned to the musichall and loitered about the door  at a late hour its audience came pouring out with discordant cries and ribald laughter  soon ned appeared and took his way homeward  the missionary followed at a safe distance till he saw ned disappear through the doorway that led to his garret  then running forward he entered the dark passage and heard neds heavy foot clanking on the stone steps as he mounted upwards  the sound became fainter and the missionary fearing lest he should fail to find the room in which his man dweltfor there were many rooms in the old tenementran hastily upstairs and paused to listen  the footsteps were still sounding above him but louder now because ned was mounting a wooden stair  a few seconds later a heavy door was banged and all was quiet  the city missionary now groped his way upwards until he came to the highest landing where in the thick darkness he saw a light under a door  with a feeling of uncertainty and a silent prayer for help he knocked gently  the door was opened at once by a middleaged woman whose outline only could be seen her back being to the light  is it here that the man lives who came up just now asked the missionary  what man she replied fiercely i know nothink about men an ave nothink to do with em  ned frogs the ony man as ever comes ere an he lives up there  she made a motion as if pointing upwards somewhere and banged the door in her visitors face  up there  the missionary had reached the highest landing and saw no other gleam of light anywhere  groping about however his hand struck against a ladder  all doubt as to the use of this was immediately banished for a mans heavy tread was heard in the room above as he crossed it  mounting the ladder the missionary instead of coming to a higher landing as he had expected thrust his hat against a trapdoor in the roof  immediately he heard a savage human growl  evidently the man was in a bad humour but the missionary knocked  whos there demanded the man fiercely for his visitors were few and these generally connected with the police force  may i come in asked the missionary in a mild voicenot that he put the mildness on for the occasion  he was naturally mildadditionally so by grace  oh yesyou may come in cried the man lifting the trapdoor  the visitor stepped into the room and was startled by ned letting fall the trapdoor with a crash that shook the whole tenement  planting himself upon it he rendered retreat impossible  it was a trying situation for the man was in a savage humour and evidently the worse for drink  but missionaries are bold men  now demanded ned what may you want  i want your soul replied his visitor quietly  you neednt trouble yourself then for the devils got it already  nohe has not got it yet ned  oh you know me then  no  i never saw you till tonight but i learned your name accidentally and im anxious about your soul  you dont know me ned repeated slowly you never saw me till tonight yet youre anxious about my soul  what stuff are you talkin ow can that be  now you have puzzled me said the missionary  i cannot tell how that can be but it is no stuff i assure you  i think it probable however that your own experience may help you  didnt you once see a young girl whom you had never seen before whom you didnt know whom you had never even heard of yet you became desperately anxious to win her  ned instantly thought of a certain woman whom he had often abused and beaten and whose heart he had probably broken  yes he said i did but then i had falled in love wi her at first sight and you cant have falled in love wi me you know  ned grinned at this idea in spite of himself  well no replied the missionary not exactly  youre not a very lovable object to look at just now  nevertheless i am anxious about your soul at first sight  i cant tell how it is but so it is  come now said ned becoming suddenly stern  i dont believe in your religion or your bible or your prayin and psalmsingin  i tell you plainly im a infidel  but if you can say anything in favour o your views fire away ill listen only dont let me have any o your singsongin or whinin else ill kick you down the trapdoor and down the stair an up the court and out into the streetspeak out like a man  i will speak as god the holy spirit shall enable me returned the missionary without the slightest change in tone or manner  well then sit down said ned pointing to the only chair in the room while he seated himself on the rickety table which threatened to give way altogether while the reckless man swung his right leg to and fro quite regardless of its complainings  have you ever studied the bible asked the missionary somewhat abruptly  well no of course not  im not a parson but i have read a bit here and there an its all rubbish  i dont believe a word of it  theres a part of it returned the visitor which says that god maketh his rain to fall on the just and on the unjust  do you not believe that  of course i do  a man cant help believin that for he sees itit falls on houses fields birds and beasts as well  then you do believe a word of it  oh come youre a deal too sharp  you know what i mean  no said his visitor quickly i dont quite know what you mean  one who professes to be an infidel professes more or less intelligent disbelief in the bible yet you admit that you have never studied the book which you profess to disbelievemuch less i suppose have you studied the books which give us the evidences of its truth  dont suppose mr parson or missioner or whatever you are said ned that youre goin to floor me wi your larnin  im too old a bird for that  do you suppose that im bound to study everything on the face o the earth like a lawyer before im entitled to say i dont believe it  if i see that a thing dont work well thats enough for me to condemn it  youre quite right there  i quite go with that line of reasoning  by their fruits shall ye know them  a man dont usually go to a thistle to find grapes  but let me ask you ned do you usually find that murderers drunkards burglars thieves and blackguards in general are students of the bible and given to prayer and psalmsinging  ha ha  i should rather think not said ned much tickled by the supposition  then continued the other tell me honestly ned do you find that people who read gods word and sing his praise and ask his blessing on all they do are generally bad fathers and mothers and masters and servants and children and that from their ranks come the worst people in society  now look here mr missioner cried ned leaping suddenly from the table which overturned with a crash im one o them fellers thats not to be floored by a puff o wind  i can hold my own agin most men wi fist or tongue  but i like fairplay in the ring or in argiment  i have not studied this matter as you say an so i wont speak on it but ill look into it an if you come back here this day three weeks ill let you know what i think  you may trust me for when i say a thing i mean it  will you accept a testament then said the missionary rising and pulling one out of his pocket  no i wont said ned ive got one  the missionary looked surprised and hesitated  dont you believe me asked ned angrily  at first i did not was the reply but now that i stand before your face and look in your eyes i do believe you  ned gave a cynical laugh  youre easy to gull he said why when it serves my purpose i can lie like a trooper  i know that returned the visitor quietly but it serves your purpose tonight to speak the truth  i can see that  may i pray that god should guide you  yes you may but not here  ill have no hypocritical goin down on my knees till i see my way to it  if i dont see my way to it ill let you know when you come back this day three weeks  well ill pray for you in my own room ned frog  you may do what you like in your own room  goodnight  he lifted the trapdoor as he spoke and pointed downward  the missionary at once descended after a brief goodnight and a pleasant nod  ned just gave him time to get his head out of the way when he let the trap fall with a clap like thunder and then began to pace up and down his little room with his hands in his pockets and his chin on his breast  after a short time he went to a corner of the room where stood a small wooden box that contained the few articles of clothing which he possessed  from the bottom of this he fished up the new testament that had been given to him long ago by reggie north  drawing his chair to the table and the candle to his elbow the returned convict opened the book and there in his garret began for the first time to read in earnest the wonderful word of life    chapter twenty eight  the great change  punctual to the day and the hour the missionary returned to neds garret  much and earnestly had he prayed in the meantime that the man might be guided in his search after truth and that to himself might be given words of wisdom which might have weight with him  but the missionarys words were not now required  god had spoken to the rough man by his own word  the holy spirit had carried conviction home  he had also revealed the saviour and the man was converted before the missionary again saw him  reader we present no fancy portrait to you  our fiction had its counterpart in actual life  ned frog in essential points at least represents a real manthough we have doubtless saddled on his broad shoulders a few unimportant matters which perhaps did not belong to him  i believe that this is gods word my friend he said extending his hand the moment the missionary entered and in proof of that i will now ask you to kneel with me and pray  you may be sure that the man of god complied gladly and with a full heart  we may not however trace here the aftercourse of this man in detail for our purpose it will suffice to say that this was no mere flash in the pan  ned frogs character did not change  it only received a new direction and a new impulse  the vigorous energy and fearless determination with which he had in former days pursued sin and selfgratification had now been turned into channels of righteousness  very soon after finding jesus for himself he began earnestly to desire the salvation of others and in a quiet humble way began with the poor people in his own stair  but this could not satisfy him  he was too strong both in body and mind to be restrained and soon took to openair preaching  im going to begin a mission he said one day to the missionary who had brought him to the saviour  there are many stout able fellows here who used to accept me as a leader in wickedness and who will perhaps agree to follow me in a new walk  some of them have come to the lord already  im goin sir to get these to form a band of workers and well take up a district  good said the missionary theres nothing like united action  what part of the district will you take up yourself ned  the place where i stand sir he replied  where i have sinned there will i preach to men the saviour of sinners  and he did preach not with eloquence perhaps but with such fervour that many of his old comrades were touched deeply and some were brought to christ and joined his daniel band  moreover ned kept to his own district and class  he did not assume that all rich churchgoers are hypocrites and that it was his duty to stand in conspicuous places and howl to them the message of salvation in tones of rasping discord  no it was noted by his mates as particularly curious that the voice of the man who could when he chose roar like a bull of bashan had become soft and what we may style entreative in its tone  moreover he did not try to imitate clerical errors  he did not get upon a deadly monotone while preaching as so many do  he simply spoke when he preached spoke loud no doubt but in a tone precisely similar to that in which in former days he would have seriously advised a brother burglar to adopt a certain course or to carefully steer clear of another course in order to gain his ends or to avoid falling into the hands of the police  thus men when listening to him came to believe that he was really speaking to them in earnest and not preaching  oh that young men who aim at the high privilege of proclaiming the good news would reflect on this latter point and try to steer clear of that fatal rock on which the churchnot the episcopal presbyterian or any other church but the whole church militanthas been bumping so long to her own tremendous damage  one point which told powerfully with those whom ned sought to win was that he went about endeavouring as far as in him lay to undo the evil that he had done  some of it could never be undonehe felt that bitterly  some could be remediedhe rejoiced in that and went about it with vigour  for instance he owed several debts  being a handy fellow and strong he worked like a horse and soon paid off his debts to the last farthing  again many a time had he in days gone by insulted and defamed comrades and friends  these he sought out with care and begged their pardon  the bulldog courage in him was so strong that in former days he would have struck or insulted any man who provoked him without reference to his it might be superior size or strength  he now went as boldly forward to confess his sin and to apologise  sometimes his apologies were kindly received at other times he was rudely repelled and called a hypocrite in language that we may not repeat but he took it well he resented nothing now and used to say he had been made invulnerable since he had enlisted under the banner of the prince of peace  yet strange to say the mans pugilistic powers were not rendered useless by his pacific life and profession  one day he was passing down one of those streets where even the police prefer to go in couples  suddenly a door burst open and a poor drunken woman was kicked out into the street by a big ruffian with whom ned was not acquainted  not satisfied with what he had done the rough proceeded to kick the woman who began to scream murder  a crowd at once collected for although such incidents were common enough in such places they always possessed sufficient interest to draw a crowd but no one interfered first because no one cared and second because the man was so big and powerful that every one was afraid of him  of course ned interfered not with an indignant statement that the man ought to be ashamed of himself but with the quiet remark  shes only a woman you know an cant return it  an wot ave you got to do with it cried the man with a savage curse as he aimed a tremendous blow at ned with his righthand  our pugilist expected that  he did not start or raise his hands to defend himself he merely put his head to one side and the huge fist went harmlessly past his ear  savagely the rough struck out with the other fist but ned quietly yet quickly put his head to the other side and again the fist went innocently by  a loud laugh and cheer from the crowd greeted this for apart altogether from the occasion of the disagreement this turning of the head aside was very pretty play on the part of nedbeing a remarkably easylooking but exceedingly difficult action as all boxers know  it enabled ned to smile in the face of his foe without doing him any harm  but it enraged the rough to such an extent that he struck out fast as well as hard obliging ned to put himself in the old familiar attitude and skip about smartly  i dont want to hurt you friend said ned at last but i can you see and he gave the man a slight pat on his right cheek with one hand and a tap on the forehead with the other  this might have convinced the rough but he would not be convinced  ned therefore gave him suddenly an openhanded slap on the side of the head which sent him through his own doorway through his own kitchenif we may so name itand into his own coalcellar where he measured his length among cinders and domestic debris  i didnt want to do it friends said ned in a mild voice as soon as the laughter had subsided but you see in the biblea book im uncommon fond ofwere told as far as we can to live peaceably with all men  now you see i couldnt live peaceably wi this man today he wouldnt let me but i think ill manage to do it some day for ill come back here tomorrow and say im sorry i had to do it  meanwhile i have a word to say to you about this matter  here ned got upon the doorstep of his adversary and finished off by what is sometimes styled improving the occasion  of course one of the first things that ned frog did on coming to his right mind was to make earnest and frequent inquiries as to the fate of his wife and family  unfortunately the man who might have guided him to the right sources of informationthe city missionary who had brought him to a knowledge of the truthwas seized with a severe illness which not only confined him to a sickbed for many weeks but afterwards rendered it necessary that he should absent himself for a long time from the sphere of his labours  thus being left to himself neds search was misdirected and at last he came to the heartbreaking conclusion that they must have gone as he expressed it to the bad that perhaps his wife had carried out her oftrepeated threat and drowned herself and that bobby having been only too successful a pupil in the ways of wickedness had got himself transported  to prosecute his inquiries among his old foes the police was so repugnant to ned that he shrank from it after the failure of one or two attempts and the only other source which might have been successful he failed to appeal to through his own ignorance  he only knew of george yard and the home of industry by name as being places which he had hated because his daughter hetty was so taken up with them  of course he was now aware that the people of george yard did good work for his new master but he was so ignorant of the special phase of their work at the beginning of his christian career that he never thought of applying to them for information  afterwards he became so busy with his own special work that he forgot all about these institutions  when the missionary recovered and returned to his work he at onceon hearing for the first time from ned his family historyput him on the scent and the discovery was then made that they had gone to canada  he wrote immediately and soon received a joyful reply from hetty and a postscript from bobby which set his heart singing and his soul ablaze with gratitude to a sparing and preserving god  about that time however the robust frame gave way under the amount of labour it was called on to perform  ned was obliged to go into hospital  when there he received pressing invitations to go out to canada and offers of passagemoney to any extent  mrs frog also offered to return home without delay and nurse him and only waited to know whether he would allow her  ned declined on the ground that he meant to accept their invitation and go to canada as soon as he was able to undertake the voyage  a relapse however interfered with his plans and thus the visit like many other desirable events in human affairs was for a time delayed    chapter twenty nine  home again  time passed away and bobby frog said to his mother one morning mother im going to england  it was a fine summer morning when he said this  his mother was sitting in a bower which had been constructed specially for her use by her son and his friend tim lumpy  it stood at the foot of the garden from which could be had a magnificent view of the neighbouring lake  rich foliage permitted the slanting sunbeams to quiver through the bower and little birds of a pert conceited nature twittered among the same martha mildthe very embodiment of meek earnest simplicity and still a mere child in face though almost a woman in yearssat on a wooden stool at mrs frogs feet reading the bible to her  martha loved the bible and mrs frog they were both fond of the bower there was a spare halfhour before themhence the situation as broken in upon by bobby  to england bobby  to england mother  martha said nothing but she gave a slightan almost imperceptible start and glanced at the sturdy youth with a mingled expression of anxiety and surprise  the surprise bob had expected the anxiety he had hoped for the start he had not foreseen but now perceived and received as a glorious fact oh  bobby frog was a deep young rascal  his wild hilarious reckless spirit which he found it so difficult to curb even with all surroundings in his favour experienced a great joy and sensation of restfulness in gazing at the pretty soft meek face of the little waif he loved martha but with all his recklessness he had not the courage to tell her so or to ask the condition of her feelings with regard to himself  being ingenious however and with much of the knowing nature of the stray still about him he hit on this plan of killing two birds with one stone as it were by briefly announcing his intentions to his mother and the result was more than he had hoped for  yes mother to englandto london  you see fathers last letter was not at all satisfactory  although he said he was convalescent and hoped to be able to travel soon it seemed rather dull in tone and now several posts have passed without bringing us a letter of any kind from him  i am beginning to feel anxious and so as i have saved a good bit of money i mean to have a trip to old england and bring daddy out with me  that will be grand indeed my son  but will mr merryboy let ye go bobby  of course he will  he lets me do whatever i please for hes as fond o me as if he were my father  no he aint that returned mrs frog with a shake of the head your father was rough bobby specially wen in liquor but he ad a kind art at bottom and he was very fond o you bobbyalmost as fond as he once was o me  mr merryboy could never come up to im in that  did i say he came up to him mother  i didnt say he was as fond o me as my own father but as if he was my father  however its all arranged and i go off at once  not before breakfast bobby  no not quite  i never do anything important on an empty stomach but by this time tomorrow i hope to be far on my way to the seacoast and i expect martha to take good care of you till i come back  ill be sure to do that said martha looking up in mrs frogs face affectionately  bob frog noted the look and was satisfied  but my boy i shant be here when you come back  you know my visit is over in a week and then we go to sir richards estate  i know that mother but martha goes with you there to help you and hetty and matty to keep house while tim lumpy looks after the farm  farm my boy what nonsense are you talking  no nonsense mother it has all been arranged this morning early though it is  mr merryboy has received a letter from sir richard saying that he wants to gather as many people as possible round him and offering him one of his farms on good terms so mr merryboy is to sell this place as soon as he can and tim and i have been offered a smaller farm on still easier terms close to his and not far from the big farm that sir richard has given to his soninlaw mr welland  soninlaw exclaimed mrs frog  do you mean to say that mr welland who used to come down an preach in the lodginouses in spitalfields as married that sweet hangel miss di  i do mean that mother  i could easily show him a superior angel of course said bob with a steady look at martha but he has done pretty well on the whole  pretty well echoed mrs frog indignantly he couldnt ave done better if ed searched the wide world over  there i dont agree with you returned her son however it dont matterhallo there goes granny down the wrong path  bob dashed off at full speed after mrs merryboy senior who had an inveterate tendency when attempting to reach mrs frogs bower to take a wrong turn and pursue a path which led from the garden to a pretty extensive piece of forestland behind  the blithe old lady was posting along this track in a tremulotottering way when captured by bob  at the same moment the breakfastbell rang mr merryboys stentorian voice was immediately heard in concert silvery shouts from the forestland alluded to told where hetty and matty had been wandering and a rush of pattering feet announced that the dogs of the farm were bent on being first to bid the old gentleman goodmorning  as bob frog had said the following day found him far on his way to the seacoast  a few days later found him on the seawishing earnestly that he were on the land  little more than a week after that found him in london walking down the old familiar strand towards the city  as he walked slowly along the crowded thoroughfare where every brick seemed familiar and every human being strange he could not help saying to himself mentally can it be possible was it here that i used to wander in rags  thank god for the rescue and for the rescuers  shine yer boots sir said a facsimile of his former self  certainly my boy said bob at once submitting himself to the operator although his boots having already been well shined the operation was an obvious absurdity  the boy must have felt something of this for when finished he looked up at his employer with a comical expression  bob looked at him sternly  they were about as bright before you began on em he said  they was sir admitted the boy candidly  how much demanded the old street boy  ony one hapenny sir replied the young street boy but ven the days fine an the boots dont want much shinin we ginrally expecs a penny  genlmin ave bin known to go the length of tuppence  bob pulled out halfacrown and offered it  the boy grinned but did not attempt to take it  why dont you take it my boy  you dont mean it do you asked the boy as the grin faded and the eyes opened  yes i do  here catch  i was once like you  christ and canada have made me what you see  here is a little book that will tell you more about that  he chanced to have one of miss macphersons canadian homes for london wanderers in his pocket and gave it to the little shoeblackwho was one of the fluttering freelances of the metropolis not one of the brigade  bob could not have said another word to have saved his life  he turned quickly on his heel and walked away followed by a fixed gaze and a prolonged whistle of astonishment  how hungry i used to be here he muttered as he walked along so uncommon hungry  the smell of roasts and pies had something to do with it i think  why theres the shopyes the very shop where i stood once gazing at the victuals for a full hour before i could tear myself away  i do think that for the sake of starving boys to say nothing of men women and girls these grubshops should be compelled to keep the victuals out o the windows and send their enticing smells up their chimneys  presently he came to a dead stop in front of a shop where a large mirror presented him with a fulllength portrait of himself and again he said mentally can it be possible for since quitting london he had never seen himself as others saw him having been too hurried on both occasions of passing through canadian cities to note the mirrors there in the backwoods of course there was nothing large enough in the way of mirror to show more than his goodlooking face  the portrait now presented to him was that of a broadchested wellmade gentlemanly young man of middle height in a grey tweed suit  not exactly tiptop a1 superfine you know bobby he muttered to himself with the memory of former days strong upon him butbut perhaps not altogether unworthy ofofa thought or two from little martha mild  bob frog increased in stature it is said by full half an inch on that occasion and thereafter he walked more rapidly in the direction of whitechapel  with sad and strangely mingled memories he went to the court where his early years had been spent  it was much the same in disreputableness of aspect as when he left it  time had been gnawing at it so long that a few years more or less made little difference on it and its inhabitants had not improved much  passing rapidly on he went straight to the beehive which he had for long regarded as his real home and there once again received a hearty welcome from its ever busy superintendent and her earnest workers but how different his circumstances now from those attending his first reception  his chief object however was to inquire the way to the hospital in which his father lay and he was glad to learn that the case of ned frog was wellknown and that he was convalescent  it chanced that a teameeting was on when he arrived so he had little more at the time than a warm shake of the hand from his friends in the home but he had the ineffable satisfaction of leaving behind him a sum sufficient to give a sixpence to each of the miserable beings who were that night receiving a plentiful meal for their bodies as well as food for their soulsthose of them at least who chose to take the latter none refused the former  on his way to the hospital he saw a remarkably tall policeman approaching  well you are a longlegged copper he muttered to himself with an irrepressible laugh as he thought of old times  the old spirit seemed to revive with the old associations for he felt a strong temptation to make a face at the policeman execute the old doubleshuffle stick his thumb to the end of his nose and bolt  as the man drew nearer he did actually make a face in spite of himselfa face of surprisewhich caused the man to stop  excuse me said bob with much of his old bluntness are not you number 666  that is not my number now sir though i confess it was once answered the policeman with a humorous twinkle of the eye  bobby noticed the word sir and felt elated  it was almost more than waifandstray human nature could stand to be respectfully sirred by a london policemanhis old foe whom in days gone by and on occasions innumerable he had scorned scouted and insulted with all the ingenuity of his fertile brain  your name is giles scott is it not he asked  it is sir  do you remember a little ragged boy who once had his leg broken by a runaway pony at the westendlong ago  yes as well as if id seen him yesterday  his name was bobby frog and a sad scamp he was though it is said hes doing well in canada  he must ave changed considerable returned bob reverting to his old language with wonderful facility wen number 666 dont know im  yes in me robert frog esquire of chikopow farm canada vest you beold your ancient henemy who is ony too appy to ave the chance of axin your parding for all the trouble he gave you an all the ard names he called you in days gone by  bobby held out his hand as he spoke and you may be sure our huge policeman was not slow to grasp it and congratulate the stray on his improved circumstances  we have not time or space to devote to the conversation which ensued it was brief but rapid and to the point and in the course of it bob learned that molly was as well and as bright and cheery as everalso somewhat stouter that monty was in a fair way to become a real policeman having just received encouragement to expect admission to the force when old enough and that he was in a fair way to become as sedate wise zealous and big as his father also that little jo aimed at the same honourable and responsible position and was no longer little  being anxious however to see his father bob cut the conversation short and having promised to visit his old enemy hastened away  the ward of the hospital in which bob soon found himself was a sad place  clean and fresh no doubt but very still save when a weary sigh or a groan told of suffering  among the beds which stood in a row each with its head against the wall one was pointed out on which a living skeleton lay  the face was very very pale and it seemed as if the angel of death were already brooding over it  yet though so changed there was no mistaking the aspect and the once powerful frame of ned frog  id rather not see any one whispered ned as the nurse went forward and spoke to him in a low voice ill soon be homei think  father dear father said bob in a trembling almost choking voice as he knelt by the bedside and took one of his fathers hands  the prostrate man sprang up as if he had received an electric shock and gazed eagerly into the face of his son  then turning his gaze on the nurse he said  im not dreaming am i  its true is it  is this bobby  whether hes bobby or not i cant say replied the nurse in the tone with which people sometimes address children but youre not dreaming it is a gentleman  ah then i am dreaming replied the sick man with inexpressible sadness for bobby is no gentleman  but it is me daddy cried the poor youth almost sobbing aloud as he kissed the hand he held why you old curmudgeon i thought youd ave knowd the voice o yer own son  ive growd a bit no doubt but its me for all that  look at me  ned did look with all the intensity of which he was capable and then fell back on his pillow with a great sigh while a deathlike pallor overspread his face almost inducing the belief that he was really dead  no bobby i aint dead yet he said in a low whisper as his terrified son bent over him  thank god for sendin you back to me  he stopped but gradually strength returned and he again looked earnestly at his son  bobby he said in stronger tones i thought the end was drawin nearor rather the beginninthe beginnin o the new life  but i dont feel like that now  i feel someow as i used to feel in the ring when they sponged my face arter a leveller  i did think i was done for this mornin  the nurse thought so too for i eerd her say so an the doctor said as much  indeed im not sure that my own art didnt say sobut ill cheat em all yet bobby my boy  youve put new life into my old carcase an ill come up to the scratch yetsee if i dont  but ned frog did not come up to the scratch  his work for the master on earth was finishedthe battle fought out and the victory gained  gi them all my love in canada bobby an say to your dear mother that i know she forgives mebut ill tell her all about that when we meetin the better land  thus he died with his rugged head resting on the bosom of his loved and loving son    chapter thirty  the new home  once again and for the last time we shift our scene to canadato the real backwoods nowthe brandon settlement  sir richard you see had been a noted sportsman in his youth  he had chased the kangaroo in australia the springbok in africa and the tiger in india and had fished salmon in norway so that his objections to the civilised parts of canada were as strong as those of the red indians themselves  he therefore resolved when making arrangements to found a colony to push as far into the backwoods as was compatible with comfort and safety  hence we now find him in the very far west  we decline to indicate the exact spot because idlers on hearing of its fertility and beauty and the felicity of its inhabitants might be tempted to crowd to it in rather inconvenient numbers  let it suffice to say in the language of the aborigines that it lies towards the setting sun  around brandon settlement there are rolling prairies illimitable pastureland oceanlike lakes grand forests and numerous rivers and rivulets with flatlands lowlands highlands undulating lands woodlands and in the faraway distance glimpses of the backbone of americapeaked and blue and snowtopped  the population of this happy region consists largely of waifs with a considerable sprinkling of strays  there are also several families of haristocrats who however are not bloatedvery much the reverse  the occupation of the people is as might be expected agricultural but as the colony is very active and thriving and growing fast many other branches of industry have sprung up so that the hiss of the saw and the ring of the anvil the clatter of the watermill and the clack of the loom may be heard in all parts of it  there is a rumour that a branch of the great pacific railway is to be run within a mile of the brandon settlement but that is not yet certain  the rumour however has caused much joyful hope to some and rather sorrowful anxiety to others  mercantile men rejoice at the prospect  those who are fond of sport tremble for it is generally supposed though on insufficient grounds that the railwaywhistle frightens away game  any one who has travelled in the scottish highlands and seen grouse close to the line regarding your clanking train with supreme indifference must doubt the evil influence of railways on game  meanwhile the sportsmen of brandon settlement pursue the buffalo and stalk the deer and hunt the brown and the grizzly bear and ply rod net gun and rifle to their hearts content  there is even a bank in this thriving settlementa branch if we mistake not of the flourishing bank of montrealof which a certain mr welland is manager and a certain thomas balls is hallporter as well as general superintendent when not asleep in the hallchair  mrs welland known familiarly as di is regarded as the mother of the settlementor more correctly the guardian angelfor she is not yet much past the prime of life  she is looked upon as a sort of goddess by many people indeed she resembles one in mind face figure and capacity  we use the last word advisedly for she knows and sympathises with every one and does so much for the good of the community that the bare record of her deeds would fill a large volume  amongst other things she trains in the way that they should go a family of ten children whose adoration of her is said to be perilously near to idolatry  she also finds time to visit an immense circle of friends there are no poor in brandon settlement yet though there are a few sick and a good many aged to whom she ministers  she also attends on sir richard who is part of the bank family as well as a director  the good knight wears well  his time is divided between the children of di the affairs of the settlement and a neighbouring stream in which the trout are large and pleasantly active  mrs screwbury who spent her mature years in nursing little di is renewing her youth by nursing little dis little ones among whom there is of course another little di whom her father styles dilicious  jessie summers assists in the nursery and the old cook reigns in the canadian kitchen with as much grace as she formerly reigned in the kitchen at the westend  quite close to the bank buildings there is a charming villa with a view of a lake in front and a peep through the woods at the mountains behind in which dwells the cashier of the bank with his wife and family  his name is robert frog esquire  his wifes name is martha  his eldest son bobbya boy of about nine or tenis said to be the most larky boy in the settlement  we know not as to that but any one with half an eye can see that he is singularly devoted to his mild little browneyed mother  there is a picturesque little hut at the foot of the garden of beehive villa which is inhabited by an old woman  to this hut bobby the second is very partial for the old woman is exceedingly fond of bobbyquite spoils him in factand often entertains him with strange stories about a certain lion of her acquaintance which was turned into a lamb  need we say that this old woman is mrs frog  the bank cashier offered her a home in beehive villa but she prefers the little hut at the foot of the garden where she sits in state to receive visitors and is tenderly cared for by a very handsome young woman named matty who calls her mother  matty is the superintendent of a neighbouring school and it is said that one of the best of the masters of that school is anxious to make matty and the school his own  if so that master must be a greedy fellowall things considered  there is a civil engineeroften styled by bob frog an uncivil engineerwho has planned all the public works of the settlement and is said to have a good prospect of being engaged in an important capacity on the projected railway  but of this we cannot speak authoritatively his name is t lampay esquire  illnatured people assert that when he first came to the colony his name was tim lumpy and at times his wife hetty calls him lumpy to his face but as wives do sometimes call their husbands improper names the fact proves nothing except the perversity of woman  there is a blind old woman in his establishment however who has grown amiably childish in her old age who invariably calls him tim whatever may be the truth as to this there is no question that he is a thriving man and an officebearer in the congregational church whose best sabbathschool teacher is his wife hetty and whose pastor is the reverend john seawarda man of singular good fortune for besides having such men as robert frog t lampay and sir richard brandon to back him up and sympathise with him on all occasions he is further supported by the aid and countenance of samuel twitter senior samuel twitter junior mrs twitter and all the other twitters some of whom are married and have twitterers of their own  samuel twitter and his sons are now farmers  yes reader you may look and feel surprised to hear it but your astonishment will never equal that of old twitter himself at finding himself in that position  he never gets over it and has been known while at the tail of the plough to stop work clap a hand on each knee and roar with laughter at the mere idea of his having taken to agriculture late in life  he tried to milk the cows when he first began but after having frightened two or three animals into fits overturned half a dozen milkpails and been partially gored he gave it up  sammy is his righthand man and the hope of his declining years  true this righthand has got the name of being slow but he is considered as preeminently sure  mrs twitter has taken earnestly to the sick since there are no poor to befriend  she is also devoted to the youngand there is no lack of them  she is likewise strong in the teaparty line and among her most favoured guests are two ladies named respectively loper and larrabel and two gentlemen named crackaby and stickler  it is not absolutely certain whether these four are a blessing to the new settlement or the reverse  some hold that things in general would progress more smoothly if they were gone others that their presence affords excellent and needful opportunity for the exercise of forbearance and charity  at all events mrs twitter holds that she could not live without them and george brisbane esquire who owns a lovely mansion on the outskirts of the settlement which he has named lively hall vows that the departure of that quartette would be a distinct and irreparable loss to society in brandon settlement  one more old friend we have to mention namely reggie north who has become a colporteur and wanders far and near over the beautiful face of canada scattering the seed of life with more vigour and greater success than her sons scatter the golden grain  his periodical visits to the settlement are always hailed with delight because north has a genial way of relating his adventures and describing his travels which renders it necessary for him to hold forth as a public lecturer at times in the little chapel for the benefit of the entire community  on these occasions north never fails you may be quite sure to advance his masters cause  besides those whom we have mentioned there are sundry persons of both sexes who go by such names as dick swiller blobby robin lilly snow robbie dell and little mouse all of whom are grown men and women and are said to have originally been london waifs and strays  but any one looking at them in their backwoods prosperity would poohpooh the idea as being utterly preposterous  however this may be it is quite certain that they are curiously well acquainted with the slums of london and with low life in that great city  these people sometimes mention the name of giles scott and always with regret that that stalwart policeman and his not less stalwart sons are unable to see their way to emigrate but if they did as bobby frog the second asks what would become of london  theyd make such splendid backwoodsmen says one  and the daughters would make such splendid wives for backwoodsmen says another  mr merryboy thinks that canada can produce splendid men of its own without importing them from england and mrs merryboy holds that the same may be said in regard to the women of canada and old granny who is still alive with a face like a shrivelledup potato blinks with undimmed eyes and nods her snowwhite head and beams her brightest smile in thorough approval of these sentiments  ah reader  brandon settlement is a wonderful place but we may not linger over it now  the shadows of our tale have lengthened out and the sun is about to set  before it goes quite down let us remind you that the diamonds which you have seen dug out cut and polished are only a few of the precious gems that lie hidden in the dust of the great cities of our land that the harvest might be very great and that the labourers at the present time are comparatively few  the end
