goblin lead them up and down   the ruddy glow of sunset was already fading into the sombre shadows of night when two travellers might have been observed swiftlyat a pace of six miles in the hourdescending the rugged side of a mountain the younger bounding from crag to crag with the agility of a fawn while his companion whose aged limbs seemed ill at ease in the heavy chain armour habitually worn by tourists in that district toiled on painfully at his side  as is always the case under such circumstances the younger knight was the first to break the silence  a goodly pace i trow he exclaimed we sped not thus in the ascent  goodly indeed the other echoed with a groan we clomb it but at three miles in the hour  and on the dead level our pace is the younger suggested for he was weak in statistics and left all such details to his aged companion  four miles in the hour the other wearily replied not an ounce more he added with that love of metaphor so common in old age and not a farthing less  twas three hours past high noon when we left our hostelry the young man said musingly we shall scarce be back by suppertime perchance mine host will roundly deny us all food  he will chide our tardy return was the grave reply and such a rebuke will be meet  a brave conceit cried the other with a merry laugh and should we bid him bring us yet another course i trow his answer will be tart  we shall but get our deserts sighed the elder knight who had never seen a joke in his life and was somewhat displeased at his companions untimely levity twill be nine of the clock he added in an undertone by the time we regain our hostelry full many a mile shall we have plodded this day  how many how many cried the eager youth ever athirst for knowledge  the old man was silent  tell me he answered after a moments thought what time it was when we stood together on yonder peak not exact to the minute he added hastily reading a protest in the young mans face an thy guess be within one poor halfhour of the mark tis all i ask of thy mothers son then will i tell thee true to the last inch how far we shall have trudged betwixt three and nine of the clock  a groan was the young mans only reply while his convulsed features and the deep wrinkles that chased each other across his manly brow revealed the abyss of arithmetical agony into which one chance question had plunged him     knot ii  eligible apartments     straight down the crooked lane    and all round the square   lets ask balbus about it said hugh  all right said lambert  he can guess it said hugh  rather said lambert  no more words were needed the two brothers understood each other perfectly  illustration balbus was assisting his motherinlaw to convince the dragon  balbus was waiting for them at the hotel the journey down had tired him he said so his two pupils had been the round of the place in search of lodgings without the old tutor who had been their inseparable companion from their childhood they had named him after the hero of their latin exercisebook which overflowed with anecdotes of that versatile geniusanecdotes whose vagueness in detail was more than compensated by their sensational brilliance balbus has overcome all his enemies had been marked by their tutor in the margin of the book successful bravery in this way he had tried to extract a moral from every anecdote about balbussometimes one of warning as in balbus had borrowed a healthy dragon against which he had written rashness in speculationsometimes of encouragement as in the words influence of sympathy in united action which stood opposite to the anecdote balbus was assisting his motherinlaw to convince the dragonand sometimes it dwindled down to a single word such as prudence which was all he could extract from the touching record that balbus having scorched the tail of the dragon went away his pupils liked the short morals best as it left them more room for marginal illustrations and in this instance they required all the space they could get to exhibit the rapidity of the heros departure  their report of the state of things was discouraging that most fashionable of wateringplaces little mendip was chockfull as the boys expressed it from end to end but in one square they had seen no less than four cards in different houses all announcing in flaming capitals eligible apartments so theres plenty of choice after all you see said spokesman hugh in conclusion  that doesnt follow from the data said balbus as he rose from the easy chair where he had been dozing over the little mendip gazette they may be all single rooms however we may as well see them i shall be glad to stretch my legs a bit  an unprejudiced bystander might have objected that the operation was needless and that this long lank creature would have been all the better with even shorter legs but no such thought occurred to his loving pupils one on each side they did their best to keep up with his gigantic strides while hugh repeated the sentence in their fathers letter just received from abroad over which he and lambert had been puzzling he says a friend of his the governor ofwhat was that name again lambert kgovjni said lambert well yes the governor ofwhatyoumaycallitwants to give a very small dinnerparty and he means to ask his fathers brotherinlaw his brothers fatherinlaw his fatherinlaws brother and his brotherinlaws father and were to guess how many guests there will be  there was an anxious pause how large did he say the pudding was to be balbus said at last take its cubical contents divide by the cubical contents of what each man can eat and the quotient  he didnt say anything about pudding said hugh and heres the square as they turned a corner and came into sight of the eligible apartments  it is a square was balbus first cry of delight as he gazed around him beautiful beautiful equilateral and rectangular  the boys looked round with less enthusiasm number nine is the first with a card said prosaic lambert but balbus would not so soon awake from his dream of beauty  see boys he cried twenty doors on a side what symmetry each side divided into twentyone equal parts its delicious  shall i knock or ring said hugh looking in some perplexity at a square brass plate which bore the simple inscription ring also  both said balbus thats an ellipsis my boy did you never see an ellipsis before  i couldnt hardly read it said hugh evasively its no good having an ellipsis if they dont keep it clean  which there is one room gentlemen said the smiling landlady and a sweet room too as snug a little backroom  we will see it said balbus gloomily as they followed her in i knew how it would be one room in each house no view i suppose  which indeed there is gentlemen the landlady indignantly protested as she drew up the blind and indicated the back garden  cabbages i perceive said balbus well theyre green at any rate  which the greens at the shops their hostess explained are by no means dependable upon here you has them on the premises and of the best  does the window open was always balbus first question in testing a lodging and does the chimney smoke his second satisfied on all points he secured the refusal of the room and they moved on to number twentyfive  this landlady was grave and stern ive nobbut one room left she told them and it gives on the backgyardin  but there are cabbages balbus suggested  the landlady visibly relented there is sir she said and good ones though i say it as shouldnt we cant rely on the shops for greens so we grows them ourselves  a singular advantage said balbus and after the usual questions they went on to fiftytwo  and id gladly accommodate you all if i could was the greeting that met them we are but mortal irrelevant muttered balbus and ive let all my rooms but one  which one is a backroom i perceive said balbus and looking out onon cabbages i presume  yes indeed sir said their hostess whatever other folks may do we grows our own for the shops  an excellent arrangement balbus interrupted then one can really depend on their being good does the window open  the usual questions were answered satisfactorily but this time hugh added one of his own inventiondoes the cat scratch  the landlady looked round suspiciously as if to make sure the cat was not listening i will not deceive you gentlemen she said it do scratch but not without you pulls its whiskers itll never do it she repeated slowly with a visible effort to recall the exact words of some written agreement between herself and the cat without you pulls its whiskers  much may be excused in a cat so treated said balbus as they left the house and crossed to number seventythree leaving the landlady curtseying on the doorstep and still murmuring to herself her parting words as if they were a form of blessing  not without you pulls its whiskers  at number seventythree they found only a small shy girl to show the house who said yesm in answer to all questions  the usual room said balbus as they marched in the usual backgarden the usual cabbages i suppose you cant get them good at the shops  yesm said the girl  well you may tell your mistress we will take the room and that her plan of growing her own cabbages is simply admirable  yesm said the girl as she showed them out  one dayroom and three bedrooms said balbus as they returned to the hotel we will take as our dayroom the one that gives us the least walking to do to get to it  must we walk from door to door and count the steps said lambert  no no figure it out my boys figure it out balbus gaily exclaimed as he put pens ink and paper before his hapless pupils and left the room  i say itll be a job said hugh  rather said lambert     knot iii  mad mathesis     i waited for the train   well they call me so because i am a little mad i suppose she said goodhumouredly in answer to claras cautiouslyworded question as to how she came by so strange a nickname you see i never do what sane people are expected to do nowadays i never wear long trains talking of trains thats the charing cross metropolitan stationive something to tell you about that and i never play lawntennis i cant cook an omelette i cant even set a broken limb theres an ignoramus for you  clara was her niece and full twenty years her junior in fact she was still attending a high schoolan institution of which mad mathesis spoke with undisguised aversion let a woman be meek and lowly she would say none of your high schools for me but it was vacationtime just now and clara was her guest and mad mathesis was showing her the sights of that eighth wonder of the worldlondon  the charing cross metropolitan station she resumed waving her hand towards the entrance as if she were introducing her niece to a friend the bayswater and birmingham extension is just completed and the trains now run round and round continuouslyskirting the border of wales just touching at york and so round by the east coast back to london the way the trains run is most peculiar the westerly ones go round in two hours the easterly ones take three but they always manage to start two trains from here opposite ways punctually every quarterofanhour  they part to meet again said clara her eyes filling with tears at the romantic thought  no need to cry about it her aunt grimly remarked they dont meet on the same line of rails you know talking of meeting an idea strikes me she added changing the subject with her usual abruptness lets go opposite ways round and see which can meet most trains no need for a chaperonladies saloon you know you shall go whichever way you like and well have a bet about it  i never make bets clara said very gravely our excellent preceptress has often warned us  youd be none the worse if you did mad mathesis interrupted in fact youd be the better im certain  neither does our excellent preceptress approve of puns said clara but well have a match if you like let me choose my train she added after a brief mental calculation and ill engage to meet exactly half as many again as you do  not if you count fair mad mathesis bluntly interrupted remember we only count the trains we meet on the way you mustnt count the one that starts as you start nor the one that arrives as you arrive  that will only make the difference of one train said clara as they turned and entered the station but i never travelled alone before therell be no one to help me to alight however i dont mind lets have a match  a ragged little boy overheard her remark and came running after her buy a box of cigarlights miss he pleaded pulling her shawl to attract her attention clara stopped to explain  i never smoke cigars she said in a meekly apologetic tone our excellent preceptress but mad mathesis impatiently hurried her on and the little boy was left gazing after her with round eyes of amazement  the two ladies bought their tickets and moved slowly down the central platform mad mathesis prattling on as usualclara silent anxiously reconsidering the calculation on which she rested her hopes of winning the match  mind where you go dear cried her aunt checking her just in time one step more and youd have been in that pail of cold water  i know i know clara said dreamily the pale the cold and the moony  take your places on the springboards shouted a porter  what are they for clara asked in a terrified whisper  merely to help us into the trains the elder lady spoke with the nonchalance of one quite used to the process very few people can get into a carriage without help in less than three seconds and the trains only stop for one second at this moment the whistle was heard and two trains rushed into the station a moments pause and they were gone again but in that brief interval several hundred passengers had been shot into them each flying straight to his place with the accuracy of a minie bulletwhile an equal number were showered out upon the sideplatforms  three hours had passed away and the two friends met again on the charing cross platform and eagerly compared notes then clara turned away with a sigh to young impulsive hearts like hers disappointment is always a bitter pill mad mathesis followed her full of kindly sympathy  try again my love she said cheerily let us vary the experiment we will start as we did before but not to begin counting till our trains meet when we see each other we will say one and so count on till we come here again  clara brightened up i shall win that she exclaimed eagerly if i may choose my train  another shriek of engine whistles another upheaving of springboards another living avalanche plunging into two trains as they flashed by and the travellers were off again  each gazed eagerly from her carriage window holding up her handkerchief as a signal to her friend a rush and a roar two trains shot past each other in a tunnel and two travellers leaned back in their corners with a sighor rather with two sighsof relief one clara murmured to herself won its a word of good omen this time at any rate the victory will be mine  but was it     knot iv  the dead reckoning     i did dream of moneybags tonight   noonday on the open sea within a few degrees of the equator is apt to be oppressively warm and our two travellers were now airily clad in suits of dazzling white linen having laid aside the chainarmour which they had found not only endurable in the cold mountain air they had lately been breathing but a necessary precaution against the daggers of the banditti who infested the heights their holidaytrip was over and they were now on their way home in the monthly packet which plied between the two great ports of the island they had been exploring  along with their armour the tourists had laid aside the antiquated speech it had pleased them to affect while in knightly disguise and had returned to the ordinary style of two country gentlemen of the twentieth century  stretched on a pile of cushions under the shade of a huge umbrella they were lazily watching some native fishermen who had come on board at the last landingplace each carrying over his shoulder a small but heavy sack a large weighingmachine that had been used for cargo at the last port stood on the deck and round this the fishermen had gathered and with much unintelligible jabber seemed to be weighing their sacks  more like sparrows in a tree than human talk isnt it the elder tourist remarked to his son who smiled feebly but would not exert himself so far as to speak the old man tried another listener  what have they got in those sacks captain he inquired as that great being passed them in his never ending parade to and fro on the deck  the captain paused in his march and towered over the travellerstall grave and serenely selfsatisfied  fishermen he explained are often passengers in my ship these five are from mhruxithe place we last touched atand thats the way they carry their money the money of this island is heavy gentlemen but it costs little as you may guess we buy it from them by weightabout five shillings a pound i fancy a ten poundnote would buy all those sacks  by this time the old man had closed his eyesin order no doubt to concentrate his thoughts on these interesting facts but the captain failed to realise his motive and with a grunt resumed his monotonous march  meanwhile the fishermen were getting so noisy over the weighingmachine that one of the sailors took the precaution of carrying off all the weights leaving them to amuse themselves with such substitutes in the form of winchhandles belayingpins c as they could find this brought their excitement to a speedy end they carefully hid their sacks in the folds of the jib that lay on the deck near the tourists and strolled away  when next the captains heavy footfall passed the younger man roused himself to speak  what did you call the place those fellows came from captain he asked  mhruxi sir  and the one we are bound for  the captain took a long breath plunged into the word and came out of it nobly they call it kgovjni sir  ki give it up the young man faintly said  he stretched out his hand for a glass of iced water which the compassionate steward had brought him a minute ago and had set down unluckily just outside the shadow of the umbrella it was scalding hot and he decided not to drink it the effort of making this resolution coming close on the fatiguing conversation he had just gone through was too much for him he sank back among the cushions in silence  his father courteously tried to make amends for his nonchalance  whereabouts are we now captain said he have you any idea  the captain cast a pitying look on the ignorant landsman i could tell you that sir he said in a tone of lofty condescension to an inch  you dont say so the old man remarked in a tone of languid surprise  and mean so persisted the captain why what do you suppose would become of my ship if i were to lose my longitude and my latitude could you make anything of my dead reckoning  nobody could im sure the other heartily rejoined  but he had overdone it  its perfectly intelligible the captain said in an offended tone to any one that understands such things with these words he moved away and began giving orders to the men who were preparing to hoist the jib  our tourists watched the operation with such interest that neither of them remembered the five moneybags which in another moment as the wind filled out the jib were whirled overboard and fell heavily into the sea  but the poor fishermen had not so easily forgotten their property in a moment they had rushed to the spot and stood uttering cries of fury and pointing now to the sea and now to the sailors who had caused the disaster  the old man explained it to the captain  let us make it up among us he added in conclusion ten pounds will do it i think you said  illustration  but the captain put aside the suggestion with a wave of the hand  no sir he said in his grandest manner you will excuse me i am sure but these are my passengers the accident has happened on board my ship and under my orders it is for me to make compensation he turned to the angry fishermen come here my men he said in the mhruxian dialect tell me the weight of each sack i saw you weighing them just now  then ensued a perfect babel of noise as the five natives explained all screaming together how the sailors had carried off the weights and they had done what they could with whatever came handy  two iron belayingpins three blocks six holystones four winchhandles and a large hammer were now carefully weighed the captain superintending and noting the results but the matter did not seem to be settled even then an angry discussion followed in which the sailors and the five natives all joined and at last the captain approached our tourists with a disconcerted look which he tried to conceal under a laugh  its an absurd difficulty he said perhaps one of you gentlemen can suggest something it seems they weighed the sacks two at a time  if they didnt have five separate weighings of course you cant value them separately the youth hastily decided  lets hear all about it was the old mans more cautious remark  they did have five separate weighings the captain said butwell it beats me entirely he added in a sudden burst of candour heres the result first and second sack weighed twelve pounds second and third thirteen and a half third and fourth eleven and a half fourth and fifth eight and then they say they had only the large hammer left and it took three sacks to weigh it downthats the first third and fifthand they weighed sixteen pounds there gentlemen did you ever hear anything like that  the old man muttered under his breath if only my sister were here and looked helplessly at his son his son looked at the five natives the five natives looked at the captain the captain looked at nobody his eyes were cast down and he seemed to be saying softly to himself contemplate one another gentlemen if such be your good pleasure i contemplate myself     knot v  oughts and crosses     look here upon this picture and on this   and what made you choose the first train goosey said mad mathesis as they got into the cab couldnt you count better than that  i took an extreme case was the tearful reply our excellent preceptress always says when in doubt my dears take an extreme case and i was in doubt  does it always succeed her aunt enquired  clara sighed not always she reluctantly admitted and i cant make out why one day she was telling the little girlsthey make such a noise at tea you knowthe more noise you make the less jam you will have and vice versâ and i thought they wouldnt know what vice versâ meant so i explained it to them i said if you make an infinite noise youll get no jam and if you make no noise youll get an infinite lot of jam but our excellent preceptress said that wasnt a good instance why wasnt it she added plaintively  her aunt evaded the question one sees certain objections to it she said but how did you work it with the metropolitan trains none of them go infinitely fast i believe  i called them hares and tortoises clara saida little timidly for she dreaded being laughed at and i thought there couldnt be so many hares as tortoises on the line so i took an extreme caseone hare and an infinite number of tortoises  an extreme case indeed her aunt remarked with admirable gravity and a most dangerous state of things  and i thought if i went with a tortoise there would be only one hare to meet but if i went with the hareyou know there were crowds of tortoises  it wasnt a bad idea said the elder lady as they left the cab at the entrance of burlington house you shall have another chance today well have a match in marking pictures  clara brightened up i should like to try again very much she said ill take more care this time how are we to play  to this question mad mathesis made no reply she was busy drawing lines down the margins of the catalogue see she said after a minute ive drawn three columns against the names of the pictures in the long room and i want you to fill them with oughts and crossescrosses for good marks and oughts for bad the first column is for choice of subject the second for arrangement the third for colouring and these are the conditions of the match you must give three crosses to two or three pictures you must give two crosses to four or five  do you mean only two crosses said clara or may i count the threecross pictures among the twocross pictures  of course you may said her aunt any one that has three eyes may be said to have two eyes i suppose  clara followed her aunts dreamy gaze across the crowded gallery halfdreading to find that there was a threeeyed person in sight  and you must give one cross to nine or ten  and which wins the match clara asked as she carefully entered these conditions on a blank leaf in her catalogue  whichever marks fewest pictures  but suppose we marked the same number  then whichever uses most marks  clara considered i dont think its much of a match she said i shall mark nine pictures and give three crosses to three of them two crosses to two more and one cross each to all the rest  will you indeed said her aunt wait till youve heard all the conditions my impetuous child you must give three oughts to one or two pictures two oughts to three or four and one ought to eight or nine i dont want you to be too hard on the ras  clara quite gasped as she wrote down all these fresh conditions its a great deal worse than circulating decimals she said but im determined to win all the same  her aunt smiled grimly we can begin here she said as they paused before a gigantic picture which the catalogue informed them was the portrait of lieutenant brown mounted on his favorite elephant  he looks awfully conceited said clara i dont think he was the elephants favorite lieutenant what a hideous picture it is and it takes up room enough for twenty  mind what you say my dear her aunt interposed its by an ra  but clara was quite reckless i dont care who its by she cried and i shall give it three bad marks  aunt and niece soon drifted away from each other in the crowd and for the next halfhour clara was hard at work putting in marks and rubbing them out again and hunting up and down for suitable pictures this she found the hardest part of all i cant find the one i want she exclaimed at last almost crying with vexation  what is it you want to find my dear the voice was strange to clara but so sweet and gentle that she felt attracted to the owner of it even before she had seen her and when she turned and met the smiling looks of two little old ladies whose round dimpled faces exactly alike seemed never to have known a care it was as much as she could doas she confessed to aunt mattie afterwardsto keep herself from hugging them both  i was looking for a picture she said that has a good subjectand thats well arrangedbut badly coloured  the little old ladies glanced at each other in some alarm calm yourself my dear said the one who had spoken first and try to remember which it was what was the subject  was it an elephant for instance the other sister suggested they were still in sight of lieutenant brown  i dont know indeed clara impetuously replied you know it doesnt matter a bit what the subject is so long as its a good one  once more the sisters exchanged looks of alarm and one of them whispered something to the other of which clara caught only the one word mad  they mean aunt mattie of course she said to herselffancying in her innocence that london was like her native town where everybody knew everybody else if you mean my aunt she added aloud shes therejust three pictures beyond lieutenant brown  ah well then youd better go to her my dear her new friend said soothingly shell find you the picture you want goodbye dear  goodbye dear echoed the other sister mind you dont lose sight of your aunt and the pair trotted off into another room leaving clara rather perplexed at their manner  theyre real darlings she soliloquised i wonder why they pity me so and she wandered on murmuring to herself it must have two good marks and     knot vi  her radiancy     one piecee thing that my have got      maskeea that thing my no can do    you talkee you no sabey what                bamboo   they landed and were at once conducted to the palace about half way they were met by the governor who welcomed them in englisha great relief to our travellers whose guide could speak nothing but kgovjnian  i dont half like the way they grin at us as we go by the old man whispered to his son and why do they say bamboo so often  it alludes to a local custom replied the governor who had overheard the question such persons as happen in any way to displease her radiancy are usually beaten with rods  illustration why do they say bamboo so often  the old man shuddered a most objectional local custom he remarked with strong emphasis i wish we had never landed did you notice that black fellow norman opening his great mouth at us i verily believe he would like to eat us  norman appealed to the governor who was walking at his other side do they often eat distinguished strangers here he said in as indifferent a tone as he could assume  not oftennot ever was the welcome reply they are not good for it pigs we eat for they are fat this old man is thin  and thankful to be so muttered the elder traveller beaten we shall be without a doubt its a comfort to know it wont be beaten without the b my dear boy just look at the peacocks  they were now walking between two unbroken lines of those gorgeous birds each held in check by means of a golden collar and chain by a black slave who stood well behind so as not to interrupt the view of the glittering tail with its network of rustling feathers and its hundred eyes  the governor smiled proudly in your honour he said her radiancy has ordered up ten thousand additional peacocks she will no doubt decorate you before you go with the usual star and feathers  itll be star without the s faltered one of his hearers  come come dont lose heart said the other all this is full of charm for me  you are young norman sighed his father young and lighthearted for me it is charm without the c  the old one is sad the governor remarked with some anxiety he has without doubt effected some fearful crime  but i havent the poor old gentleman hastily exclaimed tell him i havent norman  he has not as yet norman gently explained and the governor repeated in a satisfied tone not as yet  yours is a wondrous country the governor resumed after a pause now here is a letter from a friend of mine a merchant in london he and his brother went there a year ago with a thousand pounds apiece and on newyearsday they had sixty thousand pounds between them  how did they do it norman eagerly exclaimed even the elder traveller looked excited  the governor handed him the open letter anybody can do it when once they know how so ran this oracular document we borrowed nought we stole nought we began the year with only a thousand pounds apiece and last newyearsday we had sixty thousand pounds between ussixty thousand golden sovereigns  norman looked grave and thoughtful as he handed back the letter his father hazarded one guess was it by gambling  a kgovjnian never gambles said the governor gravely as he ushered them through the palace gates they followed him in silence down a long passage and soon found themselves in a lofty hall lined entirely with peacocks feathers in the centre was a pile of crimson cushions which almost concealed the figure of her radiancya plump little damsel in a robe of green satin dotted with silver stars whose pale round face lit up for a moment with a halfsmile as the travellers bowed before her and then relapsed into the exact expression of a wax doll while she languidly murmured a word or two in the kgovjnian dialect  the governor interpreted her radiancy welcomes you she notes the impenetrable placidity of the old one and the imperceptible acuteness of the youth  here the little potentate clapped her hands and a troop of slaves instantly appeared carrying trays of coffee and sweetmeats which they offered to the guests who had at a signal from the governor seated themselves on the carpet  sugarplums muttered the old man one might as well be at a confectioners ask for a penny bun norman  not so loud his son whispered say something complimentary for the governor was evidently expecting a speech  we thank her exalted potency the old man timidly began we bask in the light of her smile which  the words of old men are weak the governor interrupted angrily let the youth speak  tell her cried norman in a wild burst of eloquence that like two grasshoppers in a volcano we are shrivelled up in the presence of her spangled vehemence  it is well said the governor and translated this into kgovjnian i am now to tell you he proceeded what her radiancy requires of you before you go the yearly competition for the post of imperial scarfmaker is just ended you are the judges you will take account of the rate of work the lightness of the scarves and their warmth usually the competitors differ in one point only thus last year fifi and gogo made the same number of scarves in the trialweek and they were equally light but fifis were twice as warm as gogos and she was pronounced twice as good but this year woe is me who can judge it three competitors are here and they differ in all points while you settle their claims you shall be lodged her radiancy bids me say free of expensein the best dungeon and abundantly fed on the best bread and water  the old man groaned all is lost he wildly exclaimed but norman heeded him not he had taken out his notebook and was calmly jotting down the particulars  three they be the governor proceeded lolo mimi and zuzu lolo makes 5 scarves while mimi makes 2 but zuzu makes 4 while lolo makes 3 again so fairylike is zuzus handiwork 5 of her scarves weigh no more than one of lolos yet mimis is lighter still5 of hers will but balance 3 of zuzus and for warmth one of mimis is equal to 4 of zuzus yet one of lolos is as warm as 3 of mimis  here the little lady once more clapped her hands  it is our signal of dismissal the governor hastily said pay her radiancy your farewell complimentsand walk out backwards  the walking part was all the elder tourist could manage norman simply said tell her radiancy we are transfixed by the spectacle of her serene brilliance and bid an agonized farewell to her condensed milkiness  her radiancy is pleased the governor reported after duly translating this she casts on you a glance from her imperial eyes and is confident that you will catch it  that i warrant we shall the elder traveller moaned to himself distractedly  once more they bowed low and then followed the governor down a winding staircase to the imperial dungeon which they found to be lined with coloured marble lighted from the roof and splendidly though not luxuriously furnished with a bench of polished malachite i trust you will not delay the calculation the governor said ushering them in with much ceremony i have known great inconveniencegreat and serious inconvenienceresult to those unhappy ones who have delayed to execute the commands of her radiancy and on this occasion she is resolute she says the thing must and shall be done and she has ordered up ten thousand additional bamboos with these words he left them and they heard him lock and bar the door on the outside  i told you how it would end moaned the elder traveller wringing his hands and quite forgetting in his anguish that he had himself proposed the expedition and had never predicted anything of the sort oh that we were well out of this miserable business  courage cried the younger cheerily hæc olim meminisse juvabit the end of all this will be glory  glory without the l was all the poor old man could say as he rocked himself to and fro on the

be forgetting it  claras voice took the plaintive tone that her aunt never knew how to resist and with a sigh the old lady drew forth her ivory tablets and prepared to record the amount that clara had just spent at the confectioners shop her expenditure was always made out of her aunts purse but the poor girl knew by bitter experience that sooner or later mad mathesis would expect an exact account of every penny that had gone and she waited with illconcealed impatience while the old lady turned the tablets over and over till she had found the one headed petty cash  heres the place she said at last and here we have yesterdays luncheon duly entered one glass lemonade why cant you drink water like me three sandwiches they never put in half mustard enough i told the young woman so to her face and she tossed her headlike her impudence and seven biscuits total oneandtwopence well now for todays  one glass of lemonade clara was beginning to say when suddenly the cab drew up and a courteous railwayporter was handing out the bewildered girl before she had had time to finish her sentence  her aunt pocketed the tablets instantly business first she said petty cashwhich is a form of pleasure whatever you may thinkafterwards and she proceeded to pay the driver and to give voluminous orders about the luggage quite deaf to the entreaties of her unhappy niece that she would enter the rest of the luncheon account  my dear you really must cultivate a more capacious mind was all the consolation she vouchsafed to the poor girl are not the tablets of your memory wide enough to contain the record of one single luncheon  not wide enough not half wide enough was the passionate reply  the words came in aptly enough but the voice was not that of clara and both ladies turned in some surprise to see who it was that had so suddenly struck into their conversation a fat little old lady was standing at the door of a cab helping the driver to extricate what seemed an exact duplicate of herself it would have been no easy task to decide which was the fatter or which looked the more goodhumoured of the two sisters  i tell you the cabdoor isnt half wide enough she repeated as her sister finally emerged somewhat after the fashion of a pellet from a popgun and she turned to appeal to clara is it dear she said trying hard to bring a frown into a face that dimpled all over with smiles  some folks is too wide for em growled the cabdriver  illustration i tell you the cabdoor isnt half wide enough  dont provoke me man cried the little old lady in what she meant for a tempest of fury say another word and ill put you into the county court and sue you for a habeas corpus the cabman touched his hat and marched off grinning  nothing like a little law to cow the ruffians my dear she remarked confidentially to clara you saw how he quailed when i mentioned the habeas corpus not that ive any idea what it means but it sounds very grand doesnt it  its very provoking clara replied a little vaguely  very the little old lady eagerly repeated and were very much provoked indeed arent we sister  i never was so provoked in all my life the fatter sister assented radiantly  by this time clara had recognised her picturegallery acquaintances and drawing her aunt aside she hastily whispered her reminiscences i met them first in the royal academyand they were very kind to meand they were lunching at the next table to us just now you knowand they tried to help me to find the picture i wantedand im sure theyre dear old things  friends of yours are they said mad mathesis well i like their looks you can be civil to them while i get the tickets but do try and arrange your ideas a little more chronologically  and so it came to pass that the four ladies found themselves seated side by side on the same bench waiting for the train and chatting as if they had known one another for years  now this i call quite a remarkable coincidence exclaimed the smaller and more talkative of the two sistersthe one whose legal knowledge had annihilated the cabdriver not only that we should be waiting for the same train and at the same stationthat would be curious enoughbut actually on the same day and the same hour of the day thats what strikes me so forcibly she glanced at the fatter and more silent sister whose chief function in life seemed to be to support the family opinion and who meekly responded  and me too sister  those are not independent coincidences mad mathesis was just beginning when clara ventured to interpose  theres no jolting here she pleaded meekly would you mind writing it down now  out came the ivory tablets once more what was it then said her aunt  one glass of lemonade one sandwich one biscuitoh dear me cried poor clara the historical tone suddenly changing to a wail of agony  toothache said her aunt calmly as she wrote down the items the two sisters instantly opened their reticules and produced two different remedies for neuralgia each marked unequalled  it isnt that said poor clara thank you very much its only that i cant remember how much i paid  well try and make it out then said her aunt youve got yesterdays luncheon to help you you know and heres the luncheon we had the day beforethe first day we went to that shopone glass lemonade four sandwiches ten biscuits total oneandfivepence she handed the tablets to clara who gazed at them with eyes so dim with tears that she did not at first notice that she was holding them upside down  the two sisters had been listening to all this with the deepest interest and at this juncture the smaller one softly laid her hand on claras arm  do you know my dear she said coaxingly my sister and i are in the very same predicament quite identically the very same predicament arent we sister  quite identically and absolutely the very began the fatter sister but she was constructing her sentence on too large a scale and the little one would not wait for her to finish it  yes my dear she resumed we were lunching at the very same shop as you wereand we had two glasses of lemonade and three sandwiches and five biscuitsand neither of us has the least idea what we paid have we sister  quite identically and absolutely murmured the other who evidently considered that she was now a whole sentence in arrears and that she ought to discharge one obligation before contracting any fresh liabilities but the little lady broke in again and she retired from the conversation a bankrupt  would you make it out for us my dear pleaded the little old lady  you can do arithmetic i trust her aunt said a little anxiously as clara turned from one tablet to another vainly trying to collect her thoughts her mind was a blank and all human expression was rapidly fading out of her face  a gloomy silence ensued     knot viii  de omnibus rebus     this little pig went to market    this little pig staid at home   by her radiancys express command said the governor as he conducted the travellers for the last time from the imperial presence i shall now have the ecstasy of escorting you as far as the outer gate of the military quarter where the agony of partingif indeed nature can survive the shockmust be endured from that gate grurmstipths start every quarter of an hour both ways  would you mind repeating that word said norman grurm  grurmstipths the governor repeated you call them omnibuses in england they run both ways and you can travel by one of them all the way down to the harbour  the old man breathed a sigh of relief four hours of courtly ceremony had wearied him and he had been in constant terror lest something should call into use the ten thousand additional bamboos  in another minute they were crossing a large quadrangle paved with marble and tastefully decorated with a pigsty in each corner soldiers carrying pigs were marching in all directions and in the middle stood a gigantic officer giving orders in a voice of thunder which made itself heard above all the uproar of the pigs  it is the commanderinchief the governor hurriedly whispered to his companions who at once followed his example in prostrating themselves before the great man the commander gravely bowed in return he was covered with gold lace from head to foot his face wore an expression of deep misery and he had a little black pig under each arm still the gallant fellow did his best in the midst of the orders he was every moment issuing to his men to bid a courteous farewell to the departing guests  farewell oh old onecarry these three to the south cornerand farewell to thee thou young oneput this fat one on the top of the others in the western stymay your shadows never be lesswoe is me it is wrongly done empty out all the sties and begin again and the soldier leant upon his sword and wiped away a tear  he is in distress the governor explained as they left the court her radiancy has commanded him to place twentyfour pigs in those four sties so that as she goes round the court she may always find the number in each sty nearer to ten than the number in the last  does she call ten nearer to ten than nine is said norman  surely said the governor her radiancy would admit that ten is nearer to ten than nine isand also nearer than eleven is  then i think it can be done said norman  the governor shook his head the commander has been transferring them in vain for four months he said what hope remains and her radiancy has ordered up ten thousand additional  the pigs dont seem to enjoy being transferred the old man hastily interrupted he did not like the subject of bamboos  they are only provisionally transferred you know said the governor in most cases they are immediately carried back again so they need not mind it and all is done with the greatest care under the personal superintendence of the commanderinchief  of course she would only go once round said norman  alas no sighed their conductor round and round round and round these are her radiancys own words but oh agony here is the outer gate and we must part he sobbed as he shook hands with them and the next moment was briskly walking away  he might have waited to see us off said the old man piteously  and he neednt have begun whistling the very moment he left us said the young one severely but look sharphere are two whatshisnames in the act of starting  unluckily the seabound omnibus was full never mind said norman cheerily well walk on till the next one overtakes us  they trudged on in silence both thinking over the military problem till they met an omnibus coming from the sea the elder traveller took out his watch just twelve minutes and a half since we started he remarked in an absent manner suddenly the vacant face brightened the old man had an idea my boy he shouted bringing his hand down upon normans shoulder so suddenly as for a moment to transfer his centre of gravity beyond the base of support  thus taken off his guard the young man wildly staggered forwards and seemed about to plunge into space but in another moment he had gracefully recovered himself problem in precession and nutation he remarkedin tones where filial respect only just managed to conceal a shade of annoyance what is it he hastily added fearing his father might have been taken ill will you have some brandy  when will the next omnibus overtake us when when the old man cried growing more excited every moment  norman looked gloomy give me time he said i must think it over and once more the travellers passed on in silencea silence only broken by the distant squeals of the unfortunate little pigs who were still being provisionally transferred from sty to sty under the personal superintendence of the commanderinchief     knot ix  a serpent with corners     water water every where    nor any drop to drink   itll just take one more pebble  what ever are you doing with those buckets  the speakers were hugh and lambert place the beach of little mendip time 130 pm hugh was floating a bucket in another a size larger and trying how many pebbles it would carry without sinking lambert was lying on his back doing nothing  for the next minute or two hugh was silent evidently deep in thought suddenly he started i say look here lambert he cried  if its alive and slimy and with legs i dont care to said lambert  didnt balbus say this morning that if a body is immersed in liquid it displaces as much liquid as is equal to its own bulk said hugh  he said things of that sort lambert vaguely replied  well just look here a minute heres the little bucket almost quite immersed so the water displaced ought to be just about the same bulk and now just look at it he took out the little bucket as he spoke and handed the big one to lambert why theres hardly a teacupful do you mean to say that water is the same bulk as the little bucket  course it is said lambert  well look here again cried hugh triumphantly as he poured the water from the big bucket into the little one why it doesnt half fill it  thats its business said lambert if balbus says its the same bulk why it is the same bulk you know  well i dont believe it said hugh  you neednt said lambert besides its dinnertime come along  they found balbus waiting dinner for them and to him hugh at once propounded his difficulty  lets get you helped first said balbus briskly cutting away at the joint you know the old proverb mutton first mechanics afterwards  the boys did not know the proverb but they accepted it in perfect good faith as they did every piece of information however startling that came from so infallible an authority as their tutor they ate on steadily in silence and when dinner was over hugh set out the usual array of pens ink and paper while balbus repeated to them the problem he had prepared for their afternoons task  a friend of mine has a flowergardena very pretty one though no great size  how big is it said hugh  thats what you have to find out balbus gaily replied all i tell you is that it is oblong in shapejust half a yard longer than its widthand that a gravelwalk one yard wide begins at one corner and runs all round it  joining into itself said hugh  not joining into itself young man just before doing that it turns a corner and runs round the garden again alongside of the first portion and then inside that again winding in and in and each lap touching the last one till it has used up the whole of the area  like a serpent with corners said lambert  exactly so and if you walk the whole length of it to the last inch keeping in the centre of the path its exactly two miles and half a furlong now while you find out the length and breadth of the garden ill see if i can think out that seawater puzzle  you said it was a flowergarden hugh inquired as balbus was leaving the room  i did said balbus  where do the flowers grow said hugh but balbus thought it best not to hear the question he left the boys to their problem and in the silence of his own room set himself to unravel hughs mechanical paradox  to fix our thoughts he murmured to himself as with hands deepburied in his pockets he paced up and down the room we will take a cylindrical glass jar with a scale of inches marked up the side and fill it with water up to the 10inch mark and we will assume that every inch depth of jar contains a pint of water we will now take a solid cylinder such that every inch of it is equal in bulk to half a pint of water and plunge 4 inches of it into the water so that the end of the cylinder comes down to the 6inch mark well that displaces 2 pints of water what becomes of them why if there were no more cylinder they would lie comfortably on the top and fill the jar up to the 12inch mark but unfortunately there is more cylinder occupying half the space between the 10inch and the 12inch marks so that only one pint of water can be accommodated there what becomes of the other pint why if there were no more cylinder it would lie on the top and fill the jar up to the 13inch mark but unfortunatelyshade of newton he exclaimed in sudden accents of terror when does the water stop rising  a bright idea struck him ill write a little essay on it he said                                       balbuss essay  when a solid is immersed in a liquid it is well known that it displaces a portion of the liquid equal to itself in bulk and that the level of the liquid rises just so much as it would rise if a quantity of liquid had been added to it equal in bulk to the solid lardner says precisely the same process occurs when a solid is partially immersed the quantity of liquid displaced in this case equalling the portion of the solid which is immersed and the rise of the level being in proportion  suppose a solid held above the surface of a liquid and partially immersed a portion of the liquid is displaced and the level of the liquid rises but by this rise of level a little bit more of the solid is of course immersed and so there is a new displacement of a second portion of the liquid and a consequent rise of level again this second rise of level causes a yet further immersion and by consequence another displacement of liquid and another rise it is selfevident that this process must continue till the entire solid is immersed and that the liquid will then begin to immerse whatever holds the solid which being connected with it must for the time be considered a part of it if you hold a stick six feet long with its end in a tumbler of water and wait long enough you must eventually be immersed the question as to the source from which the water is suppliedwhich belongs to a high branch of mathematics and is therefore beyond our present scopedoes not apply to the sea let us therefore take the familiar instance of a man standing at the edge of the sea at ebbtide with a solid in his hand which he partially immerses he remains steadfast and unmoved and we all know that he must be drowned the multitudes who daily perish in this manner to attest a philosophical truth and whose bodies the unreasoning wave casts sullenly upon our thankless shores have a truer claim to be called the martyrs of science than a galileo or a kepler to use kossuths eloquent phrase they are the unnamed demigods of the nineteenth centuryb                                       theres a fallacy somewhere he murmured drowsily as he stretched his long legs upon the sofa i must think it over again he closed his eyes in order to concentrate his attention more perfectly and for the next hour or so his slow and regular breathing bore witness to the careful deliberation with which he was investigating this new and perplexing view of the subject  illustration he remains steadfast and unmoved  footnote  footnote b note by the writerfor the

the gentle girl filled with tears as she spoke  sadbut very curious when you come to look at it arithmetically was her aunts less romantic reply some of them have lost an arm in their countrys service some a leg some an ear some an eye  and some perhaps all clara murmured dreamily as they passed the long rows of weatherbeaten heroes basking in the sun did you notice that very old one with a red face who was drawing a map in the dust with his wooden leg and all the others watching i think it was a plan of a battle  the battle of trafalgar no doubt her aunt interrupted briskly  hardly that i think clara ventured to say you see in that case he couldnt well be alive  couldnt well be alive the old lady contemptuously repeated hes as lively as you and me put together why if drawing a map in the dustwith ones wooden legdoesnt prove one to be alive perhaps youll kindly mention what does prove it  clara did not see her way out of it logic had never been her forte  to return to the arithmetic mad mathesis resumedthe eccentric old lady never let slip an opportunity of driving her niece into a calculationwhat percentage do you suppose must have lost all foura leg an arm an eye and an ear  how can i tell gasped the terrified girl she knew well what was coming  you cant of course without data her aunt replied but im just going to give you  give her a chelsea bun miss thats what most young ladies likes best the voice was rich and musical and the speaker dexterously whipped back the snowy cloth that covered his basket and disclosed a tempting array of the familiar square buns joined together in rows richly egged and browned and glistening in the sun  no sir i shall give her nothing so indigestible be off the old lady waved her parasol threateningly but nothing seemed to disturb the goodhumour of the jolly old man who marched on chanting his melodious refrain  music chelsea buns chelsea buns hot chelsea buns  piping hot chelsea buns hot chelsea buns  far too indigestible my love said the old lady percentages will agree with you ever so much better  clara sighed and there was a hungry look in her eyes as she watched the basket lessening in the distance but she meekly listened to the relentless old lady who at once proceeded to count off the data on her fingers  say that 70 per cent have lost an eye75 per cent an ear80 per cent an arm85 per cent a legthatll do it beautifully now my dear what percentage at least must have lost all four  no more conversation occurredunless a smothered exclamation of piping hot which escaped from claras lips as the basket vanished round a corner could be counted as suchuntil they reached the old chelsea mansion where claras father was then staying with his three sons and their old tutor  balbus lambert and hugh had entered the house only a few minutes before them they had been out walking and hugh had been propounding a difficulty which had reduced lambert to the depths of gloom and had even puzzled balbus  it changes from wednesday to thursday at midnight doesnt it hugh had begun  sometimes said balbus cautiously  always said lambert decisively  sometimes balbus gently insisted six midnights out of seven it changes to some other name  i meant of course hugh corrected himself when it does change from wednesday to thursday it does it at midnightand only at midnight  surely said balbus lambert was silent  well now suppose its midnight here in chelsea then its wednesday west of chelsea say in ireland or america where midnight hasnt arrived yet and its thursday east of chelsea say in germany or russia where midnight has just passed by  surely balbus said again even lambert nodded this time  but it isnt midnight anywhere else so it cant be changing from one day to another anywhere else and yet if ireland and america and so on call it wednesday and germany and russia and so on call it thursday there must be some placenot chelseathat has different days on the two sides of it and the worst of it is the people there get their days in the wrong order theyve got wednesday east of them and thursday westjust as if their day had changed from thursday to wednesday  ive heard that puzzle before cried lambert and ill tell you the explanation when a ship goes round the world from east to west we know that it loses a day in its reckoning so that when it gets home and calls its day wednesday it finds people here calling it thursday because weve had one more midnight than the ship has had and when you go the other way round you gain a day  i know all that said hugh in reply to this not very lucid explanation but it doesnt help me because the ship hasnt proper days one way round you get more than twentyfour hours to the day and the other way you get less so of course the names get wrong but people that live on in one place always get twentyfour hours to the day  i suppose there is such a place balbus said meditatively though i never heard of it and the people must find it very queer as hugh says to have the old day east of them and the new one west because when midnight comes round to them with the new day in front of it and the old one behind it one doesnt see exactly what happens i must think it over  so they had entered the house in the state i have describedbalbus puzzled and lambert buried in gloomy thought  yes mm master is at home mm said the stately old butler nbit is only a butler of experience who can manage a series of three ms together without any interjacent vowels and the ole party is awaiting for you in the libery  i dont like his calling your father an old party mad mathesis whispered to her niece as they crossed the hall and clara had only just time to whisper in reply he meant the whole party before they were ushered into the library and the sight of the five solemn faces there assembled chilled her into silence  her father sat at the head of the table and mutely signed to the ladies to take the two vacant chairs one on each side of him his three sons and balbus completed the party writing materials had been arranged round the table after the fashion of a ghostly banquet the butler had evidently bestowed much thought on the grim device sheets of quarto paper each flanked by a pen on one side and a pencil on the other represented the platespenwipers did duty for rolls of breadwhile inkbottles stood in the places usually occupied by wineglasses the pièce de resistance was a large green baize bag which gave forth as the old man restlessly lifted it from side to side a charming jingle as of innumerable golden guineas  sister daughter sonsand balbus the old man began so nervously that balbus put in a gentle hear hear while hugh drummed on the table with his fists this disconcerted the unpractised orator sister he began again then paused a moment moved the bag to the other side and went on with a rush i meanthis beinga critical occasionmore or lessbeing the year when one of my sons comes of age he paused again in some confusion having evidently got into the middle of his speech sooner than he intended but it was too late to go back hear hear cried balbus quite so said the old gentleman recovering his selfpossession a little when first i began this annual custommy friend balbus will correct me if i am wrong hugh whispered with a strap but nobody heard him except lambert who only frowned and shook his head at him this annual custom of giving each of my sons as many guineas as would represent his ageit was a critical timeso balbus informed meas the ages of two of you were together equal to that of the thirdso on that occasion i made a speech he paused so long that balbus thought it well to come to the rescue with the words it was a most but the old man checked him with a warning look yes made a speech he repeated a few years after that balbus pointed outi say pointed out hear hear cried balbus quite so said the grateful old man that it was another critical occasion the ages of two of you were together double that of the third so i made another speechanother speech and now again its a critical occasionso balbus saysand i am making here mad mathesis pointedly referred to her watch all the haste i can the old man cried with wonderful presence of mind indeed sister im coming to the point now the number of years that have passed since that first occasion is just twothirds of the number of guineas i then gave you now my boys calculate your ages from the data and you shall have the money  but we know our ages cried hugh  silence sir thundered the old man rising to his full height he was exactly fivefoot five in his indignation i say you must use the data only you mustnt even assume which it is that comes of age he clutched the bag as he spoke and with tottering steps it was about as much as he could do to carry it he left the room  and you shall have a similar cadeau the old lady whispered to her niece when youve calculated that percentage and she followed her brother  nothing could exceed the solemnity with which the old couple had risen from the table and yet was itwas it a grin with which the father turned away from his unhappy sons could it becould it be a wink with which the aunt abandoned her despairing niece and were thosewere those sounds of suppressed chuckling which floated into the room just before balbus who had followed them out closed the door surely not and yet the butler told the cookbut no that was merely idle gossip and i will not repeat it  the shades of evening granted their unuttered petition and closed not oer them for the butler brought in the lamp the same obliging shades left them a lonely bark the wail of a dog in the backyard baying the moon for awhile but neither morn alas nor any other epoch seemed likely to restore themto that peace of mind which had once been theirs ere ever these problems had swooped upon them and crushed them with a load of unfathomable mystery  its hardly fair muttered hugh to give us such a jumble as this to work out  fair clara echoed bitterly well  and to all my readers i can but repeat the last words of gentle clara     farewell     appendix       a knot said alice oh do let me help to undo it   answers to knot i  problemtwo travellers spend from 3 oclock till 9 in walking along a level road up a hill and home again their pace on the level being 4 miles an hour up hill 3 and down hill 6 find distance walked also within half an hour time of reaching top of hill  answer24 miles halfpast 6                                       solutiona level mile takes 14 of an hour up hill 13 down hill 16 hence to go and return over the same mile whether on the level or on the hillside takes 12 an hour hence in 6 hours they went 12 miles out and 12 back if the 12 miles out had been nearly all level they would have taken a little over 3 hours if nearly all up hill a little under 4 hence 312 hours must be within 12 an hour of the time taken in reaching the peak thus as they started at 3 they got there within 12 an hour of 12 past 6                                       twentyseven answers have come in of these 9 are right 16 partially right and 2 wrong the 16 give the distance correctly but they have failed to grasp the fact that the top of the hill might have been reached at any moment between 6 oclock and 7  the two wrong answers are from gerty vernon and a nihilist the former makes the distance 23 miles while her revolutionary companion puts it at 27 gerty vernon says they had to go 4 miles along the plain and got to the foot of the hill at 4 oclock they might have done so i grant but you have no ground for saying they did so it was 712 miles to the top of the hill and they reached that at 14 before 7 oclock here you go wrong in your arithmetic and i must however reluctantly bid you farewell 712 miles at 3 miles an hour would not require 234 hours a nihilist says let x denote the whole number of miles y the number of hours to hilltop  therefore 3y  number of miles to hilltop and x3y  number of miles on the other side you bewilder me the other side of what of the hill you say but then how did they get home again however to accommodate your views we will build a new hostelry at the foot of the hill on the opposite side and also assume what i grant you is possible though it is not necessarily true that there was no level road at all even then you go wrong  you say     y  6  x  3y6  i     x412  6               ii  i grant you i but i deny ii it rests on the assumption that to go part of the time at 3 miles an hour and the rest at 6 miles an hour comes to the same result as going the whole time at 412 miles an hour but this would only be true if the part were an exact half ie if they went up hill for 3 hours and down hill for the other 3 which they certainly did not do  the sixteen who are partially right are agnes bailey f k fifee g e b h p kit m e t mysie a mothers son nairam a redruthian a socialist spear maiden t b c vis inertiÆ and yak of these f k fifee t b c and vis inertiÆ do not attempt the second part at all f k and h p give no working the rest make particular assumptions such as that there was

other traveller how many did each meet  answers1 19 2 the easterly traveller met 12 the other 8                                       the trains one way took 180 minutes the other way 120 let us take the l c m 360 and divide the railway into 360 units then one set of trains went at the rate of 2 units a minute and at intervals of 30 units the other at the rate of 3 units a minute and at intervals of 45 units an easterly train starting has 45 units between it and the first train it will meet it does 25ths of this while the other does 35ths and thus meets it at the end of 18 units and so all the way round a westerly train starting has 30 units between it and the first train it will meet it does 35ths of this while the other does 25ths and thus meets it at the end of 18 units and so all the way round hence if the railway be divided by 19 posts into 20 parts each containing 18 units trains meet at every post and in 1 each traveller passes 19 posts in going round and so meets 19 trains but in 2 the easterly traveller only begins to count after traversing 25ths of the journey ie on reaching the 8th post and so counts 12 posts similarly the other counts 8 they meet at the end of 25ths of

bopeep financier i w t kate b m a h q y z seagull thistledown tomquad and an unsigned one bopeep rightly says that the easterly traveller met all trains which started during the 3 hours of her trip as well as all which started during the previous 2 hours ie all which started at the commencements of 20 periods of 15 minutes each and she is right in striking out the one she met at the moment of starting but wrong in striking out the last train for she did not meet this at the terminus but 15 minutes before she got there she makes the same mistake in 2 financier thinks that any train met for the second time is not to be counted i w t finds by a process which is not stated that the travellers met at the end of 71 minutes and 2612 seconds kate b thinks the trains which are met on starting and on arriving are never to be counted even when met elsewhere q y z tries a rather complex algebraical solution and succeeds in finding the time of meeting correctly all else is wrong seagull seems to think that in 1 the easterly train stood still for 3 hours and says that in 2 the travellers met at the end of 71 minutes 40 seconds thistledown nobly confesses to having tried no calculation but merely having drawn a picture of the railway and counted the trains in 1 she counts wrong in 2 she makes them meet in 75 minutes tomquad omits 1 in 2 he makes clara count the train she met on her arrival the unsigned one is also unintelligible it states that the travellers go 124th more than the total distance to be traversed the clara theory already referred to is adopted by 5 of these viz

which the westerly traveller has to meet into 2 sets viz those already on the line which they rightly make 11 and those which started during her 2 hours journey exclusive of train met on arrival which they wrongly make 7 and they make a similar mistake with the easterly train bridget rightly says that the westerly traveller met a train every 6 minutes for 2 hours but wrongly makes the number 20 it should be 21 g e b adopts bopeeps method but wrongly strikes out for the easterly traveller the train which started at the commencement of the previous 2 hours mary thinks a train met on arrival must

send a joint answer greystead guy old hen and simple susan the latter was once best of all the old hen has taken advantage of her simplicity and beguiled her with the chaff which was the bane of her own chickenhood  secondly i point the finger of scorn at those who have put the worst candidate at the top arranging them as zuzu mimi lolo they are graecia m m old cat and r e x tis greece but  the third set have avoided both these enormities and have even succeeded in putting the worst last their answer being lolo mimi zuzu their names are ayr who also appears among the quite too too clifton c f b fifee grig janet and mrs sairey gamp f b has not fallen into the common error she multiplies together the proportionate numbers she gets but in getting them she goes wrong by reckoning warmth as a demerit possibly she is freshly burnt or comes from bombay janet and mrs sairey gamp have also avoided this error the method they have adopted is shrouded in mysteryi scarcely feel competent to criticize it mrs gamp says if zuzu makes 4 while lolo makes 3 zuzu makes 6 while lolo makes 5 bad reasoning while mimi makes 2 from this she concludes therefore zuzu excels in speed by 1 ie when compared with lolo but what about mimi she then compares the 3 kinds of excellence measured on this mystic scale janet takes the statement that lolo makes 5 while mimi makes 2 to prove that lolo makes 3 while mimi makes 1 and zuzu 4 worse reasoning than mrs gamps and thence concludes that zuzu excels in speed by 18 janet should have been adeline mystery of mysteries  the fourth set actually put mimi at the top arranging them as mimi zuzu lolo they are marquis and co martreb s b b first initial scarcely legible may be meant for j and stanza  the fifth set consist of an ancient fish and camel these illassorted comrades by dint of foot and fin have scrambled into the right answer but as their method is wrong of course it counts for nothing also an ancient fish has very ancient and fishlike ideas as to how numbers represent merit she says lolo gains 212 on mimi two and a half what fish fish art thou in thy duty  of the five winners i put balbus and the elder traveller slightly below the other threebalbus for defective reasoning the other for scanty working balbus gives two reasons for saying that addition of marks is not the right method and then adds it follows that the decision must be made by multiplying the marks together this is hardly more logical than to say this is not spring therefore it must be autumn   class list  i     dinah mite    e b d l    joram  ii     balbus    the elder traveller                                       with regard to knot v i beg to express to vis inertiÆ and to any others who like her understood the condition to be that every marked picture must have three marks my sincere regret that the unfortunate phrase fill the columns with oughts and crosses should have caused them to waste so much time and trouble i can only repeat that a literal interpretation of fill would seem to me to require that every picture in the gallery should be marked vis inertiÆ would have been in the first class if she had sent in the solution she now offers   answers to knot vii  problemgiven that one glass of lemonade 3 sandwiches and 7 biscuits cost 1s 2d and that one glass of lemonade 4 sandwiches and 10 biscuits cost 1s 5d find the cost of 1 a glass of lemonade a sandwich and a biscuit and 2 2 glasses of lemonade 3 sandwiches and 5 biscuits  answer1 8d 2 1s 7d  solutionthis is best treated algebraically let x  the cost in pence of a glass of lemonade y of a sandwich and z of a biscuit then we have x  3y  7z  14 and x  4y  10z  17 and we require the values of x  y  z and of 2x  3y  5z now from two equations only we cannot find separately the values of three unknowns certain combinations of them may however be found also we know that we can by the help of the given equations eliminate 2 of the 3 unknowns from the quantity whose value is required which will then contain one only if then the required value is ascertainable at all it can only be by the 3rd unknown vanishing of itself otherwise the problem is impossible  let us then eliminate lemonade and sandwiches and reduce everything to biscuitsa state of things even more depressing than if all the world were applepieby subtracting the 1st equation from the 2nd which eliminates lemonade and gives y  3z  3 or y  33z and then substituting this value of y in the 1st which gives x2z  5 ie x  5  2z now if we substitute these values of x y in the quantities whose values are required the first becomes 5  2z  33z  z ie 8 and the second becomes 25  2z  333z  5z ie 19 hence the answers are 1 8d 2 1s 7d                                       the above is a universal method that is it is absolutely certain either to produce the answer or to prove that no answer is possible the question may also be solved by combining the quantities whose values are given so as to form those whose values are required this is merely a matter of ingenuity and good luck and as it may fail even when the thing is possible and is of no use in proving it impossible i cannot rank this method as equal in value with the other even when it succeeds it may prove a very tedious process suppose the 26 competitors who have sent in what i may call accidental solutions had had a question to deal with where every number contained 8 or 10 digits i suspect it would have been a case of silvered is the raven hair see patience before any solution would have been hit on by the most ingenious of them  fortyfive answers have come in of which 44 give i am happy to say some sort of working and therefore deserve to be mentioned by name and to have their virtues or vices as the case may be discussed thirteen have made assumptions to which they have no right and so cannot figure in the classlist even though in 10 of the 13 cases the answer is right of the remaining 28 no less than 26 have sent in accidental solutions and therefore fall short of the highest honours  i will now discuss individual cases taking the worst first as my custom is  froggy gives no workingat least this is all he gives after stating the given equations he says therefore the difference 1 sandwich  3 biscuits  3d then follow the amounts of the unknown bills with no further hint as to how he got them froggy has had a very narrow escape of not being named at all  of those who are wrong vis inertiÆ has sent in a piece of incorrect working peruse the horrid details and shudder she takes x call it y as the cost of a sandwich and concludes rightly enough that a biscuit will cost 3y3 she then subtracts the second equation from the first and deduces 3y  7 × 3y34y  10 × 3y3  3 by making two mistakes in this line she brings out y  32 try it again oh vis inertiÆ away with inertiÆ infuse a little more vis and you will bring out the correct though uninteresting result 0  0 this will show you that it is hopeless to try to coax any one of these 3 unknowns to reveal its separate value the other competitor who is wrong throughout is either j m c or t m c but whether he be a juvenile miscalculator or a true mathematician confused he makes the answers 7d and 1s 5d he assumes with too much confidence that biscuits were 12d each and that clara paid for 8 though she only ate 7  we will now consider the 13 whose working is wrong though the answer is right and not to measure their demerits too exactly i will take them in alphabetical order anita finds rightly that 1 sandwich and 3 biscuits cost 3d and proceeds therefore 1 sandwich  112d 3 biscuits  112d 1 lemonade  6d dinah mite begins like anita and thence proves rightly that a biscuit costs less than a 1d whence she concludes wrongly that it must cost 12d f c w is so beautifully resigned to the certainty of a verdict of guilty that i have hardly the heart to utter the word without adding a recommended to mercy owing to extenuating circumstances but really you know where are the extenuating circumstances she begins by assuming that lemonade is 4d a glass and sandwiches 3d each making with the 2 given equations four conditions to be fulfilled by three miserable unknowns and having naturally developed this into a contradiction she then tries 5d and 2d with a similar result nb this process might have been carried on through the whole of the tertiary period without gratifying one single megatherium she then by a happy thought tries halfpenny biscuits and so obtains a consistent result this may be a good solution viewing the problem as a conundrum but it is not scientific janet identifies sandwiches with biscuits one sandwich  3 biscuits she makes equal to 4 four what mayfair makes the astounding assertion that the equation s  3b  3 is evidently only satisfied by s  32 b  12 old cat believes that the assumption that a sandwich costs 112d is the only way to avoid unmanageable fractions but why avoid them is there not a certain glow of triumph in taming such a fraction ladies and gentlemen the fraction now before you is one that for years defied all efforts of a refining nature it was in a word hopelessly vulgar treating it as a circulating decimal the treadmill of fractions only made matters worse as a last resource i reduced it to its lowest terms and extracted its square root joking apart let me thank old cat for some very kind words of sympathy in reference to a correspondent whose name i am happy to say i have now forgotten who had found fault with me as a discourteous critic o v l is beyond my comprehension he takes the given equations as 1 and 2 thence by the process 21 deduces rightly equation 3 viz s  3b  3 and thence again by the process x3 a hopeless mystery deduces 3s  4b  4 i have nothing to say about it i give it up seabreeze says it is immaterial to the answer why in what proportion 3d is divided between the sandwich and the 3 biscuits so she assumes s  l12d b  12d stanza is one of a very irregular metre at first she like janet identifies sandwiches with biscuits she then tries two assumptions s  1 b  23 and s  12 b  56 and naturally ends in contradictions then she returns to the first assumption and finds the 3 unknowns separately quod est absurdum stiletto identifies sandwiches and biscuits as articles is the word ever used by confectioners i fancied what is the next article maam was limited to linendrapers two sisters first assume that biscuits are 4 a penny and then that they are 2 a penny adding that the answer will of course be the same in both cases it is a dreamy remark making one feel something like macbeth grasping at the spectral dagger is this a statement that i see before me if you were to say we both walked the same way this morning and i were to say one of you walked the same way but the other didnt which of the three would be the most hopelessly confused turtle pyate what is a turtle pyate please and old crow who send a joint answer and y y adopt the same method y y gets the equation s  3b  3 and then says this sum must be apportioned in one of the three following ways it may be i grant you but y y do you say must i fear it is possible for y y to be two ys the other two conspirators are less positive they say it can be so divided but they add either of the three prices being right this is bad grammar and bad arithmetic at once oh mysterious birds  of those who win honours the shetland snark must have the 3rd class all to himself he has only answered half the question viz the amount of claras luncheon the two little old ladies he pitilessly leaves in the midst of their difficulty i beg to assure him with thanks for his friendly remarks that entrancefees and subscriptions are things unknown in that most economical of clubs the knotuntiers  the authors of the 26 accidental solutions differ only in the number of steps they have taken between the data and the answers in order to do them full justice i have arranged the 2nd class in sections according to the number of steps the two kings are fearfully deliberate i suppose walking quick or taking short cuts is inconsistent with kingly dignity but really in reading theseus solution one almost fancied he was marking time and making no advance at all the other king will i hope pardon me for having altered coal into cole king coilus or coil seems

lays it down as a general principle that in order to ascertain the cost of any one luncheon it must come to the same amount upon two different assumptions query should not it be we otherwise the luncheon is represented as wishing to ascertain its own cost he then makes two assumptionsone that sandwiches cost nothing the other that biscuits cost nothing either arrangement would lead to the shop being inconveniently crowdedand brings out the unknown luncheons as 8d and 19d on each assumption he then concludes that this agreement of results shows that the answers are correct now i propose to disprove his general law by simply giving one instance of its failing one instance is quite enough in logical language in order to disprove a universal affirmative it is enough to prove its contradictory which is a particular negative i must pause for a digression on logic and especially on ladies logic the universal affirmative everybody says hes a duck is crushed instantly by proving the particular negative peter says hes a goose which is equivalent to peter does not say hes a duck and the universal negative nobody calls on her is well met by the particular affirmative i called yesterday in short either of two contradictories disproves the other and the moral is that since a particular proposition is much more easily proved than a universal one it is the wisest course in arguing with a lady to limit ones own assertions to particulars and leave her to prove the universal contradictory if she can you will thus generally secure a logical victory a practical victory is not to be hoped for since she can always fall back upon the crushing remark that has nothing to do with ita move for which man has not yet discovered any satisfactory answer now let us return to balbus here is my particular negative on which to test his rule suppose the two recorded luncheons to have been 2 buns one queencake 2 sausagerolls and a bottle of zoëdone total oneandninepence and one bun 2 queencakes a sausageroll and a bottle of zoëdone total oneandfourpence and suppose claras unknown luncheon to have been 3 buns one queencake one sausageroll and 2 bottles of zoëdone while the two little sisters had been indulging in 8 buns 4 queencakes 2 sausagerolls and 6 bottles of zoëdone poor souls how thirsty they must have been if balbus will kindly try this by his principle of two assumptions first assuming that a bun is 1d and a queencake 2d and then that a bun is 3d and a queencake 3d he will bring out the other two luncheons on each assumption as oneandninepence and fourandtenpence respectively which harmony of results he will say shows that the answers are correct and yet as a matter of fact the buns were 2d each the queencakes 3d the sausagerolls 6d and the zoëdone 2d a bottle so that claras third luncheon had cost oneandsevenpence and her thirsty friends had spent fourandfourpence  another remark of balbus i will quote and discuss for i think that it also may yield a moral for some of my readers he says it is the same thing in substance whether in solving this problem we use words and call it arithmetic or use letters and signs and call it algebra now this does not appear to me a correct description of the two methods the arithmetical method is that of synthesis only it goes from one known fact to another till it reaches its goal whereas the algebraical method is that of analysis it begins with the goal symbolically represented and so goes backwards dragging its veiled victim with it till it has reached the full daylight of known facts in which it can tear off the veil and say i know you  take an illustration your house has been broken into and robbed and you appeal to the policeman who was on duty that night well mum i did see a chap getting out over your gardenwall but i was a good bit off so i didnt chase him like i just cut down the short way to the chequers and who should i meet but bill sykes coming full split round the corner so i just ups and says my lad youre wanted thats all i says and he says ill go along quiet bobby he says without the darbies he says theres your arithmetical policeman now try the other method i seed somebody a running but he was well gone or ever i got nigh the place so i just took a look round in the garden and i noticed the footmarks where the chap had come right across your flowerbeds they was good big footmarks surely and i noticed as the left foot went down at the heel ever so much deeper than the other and i says to myself the chaps been a big hulking chap and he goes lame on his left foot and i rubs my hand on the wall where he got over and there was soot on it and no mistake so i says to myself now where can i light on a big man in the chimbleysweep line whats lame of one foot and i flashes up permiscuous and i says its bill sykes says i there is your algebraical policemana higher intellectual type to my thinking than the other  little jacks solution calls for a word of praise as he has written out what really is an algebraical proof in words without representing any of his facts as equations if it is all his own he will make a good algebraist in the time to come i beg to thank simple susan for some kind words of sympathy to the same effect as those received from old cat  hecla and martreb are the only two who have used a method certain either to produce

§ 7 14 steps     theseus   answers to correspondents  i have received several letters on the subjects of knots ii and vi which lead me to think some further explanation desirable  in knot ii i had intended the numbering of the houses to begin at one corner of the square and this was assumed by most if not all of the competitors trojanus however says assuming in default of any information that the street enters the square in the middle of each side it may be supposed that the numbering begins at a street but surely the other is the more natural assumption  in knot vi the first problem was of course a mere jeu de mots whose presence i thought excusable in a series of problems whose aim is to entertain rather than to instruct but it has not escaped the contemptuous criticisms of two of my correspondents who seem to think that apollo is in duty bound to keep his bow always on the stretch neither of them has guessed it and this is true human nature only the other daythe 31st of september to be quite exacti met my old friend brown and gave him a riddle i had just heard with one great effort of his colossal mind brown guessed it right said i ah said he its very neatvery neat and it isnt an answer that would occur to everybody very neat indeed a few yards further on i fell in with smith and to him i propounded the same riddle he frowned over it for a minute and then gave it up meekly i faltered out the answer a poor thing sir smith growled as he turned away a very poor thing i wonder you care to repeat such rubbish yet smiths mind is if possible even more colossal than browns  the second problem of knot vi is an example in ordinary double rule of three whose essential feature is that the result depends on the variation of several elements which are so related to it that if all but one be constant it varies as that one hence if none be constant it varies as their product thus for example the cubical contents of a rectangular tank vary as its length if breadth and depth be constant and so on hence if none be constant it varies as the product of the length breadth and depth  when the result is not thus connected with the varying elements the problem ceases to be double rule of three and often becomes one of great complexity  to illustrate this let us take two candidates for a prize a and b who are to compete in french german and italian  a let it be laid down that the result is to depend on their relative knowledge of each subject so that whether their marks for french be 1 2 or 100 200 the result will be the same and let it also be laid down that if they get equal marks on 2 papers the final marks are to have the same ratio as those of the 3rd paper this is a case of ordinary double rule of three we multiply as 3 marks together and do the same for b note that if a gets a single 0 his final mark is 0 even if he gets full marks for 2 papers while b gets only one mark for each paper this of course would be very unfair on a though a correct solution under the given conditions  b the result is to depend as before on relative knowledge but french is to have twice as much weight as german or italian this is an unusual form of question i should be inclined to say the resulting ratio is to be nearer to the french ratio than if we multiplied as in a and so much nearer that it would be necessary to use the other multipliers twice to produce the same result as in a eg if the french ratio were 910 and the others 49 19 so that the ultimate ratio by method a would be 245 i should multiply instead by 23 13 giving the result 13 which is nearer to 910 than if he had used method a  c the result is to depend on actual amount of knowledge of the 3 subjects collectively here we have to ask two questions 1 what is to be the unit ie standard to measure by in each subject 2 are these units to be of equal or unequal value the usual unit is the knowledge shown by answering the whole paper correctly calling this 100 all lower amounts are represented by numbers between 0 and 100 then if these units are to be of equal value we simply add as 3 marks together and do the same for b  d the conditions are the same as c but french is to have double weight here we simply double the french marks and add as before  e french is to have such weight that if other marks be equal the ultimate ratio is to be that of the french paper so that a 0 in this would swamp the candidate but the other two subjects are only to affect the result collectively by the amount of knowledge shown the two being reckoned of equal value here i should add as german and italian marks together and multiply by his french mark  but i need not go on the problem may evidently be set with many varying conditions each requiring its own method of solution the problem in knot vi was meant to belong to variety a and to make this clear i inserted the following passage  usually the competitors differ in one point only thus last year fifi and gogo made the same number of scarves in the trial week and they were equally light but fifis were twice as warm as gogos and she was pronounced twice as good  what i have said will suffice i hope as an answer to balbus who holds that a and c are the only possible varieties of the problem and that to say we cannot use addition therefore we must be intended to use multiplication is no more illogical than from knowledge that one was not born in the night to infer that he was born in the daytime and also to fifee who says i think a little more consideration will show you that our error of adding the proportional numbers together for each candidate instead of multiplying is no error at all why even if addition had been the right method to use not one of the writers i speak from memory showed any consciousness of the necessity of fixing a unit for each subject no error at all they were positively steeped in error  one correspondent i do not name him as the communication is not quite friendly in tone writes thusi wish to add very respectfully that i think it would be in better taste if you were to abstain from the very trenchant expressions which you are accustomed to indulge in when criticising the answer that such a tone must not be be not agreeable to the persons concerned who have made mistakes may possibly have no great weight with you but i hope you will feel that it would be as well not to employ it unless you are quite certain of being correct yourself the only instances the writer gives of the trenchant expressions are hapless and malefactors i beg to assure him and any others who may need the assurance i trust there are none that all such words have been used in jest and with no idea that they could possibly annoy any one and that i sincerely regret any annoyance i may have thus inadvertently given may i hope that in future they will recognise the distinction between severe language used in sober earnest and the words of unmeant bitterness which coleridge has alluded to in that lovely passage beginning a little child a limber elf if the writer will refer to that passage or to the preface to fire famine and slaughter he will find the distinction for which i plead far better drawn out than i could hope to do in any words of mine  the writers insinuation that i care not how much annoyance i give to my readers i think it best to pass over in silence but to his concluding remark i must entirely demur i hold that to use language likely to annoy any of my correspondents would not be in the least justified by the plea that i was quite certain of being correct i trust that the knotuntiers and i are not on such terms as those  i beg to thank g b for the offer of a puzzlewhich however is too like the old one make four 9s into 100

a certain point both ways every 15 minutes a traveller starting on foot along with one of them meets one in 1212 minutes when will he be overtaken by one  answerin 614 minutes                                       solutionlet a be the distance an omnibus goes in 15 minutes and x the distance from the startingpoint to where the traveller is overtaken since the omnibus met is due at the startingpoint in 212 minutes it goes in that time as far as the traveller walks in 1212 ie it goes 5 times as fast now the overtaking omnibus is a behind the traveller when he starts and therefore goes a  x while he goes x hence a  x  5x ie 4x  a and x  a4 this distance would be traversed by an omnibus in 154 minutes and therefore by the traveller in 5 × 154 hence he is overtaken in 1834 minutes after starting ie in 614 minutes after meeting the omnibus                                       four answers have been received of which two are wrong dinah mite rightly states that the overtaking omnibus reached the point where they met the other omnibus 5 minutes after they left but wrongly concludes that going 5 times as fast it would overtake them in another minute the travellers are 5minuteswalk ahead of the omnibus and must walk 14th of this distance farther before the omnibus overtakes them which will be 15th of the distance traversed by the omnibus in the same time this will require 114 minutes more nolens volens tries it by a process like achilles and the tortoise he rightly states that when the overtaking omnibus leaves the gate the travellers are 15th of a ahead and that it will take the omnibus 3 minutes to traverse this distance during which time the travellers he tells us go 115th of a this should be 125th the travellers being now 115th of a ahead he concludes that the work remaining to be done is for the travellers to go 160th of a while the omnibus goes l12th the principle is correct and might have been applied earlier   class list  i     balbus    delta   answers to knot ix   § 1 the buckets  problemlardner states that a solid immersed in a fluid displaces an amount equal to itself in bulk how can this be true of a small bucket floating in a larger one  solutionlardner means by displaces occupies a space which might be filled with water without any change in the surroundings if the portion of the floating bucket which is above the water could be annihilated and the rest of it transformed into water the surrounding water would not change its position which agrees with lardners statement                                       five answers have been received none of which explains the difficulty arising from the wellknown fact that a floating body is the same weight as the displaced fluid hecla says that only that portion of the smaller bucket which descends below the original level of the water can be properly said to be immersed and only an equal bulk of water is displaced hence according to hecla a solid whose weight was equal to that of an equal bulk of water would not float till the whole of it was below the original level of the water but as a matter of fact it would float as soon as it was all under water magpie says the fallacy is the assumption that one body can displace another from a place where it isnt and that lardners assertion is incorrect except when the containing vessel was originally full to the brim but the question of floating depends on the present state of things not on past history old king cole takes the same view as hecla tympanum and vindex assume that displaced means raised above its original level and merely explain how it comes to pass that the water so raised is less in bulk than the immersed portion of bucket and thus land themselvesor rather set themselves floatingin the same boat as

vessel of water the water will rise through a series of distances two inches one inch half an inch c which series has no end he concludes that the water will rise without limit is this true

answer60 6012  solutionthe number of yards and fractions of a yard traversed in walking along a straight piece of walk is evidently the same as the number of squareyards and fractions of a squareyard contained in that piece of walk and the distance traversed in passing through a squareyard at a corner is evidently a yard hence the area of the garden is 3630 squareyards ie if x be the width x x  12  3630 solving this quadratic we find x  60 hence the dimensions are 60 6012                                       twelve answers have been receivedseven right and five wrong  c g l nabob old crow and

less he says the answer is at once seen to be 60 × 6012 nabobs calculation is short but as rich as a nabob in error he says that the square root of 3630 multiplied by 2 equals the length plus the breadth that is 6025 × 2  12012 his first assertion is only true of a square garden his second is irrelevant since 6025 is not the squareroot of 3630 nay bob this will not do tympanum says that by extracting the squareroot of 3630 we get 60 yards with a remainder of 3060 or halfayard which we add so as to make the oblong 60 × 6012 this is very terrible but worse remains behind tympanum proceeds thusbut why should there be the halfyard at all because without it there would be no space at all for flowers by means of it we find reserved in the very centre a small plot of ground two yards long by halfayard wide the only space not occupied by walk but balbus expressly said that the walk used up the whole of the area oh tympanum my tympa is exhausted my brain is num i can say no more  hecla indulges again and again in that most fatal of all habits in computationthe making two mistakes which cancel each other she takes x as the width of the garden in yards and x  12 as its length and makes her first coil the sum of x12 x12 x1 x1 ie 4x3 but the fourth term should be x112 so that her first coil is 12 a yard too long her second coil is the sum of x212 x212 x3 x3 here the first term should be x2 and the last x312 these two mistakes cancel and this coil is therefore right and the same thing is true of every other coil but the last which needs an extra halfyard to reach the end of the path and this exactly balances the mistake in the first coil thus the sum total of the coils comes right though the working is all wrong  of the seven who are right dinah mite janet magpie and taffy make the same assumption as c g l and co they then solve by a quadratic magpie also tries it by arithmetical progression but fails to notice that the first and last coils have special values  alumnus etonÆ attempts to prove what c g l assumes by a particular instance taking a garden 6 by 512 he ought to have proved it generally what is true of one number is not always true of others old king cole solves it by an arithmetical progression it is right but too lengthy to be worth as much as a quadratic  vindex proves it very neatly by pointing out that a yard of walk measured along the middle represents a square yard of garden whether we consider the straight stretches of walk or the square yards at the angles in which the middle line goes half a yard in one direction and then turns a right angle and goes half a yard in another direction   class list  i     vindex  ii     alumnus etonÆ    old king cole  iii     dinah mite    janet    magpie    taffy   answers to knot x   § 1 the

                   nineteen answers have been received one is 5 but as no working is given with it it must in accordance with the rule remain a deed without a name janet makes it 35 and 710ths i am sorry she has misunderstood the question and has supposed that those who had lost an ear were 75 per cent of those who had lost an eye and so on of course on this supposition the percentages must all be multiplied together this she has done correctly but i can give her no honours as i do not think the question will fairly bear her interpretation three score and ten makes it 19 and 38ths her solution has given mei will not say many anxious days and sleepless nights for i wish to be strictly truthful butsome trouble in making any sense at all of it she makes the number of pensioners wounded once to be 310 per cent i suppose dividing by 4 she gets 77 and a half as average percentage again dividing by 4 she gets 19 and 38ths as percentage wounded four times does she suppose wounds of different kinds to absorb each other so to speak then no doubt the data are equivalent to 77 pensioners with one wound each and a halfpensioner with a halfwound and does she then suppose these concentrated wounds to be transferable so that 34ths of these unfortunates can obtain perfect health by handing over their wounds to the remaining 14th granting these suppositions her answer is right or rather if the question had been a road is covered with one inch of gravel along 77 and a half per cent of it how much of it could be covered 4 inches deep with the same material her answer would have been right but alas that wasnt the question delta makes some most amazing assumptions let every one who has not lost an eye have lost an ear let every one who has not lost both eyes and ears have lost an arm her ideas of a battlefield are grim indeed fancy a warrior who would continue fighting after losing both eyes both ears and both arms this is a case which she or it evidently considers possible  next come eight writers who have made the unwarrantable assumption that because 70 per cent have lost an eye therefore 30 per cent have not lost one so that they have both eyes this is illogical if you give me a bag containing 100 sovereigns and if in an hour i come to you my face not beaming with gratitude nearly so much as when i received the bag to say i am sorry to tell you that 70 of these sovereigns are bad do i thereby guarantee the other 30 to be good perhaps i have not tested them yet the sides of this illogical octagon are as follows in alphabetical orderalgernon bray

of the third when the number of years since the first occasion is twothirds of the sum of the ages on that occasion one age is 21 what are the other two  answer15 and 18                                       solutionlet the ages at first be x y x  y now if a  b  2c then an  bn  2cn whatever be the value of n hence the second relationship if ever true was always true hence it was true at first but it cannot be true that x and y are together double of x  y hence it must be true of x  y together with x or y and it does not matter which we take we assume then x  y  x  2y ie y  2x hence the three ages were at first x 2x 3x and the number of years since that time is twothirds of 6x ie is 4x hence the present ages are 5x 6x 7x the ages are clearly integers since this is only the year when one of my sons comes of age hence 7x  21 x  3 and the other ages are 15 18                                       eighteen answers have been received one of the writers merely asserts that the first occasion was 12 years ago that the ages were then 9 6 and 3 and that on the second occasion they were 14 11 and 8 as a roman father i ought to withhold the name of the rash writer but respect for age makes me break the rule it is three score and ten jane e also asserts that the ages at first were 9 6 3 then she calculates the present ages leaving the second occasion unnoticed old hen is nearly as bad she tried various numbers till i found one that fitted all the conditions but merely scratching up the earth and pecking about is not the way to solve a problem oh venerable bird and close after old hen prowls with hungry eyes old cat who calmly assumes to begin with that the son who comes of age is the eldest eat your bird puss for you will get nothing from me  there are yet two zeroes to dispose of minerva assumes that on every occasion a son comes of age and that it is only such a son who is tipped with gold is it wise thus to interpret now my boys calculate your ages and you shall have the

future travellers an thou wilt thou art no bradshaw for this age  of those who win honours the merely honourable are two dinah mite ascertains rightly the relationship between the three ages at first but then assumes one of them to be 6 thus making the rest of her solution tentative m f c does the algebra all right up to the conclusion that the present ages are 5z 6z and 7z it then assumes without giving any reason that 7z  21  of the more honourable delta attempts a noveltyto discover which son comes of age by elimination it assumes successively that it is the middle one and that it is the youngest and in each case it apparently brings out an absurdity still as the proof contains the following bit of algebra 63  7x  4y  therefore 21  x  4 sevenths of y i trust it will admit that its proof is not quite conclusive the rest of its work is good magpie betrays the deplorable tendency of her tribeto appropriate any stray conclusion she comes across without having any strict logical right to it assuming a b c as the ages at first and d as the number of the years that have elapsed since then she finds rightly the 3 equations 2a  b c  b  a d  2b she then says supposing that a  1 then b  2 c  3 and d  4 therefore for a b c d four numbers are wanted which shall be to each other as 1234 it is in the therefore that i detect the unconscientiousness of this bird the conclusion is true but this is only because the equations are homogeneous ie having one unknown in each term a fact which i strongly suspect had not been graspedi beg pardon clawedby her were i to lay this little pitfall a  1  b b  1  c supposing a  1 then b  2 and c  3 therefore for a b c three numbers are wanted which shall be to one another as 123 would you not flutter down into it oh magpie as amiably as a dove simple susan is anything but simple to me after ascertaining that the 3 ages at first are as 321 she says then as twothirds of their sum added to one of them  21 the sum cannot exceed 30 and consequently the highest cannot exceed 15 i suppose her mental argument is something like thistwothirds of sum  one age  21  therefore sum  3 halves of one age  31 and a half but 3 halves of one age cannot be less than 1 andahalf here i perceive that simple susan would on no account present a guinea to a newborn baby hence the sum cannot exceed 30 this is ingenious but her proof after that is as she candidly admits clumsy and roundabout she finds that there are 5 possible sets of ages and eliminates four of them suppose that instead of 5 there had been 5 million possible sets would simple susan have courageously ordered in the necessary gallon of ink and ream of paper  the solution sent in by c r is like that of simple susan partly tentative and so does not rise higher than being clumsily right  among those who have earned the highest honours algernon bray solves the problem quite correctly but adds that there is nothing to exclude the supposition that all the ages were fractional this would make the number of answers infinite let me meekly protest that i never intended my readers to devote the rest of their lives to writing out answers e m rix points out that if fractional ages be admissible any one of the three sons might be the one come of age but she rightly rejects this supposition on the ground that it would make the problem indeterminate white sugar is the only one who has detected an oversight of mine i had forgotten the possibility which of course ought to be allowed for that the son who came of age that year need not have done so by that day so that he might be only 20 this gives a second solution viz 20 24 28 well said pure crystal verily thy fair discourse hath been as sugar   class list  i     algernon bray    an old fogey    e m rix    g

father gives him 4 apples and he eats one of them how many has he left and says i think we are justified in answering 3 i think so too there is no must here and the data are evidently meant to fix the
