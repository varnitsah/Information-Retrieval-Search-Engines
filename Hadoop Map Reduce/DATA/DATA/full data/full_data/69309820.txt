  chapter iv     supernatural chronometry      chapter v      guilt and innocence finely blent      chapter vi     the amazing duel      chapter vii    luigi defies galen      chapter viii   baptism of the better half      chapter ix     the drinkless drunk      chapter x      so they hanged luigi      final remarks       a man who is not born with the novelwriting gift has a troublesome time of it when he tries to build a novel i know this from experience he has no clear idea of his story in fact he has no story he merely has some people in his mind and an incident or two also a locality he knows these people he knows the selected locality and he trusts that he can plunge those people into those incidents with interesting results so he goes to work to write a novel nothat is a thought which comes later in the beginning he is only proposing to tell a little tale a very little tale a sixpage tale but as it is a tale which he is not acquainted with and can only find out what it is by listening as it goes along telling itself it is more than apt to go on and on and on till it spreads itself into a book i know about this because it has happened to me so many times  and i have noticed another thing that as the short tale grows into a long tale the original intention or motif is apt to get abolished and find itself superseded by a quite different one it was so in the case of a magazine sketch which i once started to writea funny and fantastic sketch about a prince and a pauper it presently assumed a grave cast of its own accord and in that new shape spread itself out into a book much the same thing happened with puddnhead wilson i had a sufficiently hard time with that tale because it changed itself from a farce to a tragedy while i was going along with ita most embarrassing circumstance but what was a great deal worse was that it was not one story but two stories tangled together and they obstructed and interrupted each other at every turn and created no end of confusion and annoyance i could not offer the book for publication for i was afraid it would unseat the readers reason i did not know what was the matter with it for i had not noticed as yet that it was two stories in one it took me months to make that discovery i carried the manuscript back and forth across the atlantic two or three times and read it and studied over it on shipboard and at last i saw where the difficulty lay i had no further trouble i pulled one of the stories out by the roots and left the other onea kind of literary caesarean operation  would the reader care to know something about the story which i pulled out he has been told many a time how the bornandtrained novelist works wont he let me round and complete his knowledge by telling him how the jackleg does it  originally the story was called those extraordinary twins i meant to make it very short i had seen a picture of a youthful italian freak or freaks which wasor which wereon exhibition in our citiesa combination consisting of two heads and four arms joined to a single body and a single pair of legsand i thought i would write an extravagantly fantastic little story with this freak of nature for heroor heroesa silly young miss for heroine and two old ladies and two boys for the minor parts i lavishly elaborated these people and their doings of course but the tale kept spreading along and spreading along and other people got to intruding themselves and taking up more and more room with their talk and their affairs among them came a stranger named puddnhead wilson and a woman named roxana and presently the doings of these two pushed up into prominence a young fellow named tom driscoll whose proper place was away in the obscure background before the book was half finished those three were taking things almost entirely into their own hands and working the whole tale as a private venture of their owna tale which they had nothing at all to do with by rights  when the book was finished and i came to look around to see what had become of the team i had originally started out withaunt patsy cooper aunt betsy hale the two boys and rowena the lightweight heroinethey were nowhere to be seen they had disappeared from the story some time or other i hunted about and found themfound them stranded idle forgotten and permanently useless it was very awkward it was awkward all around but more particularly in the case of rowena because there was a lovematch on between her and one of the twins that constituted the freak and i had worked it up to a blistering heat and thrown in a quite dramatic lovequarrel wherein rowena scathingly denounced her betrothed for getting drunk and scoffed at his explanation of how it had happened and wouldnt listen to it and had driven him from her in the usual forever way and now here she sat crying and brokenhearted for she had found that he had spoken only the truth that it was not he but the other half of the freak that had drunk the liquor that made him drunk that her half was a prohibitionist and had never drunk a drop in his life and although tight as a brick three days in the week was wholly innocent of blame and indeed when sober was constantly doing all he could to reform his brother the other half who never got any satisfaction out of drinking anyway because liquor never affected him yes here she was stranded with that deep injustice of hers torturing her poor torn heart  i didnt know what to do with her i was as sorry for her as anybody could be but the campaign was over the book was finished she was sidetracked and there was no possible way of crowding her in anywhere i could not leave her there of course it would not do after spreading her out so and making such a todo over her affairs it would be absolutely necessary to account to the reader for her i thought and thought and studied and studied but i arrived at nothing i finally saw plainly that there was really no way but onei must simply give her the grand bounce it grieved me to do it for after associating with her so much i had come to kind of like her after a fashion notwithstanding she was such an ass and said such stupid irritating things and was so nauseatingly sentimental still it had to be done so at the top of chapter xvii i put in a calendar remark concerning july the fourth and began the chapter with this statistic  rowena went out in the back yard after supper to see the fireworks and fell down the well and got drowned  it seemed abrupt but i thought maybe the reader wouldnt notice it because i changed the subject right away to something else anyway it loosened up rowena from where she was stuck and got her out of the way and that was the main thing it seemed a prompt good way of weeding out people that had got stalled and a plenty good enough way for those others so i hunted up the two boys and said they went out back one night to stone the cat and fell down the well and got drowned next i searched around and found old aunt patsy cooper and aunt betsy hale where they were aground and said they went out back one night to visit the sick and fell down the well and got drowned i was going to drown some of the others but i gave up the idea partly because i believed that if i kept that up it would arouse attention and perhaps sympathy with those people and partly because it was not a large well and would not hold any more anyway  still the story was unsatisfactory here was a set of new characters who were become inordinately prominent and who persisted in remaining so to the end and back yonder was an older set who made a large noise and a great todo for a little while and then suddenly played out utterly and fell down the well there was a radical defect somewhere and i must search it out and cure it  the defect turned out to be the one already spoken oftwo stories in one a farce and a tragedy so i pulled out the farce and left the tragedy this left the original team in but only as mere names not as characters their prominence was wholly gone they were not even worth drowning so i removed that detail also i took those twins apart and made two separate men of them they had no occasion to have foreign names now but it was too much trouble to remove them all through so i left them christened as they were and made no explanation     chapter i the twins as they really were  the conglomerate twins were brought on the stage in chapter i of the original extravaganza aunt patsy cooper has received their letter applying for board and lodging and rowena her daughter insane with joy is begging for a hearing of it  well set down then and be quiet a minute and dont fly around so it fairly makes me tired to see you it starts off so honored madam  i like that ma dont you it shows theyre highbred  yes i noticed that when i first read it my brother and i have seen your advertisement by chance in a copy of your local journal  its so beautiful and smooth madont you think so  yes seems so to meand beg leave to take the room you offer we are twentyfour years of age and twins  twins how sweet i do hope they are handsome and i just know they are dont you hope they are ma  land i aint particular we are italians by birth  its so romantic just think theres never been one in this town and everybody will want to see them and theyre all ours think of that  but have lived long in the various countries of europe and several years in the united states  oh just think what wonders theyve seen ma wont it be good to hear them talk  i reckon so yes i reckon so our names are luigi and angelo capello  beautiful perfectly beautiful not like jones and robinson and those horrible names  you desire but one guest but dear madam if you will allow us to pay for two we will not discommode you we will sleep together in the same bed we have always been used to this and prefer it and then he goes on to say they will be down thursday  and this is tuesdayi dont know how im ever going to wait ma the time does drag along so and im so dying to see them which of them do you reckon is the tallest ma  how do you spose i can tell child mostly they are the same sizetwins are  well then which do you reckon is the best looking  goodness knowsi dont  i think angelo is its the prettiest name anyway dont you think its a sweet name ma  yes its well enough id like both of them better if i knew the way to pronounce themthe eyetalian way i mean the missouri way and the eyetalian way is different i judge  maybeyes its luigi that writes the letter what do you reckon is the reason angelo didnt write it  why how can i tell whats the difference who writes it so long as its done  oh i hope it wasnt because he is sick you dont think he is sick do you ma  sick your granny whats to make him sick  oh theres never any telling these foreigners with that kind of names are so delicate and of course that kind of names are not suited to our climateyou wouldnt expect it  and soon and soon no end the time drags along thursday comes the boat arrives in a pouring storm toward midnight  at last there was a knock at the door and the anxious family jumped to open it two negro men entered each carrying a trunk and proceeded upstairs toward the guestroom then followed a stupefying apparitiona doubleheaded human creature with four arms one body and a single pair of legs itor they as you pleasebowed with elaborate foreign formality but the coopers could not respond immediately they were paralyzed at this moment there came from the rear of the group a fervent ejaculationmy lanfollowed by a crash of crockery and the slavewench nancy stood petrified and staring with a tray of wrecked teathings at her feet the incident broke the spell and brought the family to consciousness the beautiful heads of the newcomer bowed again and one of them said with easy grace and dignity  i crave the honor madam and miss to introduce to you my brother count luigi capello the other head bowed and myselfcount angelo and at the same time offer sincere apologies for the lateness of our coming which was unavoidable and both heads bowed again  the poor old lady was in a whirl of amazement and confusion but she managed to stammer out  im sure im glad to make your acquaintance siri mean gentlemen as for the delay it is nothing dont mention it this is my daughter rowena sirgentlemen please step into the parlor and sit down and have a bite and sup you are dreadful wet and must be uncomfortableboth of you i mean  but to the old ladys relief they courteously excused themselves saying it would be wrong to keep the family out of their beds longer then each head bowed in turn and uttered a friendly good night and the singular figure moved away in the wake of rowenas small brothers who bore candles and disappeared up the stairs  the widow tottered into the parlor and sank into a chair with a gasp and rowena followed tonguetied and dazed the two sat silent in the throbbing summer heat unconscious of the millionvoiced music of the mosquitoes unconscious of the roaring gale the lashing and thrashing of the rain along the windows and the roof the white glare of the lightning the tumultuous booming and bellowing of the thunder conscious of nothing but that prodigy that uncanny apparition that had come and gone so suddenlythat weird strange thing that was so softspoken and so gentle of manner and yet had shaken them up like an earthquake with the shock of its gruesome aspect at last a cold little shudder quivered along down the widows meager frame and she said in a weak voice  ugh it was awful just the mere look of that phillipene  rowena did not answer her faculties were still caked she had not yet found her voice presently the widow said a little resentfully  always been used to sleeping togetherinfact prefer it and i was thinking it was to accommodate me i thought it was very good of them whereas a person situated as that young man is  ma you oughtnt to begin by getting up a prejudice against him im sure he is goodhearted and means well both of his faces show it  im not so certain about that the one on the lefti mean the one on its lefthasnt near as good a face in my opinion as its brother  thats luigi  yes luigi anyway its the darkskinned one the one that was west of his brother when they stood in the door up to all kinds of mischief and disobedience when he was a boy ill be bound i lay his mother had trouble to lay her hand on him when she wanted him but the one on the right is as good as gold i can see that  thats angelo  yes angelo i reckon though i cant tell tother from which by their names yet awhile but its the righthand onethe blond one he has such kind blue eyes and curly copper hair and fresh complexion  and such a noble faceoh it is a noble face ma just royal you may say and beautiful deary me how beautiful but both are that the dark ones as beautiful asa picture theres no such wonderful faces and handsome heads in this town none that even begin and such hands especially angelosso shapely and  stuff how could you tell which they belonged tothey had gloves on  why didnt i see them take off their hats  that dont signify they might have taken off each others hats nobody could tell there was just a wormy squirming of arms in the airseemed to be a couple of dozen of them all writhing at once and it just made me dizzy to see them go  why ma i hadnt any difficulty theres two arms on each shoulder  there now one arm on each shoulder belongs to each of the creatures dont it for a person to have two arms on one shoulder wouldnt do him any good would it of course not each has an arm on each shoulder now then you tell me which of them belongs to which if you can they dont know themselvesthey just work whichever arm comes handy of course they do especially if they are in a hurry and cant stop to think which belongs to which  the mother seemed to have the rights of the argument so the daughter abandoned the struggle presently the widow rose with a yawn and said  poor thing i hope it wont catch cold it was powerful wet just drenched you may say i hope it has left its boots outside so they can be dried  then she gave a little start and looked perplexed  now i remember i heard one of them ask joe to call him at half after seveni think it was the one on the leftno it was the one to the east of the other onebut i didnt hear the other one say any thing i wonder if he wants to be called too do you reckon its too late to ask  why ma its not necessary calling one is calling both if one gets up the others got to  sho of course i never thought of that well come along maybe we can get some sleep but i dont know im so shook up with what weve been through  the stranger had made an impression on the boys too they had a word of talk as they were getting to bed henry the gentle the humane said  i feel ever so sorry for it dont you joe  but joe was a boy of this world active enterprising and had a theatrical side to him  sorry why how you talk it cant stir a step without attracting attention its just grand  henry said reproachfully  instead of pitying it joe you talk as if  talk as if what i know one thing mighty certain if you can fix me so i can eat for two and only have to stub toes for one i aint going to fool away no such chance just for sentiment  the twins were wet and tired and they proceeded to undress without any preliminary remarks the abundance of sleeve made the partnership coat hard to get off for it was like skinning a tarantula but it came at last after much tugging and perspiring the mutual vest followed then the brothers stood up before the glass and each took off his own cravat and collar the collars were of the standing kind and came high up under the ears like the sides of a wheelbarrow as required by the fashion of the day the cravats were as broad as a bankbill with fringed ends which stood far out to right and left like the wings of a dragonfly and this also was strictly in accordance with the fashion of the time each cravat as to color was in perfect taste so far as its owners complexion was concerneda delicate pink in the case of the blond brother a violent scarlet in the case of the brunettebut as a combination they broke all the laws of taste known to civilization nothing more fiendish and irreconcilable than those shrieking and blaspheming colors could have been contrived the wet boots gave no end of troubleto luigi when they were off at last angelo said with bitterness  i wish you wouldnt wear such tight boots they hurt my feet  luigi answered with indifference  my friend when i am in command of our body i choose my apparel according to my own convenience as i have remarked more than several times already when you are in command i beg you will do as you please  angelo was hurt and the tears came into his eyes there was gentle reproach in his voice but not anger when he replied  luigi i often consult your wishes but you never consult mine when i am in command i treat you as a guest i try to make you feel at home when you are in command you treat me as an intruder you make me feel unwelcome it embarrasses me cruelly in company for i can see that people notice it and comment on it  oh damn the people responded the brother languidly and with the air of one who is tired of the subject  a slight shudder shook the frame of angelo but he said nothing and the conversation ceased each buttoned his own share of the nightshirt in silence then luigi with paines age of reason in his hand sat down in one chair and put his feet in another and lit his pipe while angelo took his whole duty of man and both began to read angelo presently began to cough his coughing increased and became mixed with gaspings for breath and he was finally obliged to make an appeal to his brothers humanity  luigi if you would only smoke a little milder tobacco i am sure i could learn not to mind it in time but this is so strong and the pipe is so rank that  angelo i wouldnt be such a baby i have learned to smoke in a week and the trouble is already over with me if you would try you could learn too and then you would stop spoiling my comfort with your everlasting complaints  ah brother that is a strong wordeverlastingand isnt quite fair i only complain when i suffocate you know i dont complain when we are in the open air  well anyway you could learn to smoke yourself  but my principles luigi you forget my principles you would not have me do a thing which i regard as a sin  oh bosh  the conversation ceased again for angelo was sick and discouraged and strangling but after some time he closed his book and asked luigi to sing from greenlands icy mountains with him but he would not and when he tried to sing by himself luigi did his best to drown his plaintive tenor with a rude and rollicking song delivered in a thundering bass  after the singing there was silence and neither brother was happy before blowing the light out luigi swallowed half a tumbler of whisky and angelo whose sensitive organization could not endure intoxicants of any kind took a pill to keep it from giving him the headache     chapter ii ma cooper gets all mixed up  the family sat in the breakfastroom waiting for the twins to come down the widow was quiet the daughter was alive with happy excitement she said  ah theyre a boon ma just a boon dont you think so  laws i hope so i dont know  why ma yes you do theyre so fine and handsome and highbred and polite so every way superior to our gawks here in this village why theyll make life different from what it wasso humdrum and commonplace you knowoh you may be sure theyre full of accomplishments and knowledge of the world and all that that will be an immense advantage to society here dont you think so ma  mercy on me how should i know and ive hardly set eyes on them yet after a pause she added they made considerable noise after they went up  noise why ma they were singing and it was beautiful too  oh it was well enough but too mixedup seemed to me  now ma honor bright did you ever hear greenlands icy mountains sung sweeternow did you  if it had been sung by itself it would have been uncommon sweet i dont deny it but what they wanted to mix it up with old bob ridley for i cant make out why they dont go together at all they are not of the same nature bob ridley is a common rackety slambang secular song one of the rippingest and rantingest and noisiest there is i am no judge of music and i dont claim it but in my opinion nobody can make those two songs go together right  why ma i thought  it dont make any difference what you thought it cant be done they tried it and to my mind it was a failure i never heard such a crazy uproar seemed to me sometimes the roof would come off and as for the catswell ive lived a many a year and seen cats aggravated in more ways than one but ive never seen cats take on the way they took on last night  well i dont think that that goes for anything ma because it is the nature of cats that any sound that is unusual  unusual you may well call it so now if they are going to sing duets every night i do hope they will both sing the same tune at the same time for in my opinion a duet that is made up of two different tunes is a mistake especially when the tunes aint any kin to one another that way  but ma i think it must be a foreign custom and it must be right too and the best way because they have had every opportunity to know what is right and it dont stand to reason that with their education they would do anything but what the highest musical authorities have sanctioned you cant help but admit that ma  the argument was formidably strong the old lady could not find any way around it so after thinking it over awhile she gave in with a sigh of discontent and admitted that the daughters position was probably correct being vanquished she had no mind to continue the topic at that disadvantage and was about to seek a change when a change came of itself a footstep was heard on the stairs and she said  therehes coming  they mayou ought to say theyits nearer right  the new lodger rather shoutingly dressed but looking superbly handsome stepped with courtly carnage into the trim little breakfastroom and put out all his cordial arms at once like one of those pocketknives with a multiplicity of blades and shook hands with the whole family simultaneously he was so easy and pleasant and hearty that all embarrassment presently thawed away and disappeared and a cheery feeling of friendliness and comradeship took its place heor preferably theywere asked to occupy the seat of honor at the foot of the table they consented with thanks and carved the beefsteak with one set of their hands while they distributed it at the same time with the other set  will you have coffee gentlemen or tea  coffee for luigi if you please madam tea for me  cream and sugar  for me yes madam luigi takes his coffee black our natures differ a good deal from each other and our tastes also  the first time the negro girl nancy appeared in the door and saw the two heads turned in opposite directions and both talking at once then saw the commingling arms feed potatoes into one mouth and coffee into the other at the same time she had to pause and pull herself out of a faintness that came over her but after that she held her grip and was able to wait on the table with fair courage  conversation fell naturally into the customary grooves it was a little jerky at first because none of the family could get smoothly through a sentence without a wabble in it here and a break there caused by some new surprise in the way of attitude or gesture on the part of the twins the weather suffered the most the weather was all finished up and disposed of as a subject before the simple missourians had gotten sufficiently wonted to the spectacle of one body feeding two heads to feel composed and reconciled in the presence of so bizarre a miracle and even after everybodys mind became tranquilized there was still one slight distraction left the hand that picked up a biscuit carried it to the wrong head as often as any other way and the wrong mouth devoured it this was a puzzling thing and marred the talk a little it bothered the widow to such a degree that she presently dropped out of the conversation without knowing it and fell to watching and guessing and talking to herself  now that hand is going to take that coffee tono its gone to the other mouth i cant understand it and now here is the darkcomplected hand with a potato in its fork ill see what goes with itthere the lightcomplected heads got it as sure as i live  finally rowena said  ma what is the matter with you are you dreaming about something  the old lady came to herself and blushed then she explained with the first random thing that came into her mind i saw mr angelo take up mr luigis coffee and i thought maybe heshant i give you a cup mr angelo  oh no madam i am very much obliged but i never drink coffee much as i would like to you did see me take up luigis cup it is true but if you noticed i didnt carry it to my mouth but to his  yes i thought you did did you mean to  how  the widow was a little embarrassed again she said  i dont know but what im foolish and you mustnt mind but you see he got the coffee i was expecting to see you drink and you got a potato that i thought he was going to get so i thought it might be a mistake all around and everybody getting what wasnt intended for him  both twins laughed and luigi said  dear madam there wasnt any mistake we are always helping each other that way it is a great economy for us both it saves time and labor we have a system of signs which nobody can notice or understand but ourselves if i am using both my hands and want some coffee i make the sign and angelo furnishes it to me and you saw that when he needed a potato i delivered it  how convenient  yes and often of the extremest value take the mississippi boats for instance they are always overcrowded there is tableroom for only half of the passengers therefore they have to set a second table for the second half the stewards rush both parties they give them no time to eat a satisfying meal both divisions leave the table hungry it isnt so with us angelo books himself for the one table i book myself for the other neither of us eats anything at the others table but just simply worksworks thus you see there are four hands to feed angelo and the same four to feed me each of us eats two meals  the old lady was dazed with admiration and kept saying it is perfectly wonderful perfectly wonderful and the boy joe licked his chops enviously but said nothingat least aloud  yes continued luigi our construction may have its disadvantagesin fact hasbut it also has its compensations of one sort and another take travel for instance travel is enormously expensive in all countries we have been obliged to do a vast deal of itcome angelo dont put any more sugar in your tea im just over one indigestion and dont want another right awaybeen obliged to do a deal of it as i was saying well we always travel as one person since we occupy but one seat so we save half the fare  how romantic interjected rowena with effusion  yes my dear young lady and how practical too and economical in europe beds in the hotels are not charged with the board but separatelyanother saving for we stood to our rights and paid for the one bed only the landlords often insisted that as both of us occupied the bed we ought  no they didnt said angelo they did it only twice and in both cases it was a double beda rare thing in europeand the double bed gave them some excuse be fair to the landlords twice doesnt constitute often  well that dependsthat depends i knew a man who fell down a well twice he said he didnt mind the first time but he thought the second time was once too often have i misused that word mrs cooper  to tell the truth i was afraid you had but it seems to look now like you hadnt she stopped and was evidently struggling with the difficult problem a moment then she added in the tone of one who is convinced without being converted it seems so but i cant somehow tell why  rowena thought luigis retort was wonderfully quick and bright and she remarked to herself with satisfaction that there wasnt any young native of dawsons landing that could have risen to the occasion like that luigi detected the applause in her face and expressed his pleasure and his thanks with his eyes and so eloquently withal that the girl was proud and pleased and hung out the delicate sign of it on her cheeks luigi went on with animation  both of us get a bath for one ticket theater seat for one ticket pewrent is on the same basis but at peepshows we pay double  we have much to be thankful for said angelo impressively with a reverent light in his eye and a reminiscent tone in his voice we have been greatly blessed as a rule what one of us has lacked the other by the bounty of providence has been able to supply my brother is hardy i am not he is very masculine assertive aggressive i am much less so i am subject to illness he is never ill i cannot abide medicines and cannot take them but he has no prejudice against them and  why goodness gracious interrupted the widow when you are sick does he take the medicine for you  always madam  why i never heard such a thing in my life i think its beautiful of you  oh madam its nothing dont mention it its really nothing at all  but i say its beautiful and i stick to it cried the widow with a speaking moisture in her eye  a well brother to take the medicine for his poor sick brotheri wish i had such a son and she glanced reproachfully at her boys i declare ill never rest till ive shook you by the hand and she scrambled out of her chair in a fever of generous enthusiasm and made for the twins blind with her tears and began to shake the boy joe corrected her youre shaking the wrong one ma  this flurried her but she made a swift change and went on shaking  got the wrong one again ma said the boy  oh shut up cant you said the widow embarrassed and irritated give me all your hands i want to shake them all for i know you are both just as good as you can be  it was a victorious thought a masterstroke of diplomacy though that never occurred to her and she cared nothing for diplomacy she shook the four hands in turn cordially and went back to her place in a state of high and fine exultation that made her look young and handsome  indeed i owe everything to luigi said angelo affectionately but for him i could not have survived our boyhood days when we were friendless and poorah so poor we lived from hand to mouthlived on the coarse fare of unwilling charity and for weeks and weeks together not a morsel of food passed my lips for its character revolted me and i could not eat it but for luigi i should have died he ate for us both  how noble sighed rowena  do you hear that said the widow severely to her boys let it be an example to youi mean you joe  joe gave his head a barely perceptible disparaging toss and said et for both it aint anything id a done it  hush if you havent got any better manners than that you dont see the point at all it wasnt good food  i dont careit was food and id a et it if it was rotten  shame such language cant you understand they were starvingactually starvingand he ate for both and  shucks you gimme a chance and ill  there nowclose your head and dont you open it again till youre asked       angelo goes on and tells how his parents the count and countess had      to fly from florence for political reasons and died poor in berlin      bereft of their great property by confiscation and how he and luigi      had to travel with a freakshow during two years and suffer      semistarvation  that hateful blackbread but i seldom ate anything during that time that was poor luigis affair  ill never mister him again cried the widow with strong emotion hes luigi to me from this out  thank you a thousand times madam a thousand times though in truth i dont deserve it  ah luigi is always the fortunate one when honors are showering said angelo plaintively now what have i done mrs cooper that you leave me out come you must strain a point in my favor  call you angelo why certainly i will what are you thinking of in the case of twins why  but ma youre breaking up the storydo let him go on  you keep still rowena cooper and he can go on all the better i reckon one interruption dont hurt its two that makes the trouble  but youve added one now and that is three  rowena i will not allow you to talk back at me when you have got nothing rational to say     chapter iii angelo is blue  after breakfast the whole village crowded in and there was a grand reception in honor of the twins and at the close of it the gifted freak captured everybodys admiration by sitting down at the piano and knocking out a classic fourhanded piece in great style then the judge took itor themdriving in his buggy and showed off his village  all along the streets the people crowded the windows and stared at the amazing twins troops of small boys flocked after the buggy excited and yelling at first the dogs showed no interest they thought they merely saw three men in a buggya matter of no consequence but when they found out the facts of the case they altered their opinion pretty radically and joined the boys expressing their minds as they came other dogs got interested indeed all the dogs it was a spirited sight to see them come leaping fences tearing around corners swarming out of every bystreet and alley the noise they made was something beyond beliefor praise they did not seem to be moved by malice but only by prejudice the common human prejudice against lack of conformity if the twins turned their heads they broke and fled in every direction but stopped at a safe distance and faced about and then formed and came on again as soon as the strangers showed them their back negroes and farmers wives took to the woods when the buggy came upon them suddenly and altogether the drive was pleasant and animated and a refreshment all around       it was a long and lively drive  angelo was a methodist luigi was      a freethinker  the judge was very proud of his freethinkers      society which was flourishing along in a most prosperous way and      already had two membershimself and the obscure and neglected      puddnhead wilson  it was to meet that evening and he invited      luigi to join a thing which luigi was glad to do partly because it      would please himself and partly because it would gravel angelo  they had now arrived at the widows gate and the excursion was ended the twins politely expressed their obligations for the pleasant outing which had been afforded them to which the judge bowed his thanks and then said he would now go and arrange for the freethinkers meeting and would call for count luigi in the evening  for you also dear sir he added hastily turning to angelo and bowing in addressing myself particularly to your brother i was not meaning to leave you out it was an unintentional rudeness i assure you and due wholly to accidentaccident and preoccupation i beg you to forgive me  his quick eye had seen the sensitive blood mount into angelos face betraying the wound that had been inflicted the sting of the slight had gone deep but the apology was so prompt and so evidently sincere that the hurt was almost immediately healed and a forgiving smile testified to the kindly judge that all was well again  concealed behind angelos modest and unassuming exterior and unsuspected by any but his intimates was a lofty pride a pride of almost abnormal proportions indeed and this rendered him ever the prey of slights and although they were almost always imaginary ones they hurt none the less on that account by ill fortune judge driscoll had happened to touch his sorest point ie his conviction that his brothers presence was welcomer everywhere than his own that he was often invited out of mere courtesy where only his brother was wanted and that in a majority of cases he would not be included in an invitation if he could be left out without offense a sensitive nature like this is necessarily subject to moods moods which traverse the whole gamut of feeling moods which know all the climes of emotion from the sunny heights of joy to the black abysses of despair at times in his seasons of deepest depressions angelo almost wished that he and his brother might become segregated from each other and be separate individuals like other men but of course as soon as his mind cleared and these diseased imaginings passed away he shuddered at the repulsive thought and earnestly prayed that it might visit him no more to be separate and as other men are how awkward it would seem how unendurable what would he do with his hands his arms how would his legs feel how odd and strange and grotesque every action attitude movement gesture would be to sleep by himself eat by himself walk by himselfhow lonely how unspeakably lonely no no any fate but that in every way and from every point the idea was revolting  this was of course natural to have felt otherwise would have been unnatural he had known no life but a combined one he had been familiar with it from his birth he was not able to conceive of any other as being agreeable or even bearable to him in the privacy of his secret thoughts all other men were monsters deformities and during threefourths of his life their aspect had filled him with what promised to be an unconquerable aversion but at eighteen his eye began to take note of female beauty and little by little undefined longings grew up in his heart under whose softening influences the old stubborn aversion gradually diminished and finally disappeared men were still monstrosities to him still deformities and in his sober moments he had no desire to be like them but their strange and unsocial and uncanny construction was no longer offensive to him  this had been a hard day for him physically and mentally he had been called in the morning before he had quite slept off the effects of the liquor which luigi had drunk and so for the first halfhour had had the seedy feeling and languor the brooding depression the cobwebby mouth and druggy taste that come of dissipation and are so ill a preparation for bodily or intellectual activities the long violent strain of the reception had followed and this had been followed in turn by the dreary sightseeing the judges wearying explanations and laudations of the sights and the stupefying clamor of the dogs as a congruous conclusion a fitting end his feelings had been hurt a slight had been put upon him he would have been glad to forego dinner and betake himself to rest and sleep but he held his peace and said no word for he knew his brother luigi was fresh unweary full of life spirit energy he would have scoffed at the idea of wasting valuable time on a bed or a sofa and would have refused permission     chapter iv supernatural chronometry  rowena was dining out joe and harry were belated at play there were but three chairs and four persons that noon at the home dinnertablethe twins the widow and her chum aunt betsy hale the widow soon perceived that angelos spirits were as low as luigis were high and also that he had a jaded look her motherly solicitude was aroused and she tried to get him interested in the talk and win him to a happier frame of mind but the cloud of sadness remained on his countenance luigi lent his help too he used a form and a phrase which he was always accustomed to employ in these circumstances he gave his brother an affectionate slap on the shoulder and said encouragingly  cheer up the worst is yet to come  but this did no good it never did if anything it made the matter worse as a rule because it irritated angelo this made it a favorite with luigi by and by the widow said  angelo you are tired youve overdone yourself you go right to bed after dinner and get a good nap and a rest then youll be all right  indeed i would give anything if i could do that madam  and whats to hender id like to know land the rooms yours to do what you please with the idea that you cant do what you like with your own  but you see theres one prime essentialan essential of the very first importancewhich isnt my own  what is that  my body  the old ladies looked puzzled and aunt betsy hale said  why bless your heart how is that  its my brothers  your brothers i dont quite understand i supposed it belonged to both of you  so it does but not to both at the same time  that is mighty curious i dont see how it can be i shouldnt think it could be managed that way  oh its a good enough arrangement and goes very well in fact it wouldnt do to have it otherwise i find that the teetotalers and the antiteetotalers hire the use of the same hall for their meetings both parties dont use it at the same time do they  you bet they dont said both old ladies in a breath  and moreover said aunt betsy the freethinkers and the baptist bible class use the same room over the market house but you can take my word for it they dont mush up together and use it at the same time  very well said angelo you understand it now and it stands to reason that the arrangement couldnt be improved ill prove it to you if our legs tried to obey two wills how could we ever get anywhere i would start one way luigi would start another at the same momentthe result would be a standstill wouldnt it  as sure as you are born now aint that wonderful a body would never have thought of it  we should always be arguing and fussing and disputing over the merest trifles we should lose worlds of time for we couldnt go downstairs or up couldnt go to bed couldnt rise couldnt wash couldnt dress couldnt stand up couldnt sit down couldnt even cross our legs without calling a meeting first and explaining the case and passing resolutions and getting consent it wouldnt ever donow would it  do why it would wear a person out in a week did you ever hear anything like it patsy cooper  oh youll find theres more than one thing about them that aint commonplace said the widow with the complacent air of a person with a property right in a novelty that is under admiring scrutiny  well now how ever do you manage it i dont mind saying im suffering to know  he who made us said angelo reverently and with us this difficulty also provided a way out of it by a mysterious law of our being each of us has utter and indisputable command of our body a week at a time turn and turn about  well i never now aint that beautiful  yes it is beautiful and infinitely wise and just the week ends every saturday at midnight to the minute to the second to the last shade of a fraction of a second infallibly unerringly and in that instant the one brothers power over the body vanishes and the other brother takes possession asleep or awake  how marvelous are his ways and past finding out  luigi said so exactly to the instant does the change come that during our stay in many of the great cities of the world the public clocks were regulated by it and as hundreds of thousands of private clocks and watches were set and corrected in accordance with the public clocks we really furnished the standard time for the entire city  dont tell me that he dont do miracles any more blowing down the walls of jericho with rams horns want as difficult in my opinion  and that is not all said angelo a thing that is even more marvelous perhaps is the fact that the change takes note of longitude and fits itself to the meridian we are on luigi is in command this week now if on saturday night at a moment before midnight we could fly in an instant to a point fifteen degrees west of here he would hold possession of the power another hour for the change observes local time and no other  betsy hale was deeply impressed and said with solemnity  patsy cooper for detail it lays over the passage of the red sea  now i shouldnt go as far as that said aunt patsy but if youve a mind to say sodom and gomorrah i am with you betsy hale  i am agreeable then though i do think i was right and i believe parson maltby would say the same well now theres another thing suppose one of you wants to borrow the legs a minute from the one thats got them could he let him  yes but we hardly ever do that there were disagreeable results several times and so we very seldom ask or grant the privilege nowadays and we never even think of such a thing unless the case is extremely urgent besides a weeks possession at a time seems so little that we cant bear to spare a minute of it people who have the use of their legs all the time never think of what a blessing it is of course it never occurs to them its just their natural ordinary condition and so it does not excite them at all but when i wake up on sunday morning and its my week and i feel the power all through me oh such a wave of exultation and thanksgiving goes surging over me and i want to shout i can walk i can walk madam do you ever at your uprising want to shout i can walk i can walk  no you poor unfortunate cretur but ill never get out of my bed again without doing it laws to think ive had this unspeakable blessing all my long life and never had the grace to thank the good lord that gave it to me  tears stood in the eyes of both the old ladies and the widow said softly  betsy hale we have learned something you and me  the conversation now drifted wide but by and by floated back once more to that admired detail the rigid and beautiful impartiality with which the possession of power had been distributed between the twins aunt betsy saw in it a far finer justice than human law exhibits in related cases she said  in my opinion it aint right now and never has been right the way a twin born a quarter of a minute sooner than the other one gets all the land and grandeurs and nobilities in the old countries and his brother has to go bare and be a nobody which of you was born first  angelos head was resting against luigis weariness had overcome him and for the past five minutes he had been peacefully sleeping the old ladies had dropped their voices to a lulling drone to help him to steal the rest his brother wouldnt take him upstairs to get luigi listened a moment to angelos regular breathing then said in a voice barely audible  we were both born at the same time but i am six months older than he is  for the lands sake  sh dont wake him up he wouldnt like my telling this it has always been kept secret till now  but how in the world can it be if you were both born at the same time how can one of you be older than the other  it is very simple and i assure you it is true i was born with a full crop of hair he was as bald as an egg for six months i could walk six months before he could make a step i finished teething six months ahead of him i began to take solids six months before he left the breast i began to talk six months before he could say a word last and absolutely unassailable proof the sutures in my skull closed six months ahead of his always just that six months difference to a day was that accident nobody is going to claim that im sure it was ordainedit was lawit had its meaning and we know what that meaning was now what does this overwhelming body of evidence establish it establishes just one thing and that thing it establishes beyond any peradventure whatever friends we would not have it known for the world and i must beg you to keep it strictly to yourselves but the truth is we are no more twins than you are  the two old ladies were stunned paralyzedpetrified one may almost sayand could only sit and gaze vacantly at each other for some moments then aunt betsy hale said impressively  theres no getting around proof like that i do believe its the most amazing thing i ever heard of she sat silent a moment or two and breathing hard with excitement then she looked up and surveyed the strangers steadfastly a little while and added well it does beat me but i would have took you for twins anywhere  so would i so would i said aunt patsy with the emphasis of a certainty that is not impaired by any shade of doubt  anybody wouldanybody in the world i dont care who he is said aunt betsy with decision  you wont tell said luigi appealingly  oh dear no answered both ladies promptly you can trust us dont you be afraid  that is good of you and kind never let on treat us always as if we were twins  you can depend on us said aunt betsy but it wont be easy because now that i know you aint you dont seem so  luigi muttered to himself with satisfaction that swindle has gone through without change of cars  it was not very kind of him to load the poor things up with a secret like that which would be always flying to their tongues ends every time they heard any one speak of the strangers as twins and would become harder and harder to hang on to with every recurrence of the temptation to tell it while the torture of retaining it would increase with every new strain that was applied but he never thought of that and probably would not have worried much about it if he had  a visitor was announcedsome one to see the twins they withdrew to the parlor and the two old ladies began to discuss with interest the strange things which they had been listening to when they had finished the matter to their satisfaction and aunt betsy rose to go she stopped to ask a question  how does things come on between roweny and tom driscoll  well about the same he writes tolerable often and she answers tolerable seldom  where is he  in st louis i believe though hes such a gadabout that a body cant be very certain of him i reckon  dont roweny know  oh yes like enough i havent asked her lately  do you know how him and the judge are getting along now  first rate i believe mrs pratt says so and being right in the house and sister to the one and aunt to tother of course she ought to know she says the judge is real fond of him when hes away but frets when hes around and is vexed with his ways and not sorry to have him go again he has been gone three weeks this timea pleasant thing for both of them i reckon  toms rather harumscarum but there aint anything bad in him i guess  oh no hes just young thats all still twentythree is old in one way a young man ought to be earning his living by that time if tom were doing that or was even trying to do it the judge would be a heap better satisfied with him toms always going to begin but somehow he cant seem to find just the opening he likes  well now its partly the judges own fault promising the boy his property wasnt the way to set him to earning a fortune of his own but what do you thinkis roweny beginning to lean any toward him or aint she  aunt patsy had a secret in her bosom she wanted to keep it there but nature was too strong for her she drew aunt betsy aside and said in her most confidential and mysterious manner  dont you breathe a syllable to a soulim going to tell you something in my opinion tom driscolls chances were considerable better yesterday than they are today  patsy cooper what do you mean  its so as sure as youre born i wish you could a been at breakfast and seen for yourself  you dont mean it  well if im any judge theres a leaningtheres a leaning sure  my land which one of em is it  i cant say for certain but i think its the youngest oneanjy  then there were handshakings and congratulations and hopes and so on and the old ladies parted perfectly happythe one in knowing something which the rest of the town didnt and the other in having been the sole person able to furnish that knowledge  the visitor who had called to see the twins was the rev mr hotchkiss pastor of the baptist church at the reception angelo had told him he had lately experienced a change in his religious views and was now desirous of becoming a baptist and would immediately join mr hotchkisss church there was no time to say more and the brief talk ended at that point the minister was much gratified and had dropped in for a moment now to invite the twins to attend his bible class at eight that evening angelo accepted and was expecting luigi to decline but he did not because he knew that the bible class and the freethinkers met in the same room and he wanted to treat his brother to the embarrassment of being caught in freethinking company     chapter v guilt and innocence finely blent  a long and vigorous quarrel follows between the twins and there is plenty to quarrel about for angelo was always seeking truth and this obliged him to change and improve his religion with frequency which wearied luigi and annoyed him too for he had to be present at each new enlistmentwhich placed him in the false position of seeming to indorse and approve his brothers fickleness moreover he had to go to angelos prohibition meetings and he hated them on the other hand when it was his week to command the legs he gave angelo just cause of complaint for he took him to circuses and horseraces and fandangoes exposing him to all sorts of censure and criticism and he drank too and whatever he drank went to angelos head instead of his own and made him act disgracefully when the evening was come the two attended the freethinkers meeting where angelo was sad and silent then came the bible class and looked upon him coldly finding him in such company then they went to wilsons house and chapter xi of puddnhead wilson follows which tells of the girl seen in tom driscolls room and closes with the kicking of tom by luigi at the antitemperance massmeeting of the sons of liberty with the addition of some account of roxys adventures as a chambermaid on a mississippi boat her exchange of the children had been flippantly and farcically described in an earlier chapter  next morning all the town was abuzz with great news puddnhead wilson had a law case the public astonishment was so great and the public curiosity so intense that when the justice of the peace opened his court the place was packed with people and even the windows were full everybody was flushed and perspiring the summer heat was almost unendurable  tom driscoll had brought a charge of assault and battery against the twins robert allen was retained by driscoll david wilson by the defense tom his native cheerfulness unannihilated by his backbreaking and bonebruising passage across the massed heads of the sons of liberty the previous night laughed his little customary laugh and said to wilson  ive kept my promise you see im throwing my business your way sooner than i was expecting too  its very good of youparticularly if you mean to keep it up  well i cant tell about that yet but well see if i find you deserve it ill take you under my protection and make your fame and fortune for you  ill try to deserve it tom  a jury was sworn in then mr allen said  we will detain your honor but a moment with this case it is not one where any doubt of the fact of the assault can enter in these gentlementhe accusedkicked my client at the market hall last night they kicked him with violence with extraordinary violence with even unprecedented violence i may say insomuch that he was lifted entirely off his feet and discharged into the midst of the audience we can prove this by four hundred witnesseswe shall call but three mr harkness will take the stand  mr harkness being sworn testified that he was chairman upon the occasion mentioned that he was close at hand and saw the defendants in this action kick the plaintiff into the air and saw him descend among the audience  take the witness said allen  mr harkness said wilson you say you saw these gentlemen my clients kick the plaintiff are you sureand please remember that you are on oathare you perfectly sure that you saw both of them kick him or only one now be careful  a bewildered look began to spread itself over the witnesss face he hesitated stammered but got out nothing his eyes wandered to the twins and fixed themselves there with a vacant gaze  please answer mr harkness you are keeping the court waiting it is a very simple question  counsel for the prosecution broke in with impatience  your honor the question is an irrelevant triviality necessarily they both kicked him for they have but the one pair of legs and both are responsible for them  wilson said sarcastically  will your honor permit this new witness to be sworn he seems to possess knowledge which can be of the utmost value just at this momentknowledge which would at once dispose of what every one must see is a very difficult question in this case brother allen will you take the stand  go on with your case said allen petulantly the audience laughed and got a warning from the court  now mr harkness said wilson insinuatingly we shall have to insist upon an answer to that question  ierwell of course i do not absolutely know but in my opinion  never mind your opinion siranswer the question  iwhy i cant answer it  that will do mr harkness stand down  the audience tittered and the discomfited witness retired in a state of great embarrassment  mr wakeman took the stand and swore that he saw the twins kick the plaintiff off the platform  the defense took the witness  mr wakeman you have sworn that you saw these gentlemen kick the plaintiff do i understand you to swear that you saw them both do it  yes sirwith decision  how do you know that both did it  because i saw them do it  the audience laughed and got another warning from the court  but by what means do you know that both and not one did it  well in the first place the insult was given to both of them equally for they were called a pair of scissors of course they would both want to resent it and so  wait you are theorizing now stick to factscounsel will attend to the arguments go on  well they both went over therethat i saw  very good go on  and they both kicked himi swear to it  mr wakeman was count luigi here willing to join the sons of liberty last night  yes sir he was he did join too and drank a glass or two of whisky like a man  was his brother willing to join  no sir he wasnt he is a teetotaler and was elected through a mistake  was he given a glass of whisky  yes sir but of course that was another mistake and not intentional he wouldnt drink it he set it down a slight pause then he added casually and quite simply the plaintiff reached for it and hogged it  there was a fine outburst of laughter but as the justice was caught out himself his reprimand was not very vigorous  mr allen jumped up and exclaimed i protest against these foolish irrelevancies what have they to do with the case  wilson said calm yourself brother it was only an experiment now mr wakeman if one of these gentlemen chooses to join an association and the other doesnt and if one of them enjoys whisky and the other doesnt but sets it aside and leaves it unprotected titter from the audience it seems to show that they have independent minds and tastes and preferences and that one of them is able to approve of a thing at the very moment that the other is heartily disapproving of it doesnt it seem so to you  certainly it does its perfectly plain  now then it might bei only say it might bethat one of these brothers wanted to kick the plaintiff last night and that the other didnt want that humiliating punishment inflicted upon him in that public way and before all those people isnt that possible  of course it is its more than possible i dont believe the blond one would kick anybody it was the other one that  silence shouted the plaintiffs counsel and went on with an angry sentence which was lost in the wave of laughter that swept the house  that will do mr wakeman said wilson you may stand down  the third witness was called he had seen the twins kick the plaintiff mr wilson took the witness  mr rogers you say you saw these accused gentlemen kick the plaintiff  yes sir  both of them  yes sir  which of them kicked him first  whytheythey both kicked him at the same time  are you perfectly sure of that  yes sir  what makes you sure of it  why i stood right behind them and saw them do it  how many kicks were delivered  only one  if two men kick the result should be two kicks shouldnt it  whywhy yes as a rule  then what do you think went with the other kick  iwellthe fact is i wasnt thinking of two being necessary this time  what do you think now  well iim sure i dont quite know what to think but i reckon that one of them did half of the kick and the other one did the other half  somebody in the crowd sung out its the first sane thing that any of them has said  the audience applauded the judge said silence or i will clear the court  mr allen looked pleased but wilson did not seem disturbed he said  mr rogers you have favored us with what you think and what you reckon but as thinking and reckoning are not evidence i will now give you a chance to come out with something positive one way or the other and shall require you to produce it i will ask the accused to stand up and repeat the phenomenal kick of last night the twins stood up now mr rogers please stand behind them  a voice no stand in front laughter silenced by the court another voice no give tommy another highst laughter sharply rebuked by the court  now then mr rogers two kicks shall be delivered one after the other and i give you my word that at least one of the two shall be delivered by one of the twins alone without the slightest assistance from his brother watch sharply for you have got to render a decision without any ifs and ands it rogers bent himself behind the twins with his palms just above his knees in the modern attitude of the catcher at a baseball match and riveted his eyes on the pair of legs in front of him  are you ready mr rogers  ready sir  the kick was launched  have you got that one classified mr rogers  let me study a minute sir  take as much time as you please let me know when you are ready  for as much as a minute rogers pondered with all eyes and a breathless interest fastened upon him then he gave the word ready sir  kick  the kick that followed was an exact duplicate of the first one  now then mr rogers one of those kicks was an individual kick not a mutual one you will now state positively which was the mutual one  the witness said with a crestfallen look  ive got to give it up there aint any man in the world that could tell tother from which sir  do you still assert that last nights kick was a mutual kick  indeed i dont sir  that will do mr rogers if my brother allen desires to address the court your honor very well but as far as i am concerned i am ready to let the case be at once delivered into the hands of this intelligent jury without comment  mr justice robinson had been in office only two months and in that short time had not had many cases to try of course he had no knowledge of laws and courts except what he had picked up since he came into office he was a sore trouble to the lawyers for his rulings were pretty eccentric sometimes and he stood by them with roman simplicity and fortitude but the people were well satisfied with him for they saw that his intentions were always right that he was entirely impartial and that he usually made up in good sense what he lacked in technique so to speak he now perceived that there was likely to be a miscarriage of justice here and he rose to the occasion  wait a moment gentlemen he said it is plain that an assault has been committed it is plain to anybody but the way things are going the guilty will certainly escape conviction i can not allow this now  but your honor said wilson interrupting him earnestly but respectfully you are deciding the case yourself whereas the jury  never mind the jury mr wilson the jury will have a chance when there is a reasonable doubt for them to take hold ofwhich there isnt so far there is no doubt whatever that an assault has been committed the attempt to show that both of the accused committed it has failed are they both to escape justice on that account not in this court if i can prevent it it appears to have been a mistake to bring the charge against them as a corporation each should have been charged in his capacity as an individual and  but your honor said wilson in fairness to my clients i must insist that inasmuch as the prosecution did not separate the  no wrong will be done your clients sirthey will be protected also the public and the offended laws mr allen you will amend your pleadings and put one of the accused on trial at a time  wilson broke in but your honor this is wholly unprecedented to imperil an accused person by arbitrarily altering and widening the charge against him in order to compass his conviction when the charge as originally brought promises to fail to convict is a thing unheard of before  unheard of where  in the courts of this or any other state  the judge said with dignity i am not acquainted with the customs of other courts and am not concerned to know what they are i am responsible for this court and i cannot conscientiously allow my judgment to be warped and my judicial liberty hampered by trying to conform to the caprices of other courts be they  but your honor the oldest and highest courts in europe  this court is not run on the european plan mr wilson it is not run on any plan but its own it has a plan of its own and that plan is to find justice for both state and accused no matter what happens to be practice and custom in europe or anywhere else great applause silence it has not been the custom of this court to imitate other courts it has not been the custom of this court to take shelter behind the decisions of other courts and we will not begin now we will do the best we can by the light that god has given us and while this court continues to have his approval it will remain indifferent to what other organizations may think of it applause gentlemen i must have orderquiet yourselves mr allen you will now proceed against the prisoners one at a time go on with the case  allen was not at his ease however after whispering a moment with his client and with one or two other people he rose and said  your honor i find it to be reported and believed that the accused are able to act independently in many ways but that this independence does not extend to their legs authority over their legs being vested exclusively in the one brother during a specific term of days and then passing to the other brother for a like term and so on by regular alternation i could call witnesses who would prove that the accused had revealed to them the existence of this extraordinary fact and had also made known which of them was in possession of the legs yesterdayand this would of course indicate where the guilt of the assault belongsbut as this would be mere hearsay evidence these revelations not having been made under oath  never mind about that mr allen it may not all be hearsay we shall see it may at least help to put us on the right track call the witnesses  then i will call mr john buckstone who is now present and i beg that mrs patsy cooper may be sent for take the stand mr buckstone  buckstone took the oath and then testified that on the previous evening the count angelo capello had protested against going to the hall and had called all present to witness that he was going by compulsion and would not go if he could help himself also that the count luigi had replied sharply that he would go just the same and that he count luigi would see to that himself also that upon count angelos complaining about being kept on his legs so long count luigi retorted with apparent surprise your legsi like your impudence  now we are getting at the kernel of the thing observed the judge with grave and earnest satisfaction it looks as if the count luigi was in possession of the battery at the time of the assault  nothing further was elicited from mr buckstone on direct examination mr wilson took the witness  mr buckstone about what time was it that that conversation took place  toward nine yesterday evening sir  did you then proceed directly to the hall  yes sir  how long did it take you to go there  well we walked and as it was from the extreme edge of the town and there was no hurry i judge it took us about twenty minutes maybe a trifle more  about what hour was the kick delivered  about thirteen minutes and a half to ten  admirable you are a pattern witness mr buckstone how did you happen to look at your watch at that particular moment  i always do it when i see an assault its likely i shall be called as a witness and its a good point to have  it would be well if others were as thoughtful was anything said between the conversation at my house and the assault upon the detail which we are now examining into  no sir  if power over the mutual legs was in the possession of one brother at nine and passed into the possession of the other one during the next thirty or forty minutes do you think you could have detected the change  by no means  that is all mr buckstone  mrs patsy cooper was called the crowd made way for her and she came smiling and bowing through the narrow human lane with betsy hale as escort and support smiling and bowing in her wake the audience breaking into welcoming cheers as the old favorites filed along the judge did not check this kindly demonstration of homage and affection but let it run its course unrebuked  the old ladies stopped and shook hands with the twins with effusion then gave the judge a friendly nod and bustled into the seats provided for them they immediately began to deliver a volley of eager questions at the friends around them what is this thing for what is that thing for who is that young man thats writing at the desk why i declare its jack bunce i thought he was sick which is the jury why is that the jury billy price and job turner and jack lounsbury andwell i never now who would ever a thought  but they were gently called to order at this point and asked not to talk in court their tongues fell silent but the radiant interest in their faces remained and their gratitude for the blessing of a new sensation and a novel experience still beamed undimmed from their eyes aunt patsy stood up and took the oath and mr allen explained the point in issue and asked her to go on now in her own way and throw as much light upon it as she could she toyed with her reticule a moment or two as if considering where to begin then she said  well the way of it is this they are luigis legs a week at a time and then they are angelos and he can do whatever he wants to with them  you are making a mistake aunt patsy cooper said the judge you shouldnt state that as a fact because you dont know it to be a fact  whats the reason i dont said aunt patsy bridling a little  what is the reason that you do know it  the best in the world because they told me  that isnt a reason  well for the lands sake betsy hale do you hear that  hear it i should think so said aunt betsy rising and facing the court why judge i was there and heard it myself luigi says to angelono it was angelo said it to  come come mrs hale pray sit down and  certainly its all right im going to sit down presently but not until ive  but you must sit down  must well upon my word if things aint getting to a pretty pass when  the house broke into laughter but was promptly brought to order and meantime mr allen persuaded the old lady to take her seat aunt patsy continued  yes they told me that and i know its true theyre luigis legs this week but  ah they told you that did they said the justice with interest  well no i dont know that they told me but thats neither here nor there i know without that that at dinner yesterday angelo was as tired as a dog and yet luigi wouldnt lend him the legs to go upstairs and take a nap with  did he ask for them  let me seeit seems to me somehow thatthataunt betsy do you remember whether he  never mind about what aunt betsy remembersshe is not a witness we only want to know what you remember yourself said the judge  well it does seem to me that you are most cantankerously particular about a little thing sim robinson why when i cant remember a thing myself i always  ah please go on  now how can she when you keep fussing at her all the time said aunt betsy why with a person pecking at me that way i should get that fuzzled and fuddled that  she was on her feet again but allen coaxed her into her seat once more while the court squelched the mirth of the house then the judge said  madam do you knowdo you absolutely know independently of anything these gentlemen have told youthat the power over their legs passes from the one to the other regularly every week  regularly bless your heart regularly aint any name for the exactness of it all the big cities in europe used to set the clocks by it laughter suppressed by the court  how do you know that is the question please answer it plainly and squarely  dont you talk to me like that sim robinsoni wont have it how do i know indeed how do you know what you know because somebody told you you didnt invent it out of your own head did you why these twins are the truthfulest people in the world and i dont think it becomes you to sit up there and throw slurs at them when they havent been doing anything to you and they are orphans besidesboth of them all  but aunt betsy was up again now and both old ladies were talking at once and with all their might but as the house was weltering in a storm of laughter and the judge was hammering his desk with an iron paperweight one could only see them talk not hear them at last when quiet was restored the court said  let the ladies retire  but your honor i have the right in the interest of my clientsto crossexam  youll not need to exercise it mr wilsonthe evidence is thrown out  thrown out said aunt patsy ruffled and whats it thrown out for id like to know  and so would i patsy cooper it seems to me that if we can save these poor persecuted strangers it is our bounden duty to stand up here and talk for them till  there there there do sit down  it cost some trouble and a good deal of coaxing but they were got into their seats at last the trial was soon ended now the twins themselves became witnesses in their own defense they established the fact upon oath that the legpower passed from one to the other every saturday night at twelve oclock sharp but on crossexamination their counsel would not allow them to tell whose week of power the current week was the judge insisted upon their answering and proposed to compel them but even the prosecution took fright and came to the rescue then and helped stay the sturdy jurists revolutionary hand so the case had to go to the jury with that important point hanging in the air they were out an hour and brought in this verdict  we the jury do find 1 that an assault was committed as charged 2 that it was committed by one of the persons accused he having been seen to do it by several credible witnesses 3 but that his identity is so merged in his brothers that we have not been able to tell which was him we cannot convict both for only one is guilty we cannot acquit both for only one is innocent our verdict is that justice has been defeated by the dispensation of god and ask to be discharged from further duty  this was read aloud in court and brought out a burst of hearty applause the old ladies made a spring at the twins to shake and congratulate but were gently disengaged by mr wilson and softly crowded back into their places  the judge rose in his little tribune laid aside his silverbowed spectacles roached his gray hair up with his fingers and said with dignity and solemnity and even with a certain pathos  in all my experience on the bench i have not seen justice bow her head in shame in this court until this day you little realize what farreaching harm has just been wrought here under the fickle forms of law imitation is the bane of courtsi thank god that this one is free from the contamination of that viceand in no long time you will see the fatal work of this hour seized upon by profligate socalled guardians of justice in all the wide circumstance of this planet and perpetuated in their pernicious decisions i wash my hands of this iniquity i would have compelled these culprits to expose their guilt but support failed me where i had most right to expect aid and encouragement and i was confronted by a law made in the interest of crime which protects the criminal from testifying against himself yet i had precedents of my own whereby i had set aside that law on two different occasions and thus succeeded in convicting criminals to whose crimes there were no witnesses but themselves what have you accomplished this day do you realize it you have set adrift unadmonished in this community two men endowed with an awful and mysterious gift a hidden and grisly power for evila power by which each in his turn may commit crime after crime of the most heinous character and no man be able to tell which is the guilty or which the innocent party in any case of them all look to your homeslook to your propertylook to your livesfor you have need  prisoners at the bar stand up through suppression of evidence a jury of yourourcountrymen have been obliged to deliver a verdict concerning your case which stinks to heaven with the rankness of its injustice by its terms you the guilty one go free with the innocent depart in peace and come no more the costs devolve upon the outraged plaintiffanother iniquity the court stands dissolved  almost everybody crowded forward to overwhelm the twins and their counsel with congratulations but presently the two old aunties dug the duplicates out and bore them away in triumph through the hurrahing crowd while lots of new friends carried puddnhead wilson off tavernward to feast him and wet down his great and victorious entry into the legal arena to wilson so long familiar with neglect and depreciation this strange new incense of popularity and admiration was as a fragrance blown from the fields of paradise a happy man was wilson     chapter vi the amazing duel       a deputation came in the evening and conferred upon wilson the      welcome honor of a nomination for mayor for the village has just      been converted into a city by charter  tom skulks out of      challenging the twins  judge driscoll thereupon challenges angelo      accused by tom of doing the kicking he declines but luigi      accepts in his place against angelos timid protest  it was late saturday night nearing eleven  the judge and his second found the rest of the war party at the further end of the vacant ground near the haunted house puddnhead wilson advanced to meet them and said anxiously  i must say a word in behalf of my principals proxy count luigi to whom you have kindly granted the privilege of fighting my principals battle for him it is growing late and count luigi is in great trouble lest midnight shall strike before the finish  it is another testimony said howard approvingly that young man is fine all through he wishes to save his brother the sorrow of fighting on the sabbath and he is right it is the right and manly feeling and does him credit we will make all possible haste  wilson said there is also another reasona consideration in fact which deeply concerns count luigi himself these twins have command of their mutual legs turn about count luigi is in command now but at midnight possession will pass to my principal count angelo andwell you can foresee what will happen he will march straight off the field and carry luigi with him  why sure enough cried the judge we have heard something about that extraordinary law of their being alreadynothing very definite it is true as regards dates and durations of power but i see it is definite enough as regards tonight of course we must give luigi every chance omit all the ceremonial possible gentlemen and place us in position  the seconds at once tossed up a coin howard won the choice he placed the judge sixty feet from the haunted house and facing it wilson placed the twins within fifteen feet of the house and facing the judgenecessarily the pistolcase was opened and the long slim tubes taken out when the moonlight glinted from them a shiver went through angelo the doctor was a fool but a thoroughly wellmeaning one with a kind heart and a sincere disposition to oblige but along with it an absence of tact which often hurt its effectiveness he brought his box of lint and bandages and asked angelo to feel and see how soft and comfortable they were angelos head fell over against luigis in a faint and precious time was lost in bringing him to which provoked luigi into expressing his mind to the doctor with a good deal of vigor and frankness after angelo came to he was still so weak that luigi was obliged to drink a stiff horn of brandy to brace him up  the seconds now stepped at once to their posts halfway between the combatants one of them on each side of the line of fire wilson was to count very deliberately onetwothreefirestop and the duelists could bang away at any time they chose during that recitation but not after the last word angelo grew very nervous when he saw wilsons hand rising slowly into the air as a sign to make ready and he leaned his head against luigis and said  oh please take me away from here i cant stay i know i cant  what in the world are you doing straighten up whats the matter with youyoure in no dangernobodys going to shoot at you straighten up i tell you  angelo obeyed just in time to hear  one  bang just one report and a little tuft of white hair floated slowly to the judges feet in the moonlight the judge did not swerve he still stood erect and motionless like a statue with his pistolarm hanging straight down at his side he was reserving his fire  two  three  fire  up came the pistolarm instantlyangelo dodged with the report he said ouch and fainted again  the doctor examined and bandaged the wound  it was of no consequence he saidbullet through fleshy part of armno bones brokenthe gentleman was still able to fight let the duel proceed  next time angelo jumped just as luigi fired which disordered his aim and caused him to cut a chip off of howards ear the judge took his time again and when he fired angelo jumped and got a knuckle skinned the doctor inspected and dressed the wounds angelo now spoke out and said he was content with the satisfaction he had got and if the judgebut luigi shut him roughly up and asked him not to make an ass of himself adding  and i want you to stop dodging you take a great deal too prominent a part in this thing for a person who has got nothing to do with it you should remember that you are here only by courtesy and are without official recognition officially you are not here at all officially you do not even exist to all intents and purposes you are absent from this place and you ought for your own modestys sake to reflect that it cannot become a person who is not present here to be taking this sort of public and indecent prominence in a matter in which he is not in the slightest degree concerned now dont dodge again the bullets are not for you they are for me if i want them dodged i will attend to it myself i never saw a person act so  angelo saw the reasonableness of what his brother had said and he did try to reform but it was of no use both pistols went off at the same instant and he jumped once more he got a sharp scrape along his cheek from the judges bullet and so deflected luigis aim that his ball went wide and chipped a flake of skin from puddnhead wilsons chin the doctor attended to the wounded  by the terms the duel was over but luigi was entirely out of patience and begged for one more exchange of shots insisting that he had had no fair chance on account of his brothers indelicate behavior howard was opposed to granting so unusual a privilege but the judge took luigis part and added that indeed he himself might fairly be considered entitled to another trial because although the proxy on the other side was in no way to blame for his the judges humiliatingly resultless work the gentleman with whom he was fighting this duel was to blame for it since if he had played no advantages and had held his head still his proxy would have been disposed of early he added  count luigis request for another exchange is another proof that he is a brave and chivalrous gentleman and i beg that the courtesy he asks may be accorded him  i thank you most sincerely for this generosity judge driscoll said luigi with a polite bow and moving to his place then he addedto angelo now hold your grip hold your grip i tell you and ill land him sure  the men stood erect their pistolarms at their sides the two seconds stood at their official posts the doctor stood five paces in wilsons rear with his instruments and bandages in his hands the deep stillness the peaceful moonlight the motionless figures made an impressive picture and the impending fatal possibilities augmented this impressiveness to solemnity wilsons hand began to riseslowlyslowlyhigherstill higherstill higherin another moment  boom the first stroke of midnight swung up out of the distance angelo was off like a deer  oh you unspeakable traitor wailed his brother as they went soaring over the fence  the others stood astonished and gazing and so stood watching that strange spectacle until distance dissolved it and swept it from their view then they rubbed their eyes like people waking out of a dream  well ive never seen anything like that before said the judge wilson i am going to confess now that i wasnt quite able to believe in that leg business and had a suspicion that it was a putup convenience between those twins and when count angelo fainted i thought i saw the whole schemethought it was pretext no 1 and would be followed by others till twelve oclock should arrive and luigi would get off with all the credit of seeming to want to fight and yet not have to fight after all but i was mistaken his pluck proved it hes a brave fellow and did want to fight  there isnt any doubt about that said howard and added in a grieved tone but what an unworthy sort of christian that angelo isi hope and believe there are not many like him it is not right to engage in a duel on the sabbathi could not approve of that myself but to finish one that has been begunthat is a duty let the day be what it may  they strolled along still wondering still talking  it is a curious circumstance remarked the surgeon halting wilson a moment to paste some more courtplaster on his chin which had gone to leaking blood again that in this duel neither of the parties who handled the pistols lost blood while nearly all the persons present in the mere capacity of guests got hit i have not heard of such a thing before dont you think it unusual  yes said the judge it has struck me as peculiar peculiar and unfortunate i was annoyed at it all the time in the case of angelo it made no great difference because he was in a measure concerned though not officially but it troubled me to see the seconds compromised and yet i knew no way to mend the matter  there was no way to mend it said howard whose ear was being readjusted now by the doctor the code fixes our place and it would not have been lawful to change it if we could have stood at your side or behind you or in front of you itbut it would not have been legitimate and the other parties would have had a just right to complain of our trying to protect ourselves from danger infractions of the code are certainly not permissible in any case whatever  wilson offered no remarks it seemed to him that there was very little place here for so much solemnity but he judged that if a duel where nobody was in danger or got crippled but the seconds and the outsiders had nothing ridiculous about it for these gentlemen his pointing out that feature would probably not help them to see it  he invited them in to take a nightcap and howard and the judge accepted but the doctor said he would have to go and see how angelos principal wound was getting on       it was now sunday and in the afternoon angelo was to be received      into the baptist communion by immersiona doubtful prospect the      doctor feared      chapter vii luigi defies galen  when the doctor arrived at aunt patsy coopers house he found the lights going and everybody up and dressed and in a great state of solicitude and excitement the twins were stretched on a sofa in the sittingroom aunt patsy was fussing at angelos arm nancy was flying around under her commands the two young boys were trying to keep out of the way and always getting in it in order to see and wonder rowena stood apart helpless with apprehension and emotion and luigi was growling in unappeasable fury over angelos shameful flight  as has been reported before the doctor was a foola kindhearted and wellmeaning one but with no tact and as he was by long odds the most learned physician in the town and was quite well aware of it and could talk his learning with ease and precision and liked to show off when he had an audience he was sometimes tempted into revealing more of a case than was good for the patient  he examined angelos wound and was really minded to say nothing for once but aunt patsy was so anxious and so pressing that he allowed his caution to be overcome and proceeded to empty himself as follows with scientific relish  without going too much into detail madamfor you would probably not understand it anywayi concede that great care is going to be necessary here otherwise exudation of the esophagus is nearly sure to ensue and this will be followed by ossification and extradition of the maxillaris superioris which must decompose the granular surfaces of the great infusorial ganglionic system thus obstructing the action of the posterior varioloid arteries and precipitating compound strangulated sorosis of the valvular tissues and ending unavoidably in the dispersion and combustion of the marsupial fluxes and the consequent embrocation of the bicuspid populo redax referendum rotulorum  a miserable silence followed aunt patsys heart sank the pallor of despair invaded her face she was not able to speak poor rowena wrung her hands in privacy and silence and said to herself in the bitterness of her young grief there is no hopeit is plain there is no hope the goodhearted negro wench nancy paled to chocolate then to orange then to amber and thought to herself with yearning sympathy and sorrow po thing he ain gwyne to las throo de half o dat small henry choked up and turned his head away to hide his rising tears and his brother joe said to himself with a sense of loss the baptizings busted thats sure luigi was the only person who had any heart to speak he said a little bit sharply to the doctor  well well theres nothing to be gained by wasting precious time give him a barrel of pillsill take them for him  you asked the doctor  yes did you suppose he was going to take them himself  why of course  well its a mistake he never took a dose of medicine in his life he cant  well upon my word its the most extraordinary thing i ever heard of  oh said aunt patsy as pleased as a mother whose child is being admired and wondered at youll find that theres more about them thats wonderful than their just being made in the image of god like the rest of his creatures now you can depend on that i tell you and she wagged her complacent head like one who could reveal marvelous things if she chose  the boy joe began  why ma they aint made in the im  you shut up and wait till youre asked joe ill let you know when i want help are you looking for something doctor  the doctor asked for a few sheets of paper and a pen and said he would write a prescription which he did it was one of galens in fact it was galens favorite and had been slaying people for sixteen thousand years galen used it for everything applied it to everything said it would remove everything from warts all the way through to lungs and it generally did galen was still the only medical

the room is kept wholesomely hot and the doors and windows closed tight keep count angelo nicely covered up with six or seven blankets and when he is thirstywhich will be frequentlymoisten a rag in the vapor of the tea kettle and let his brother suck it when he is hungrywhich will also be frequentlyhe must not be humored oftener than every seven or eight hours then toast part of a cracker until it begins to brown and give it to his brother  that is all very well as far as angelo is concerned said luigi but what am i to eat  i do not see that there is anything the matter with you the doctor answered you may of course eat what you please  and also drink what i please i suppose  oh certainlyat present when the violent and continuous perspiring has reduced your strength i shall have to reduce your diet of course and also bleed you but there is no occasion for that yet awhile he turned to aunt patsy and said he must be put to bed and sat up with and tended with the greatest care and not allowed to stir for several days and nights  for one im sacredly thankful for that said luigi it postpones the funeralim not to be drowned today anyhow  angelo said quietly to the doctor  i will cheerfully submit to all your requirements sir up to two oclock this afternoon and will resume them after three but cannot be confined to the house during that intermediate hour  why may i ask  because i have entered the baptist communion and by appointment am to be baptised in the river at that hour  oh insanityit cannot be allowed  angelo answered with placid firmness  nothing shall prevent it if i am alive  why consider my dear sir in your condition it might prove fatal  a tender and ecstatic smile beamed from angelos eyes and he broke forth in a tone of joyous fervency  ah how blessed it would be to die for such a causeit would be martyrdom  but your brotherconsider your brother you would be risking his life too  he risked mine an hour ago responded angelo gloomily did he consider me a thought swept through his mind that made him shudder if i had not run i might have been killed in a duel on the sabbath day and my soul would have been lostlost  oh dont fret it wasnt in any danger said luigi irritably they wouldnt waste it for a little thing like that theres a glass case all ready for it in the heavenly museum and a pin to stick it up with  aunt patsy was shocked and said  looy looydont talk so dear  rowenas soft heart was pierced by luigis unfeeling words and she murmured to herself oh if i but had the dear privilege of protecting and defending him with my weak voicebut alas this sweet boon is denied me by the cruel conventions of social intercourse  get their bed ready said aunt patsy to nancy and shut up the windows and doors and light their candles and see that you drive all the mosquitoes out of their bar and make up a good fire in their stove and carry up some bags of hot ashes to lay to his feet  and a shovel of fire for his head and a mustard plaster for his neck and some gum shoes for his ears luigi interrupted with temper and added to himself damnation im going to be roasted alive i just know it  why looy do be quiet i never saw such a fractious thing a body would think you didnt care for your brother  i dontto that extent aunt patsy i was glad the drowning was postponed a minute ago but im not now no that is all gone by i want to be drowned  youll bring a judgment on yourself just as sure as you live if you go on like that why i never heard the beat of it now therethere youve said enough not another word out of youi wont have it  but aunt patsy  luigi didnt you hear what i told you  but aunt patsy iwhy im not going to set my heart and lungs afloat in that pail of sewage which this criminal here has been prescri  yes you are too you are going to be good and do everything i tell you like a dear and she tapped his cheek affectionately with her finger rowena take the prescription and go in the kitchen and hunt up the things and lay them out for me ill sit up with my patient the rest of the night doctor i cant trust nancy she couldnt make luigi take the medicine of course youll drop in again during the day have you got any more directions  no i believe not aunt patsy if i dont get in earlier ill be along by early candlelight anyway meantime dont allow him to get out of his bed  angelo said with calm determination  i shall be baptized at two oclock nothing but death shall prevent me  the doctor said nothing aloud but to himself he said  why this chaps got a manly side after all physically hes a coward but morally hes a lion ill go and tell the others about this it will raise him a good deal in their estimationand the public will follow their lead of course  privately aunt patsy applauded too and was proud of angelos courage in the moral field as she was of luigis in the field of honor  the boy henry was troubled but the boy joe said inaudibly and gratefully were all honky after all and no postponement on account of the weather     chapter viii baptism of the better half  by nine oclock the town was humming with the news of the midnight duel and there were but two opinions about it one that luigis pluck in the field was most praiseworthy and angelos flight most scandalous the other that angelos courage in flying the field for conscience sake was as fine and creditable as was luigis in holding the field in the face of the bullets the one opinion was held by half of the town the other one was maintained by the other half the division was clean and exact and it made two parties an angelo party and a luigi party the twins had suddenly become popular idols along with puddnhead wilson and haloed with a glory as intense as his the children talked the duel all the way to sundayschool their elders talked it all the way to church the choir discussed it behind their red curtain it usurped the place of pious thought in the nigger gallery  by noon the doctor had added the news and spread it that count angelo in spite of his wound and all warnings and supplications was resolute in his determination to be baptized at the hour appointed this swept the town like wildfire and mightily reinforced the enthusiasm of the angelo faction who said if any doubted that it was moral courage that took him from the field what have they to say now  still the excitement grew all the morning it was traveling countryward toward all points of the compass so whereas before only the farmers and their wives were intending to come and witness the remarkable baptism a general holiday was now proclaimed and the children and negroes admitted to the privileges of the occasion all the farms for ten miles around were vacated all the converging roads emptied long processions of wagons horses and yeomanry into the town the pack and cram of people vastly exceeded any that had ever been seen in that sleepy region before the only thing that had ever even approached it was the time long gone by but never forgotten nor even referred to without wonder and pride when two circuses and a fourth of july fell together but the glory of that occasion was extinguished now for good it was but a freshet to this deluge  the great invasion massed itself on the riverbank and waited hungrily for the immense event waited and wondered if it would really happen or if the twin who was not a professor would stand out and prevent it  but they were not to be disappointed angelo was as good as his word he came attended by an escort of honor composed of several hundred of the best citizens all of the angelo party and when the immersion was finished they escorted him back home and would even have carried him on their shoulders but that people might think they were carrying luigi  far into the night the citizens continued to discuss and wonder over the strangely mated pair of incidents that had distinguished and exalted the past twentyfour hours above any other twentyfour in the history of their town for picturesqueness and splendid interest and long before the lights were out and burghers asleep it had been decided on all hands that in capturing these twins dawsons landing had drawn a prize in the great lottery of municipal fortune  at midnight angelo was sleeping peacefully his immersion had not harmed him it had merely made him wholesomely drowsy and he had been dead asleep many hours now it had made luigi drowsy too but he had got only brief naps on account of his having to take the medicine every threequarters of an hourand aunt betsy hale was there to see that he did it when he complained and resisted she was quietly firm with him and said in a low voice  nono that wont do you mustnt talk and you mustnt retch and gag that way eitheryoull wake up your poor brother  well what of it aunt betsy he  shh dont make a noise dear you mustnt forget that your poor brother is sick and  sick is he well i wish i  shhh will you be quiet luigi here now take the rest of itdont keep me holding the dipper all night i declare if you havent left a good fourth of it in the bottom comethats a good  aunt betsy dont make me i feel like ive swallowed a cemetery i do indeed do let me rest a littlejust a little i cant take any more of the devilish stuff now  luigi using such language here and him just baptized do you want the roof to fall on you  i wish to goodness it would  why you dreadful thing ive a good notion tolet that blanket alone do you want your brother to catch his death  aunt betsy ive got to have it off im being roasted alive nobody could stand ityou couldnt yourself  now then youre sneezing againi just expected it  because ive caught a cold in my head i always do when i go in the water with my clothes on and it takes me weeks to get over it too i think it was a shame to serve me so  luigi you are unreasonable you know very well they couldnt baptize him dry i should think you would be willing to undergo a little inconvenience for your brothers sake  inconvenience now how you talk aunt betsy i came as near as anything to getting drowned you saw that yourself and do you call this inconveniencethe room shut up as tight as a drum and so hot the mosquitoes are trying to get out and a cold in the head and dying for sleep and no chance to get anyon account of this infamous medicine that that assassin prescri  there youre sneezing again im going down and mix some more of this truck for you dear     chapter ix the drinkless drunk  during monday tuesday and wednesday the twins grew steadily worse but then the doctor was summoned south to attend his mothers funeral and they got well in fortyeight hours they appeared on the street on friday and were welcomed with enthusiasm by the newborn parties the luigi and angelo factions the luigi faction carried its strength into the democratic party the angelo faction entered into a combination with the whigs the democrats nominated luigi for alderman under the new city government and the whigs put up angelo against him the democrats nominated puddnhead wilson for mayor and he was left alone in this glory for the whigs had no man who was willing to enter the lists against such a formidable opponent no politician had scored such a compliment as this before in the history of the mississippi valley  the political campaign in dawsons landing opened in a pretty warm fashion and waxed hotter every week luigis whole heart was in it and even angelo developed a surprising amount of interestwhich was natural because he was not merely representing whigism a matter of no consequence to him but he was representing something immensely finer and greaterto wit reform in him was centered the hopes of the whole reform element of the town he was the chosen and admired champion of every clique that had a pet reform of any sort or kind at heart he was president of the great teetotalers union its chiefest prophet and mouthpiece  but as the canvass went on troubles began to spring up all aroundtroubles for the twins and through them for all the parties and segments and fractions of parties whenever luigi had possession of the legs he carried angelo to balls rum shops sons of liberty parades horseraces campaign riots and everywhere else that could damage him with his party and the church and when it was angelos week he carried luigi diligently to all manner of moral and religious gatherings doing his best to regain the ground he had lost before as a result of these double performances there was a storm blowing all the time an everrising storm tooa storm of frantic criticism of the twins and rage over their extravagant incomprehensible conduct  luigi had the final chance the legs were his for the closing week of the canvass he led his brother a fearful dance  but he saved his best card for the very eve of the election there was to be a grand turnout of the teetotalers union that day and angelo was to march at the head of the procession and deliver a great oration afterward luigi drank a couple of glasses of whiskywhich steadied his nerves and clarified his mind but made angelo drunk everybody who saw the march saw that the champion of the teetotalers was half seas over and noted also that his brother who made no hypocritical pretensions to extra temperance virtues was dignified and sober this eloquent fact could not be unfruitful at the end of a hot political canvass at the massmeeting angelo tried to make his great temperance oration but was so discommodedby hiccoughs and thickness of tongue that he had to give it up then drowsiness overtook him and his head drooped against luigis and he went to sleep luigi apologized for him and was going on to improve his opportunity with an appeal for a moderation of what he called the prevailing teetotal madness but persons in the audience began to howl and throw things at him and then the meeting rose in wrath and chased him home  this episode was a crusher for angelo in another way it destroyed his chances with rowena those chances had been growing right along for two months rowena had partly confessed that she loved him but wanted time to consider now the tender dream was ended and she told him so the moment he was sober enough to understand she said she would never marry a man who drank  but i dont drink he pleaded  that is nothing to the point she said coldly you get drunk and that is worse  there was a long and sufficiently idiotic discussion here which ended as reported in a previous note     chapter x so they hanged luigi  dawsons landing had a week of repose after the election and it needed it for the frantic and variegated nightmare which had tormented it all through the preceding week had left it limp haggard and exhausted at the end it got the week of repose because angelo had the legs and was in too subdued a condition to want to go out and mingle with an irritated community that had come to distrust and detest him because there was such a lack of harmony between his morals which were confessedly excellent and his methods of illustrating them which were distinctly damnable the new city officers were sworn in on the following mondayat least all but luigi there was a complication in his case his election was conceded but he could not sit in the board of aldermen without his brother and his brother could not sit there because he was not a member there seemed to be no way out of the difficulty but to carry the matter into the courts so this was resolved upon  the case was set for the monday fortnight in due course the time arrived in the mean time the city government had been at a standstill because without luigi there was a tie in the board of aldermen whereas with him the liquor interestthe richest in the political fieldwould have one majority but the court decided that angelo could not sit in the board with him either in public or executive sessions and at the same time forbade the board to deny admission to luigi a fairly and legally chosen alderman the case was carried up and up from court to court yet still the same old original decision was confirmed every time as a result the city government not only stood still with its hands tied but everything it was created to protect and care for went a steady gait toward rack and ruin there was no way to levy a tax so the minor officials had to resign or starve therefore they resigned there being no city money the enormous legal expenses on both sides had to be defrayed by private subscription but at last the people came to their senses and said  puddnhead was right at the startwe ought to have hired the official half of that human phillipene to resign but its too late now some of us havent got anything left to hire him with  yes we have said another citizen weve got thisand he produced a halter  many shouted thats the ticket but others said nocount angelo is innocent we mustnt hang him  who said anything about hanging him we are only going to hang the other one  then that is all rightthere is no objection to that  so they hanged luigi and so ends the history of those extraordinary twins     final remarks  as you see it was an extravagant sort of a tale and had no purpose but to exhibit that monstrous freak in all sorts of grotesque lights but when roxy wandered into the tale she had to be furnished with something to do so she changed the children in the cradle this necessitated the invention of a reason for it this in turn resulted in making the children prominent personagesnothing could prevent it of course their career began to take a tragic aspect and some one had to be brought in to help work the machinery so puddnhead wilson was introduced and taken on trial by this time the whole show was being run by the new people and in their interest and the original show was become sidetracked and forgotten the twinmonster and the heroine and the lads and the old ladies had dwindled to inconsequentialities and were merely in the way their story was one story the new peoples story was another story and there was no connection between them no interdependence no kinship it is not practicable or rational to try to tell two stories at the same time so i dug out the farce and left the tragedy  the reader already knew how the expert works he knows now how the other kind do it mark twain
