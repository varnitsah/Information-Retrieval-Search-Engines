the arm of the law     xxx the roundupconclusion     introduction   my dear boys this is a complete story in itself but forms the sixteenth volume issued under the general title of rover boys series for young americans  this line was started thirteen years ago by the publication of the first three volumes the rover boys at school on the ocean and in the jungle i hoped that the young people would like the stories but i was hardly prepared for the very warm welcome the volumes received the three books were followed by a fourth the rover boys out west and then yearly by on the great lakes in camp on land and sea on the river on the plains in southern waters on the farm on treasure isle at college and then by down east where we last left our heroes and their friends  of course as is but natural dick tom and sam are older than when we first met them indeed dick is thinking of getting married and settling down and with such a nice girl as dora stanhope who could blame him all of the boys are at college finishing their education and all are as wideawake as ever and tom is just as full of merriment they have some strenuous times and take a trip through the air that is a good deal out of the ordinary they meet some of their old enemies and prove that they are heroes in the best meaning of that muchabused term  the publishers report a sale of this series of books of over a million copies this is truly amazing to me and again as in the past i thank my many young friends for their cordial reception of what i have written for them i trust the present story will interest them and prove of benefit  affectionately and sincerely yours  arthur m winfield     the rover boys in the air     chapter i  the boys and the biplane   fo de land sakes massa dick wot am dat contraption yo boys dun put togedder back ob de bahn yesterday  why aleck dont you know what that is returned dick rover with a smile at the colored man thats a biplane  a biplane eh repeated alexander pop the colored helper around the rover homestead he scratched his woolly head thoughtfully yo dont mean to say it am lak a plane a carpenter man uses does yo massa dick pears lak to me it was moah lak some ship sails layin downsomethin lak dem ships we see over in africy when we went into dem jungles to find yo fadder  no it has nothing to do with a carpenters plane aleck answered dick with a laugh a biplane is a certain kind of a flying machine  wats dat a flyin machine shorely massa dick yo aint gwine to try to fly exclaimed aleck in horror  that is just what i am going to do aleck after i have had a few lessons i hope to fly right over the house just like a bird  no no dont you try dat massa dick youll break yo neck suah dont yo try it ii cant allow it nohowan yo aunt wont allow it neither and the colored man shook his head most emphatically  now dont get excited aleck said dick calmly i wont go up until i am sure of what i am doing why dont you know that flying in the air is getting to be a common thing these days tom and sam and i bought that biplane in new york last week and a man who knows all about flying is coming out to the farm to teach us how to run it after we know how to sail through the air well take you up with us  me ejaculated the colored man and rolled his eyes wildly not in a thousand years massa dick an not fo all dat treasure yo dun brung home from treasure isle no sah de ground am good enough fo aleck pop and he backed away as if afraid dick rover might carry him off then and there  hello aleck cried a merry voice at this moment and tom rover came into view want to take a sail through the clouds for a change  massa tom am yo really thinking ob goin up in dat contraption demanded the colored man earnestly  sure thing aleck and youll want to go too before long think of flying along like a bird and tom rover spread out his arms and moved them slowly up and down oh its grand  yo wont be no bird when yo come down kerflop murmured aleck soberly yo will be all busted up dats wot yoll be  we wont fall dont you worry continued tom this biplane is a firstclass machine warranted in all kinds of weather  if it am a flyin machine wot fo you call it a biplane asked the colored man curiously  bi stands for two explained dick a bicycle means two cycles or two wheels a biplane means two planes or two surfaces of canvas this biplane of ours as you can see has two surfaces or decks an upper and a lower a monoplane has only one plane and a triplane has three now you understand dont you aleck  i dun reckon i do massa dick but look yeah boys yo take my advice an dont yo try to sail frough de air in dat bicycleplane or wot yo call it taint safe nohow yo stick to de hosses an dat autermobile an de boat on de ribber a boy wasnt meant to be a bird nohow  how about being an angel aleck asked tom slyly  huh an angel eh well if yo go up in dat bicycleplane maybe yo will be an angel after yo fall out even if yo aint one when yo starts and with this remark aleck pop hurried away to his work in the house  thats one on you tom cried dick with a broad smile poor aleck he evidently has no use for flying machines  well dick now the machine is together it does look rather scary answered tom rover slowly i want to see that aviator try it out pretty well before i risk my neck going up  oh so do i and well have to have a good many lessons in running the engine and in steering and all that i begin to think running a flying machine is a good deal harder than running an auto or a motor boat  yes i guess it is come on down and let us see how the engine works we can do that easily enough for its a good deal like the engine of an auto or a motor boat went on tom  where is sam  he took the auto and went down to the corners on an errand for aunt martha he said hed be back as soon as possible hes as crazy to get at the biplane as either of us  the two boys walked to where the biplane had been put together in a large open wagon shed attached to the rear of the big barn the biplane has a stretch from side to side of over thirty feet and the shed had been cleaned out from end to end to make room for it there was a rudder in front and another behind and in the centre was a broad cane seat with a steering wheel and several levers for controlling the craft back of the seat was the engine lightly built but powerful and above was a goodsized tank of gasoline the framework of the biplane was of bamboo held together by stays of piano wire and the planes themselves were of canvas especially prepared so as to be almost if not quite air proof all told the machine was a fine one thoroughly uptodate and had cost considerable money  well have to get a name for this machine remarked tom have you any in mind  well ierthought we might call her theer and then his big brother stopped short and grew slightly red in the face  ill bet an apple you were going to say dora cried tom quickly  humph murmured dick maybe you were going to suggest nellie  no i wasnt returned tom and now he got a little red also if i did that sam might come along and want to name it the grace we had better give the girls names a rest lets call her the dartaway that is if she really does dart away when she flies  all right tom thats a firstclass name responded dick and dartaway she shall become if sam is willing now then well fill that gasoline tank and let the engine warm up a bit probably it will need some adjusting  can we use the same gasoline as we use in the auto  yes on ordinary occasions in a race you can use a higher grade so that aviator said but then youll have to readjust the magneto and carburetor  gracious dick youre not thinking of an air race already are you  oh no but we might get in a race some dayand such things are good to know answered dick as he walked off to the garage where there was a barrel of gasoline sunk in the ground with a pipe connection he got out a fivegallon can and filled it and then poured the gasoline in the tank of the biplane  shell hold more than that said tom watching him here give me the can and ill fill the tank while we are at it well want plenty of gas when that aviator gets here  in a few minutes more the gasoline tank was full and then the two lads busied themselves putting the engine in running order and in filling up the lubricating oil box they also oiled up the working parts and oiled the propeller bearings and the steering gear  now i guess she is all ready to run remarked dick at length my but isnt she a beauty tom just think of sailing around in her  id like to go up right now answered the brother if only i knew more about airships hang me if i wouldnt try it  dont you dream of it yet answered dick weve got to learn the art of it just like a baby has got to learn to walk if you went up now youd come down with a smash sure  maybe i would mused tom well let us try the engine anyhow and maybe we can try the propellers he added with a longing glance at the smooth wooden blades  one thing at a time answered dick with a laugh well try the engine but well have to tie the biplane fast or else it may run into something and get smashed  let us run her out into the field first its too gloomy in the shed ill hammer in some stakes and tie her  the biplane rested on three small rubbertired wheels placed in the form of a triangle thus it was an easy matter to roll the big machine from the shed to the level field beyond then tom ran back and procured some stakes several ropes and a hammer and soon he had the biplane staked fast to the ground after the manner of a small circus tent  now she cant break loose even if you do start the engine and the propellers said he as he surveyed his work go ahead dick and turn on the juice he cried impatiently  dick rover was just as anxious to see the engine work and after another critical inspection he turned on the battery and then walked to one of the propellers  well have to start the engine by turning these he said  all right cried tom catching hold of the other wooden blades now then all ready heave ahoy my hearty he added in sailor fashion  four times were the wooden blades turned over and still the engine refused to respond it was hard work and both of the lads perspired freely for it was a hot day in early september  got that spark connected all right panted tom as he stopped to catch his breath  yes was the reply after dick had made an inspection the engine is cold thats all  humph well im not but come on let us give her another twist  the brothers took hold again and at a word from dick each gave the wooden paddles of the propellers a vigorous turn there came a sudden hiss followed by a crack and a bang and then off the engine started with the loudness of a gattling gun  hurrah shes started yelled tom triumphantly say but she makes some noise doesnt she he added  i should say yes thats because airship engines dont have mufflers like autos yelled back dick to make himself heard above the explosions  and see those propellers go around went on tom in deep admiration all you can see is a whirr we sure have a dandy engine in this craft dick  looks so doesnt it returned dick also in admiration i reckon the dartaway will give a good account of herself when she is properly handled now i had better stop the propellers i guess he added moving toward the front of the biplane to do so  yes yes stop em yelled tom suddenly hurry up dick see how she is straining to break the ropes say she wants to go up  dick was startled and with good reason even while his brother was speaking there came a sudden snap and one of the ropes flew apart then up out of the ground came the stake holding another rope the big biplane thus released on one side slewed around and tom was knocked flat then came another snap and two more ropes flew apart  shes going stop her screamed tom from where he lay and the next moment he saw dick struck full in the face by the machine down went the youth backwards and as he fell with a rush and a roar the biplane sped over the level ground for a distance of two hundred feet and then went sailing into the air headed almost point blank for the rover homestead less than fifty rods away     chapter ii  something about the rover boys   oh dick are you hurt  the cry came from tom as he turned over on the ground and struggled to his feet he had seen his brother hurled backwards and he saw that dick made no move to arise he had been struck in the head and blood was flowing from a wound over his left ear  oh maybe hes killed gasped poor tom and then for the moment he forgot all about the flying machine that was rushing so madly through the air towards the rover homestead he hurried to his brothers side at the same time calling for others to come to his assistance  to my old readers the lads already mentioned will need no introduction for the benefit of others let me state that the rover boys were three in number dick being the oldest funloving tom coming next and sturdy sam being the youngest they were the sons of anderson rover a widower and when at home as at present lived with their father and their uncle randolph and aunt martha at a pleasant place known as valley brook farm in new york state  while their father was in africa on a mission of importance the three boys had been sent by their uncle to boarding school as related in the first volume of this series entitled the rover boys at school the place was putnam hall military academy and there the lads had made many friends and also a few enemies  from school the boys had made a short trip on the ocean and then another trip into the jungle after their father then had followed a trip out west and another on the great lakes later the youths had camped out in the mountains during the winter shooting quite some game then they had returned to school to go into camp during the summer with the other cadets  the boys by this time thought their adventures at an end but more were soon to follow there came a long trip on land and sea and then a voyage down the ohio river and soon after this the rovers found themselves on the plains where they had some adventures far out of the ordinary from the plains they went further south and in southern watersthe same being the gulf of mexicothey solved the mystery of the deserted steam yacht  now back to the farm for me sam had said at this time and all were glad to go back and also to return to putnam hall from which seat of learning they presently graduated with honors then mr anderson rover got word of a valuable treasure and he and the boys with a number of their friends went to treasure isle in search of it they were followed by some of their enemies and the latter did all in their power to cause trouble  although the boys had finished at putnam hall their days of learning were not yet over and soon they set off for brill college a highgrade seat of learning located in one of our middlewestern states they had with them an old school chum named john powell usually called songbird because of his habit of making up and reciting socalled poetry and were presently joined by another old school companion named william philander tubbs a dudish chap who thought more of his dress and the society of ladies than he did of his studies tom loved to play jokes on tubbs who was generally too dense to see where the fun came in  from the college the boys had taken another trip as related in the fifteenth volume of this series called the rover boys down east there was a mystery about that trip of which the outside world knew little but as that trip has something to do with the events which are to follow in this story i will here give such details as seem necessary  when the rover boys went to putnam hall they met three girls dora stanhope and her two cousins nellie and grace laning doras mother was a widow living not far from the school and it was not long before a warm friendship sprang up between dick and doraa friendship that grew more and more intimate as the days went by dick thought the world of dora and the two were now practically engaged to be married as for tom and sam they had taken to the two laning girls from the start and though tom was too full of fun to pay much attention to girls yet whenever nellie was mentioned he would grow red in the face and it was noticed that whenever grace was present sam was usually on hand to keep her company  the treasure unearthed on treasure isle had belonged to the stanhope estate the bulk of it going to mrs stanhope and dora and the remainder to the lanings because mrs laning was mrs stanhopes sister but the treasure had been claimed by a certain rascal named sid merrick and his nephew tad sobber and when merrick lost his life during a hurricane at sea sobber continued to do all he could to get the money and jewels into his possession  its mine he told dick rover one day its mine all mine and some day im going to get it  you keep on tad sobber and some day youll land in prison had been dicks answer we found that treasure and the courts have decided that it belongs to the stanhope estate and you had better keep your hands off  but tad sobber was not satisfied and soon he made a move that caused the worst kind of trouble there was a learned but unscrupulous man named josiah crabtree who had once been a teacher at putnam hall but who had been discharged and who had later on been sent to prison for his misdeeds this josiah crabtree had once sought to marry mrs stanhope thinking thereby to get control of her money and the money she held in trust for dora the lady was weak and sickly and the teacher had tried to hypnotize her into getting married and had nearly succeeded but the plot was nipped in the bud by the rover boys  tad sobber met josiah crabtree and the pair hatched out another plot this time to abduct mrs stanhope getting the lady at the time to bring a good share of the treasure with her under the impression that it was to be invested by her friends the lady was carried off to an island in casco bay off the coast of maine and thither the rover boys and some others followed them there was a good deal of excitement but in the end the lady was rescued and the treasure brought back an effort was made to capture tad sobber and josiah crabtree but the two evildoers managed to get away  the homecoming of the boys with mrs stanhope had been a time of great rejoicing dora had embraced dick over and over again for what he had done for her mother and nellie and grace had not been backward in complimenting tom and sam on their good work there had been a general jubilee which had lasted several days  splendid work boys splendid work anderson rover had said i am proud of you  better work than the authorities could do had come from uncle randolph  now that treasure had better be placed where no outsider can get his hands on it mr rover had added and soon after that it was put in the strong box of a safe deposit company there to remain until it could be properly invested  at brill college the rover boys had fallen in with a number of fine fellows including stanley browne and a germanamerican student named max spangler they had also encountered some others among whom were dudd flockley jerry koswell and bart larkspur led by koswell who was a thoroughly bad egg the three lastnamed students had tried to get the rover boys into trouble and had succeeded but they overreached themselves and were exposed and in sheer fright koswell and larkspur ran away and refused to return dudd flockley was repentant and was given another chance  while on the hunt for mrs stanhope the rovers had fallen in with koswell and larkspur but instead of getting aid from the pair the latter did what they could to help old crabtree and sobber this brought on a fight and koswell and larkspur received a thrashing they would long remember the former college students might have been arrested but like crabtree and sobber they kept out of sight  they are sure a bunch of bad ones had been dick rovers comment when referring to crabtree sobber koswell and larkspur i wish they were all in jail  i reckon we all wish that had been sam rovers reply its an awful shame that we didnt capture at least one of em  well we might have caught old crabtree and sobber if we hadnt broken the engine of the motorboat put in tom  well the engine was broken in a good cause came from dick and he spoke the truth as my old readers well know  following the homecoming of the boys and the general jubilee our heroes had settled down to enjoy themselves before going back to brill they had intended to take it easy on the farm but when a great aviation meet was advertised to take place at the county seat they could not resist the temptation to be present  at this meet there were five flying machinesthree biplanes a monoplane and a dirigible balloon all made good records and the rover boys became wildly enthusiastic over what they saw  say this suits me right down to the ground cried tom  what fun a fellow could have if he had a flying machine and knew how to run it had come from sam  exactlyif he knew how to run it had been dicks words but if he didnt knowwell he might have a nasty tumble thats all  pooh dick if those fellows can run these machines so can we had been toms confident words  we know all about autos and motorboats sam had put in  thats true sam but a monoplane or a biplane or any kind of an aeroplane isnt an auto or a motorboat  are you afraid demanded tom  oh no only if we got a flying machine wed have to be careful about what we tried to do  hurrah its settled cried tom who went headlong into everything well get a machine tomorrow how much do they cost  i dont knowseveral thousand dollars i fancy answered his elder brother  boiled umbrellas dick as much as that  i think so  why look at some of em declared sam nothing but bamboo poles and a few wires and canvasand the engine  yes but the poles wires and canvas have to be put together just right sam and those engines are as powerful as they are light and then dont forget the propellers and the steering outfit and the other things  come on and ask one of the men about them came from tom and a little later they had a long talk with an aviator named captain colby who proved to be a relative to larry colby one of their former chums at putnam hall he had heard about the rover boys and some of their doings and willingly told them all they wanted to know  the boys went home with their minds full of flying machines and as the rovers were all welltodo and as the three lads had in the past proved capable of taking care of themselves it was not a very difficult matter for them to persuade their father to let them buy a biplane then through captain colby they learned where the flying machine could be obtained and the very next day bought the affair and had it shipped to the farm and also arranged with the aviator to visit them and give them a number of lessons  weve got three weeks before we have to go back to college tom had said if we are quick to learn we can have lots of fun in that time  yes and if we do learn perhaps we can take the biplane to college with us and astonish some of the students and the faculty dick had added  thats the talk cried the youngest rover well take it along  that morning sam had gone off on an errand as already mentioned then dick and tom had gotten out the flying machine and started up the engine and the propellers the ropes holding the biplane had broken or torn loose from the ground and now the machine had gone off with a wild swoop hurling poor dick flat on his back and injuring him how seriously was still to be learned     chapter iii  sam brings news   as tom ran over to his brothers side he could not help but give a glance at the flying machine which was rising higher and higher in the air with a noise from the engine that sounded like a battery of gattling guns in action  hi hi wots that came in a startled voice from the other side of the barn and jack ness the rovers hired man came running into view by gum if them boys aint gone an flew without waitin fer that man to show em whos doin it i dont see nobuddy and the hired man blinked in amazement at the sight before him is sam in there  nobody is in the machine answered tom who was kneeling beside his brother oh gracious look at that he exclaimed  there goes the chimbley roared jack ness as the biplane swooped just high enough to clear the roof of the rover homestead one of the wheels underneath struck a chimney a glancing blow hurling the bricks in all directions as they came clattering down from the house out ran mrs rover followed by her husband and the hired help anderson rover was away on business  what is the matteris it aera cyclone gasped randolph rover  i dont know im sure answered mrs rover but its a terrible noise  look look shrieked the cook pointing upward saints preserve us she moaned tis the end of the world  a flying machine murmured randolph rover he gazed around hurriedly can it be the boys  oh those boys they will surely kill themselves groaned mrs rover they know nothing about airships  say dar aint nobuddy in dat contraption came suddenly from aleck pop it am flyin all by itself  by itself repeated randolph rover impossible alexander a flying machine cannot run itself there must be somebody to steer and manipulate the engine and  oh maybe whoever was in it fell out screamed mrs rover and now she looked ready to faint  we must find out about this returned her husband quickly they had the machine in the shed back of the barn and he ran in that direction followed by the colored man and then by his wife and the cook in the meantime the biplane soared on and on ever rising in the air and moving off in the direction of the river  when the others arrived they found that tom had carried poor dick to the wagon shed and placed him on a pile of horse blankets and was washing his wounded head with water at the sight of her nephew lying there so still mrs rover gave a scream  oh tom is heis he she could not go on  hes only stunned i guess aunt martha was the reply but he got a pretty good crack  did the flying machine do it queried randolph rover  yes we had it tied fast but when we started the engine and the propellers it broke loose and ran right over dick  i dun tole you boys to be careful burst out aleck its a suah wondah yo aint bof killed wot kin i do massa tom and he got down on his knees beside dick for he loved these lads who had done so much for him in the past  hes only stunned i thinkand hes coming around now answered tom and at that moment dick commenced to stir then he gave a gasp opened his eyes and suddenly sat up  stop her stop her tom he murmured  dick dick my poor dear boy burst out mrs rover and got down beside him oh i am so thankful that you werent killed  whyerwhy stammered the oldest rover boy say whats happened he went on looking from one to another of the group wheres the biplane  flew away answered tom you got struck and knocked down dont you remember  ah dick drew a deep breath yes i remember now oh how my head aches he put up his hand and noticed the blood got a pretty good rap didnt i what did the machine do tom go to smash  i dont know the last i saw of her she was sailing over the house  she kept right on asailin answered aleck went on right ober de woods along de ribber  you dont say then well have a time of it getting her back dick gritted his teeth phew how my head hurts  bring him to the house and well bind his head up said mrs rover ill wash the wound first and we can put on some witch hazel  yes that or some peroxide of hydrogen added randolph rover who was a scientific farmer and something of a chemist that will kill any germs that may lodge there  dick was half led and half carried to the house and placed on a couch in the sitting room and then his aunt went to work to make him comfortable the cut was not a deep one and the youth was suffering more from shock than from anything else  ill be all right by tomorrow he assured his aunt martha i only got a knockdown blow thats all  the machine didnt fight fairly added tom who had to have his little joke it hit dick before he was ready  well i am thankful it was no worse answered mrs rover but it is bad enough  and well have to have a mason here to mend the chimney added randolph rover  ill get a man from the corners tomorrow said tom but say id like to know where the biplane went to he continued anxiously  maybe it landed on some other house mused randolph if it did you may have more to pay for than a dismantled chimney  oh houses are few and far between in that direction uncle randolph what i am afraid of is that the biplane came down in the trees or on the rocks and got smashed that would be a big loss  that is true  i can send jack ness and aleck pop out to look for the machine went on tom and i can go out myself with sam when he returns  yes youd better do that answered dick and ill go out with you tomorrow if you cant locate the machine today  better take it easy dick cautioned his aunt  oh ill be all right by tomorrow aunt martha a good nights sleep will be sure to set me on my feet again and i can fix this cut up with a bit of adhesive plaster  did you have much gasoline on board queried randolph rover  the tank was full answered tom oh the dartaway could go a good many miles if she wanted to he added dubiously  the dartaway was that the name of the craft  yes and she did dart away didnt she and tom grinned  for all we know she may have gone fifty or a hundred miles continued dick but i doubt it with nobody to steer shed be bound to turn turtle or something before long  well if shes busted shes busted thats all answered tom philosophically yet the thought of the beautiful biplane being a wreck caused him to sigh  a few minutes later the honk of an automobile horn was heard in the lane leading to the house and sam rover appeared driving the family car he was alone on the front seat and in the tonneau had a variety of things purchased in the village for his aunt and the others  hello what does this mean cried sam as he came into the sitting room and saw dick with his head bound up what did you do did you get that fussing with the biplane  i did sam was the answer  we both had a setto with her ladyship put in tom and the biplane floored us on the first round and then he told his younger brother of what had occurred  humph thats too bad murmured sam he took dicks hand not hurt much really he asked in a lower voice  no sam ill soon be o k  jumping lobsters but this beats all went on the youngest rover i dont know if i had better tell you or not and he looked around to see if anybody but his brothers was present the grown folks had left the room  tell us what demanded tom who quickly saw that sam had something on his mind  tell you the news  what news asked dick  maybe you cant stand it dick it will keep till tomorrow  see here sam im not a baby retorted the oldest rover boy if youve got anything worth telling tell it  but it may make your head ache worse dick  no it wont now whats the news out with it  instead of answering at once sam rover walked over to the door and closed it carefully  no use of worrying the others about it he half whispered  but what is it demanded tom and now he showed that he was as impatient as was dick  i got a letter from grace laning went on sam slowly and turned a bit red she told me a piece of news that is bound to upset you dick  is it about the stanhopesabout dora questioned dick half rising from the couch on which he rested  yesand about some others too but dont get excited nothing very bad has happened yet  what did happen sam hurry up and tell usdont keep us in suspense cried dick  well then if you want it in a few words here goes grace was visiting the stanhopes a few days ago and she and dora went to ithaca to do some shopping while in that town coming along the street leading to the boat landing they almost ran into tad sobber and old josiah crabtree  what those rascals in that townso near to the stanhope home exclaimed dick and after what has happened we must have them arrested  i dont think you can do it dicknot from what grace says in her letter  what does she say  she says she and dora were very much frightened especially when they discovered that both sobber and old crabtree had been drinking freely the two got right in front of the girls and commenced to threaten them and threaten us nobody else was near and the girls didnt know what to do but at last they got away and ran for the boat and what became of sobber and old crabtree they dont know  what did the rascals say to them questioned tom who could see that his brother had not told all of his tale  they said that they were going to square up with dora and with mrs stanhope and said they would square up with us too and in a way we little expected grace wrote that sobber pulled a big roll of bank bills out of his pocket and flourished it in her face do you see that he asked well i can get more where that came from and i am going to use that and more too just to get even with the rovers im getting my trap set for them and when they fall into it theyll wish they had never been born ill blow them and their whole family skyhigh thats what ill do  sobber said that asked dick slowly  so grace writes no wonder she and dora were scared to death  oh maybe he was only blowing especially if he had been drinking too much came from tom  i dont know about that answered dick with a long sigh with such a rascal at libertyand with money in his pocketthere is no telling what will happen  what do you suppose he meant by blowing us skyhigh asked tom but this question was not answered for at that moment mrs rover came into the room and the course of the conversation had to be changedthe lads not wishing to worry her with their new troubles     chapter iv  at the telephone   tom and sam spent the balance of the day in looking for the missing biplane walking down to the river and even visiting humpback falls where the youngest rover had once had such a thrilling adventure  dont seem to be in sight remarked tom after they had tramped through the woods and over the rocks until they were tired  looks to me as if the dartaway had gone further than we supposed possible replied sam maybe shes a hundred miles from here  oh she may have gone clean over to the ocean and dropped in said tom but i dont see how she couldwith nobody to steer how long would an auto keep to the road without somebody steering  do you know what i think we ought to do go back home and telephone to the villages and towns in the direction the biplane took somebody must have seen the craftif she kept in the air  by jove sam thats the idea why didnt you think of that before it would have saved us quite a tramp  the two boys turned back and reached home a little after the supper hour the meal had been held back for them  any luck asked dick who sat in an easy chair on the front piazza his cuts had been plastered up and he felt quite like himself again  no luck but sam has an idea answered tom and mentioned what it was  you must have supper first said mrs rover then you can do all the telephoning you please and so it was agreed  during the past few months the telephone service in the neighborhood of dexters corners had been greatly improved and the lines could be connected with nearly all of the villages and towns roundabout  ill try carwood first said sam ill call up tom bender hes a wideawake fellow and would know if an airship had been seen  carwood was soon had on the wire and sam presently was talking to the boy he had mentioneda lad who worked in the general store with his father  see an airship cried tom bender we sure didscooting over this burgh like a streak too was it your machine who was running it i tried to make out but couldnt  nobody was running it answered sam it ran away on its own account from back of our barn where did it go to  ran away suffering toadstools sam you dont mean it i dont know where it went it went so fast  which way was it headed try to tell me as nearly as you can  it was headed over bear hill near the spring that would about take it over rayville  thank you tom then ill call up somebody in rayville goodbye  oh say sam hold on a minute you say the machine broke away how was that tom bender was all curiosity  we were trying the engine and propellers thats all ill tell you the rest when i see you answered the youngest rover and rang off tom would keep me answering questions for a year if i let him he added to his brothers  he next tried the rayville general store but could get no information concerning the missing biplane then he tried several farmers who were utter strangers to him but whose names were in the telephone directory  airship eh queried one farmer a man named peter marley well we sure did see an airship fer it came nigh onto rippin off the roof o the barn ef i had the feller here as was runin it id give him a dose o buckshot he nigh scart my wife into a fit he did  which way did the airship go mr marley  went right over into rockers woodsover where the old saw mill used to be  did the airship come down do you think  i guess soleaswise she looks like she was goin to come down but who was the crazy loon as was runnin her  nobody was running the craftshe ran away on her own hook  by gum ye dont tell me no wonder she acted so blamed crazy like any reward fer her and the farmers voice betrayed a sudden interest  i dont knowill find out answered sam and then consulted hastily with his brothers  tell him the biplane is ours and if he will help locate it and get it to a safe place we will pay him well for his services said dick  when can we go to rayville  first thing in the morning theres a good road and we can make the sixteen miles in the auto in no time  all right said sam and told peter marley of what had been said the farmer agreed to remain around his house until they arrived and then do all in his power to help locate the dartaway  dick do you think youll be able to take that trip questioned randolph rover hadnt you better remain behind i can go with tom and sam if necessary  oh ill be all right in the morning was the reply  but youve got to let me and sam run the machine put in tom no use of your doing that  all right answered the eldest rover boy  that night when the others had gone to bed the three rover boys gathered in dicks room to discuss further the news regarding josiah crabtree and tad sobber  do you suppose it is possible that sobber thinks to come here and blow the house up queried tom  he might be equal to it answered dick soberly well have to keep our eyes peeled and when we go back to brill well have to warn dad and uncle randolph  do you know dad looked worried when he went away put in sam  i noticed it sam did he say anything to you about business  not a word why do you think its that  there is some trouble out westhas been ever since there was a strike at that golden horseshoe mine in which dad invested so heavily last summer they had a strike and now one crowd is trying to get the control from another crowd i dont know the particulars but i guess dad is worried  dick dont you think you ought to help him in these affairs came suddenly from sam uncle randolph is too absorbed in his books and in scientific farming to pay any attention andwell dad isnt as young as he used to beand we are growing older  ive been thinking of that sam i wish i was through college id jump right into the game and try to take the load from his shoulders  are you going to take the full course  no i talked it over with dad last week and im going to take the shorter course he said you two could take the long course if you wanted to  not much the short course for yours truly cried tom  ditto here came from sam  i want to settle down and get into business went on tom  he thinks nellie wont wait much longer remarked sam with a wink at dick  huh i guess you think grace wont wait snorted tom didnt i see you looking over that furniture and picture catalogue the other day ha i caught you sammy my boy  rats cried sam growing suddenly red in the face i was thinking of buying a new chair and maybe a picture or two for our quarters at brill the old ones are pretty punk if youll remember besides weve got to wait until dick and dora step off you know went on the youngest rover  thats soso we have added tom with more of a grin than ever by the way dick how much longer are you going to linger before you scrape up money enough to pay the ministers fee  just long enough to hammer some commonsense into the heads of two brothers of mine cried dick and threw a book at tom and a pillow at sam now go to bed and dont forget to wake up early for we want to be in rayville by eight oclock so we can have all day if necessary to locate the biplane and then he chased tom and sam out of the bedroom and locked the door on them  left to himself dick walked slowly across the room to where the bureau stood on the top was a small framed picture of dora stanhope that had been taken only a few months before dick could not help but take up the portrait and gaze at it long and earnestly  dear dear dora he murmured fondly the best girl in all this wide world some day you are going to be mrs dick rover and that day cant come any too soon for me oh i hope those rascals dont do anything more to harm you  dick was still holding the picture when there came a soft knock on the door  who is it what do you want he asked as he put the picture down  dick my child came in a whisper from the funloving tom be careful and dont kiss all the glaze off that photo shes a sweet girl warranted all silk and a yard wide but the glaze may be poisonous and  tom if you dont get to bed illill throw a pitcher of water over you cried dick and started to unlock the door with a merry laugh tom ran off and that was the last seen or heard of him that night  before retiring dick gave his wounded head another application of liniment and in the morning he was gratified to find that much of the soreness was gone the cuts of course remained and he bound these up with extra strips of adhesive plaster the three lads had an early breakfast and by halfpast seven oclock were in the touring car bound for rayville  how are you going to get the biplane back here even if you do find it questioned their uncle before they started off  i dont know answered dick it will depend on what condition the dartaway is in she may be so broken up as to be unfit for anything and then it wouldnt pay to move her  well better not attempt to fly in the craft cautioned randolph rover  hardly said tom maybe well telephone for captain colby to come and get her  tom was at the wheel of the touring car and once the farm was left behind and they were on a fairly good country road he advanced the spark and the gasoline control until they were running at twentyfive and then thirty miles an hour  now dont get gay tom warned dick this road wasnt built for racing  pooh whats thirty miles an hour declared the funloving rover who just then felt like letting out you know this machine can make fifty and better dick  i know it but youve got to have a safer road than this tom  beware of the turn cried sam who sat on the front seat with tom while dick was alone in the tonneau its a bad one  i know it but ill make it answered tom and then the touring car reached a bend in the road and went whizzing around it with a sudden lurch that made sam cling desperately to the seat and sent dick flying from one side of the tonneau to the other  tom be careful cried sam do you want to pitch me out on my head  do that again and ill make you let sam drive came from dick  it was the brakeit didnt act just right answered tom just a little frightened i think its loose  better stop and look at it answered dick promptly  oh i guess its all right said tom the touring car continued to move along up a winding hill then came a level stretch for half a mile and then a sharp descent leading into carwood  now be careful commenced dick and then stopped short for a sudden snapping sound reached his ears  whats that cried sam in alarm  the brakeits broken answered tom and then he set his teeth grimly to try to guide the heavy touring car down the steep hill without disaster     chapter v  looking for the lost flying machine   it was the foot brake that had given away the hand brake was still fit for use but each of the rover boys remembered with dismay that this brake had been loose for some time they had thought to tighten it up but other matters had claimed their attention and they had not deemed it absolutely necessary before taking the short trip to rayville since on starting the other brake had seemed to be in good order  can you do it tom asked dick quickly as the big car gathered headway on the steep hill  ill try was toms reply but its some hill  if only we dont meet anything put in sam blow the horn dick  the oldest rover boy did as requested leaning over from the back seat to do so and thus leaving tom free to manipulate the steering wheel dick also set the hand brake a notch tighter but this did little good since it was the bands that were worn  on and on bounded the touring car down the long hill on both sides the road was bound by rocks and trees with nasty gullies in several spots here and there were resting spots for teams and over these indentations flew the automobile with jolts that threatened to break all the springs at once  the turn beware of the turn cried sam and dick together when about threequarters of the hill had been passed  tom nodded but said not a word he had thrown the motive power to the low gear and thus the engine was doing something towards holding the car back  suddenly dick uttered a cry and the next minute sam saw him dive down to the bottom of the tonneau and bring up several long ropes to which were attached a number of hooks he had placed these in the automobile for possible use in getting the dartaway out of the woods or from among the rocks  with care dick took the hooks and threw them out of the machine at the same time he leaned over and allowed the ends of the ropes to catch on the swiftlyrevolving wheels of the machine  maybe theyll hold somethinganyway i hope so he said  they had now reached the turn tom was running as closely as possible to the inner side and dick had commenced to toot the horn again with a slipping and sliding the touring car went over the dirt and stones rushing nearer and nearer to the gully on the outer edge of the highway  look look screamed sam a second later a carriage and three ladies in it  he was right and the carriage was less than a hundred yards ahead but just now tom could think of nothing but the turn for the machine was running closer than ever to the gully if they went down in that the touring car would most likely turn turtle and they might all be killed  but they did not go down into the gully by sheer good luck tom managed to throw the automobile back into the roadway two wheels for a second spinning in midair then he had to reckon with the other dangerthat of hitting the carriage with the three ladies  the ladies had heard the tooting of the auto horn and had tried to draw up to the side of the road but the incline was still steep and the two horses evidently did not like the looks of that gully  you cant pass them groaned sam and just then came a grinding from underneath the touring car this was followed by a series of jerks and then came one final jerk that brought the automobile to a standstill and all but sent the rover boys flying over the engine hood  well weve stopped panted tom when he could catch his breath i guess the brake held somehow  no it didnt answered sam its another brake one that dick heaved overboard and he pointed to the ropes and hooks one hook the biggest had caught in a rock lining the gully and the ropes were in a mess around the wheels and the rear axle  good for you murmured tom it saved us from running into that carriage  are you men going on cried one of the ladies noticing that the automobile had come to a stop  not just yet sang out dick you can go ahead if you wish well wait until you get down to the bottom of the hilland maybe well wait longer he added in an undertone  you scared us nearly to death said another of the ladies tartly and then the carriage went on and was soon lost to sight on a side road  the three youths alighted and after blocking the wheels with stones so that it might not get away unexpectedly commenced an inspection of the car  the ropes wouldnt do much damage but the hooks might said dick but i couldnt think of anything else to do  it was grand of you to do that answered tom warmly i was a fool to let her out as i did he added bluntly ill know better next time  that was tom often headstrong but quick to acknowledge a fault  not without much difficulty did the three youths manage to get the ropes disentangled from the rear wheels and the back axle it was found that one of the hooks had gone into a tire causing a blowout that in the general excitement nobody had noticed but otherwise everything seemed to be all right apart of course from the broken brake rod and the boys were thankful  i guess we can manage to run to the nearest blacksmith shop said dick and there we can get the rod mended  what a lucky thing that big hook caught in the rock cried sam  its the one thing that saved us from going into the carriage returned tom and his face was very sober as he spoke for a time being he did not feel like running the car further and readily agreed to let sam take hold after another tire had been adjusted to keep the automobile from going down the remainder of the hill too rapidly they allowed one of the ropes to remain on the rear axle and to this tied a small fallen tree that made an excellent drag  when the level roadway was gained once more they made good time to carwood and there called on the blacksmith to repair the broken brake rod while waiting they ran into tom bender and the boy was very anxious to know all about the lost aeroplane  say but you fellows have a cinch he said in admiration you get what you please wish i was in your shoes  youd not want to be in our shoes when that brake rod broke answered sam bluntly eh tom  not much replied his brother  at last they were on the way again they had telephoned to peter marley so that the farmer would know the cause of the delay sam did the driving and now the machine went along well and almost before they knew it they were at rayville and asking the way to the marley farm this was on a back road but the way was good and they reached the farm without trouble excepting that they had to slow down to let a herd of cows pass them  got here at last have ye cried peter marley as he came out to greet them you kin put that mobile under the wagon shed if ye want to he added  cant we use it to go after the biplane questioned dick  no there haint no fit road if ye say so we can go on hossesif ye want to pay fer ridin added the farmer shrewdly he was a good man but close and never allowed a chance to make an honest cent slip by  all right well ride said dick the horses may come in handy for hauling the biplaneand besides we cant carry these ropes and hooks if we walk  so it was arranged and a little later the party of four set off on horseback the farmer and tom carrying the ropes and hooks and sam keeping beside dick who looked a trifle pale in spite of his efforts to appear all right the knockdown blow from the flying machine had been harder than the eldest rover boy was willing to admit  rockers woods proved to be a large patch of scrub timber all the large trees having been cut down to feed the old sawmill which still stood on the bank of a goodsized stream the sawmill had not been used for nine years and the timber was gradually coming up once more  this is exactly the way thet airship tuk said peter marley as he led the way an as she wasnt runnin very fast i guess she must acome down not very fur off  i hope so answered dick and i hope too she came down gently  huh how could she come down any other way aint much to em is there ceptin sticks an cloth  the engine weighs several hundred pounds  gee shoo several hundred pounds say if thets so its great how they kin stay up burst out the farmer in admiration aint no bird as weighs as much as thet  as they advanced through the woods all of the party looked to the right and the left for some sign of the missing biplane  heres a tree top down cried tom when they were close to the river on which the old saw mill was located this looks as if it might have been done by the machine  gracious i wonder if the airship went into the river burst out sam  that might be a good thing if it did answered dick it might save it from being wrecked and we might be able to tow it ashore  in a moment more they came to a halt at the edge of the river which was broad and smooth at this point in the middle the stream was ten to twelve feet deep and the bottom was of sand and smooth rocks  i dont see anything that looks like a flying machine said sam after a long look around  maybe after all it went over into the woods on the other side returned dick  that must be it said peter marley im afraid well have to go up the stream a bit to get across we cant ford here  how far to a good ford asked dick  about quarter o a mile tudder side o the old mill  say look over there cried tom at this moment what does that look like to you sam  he pointed with his hand and all in the party gazed in the direction indicated a point close to the opposite shore where some brushwood overhung the river  why that looks to me like one of the planes of the flying machine cried the youngest rover  just what i thought exclaimed tom what do you say dick  it certainly does look like one of the planes answered the older brother but dont be too sure or we may be disappointed  too bad we cant get over here murmured sam supposing i swim it he continued  no dont bother sam replied dick well all go around by way of the ford you cant do anything alone anyway  but i might make sure if it was the machine insisted sam  never mind we want to get over there anywayto continue the searchif that isnt the machine  again peter marley led the way along a trail that ran past the old mill the boys came close at his heels and as they advanced tom questioned the farmer concerning the place  it belongs to a lumber company but its been closed up fer years said peter marley once in a while tramps hang out there but thets all  presently they found themselves close to the mill which was almost ready to fall down from disuse and neglect as they rode up tom chanced to glance towards a side window and was surprised to catch sight of a man looking curiously at them as soon as he saw that he was discovered the man stepped out of sight  well i never gasped tom did you see him  see who asked his brothers  that man at the window of the mill unless i am greatly mistaken it was josiah crabtree     chapter vi  two old enemies   josiah crabtree came simultaneously from dick and sam rover  yes returned tom  how can he be here in this outoftheway place demanded sam  you must be mistaken tom came from the eldest rover boy old crabtree must be around cedarville or in ithaca he would have no call to come to a place like this  did you say josiah crabtree questioned peter marley curiously all had come to a halt on their horses  yes returned tom quickly do you know him  i used to know himfact is he once stopped at my place to git a ridewhen he was avisitin thet old mill  then he visits the mill exclaimed dick tom you must have been right  but why does he come here questioned sam  why as near as i know some relative o hisn used to have an interest in the lumber company as run the mill replied the farmer it was a man named foxwell hes dead now maybe he left his share o the place to this man crabtree he was a teacher wasnt he  he was years ago since then he has been a jailbird answered tom  a jailbird  yes he was in jail for a number of yearsand since he has been out he has been trying his best to make trouble for us and for some of our friends went on tom come on lets go after him instead of talking he added as he dismounted  thats the talk cried sam the biplane can wait  dick was as willing as his brothers to go after the former teacher of putnam hall and leaving the farmer to take care of the horses all three ran up to the door of the old mill it was unlocked and one of the hinges was broken and it was an easy matter for them to push their way into the building  do you think tad sobber is with old crabtree asked sam in a low voice  it may besince they were together when the girls saw them returned dick  we ought to have armed ourselves put in tom the boys had no weapons of any kind  here are some old barrel staves said tom they are better than nothing and he picked up a stave and his brothers followed suit  with caution the three rover boys advanced through the old mill which because of the closed doors and dirty windows was a gloomy place in spite of the brightness of the day outside all listened intently but not a sound reached their ears excepting mr marleys voice as he talked to the restless horses  supposing i call to him suggested dick  it cant do any harm answered sam  hello mr crabtree sang out tom without waiting for his brother where are you why dont you show yourself  all waited after this call but no reply came back and then dick and sam called  hes a bit bashful was toms grinning comment wants to be hauled out by the coattails i guess come on well soon locate him and he started forward  be careful tom warned his elder brother he may set a trap for you you know he and sobber are not to be trusted  ive got my eyes open answered the funloving rover sturdily  with the barrel staves in hand the three rover boys advanced further and further into the old mill going from one room to another occasionally they stumbled over bits of lumber and piles of sawdust for when the place had been shut down no attempt had been made to clean up even some of the machinery had been left and this was now so rusted that it was practically unfit for use  say mr crabtree why dont you show yourself called out dick are you afraid  you get out of here came the unexpected answer from a small toolroom the door to which was split but tightly closed you rovers have no right on this property  the boys recognized the harsh and dictatorial voice of josiah crabtreeless pleasant now than it ever had been they saw the former teacher glaring at them from the split in the toolroom door  mr crabtree come out here and let us talk to you said dick quietly but firmly  i dont want to talk to youi want you to leave these premises snarled the man  why should we leave asked tom  because this is my property  your property cried sam how so  it was left to me by a distant relative i wont have you on the place  mr crabtree do you know that we can have you arrested said dick sharply  arrested what for  for the abduction of mrs stanhope  i didnt abduct hershe went along of her own free willi can prove it  you know that statement is false you carried her off against her willand did what you could to hypnotize her into marrying you mr crabtree you are a villain and you ought to be returned to the prison from which you came  dont you dare to talk to me like that dont you dare fairly shrieked josiah crabtree i know my rights and some day ill have the law on you boys you are responsible for my being sent to prison and but for you mrs stanhope would have married me long ago now i want you to leave these premises and dont you dare to come back  is tad sobber with you asked tom  i am not here to answer questions tom rover i want to leave and at once  mr crabtree you listen to me said dick stepping closer to the crack in the door we are not afraid of you and we want you and tad sobber to know it were it not for the unpleasant publicity for mrs stanhope and her daughter wed have you in the lockup inside of twentyfour hours we understand that you and sobber have been threatening the stanhopes and the lanings again and also threatening us now these threats have got to stop and you have got to behave yourself if you dont behave yourself we are going to make it our business to see that you are arrested and well do our level best to have you placed behind the bars for a long term of years  iiwiller stammered the former teacher of putnam hall he did not know how to proceed  ah dont you get scared came in a low voice from inside the toolroom you know what the rovers are  it must be tad sobber cried tom sobber if you are in there why dont you show yourself are you scared  of course he is scared put in sam  im not scared roared the bullying voice of the youth who had claimed the fortune from treasure isle i am not scared and you know it  so you are really there sobber put in dick i thought as much well you heard what i said to crabtree it applies to you as well  bah dick rover you cant scare me returned tad sobber savagely just now you think you are on top but wait thats all that treasure belongs to me and i mean to have it and i mean to square up for the way you have treated me too  are you two going to settle down here asked sam just for something to say  that is none of your business answered josiah crabtree now i want you to leave  sobber what has become of jerry koswell and bart larkspur asked dick wishing to know something of those former goodfornothing students of brill college  never you mind what has become of them answered sobber but dont think you have seen the last of them dick rover they havent forgotten how you treated them on chesoque island and elsewhere and they mean to even up that score  are they here with you  no but im going to keep in touch with them and some day we but never mind now just you wait thats all finished tad sobber meaningly  youll try to play us fouljust as you tried in the past said dick very well ill remember that sobber and you remember what i told you the next time there is trouble well fight it out to the bitter end  there was a moment of silence  i want you to go away said josiah crabtree and there was just a trace of nervousness in his tones evidently dicks firm words had had some effect  we are going answered dick both of you remember what i said and then he motioned to his brothers and all three left the old mill  well did ye find the feller ye was after queried peter marley as the boys came out to where he stood with the horses  we did answered dick and nudged his brothers to keep them quiet its josiah crabtree all right and we had quite a talk with him  wots he going to do here  he says it is his propertyleft to him by a distant relative he ordered us away  must have been foxwell left him the place is he going to start the mill up agin  he didnt say  if hes a jailbird ill hate to see him in these parts went on the farmer soberly  well it wont hurt you to keep an eye on him mr marley answered dick and then struck with a sudden idea he continued and if you see or hear anything wrong about him will you do us the favor to let us know at once over the telephone or otherwise ill pay you for the calls  sure ill let you knowif i hear anything  i might as well tell you that he is down on us and down on some of our friends and he and a young fellow with him named tad sobber may try to play us foul in some way so if you hear of anything strange let us know by all means  you can depend on it i will replied peter marley  and now to see if that really was the biplane cried tom when the party was once more on horseback let us try to forget old crabtree and sobber one trouble at a time is enough if that was the flying machine i hope she isnt damaged much he added wistfully for he had hoped to get a good deal of sport out of sailing the dartaway  well if that was the biplane she must have landed in the river and that would break the shock some said sam hopefully  yes especially if she came down on a slant added dick maybe she struck the water and scaled along like a clamshell  along the river they proceeded for quite a distance and then came to the spot that the farmer said was the ford  not so very shallow either was dicks comment mr marley are you sure of the footing  yes ive been across any number of times was the answer ill lead the way be careful fer the rocks is slippery an if a hoss goes down he might give ye a nasty tumble  and then peter marley urged his steed into the river and one by one the rover boys followed him     chapter vii  the runaway horses   in the middle of the river the ford was so deep that the water almost touched the feet of the riders but fortunately the current was sluggish so the horses managed to keep their footing they were allowed to take their own time so it took several minutes to gain the opposite shore  well im glad we are out of that was toms comment as they reached a trail on the other bank  well have to endure it again to get back said sam and what about the biplane  just wait till we find the machine first answered dick with a faint smile you know the old saying dont count your chickens  before they are fried finished tom with a grin you see somebody might lift them from the henroost before you had a chance to cook them he went on soberly  by gum thet aint no joke nuther burst in peter marley many a chicken ive lost through tramps an wuthless niggers  illustration there she is burst from toms lipspage 63 rover boys in the air  they had to go around several walls of rocks and through a tangle of brushwood and then came to a small clearing where was located the remains of a woodcutters hut not far beyond was the locality where they had seen the object that looked like one of the biplanes wings  it must be confessed that the hearts of the three boys beat a bit faster as they drew closer would they find the flying machine and if so would it be in serviceable condition or so smashed up as to be worthless  there she is burst from toms lips and he pointed out into the water  right down between half a dozen big rocks added sam is she smashed much how about the engine dick  the engine is there but i cant tell if its broken or not well soon find out  the big biplane lay among some rocks and bushes the latter overhanging the water which at this spot was less than two feet deep by taking off their shoes and socks and rolling up their trousers the boys were able to wade out to the flying machine and make an inspection  one of the planes is broken said dick but as the bamboo poles are merely split i think they can be repaired with some fine wirejust as we repair a split baseball bat  but the engine asked sam impatiently  i think the engine is all rightat least it looks all right to me of course we cant be sure until we clean it up and try it  then she must have struck the water on the slant and that must have broken the shock said tom and this surmise was undoubtedly correct for had the dartaway come down squarely on the rocks the planes and the engine must have been broken to bits  do you think we can get her ashore asked sam  sure we can by the aid of the hooks and ropes and the horses but we want to be careful how its done there is no sense in breaking the machine still more  we might get some planks from that old hut and roll the wheels up on them suggested tom i dont believe anybody uses the hut  no that aint been used for years said peter marley ye can tear down the hull thing if ye want to  the boys and the farmer set to work and presently they had several rough planks taken from the sides of the hut they had the horses drag these down to the water and by hard work managed to get the planks under the flying machine as the planks were of wood they aided in floating the affair  by jinks ive got an idea suddenly cried dick well want the machine on the other side of the river why not build a raft and float her over instead of bringing her ashore here there is plenty of stuff in that old hut  thats the ticket answered tom hurrah for a life on the rolling deep  its a good idee was the farmers comment i was wonderin how wed git over with the contraption you kin keep on shovin planks an logs under till she floats an tie them together with the ropes ye brung along a good idee  it was not until noon that they had the socalled raft built and the biplane fastened to it the work had made them all hungry and they were glad that they had brought along a substantial lunch they sat down in the shade of the woods to eat washing the meal down with some water from a spring back of the old hutor rather of what was now left of the structure while the boys ate they talked about josiah crabtree and tad sobber and the others who were their enemies  theyll surely try to do something said dick but what it will be i cant guess well have to keep on guard  who is going to go on the raft asked sam it wont carry all of us  ill pole it over answered dick the rest of you will have to go around by the ford  dont you want any help asked tom  no i think i can do it alone if two of us got on the raft it might sink too deep and get stuck on the rocks  so it was arranged and a few minutes later dick set off peter marley had cut for him a slender but tough pole which he was to use in shoving the novel craft across the stream  dont go overboard cried sam  im going to take off the most of my clothing answered the older brother you can carry the things for meand dont drop them at the ford  soon dick was on the way standing behind the biplane and using the long pole as best he could he was in water up to his ankles and as the planks were slippery he had to watch his footing once he came close to going overboard but saved himself by clutching one of the wire stays of the machine  in the middle of the stream the current caught the raft and forced it down the river for quite a distance but dick had expected this and kept his eyes on a sandy stretch still further below he poled along with vigor and did what he could to avoid the rocks and shallows once the raft caught fast but soon he had it loose again and a few minutes later the sandy stretch was gained and he sent the raft shoreward with all his force it came up on the sand and there it stuck and the voyage was at an end somewhat out of breath dick sat down to await the coming of the others  safe and sound eh cried tom as he galloped up from the ford good enough  now whats the next move asked sam who was at his brothers heels  well let the horses pull the whole concern up into the meadow answered dick and as soon as peter marley arrived this was done and then the biplane was unfastened from the raft and rolled still further inland to a level grassy field belonging to a farm of the vicinity  the boys were anxious to learn if the engine of the flying machine was in running order and all set to work at once drying and cleaning the parts fortunately the gasoline tank had remained airtight while tom looked over the spark plugs and sam tried the oil feed dick adjusted the carburetor and magneto  now i guess we can try it said the eldest rover boy at last but well tie her down first he added with a grin  yes and good and hard this time added tom  rope her to the raft suggested sam and drive a few stakes in the ground too and this was done  it was a wonder that none of the propeller blades had been broken yet such was a fact they were scratched and nicked but a coat of varnish would soon remedy all that  dick turned on the spark adjusted the gasoline feed and then he and tom took hold of the propeller blades half a dozen turns proved unavailing and the boys looked glumly at each other had the engine been damaged after all  give her another said dick and this was done then the engine suddenly responded and there followed those gatlinggun like explosions that set the horses to prancing wildly  hi hi let up with thet racket yelled peter marley if ye dont them hosses will run away  all right ill stop her and you can take the horses up into the field answered dick  he sprang to the front of the biplane to stop the engine but ere he could do so one of the horses broke away and galloped madly away in the direction of the woods then another followed  there they go bawled the farmer lustily stop em  sam and tom leaped to do as bidden but they were too late and so was peter marley across the field dashed the horses badly frightened by the noise and in a few seconds they disappeared into the timber  well by gum now whats to be did asked the farmer helplessly  lets go after em answered tom running for the horse he had ridden we ought to be able to catch them mr marley dick and sam can stay here  all right well try it answered the farmer but them critters is powerful runners i can tell ye thet that black dont like no better fun than to run away  take care of yourself tom called dick who had now stopped the engine and then he and sam watched their brother and the farmer as they went riding away at top speed after the runaway steeds  well anyway the engine seems to be o k remarked sam after the others had disappeared and the propellers go around like circular saws now all weve got to do is to have those bamboo sticks bound up or replaced by new ones wouldnt it be great if we could go home in this machine he added enthusiastically  the boys inspected the split poles and the canvas which had been punctured in several places and then tried the engine once more  makes a lot of noise was sams comment youd think it was half a dozen fourths of july rolled into one  presently they saw a farmer approaching accompanied by two boys the farmer had a shotgun in his hands and each of the boys carried a club  wots this noise about an wots that thing demanded the farmer and he showed his nervousness by the way he handled his gun  this is an airship answered dick pleasantly i was trying the engine thats all  gosh all hemlock an airship eh i thought it was a company o soldiers firin their rifles wot be you adoin here in my pasture lot  is this your lot  it sure is an has been for forty years  we came here with mr marley of rayville to get the machine it got away from us and landed in the river we dragged it over here explained dick well make it right with you for using the lot he added with a smile  oh so thets it eh well youre welcome to use the lot said john snubble im glad o the chanct to see an airship boys this is one of them airships you read about in the papers he went on to his two sons aint no danger o an explosion is there he asked anxiously as he slowly drew closer  i dont think so answered dick and then he explained to mr snubble how the two horses had become frightened and run away and how mr marley and tom had gone after the runaway steeds  its too bad its broke said one of the farmers sons id like to see her go up  so would i added the other  perhaps youll see her go up when shes mended said sam  if this is your farm could you rent me a shed in which to store this biplane until she is mended said dick to the farmer  maybe i can was the slow answer but wed have to keep the thing out o sight o the hosses an cattle or theyd cut up wuss nor them hoses did wot run away the man added soberly     chapter viii  trial flights   it was a full hour before tom and peter marley came back and even then they did not bring the runaway horses in the field where the biplane was located  wont take no more chances said the farmer i kin tie em down here on the edge o the woods jest as well and this was done  well we may as well store the machine here for the present said dick well have to get some piano wire for those broken poles  arent you going to try to take it home asked tom in surprise  whats the use this is a good field to fly from we can mend the dartaway here and then if captain colby is willing he can sail her from here to our farm  a big wagon shed was cleaned out and john snubble and his sons aided the others in rolling the biplane under the roof some old blankets were thrown over the engine  do you think shed be safe here whispered dick to peter marley  she will be so far as snubble is concerned said the farmer hell leave her alone an so will his sons but some outsider may come an fool with her  well weve got to take that chance returned the eldest rover boy we wont leave the biplane here any longer than necessary  it was not until nearly supper time that the boys got back to rayville here peter marley was paid for what he had done and then the youths lost no time in running out their automobile and going home  the next day they telegraphed to the aviator who was to give them lessons in sailing the dartaway and he came as soon as he could he listened with much interest to what the lads had to tell him  well it was certainly a great tryout he declared it proves that the dartaway is a wellbalanced machine and that means much  he had brought with him the necessary wire for repairs and soon all were on the way to the snubble farm taking a road that would land them directly at the door  glad you come cried john snubble on seeing the boys going to take the machine right away aint you  we hope to answered dick why for he saw that the farmer had something on his mind  might have been burnt up last night thats why  burnt up cried tom how  heard a noise outside about eleven oclockmy wife did she aint well an dont sleep good i came down with my shotgun thinkin chicken thieves might be around i heard somebuddy at the flyin machine and sneaked up to see who it was hang my skin if a young feller wasnt there with a lighted candle an some loose hay and wantin to start a fire close to the gasoline tank i gave a yell an he dropped the candle and legged it for dear life  why didnt you stop him or shoot him queried sam  i was too excited fer the candle dropped into the hay an it begun to blaze up i stamped the fire out an by that time the feller was out o sight  he must have wanted to blow the biplane up exclaimed captain colby  he sure did an he might have burnt up the shed an the barn an the house too added john snubble  the three rover boys looked at each other the same thought was in the mind of each  tad sobber murmured sam  sure as youre a foot high added tom oh what a mean thing to do  he must have watched what we did and then planned to wreck the dartaway said dick its just like his meanness  lets go down to the old mill after him burst out tom id like nothing better than to wipe up the ground with him and he clenched his fists tightly  humph do you think hed show himself asked sam not much hed hide where you couldnt find him now he and old crabtree know we are around theyll take good care not to get caught  we might burn down the old mill murmured tom it would serve em right for all their meanness  let it go was dicks advice some day well catch both of them redhanded at something and then we can give em whats coming to em  the matter was talked over with john snubble and the aviator and the farmer said he would keep on guard against sobber and crabtree and report to dick if he found out anything unusual then the biplane was brought forth and captain colby made an examination  all these breaks can easily be mended said the aviator well go to work at once then ill give the dartaway a little tryout and if she runs as she should ill take her back to your home  dont you want a passenger asked sam and tom in a breath  why do you want to go  sure  im afraid ill have to disappoint you i want to try the machine several times before i risk taking anybody up  the snubble boys were delighted to think they could see the dartaway fly and they assisted the others in making the necessary repairs for two hours all were very busy and then captain colby announced the biplane in as good a condition as before the wild flight  now ill give her a short tryout he said and this was done up into the air mounted the dartaway as gracefully as a bird and all of the boys clapped their hands in delight  by gum beats the nation said one of the snubble lads  its grand im going to save up for one added the other  around the field sailed captain colby and then made the figure eight three times then he came down near the spot from which he had started  couldnt be better he declared i could take her a hundred miles if i wished  wish i could go up said sam wistfully  your time will come pretty soon added the aviator the flight to your home will be a good test  a little later the aviator arose again in the air this time headed for valley brook farm the boys were also ready and started off immediately in the automobile  come again shouted the snubble boys  we will answered dick your field makes a dandy landing place  dick ran the automobile and put on good speed all the way home as they went along they watched the flight of the biplane but soon the machine passed from view  she certainly can sail cried tom oh dick well have to take her to brill with us  thats it cried sam whats the use of leaving her behind we can sail after college hours  yes and think how quickly we could get over to hope seminary went on tom the place he mentioned was a young ladies boarding school located not many miles from brill dora stanhope went to hope and so did the two laning girls  well see about it replied dick briefly but the idea of taking the flying machine to brill pleased him as much as it did his brothers  when they got home they found that captain colby had already arrived he and the dartaway were in the field back of the barn and surrounding the aviator were all the members of the rover household  well boys got back eh cried anderson rover as they rolled up in the automobile  hello dad came from all three and then they leaped to the ground to greet their parent all could not help but notice that he looked a trifle pale and careworn  was your trip a success asked dick in a low voice  i dont know yeti hope so answered the father some business matters have gotten pretty well twisted up but never mind now i see your new machine can fly and anderson rover smiled  oh shes a peach cried tom slangily we expect to have the greatest times ever in her  yes but you must learn all about the biplane first added the fond father anxiously you mustnt think of going up until you are sure of what you are doing  dat am suttenly de greatest bird wot i most eber see declared aleck pop solemnly if i hadnt dun see it wid my own eyes i wouldnt nebber believe it nohow  thats a fact added jack ness when the boys go up in it there wont be no holdin em in  were going to take you up first thing jack said tom with a wink at his brothers  me not much cried the hired man i wasnt built to fly not me and he began to back away in alarm  after dinner captain colby made another trial flight and then gave the three boys a lesson in the manipulation of the biplane showing them just how to regulate the engine while running how to balance the machine how to steer and how to make various turns  do you ride bicycles he asked  we do and have for years answered dick  and do you swim  of course came from all of the lads  then just remember how you felt when you first tried to ride a wheel and when you first tried to swim you got excited didnt you and when you thought the wheel was going over you gave it a wild twist that did send you over and when you thought you were going to drown you thrashed around in a way that only made matters worse well thats a lesson to remember in running a flying machine dont get excited and lose your presence of mind or it may cost you your life keep cool act quickly but dont overdo a thing if the machine is tipping a little to one side dont get excited and throw it clean over the other way and dont try to make any sharp turns until you know your machine thoroughly  then he had them watch him while making several flights close to the ground and told them exactly what he was going to do this lasted for two days  running an auto and a bicycle will help you he said but sailing a biplane is after all a science in itself but youll learni see that by the way you take hold  there had been a slight breeze blowing during the third afternoon but towards sunset this went down and then the aviator said that dick might try a short flight over a cornfield that was close by  dont go too high he cautioned and if you feel the biplane turning over try to jump clear of the engine so it cant crush you  it must be confessed that dicks heart beat loudly as he took his seat in the flying machine it was one thing to talk about going up and quite another to really fly he realized the danger far more than did merryhearted tom or even sam but he was not going to show the white feather  the engine was started the others holding the machine back dick grasped the steering wheel and put his feet on the pedals  all ready asked captain colby  yes let go  now be careful take it easyand keep over the cornfield said the captain and if you turn make a wide circle he thought a tumble among the corn might not be as bad as one in an open field where the ground was hard  those on the ground let go and with a rush and a whirr the dartaway sped forward over the ground then dick shifted the elevation rudder and up into the air rushed the biplane gathering speed at every revolution of the propellers  the eldest rover boy was in the air at last     chapter ix  the new arrival   say thats great  be careful dick dont try too much  he made a very good start came from captain colby who was watching the progress of the biplane closely  over the cornfield sailed the dartaway with dick rover the sole occupant he was up about fifty feet in the air and presently he went still higher  hes making the turn cried sam just look at him coming around  here he comes back exclaimed tom hurrah who says dick cant fly why hes flying like a veteran  very good so far murmured captain colby if only he keeps his wits about him hell be all right  trust dick to do that answered sam he knows what he is doing every time  the biplane had now reached a point close to where the three stood in the field all expected dick to come down but he did not instead he made another graceful turn to the left and started over the cornfield a second time  i wish the others could see him murmured tom they had not told the folks in the house about the trial flights for fear of scaring them everybody thought the boys would not try to fly for at least a week  four times did dick sail around the cornfield the last time making such a wide circle that he went directly over the barn and the wagon shed then he shut off the engine and glided slowly to earth coming down in the middle of the field with scarcely a jar  by the great clam chowder of pocahontas cried tom rushing up and helping him out of the machine dick it was fine couldnt have been better  it was immense put in sam you made the turns beautifully  it was very well done added captain colby if you do as well in the future you will have no cause to fear as far as you are concerned i reckon the worst is over  how did it feel to be up in the air queried sam  oh i felt kind of funny in my head for a few seconds answered the older brother but i knew i had to pull myself together and i did after that it was only a question of watching everything closely  now i guess its my turn isnt it asked tom impatiently  if you feel equal to it answered the captain  sure thing  once more the biplane was gotten ready and with another rush and a whizz the dartaway shot into the air for a moment as the machine wobbled from side to side it looked as if tom would have an accident and his brothers gave a shiver but then he managed to steady the machine and over the cornfield he flew and around in a big circle twice then he made a still larger turn well up in the air and in a few seconds more was sailing over the barn and then over the rover home  gracious thats tom murmured sam always bound to go the limit  the noise of the engine caused those in the house to rush out and look at the machine  who is running it that aviator queried mrs rover  no its tom replied her husband  tom burst out anderson rover impossible why he doesnt know enough about it yet  hell be killed moaned mrs rover oh what a daring boy and she began to wring her hands in despair  over the house flew the biplane and then made another turn and came back then came sudden silence  something is wrong cried anderson rover the engine has stopped working  hes coming down like a bird exclaimed aleck pop now jess to look at dat  as he spoke the biplane glided slowly to the ground landing near the barn all rushed to the spot there sat tom grinning broadly  how was that he asked coolly wasnt that a dandy initial flight  tom tom cried his aunt youll kill me with your daring are you hurt did something break  no im not hurt aunty and nothing broke he answered oh it was immense i could have stayed up an hour if i had wanted to  very goodvery good indeed said captain colby you took a risk in flying over the house but as nothing went wrong we wont say anything about that  now its my turn cried sam  has dick been up queried his father  yes and he made a splendid flight too answered tom oh dad your sons are born aviators  perhaps but sam do be careful dont try to fly so high at first pleaded anderson rover  ill be careful dad answered his youngest offspring  all remained in the field to watch the flight of the youngest rover sam was a little pale but just as determined as his brothers had been to succeed he looked over the biplane carefully then took his seat and told them to start the propellers  once more the dartaway arose and as it did mrs rover could not repress a shudder for sam was very dear to her because he was her dead sisters youngest child and she had never had any children of her own  but her fears were groundless for sam sailed over the cornfield just as well as had dick he did not fly very high but he kept in the air nearly ten minutes which was longer than had either of the others when he came down he did so with a little bump but this was not enough to hurt anything  its the best ever was sams comment when the others gathered around beats autoing all hollow  wasnt you scared massa sam asked aleck who had watched the flight with wildlyrolling eyes  not in the least aleck after once i got started just when i went up i had a little chill down my backbone thats all  glory to heaben say yo know wot i think i think dare aint nuffin wot you rober boys cant natually do dats wot and with this comment aleck shuffled off to his work  every one of you did well was captain colbys comment he turned to anderson rover you can be proud of your sons sir they handled the machine in splendid shape  yes but i want you to watch them closely captain answered mr rover teach them all there is to know  ill teach them all i know myself answered the aviator  that evening the boys could talk of nothing but aviation and many were their plans for flights in the dartaway all wanted captain colby to tell them if the biplane could carry three persons  i hardly think so answered the aviator it will carry two though that i am sure of  well if it will carry two men it ought to carry three boys insisted sam  the best way to find out is to try it went on the captain so long as you run with care nothing can happen to you because of the extra load of course if the weight is too heavy the biplane wont go up or if it does it wont stay up  the following day came a telegraph message from one of the old putnam hall pupils hans mueller he sent word that he would be in that vicinity and would call on the rovers  good for hans cried tom who scented fun maybe we can take him up in the dartaway  hans would be scared stiff returned dick  it would take all the starch out of him said sam  in that case how could he be scared stiff asked tom dryly  it was arranged that sam should run down to the depot with the auto for the german youth in the meantime captain colby and the other boys got out the dartaway and prepared for more trial flights then dick went up and remained in the air for twelve minutes making a number of turns that were very graceful and taking a little trip over the woods back of the farm  its a sport that cant be beat tom he said on coming down i believe everybody will be getting a flying machine before longjust as folks have been getting autos  the supply of gasoline had been replenished and the lubricating oil renewed and then tom went up he flew around the cornfield twice then headed in the direction of oak run  i guess he has gone off to meet sam and hans said dick i heard the train go through and they must be on the way here by now  your brother certainly takes chances replied captain colby  he always did tom acts first and thinks afterwardsbut he usually comes out on top added dick loyally  in the meantime sam had reached the depot at oak run just as the train came in he immediately espied hans mueller dresssuit case in hand and ran to meet him  hello hans old boy he exclaimed glad to see you and he shook hands cordially  is dot you sam replied the german youth who although he had been in this country quite some time still found a difficulty in mastering the language i vos certainly glad to meet you how vas der udder poys  oh tom and dick are first rate they couldnt come down just now for they are busy with our new biplane  a biplane eh vot is dot some kind of a sawmill alretty  no hans a flying machine hop in and youll soon be at the farm and then you can look it over and sam led the way to the automobile threw the dresssuit case in the tonneau and assisted the german youth to a seat in front  a flying machine cried hans as they started off by chimanatics vot you poys going to git next  i dont know  first you get a houseboat den an autermobile den a steam yachts und bicycles und now it vos a flying machine vot you do mid him sam  we are learning to fly  vot you going up by der sky in him cried the german youth aghast  of courseand you can go up with us too  me me go up in a airship not on your neckties sam rofer i got too much regart for my neck alretty yet ven i fly i valk on der groundt und do it yah  oh its dead easy when you know how hans  dead hey chust vot i dink samput i tont vonts to pe dead not chust yet  they soon passed over the swift river and through dexters corners and came out on the highway leading to the farm looking up into the sky hans suddenly saw something unusual approaching  look look sam he bawled vot is dot  oh that must be our biplane answered sam yes it is dick or tom must be running it isnt it great hans  du meine zeit groaned the german youth of dick or dom be in dot he preaks his neck sure tole him to come town sam  sam did not answer but slowed up the automobile to better watch the flight of the biplane tom was making a graceful curve so that he might pass directly over the machine below  hello hans he cried gaily and waved his hand for the noise of the engine drowned out his oral salute then with a rush the biplane sailed directly over the automobile  sthop tont hit me yelled poor hans and badly frightened he ducked his head although the flying machine was fully twentyfive feet above him  then tom made another wide circle and again approached the automobile but this time he was sailing lower and even sam grew uneasy  go up he yelled to his brother and tom tried to obey but for some reason the biplane refused to respond to the rudder and with a rush and a roar it came directly for the automobile and its occupants     chapter x  fun with old ricks   it was a moment of extreme peril sam brought the automobile to a stop had the roadway been wider he might have sheered to one side but the highway was too narrow for that and with a ditch on either side to carry off rain water he did not want to take a chance of going over  go pack go pack shrieked hans mueller he was crouching down looking with staring eyes through the lowered wind shield of the touring car  suddenly sam acted while the biplane was still a hundred feet away he threw his lever into the reverse and allowed the gears to connect with the engine then the automobile began to move backwards slowly at first and then faster and faster as the youngest rover put on the power  hes coming hes coming ve peen busted up in a minit roared hans who was shaking as with the ague oh vy tidnt i sthay home ven i come to pay dis visit  the biplane had slowed down for tom had shut off the engine but the dartaway still had headway enough to catch up to the automobile and it came up like some bird of illomen that made even stouthearted sam quail but he stuck to his post sending the automobile backward as fast as he dared he knew the roadway behind was straight so he simply steered by keeping the wheel as it was  tom tom cant you do something he yelled turn her aside  im trying yelled back his brother the steering outfit is jammed  backward went the automobile and on and on came the big biplane until the forward part of the machine was almost over the hood of the touring car  maybe you had better jump out cried sam to hans  but even as he spoke there came a sudden snap from the flying machine a caught wire had released itself at once the biplane could be steered again and with a dexterous twist of the wheel and a deflection of one of the tips tom brought it around over a rail fence it sailed to land gracefully in the open field beyond then sam stopped the automobile  well came from the youngest rover and that single word meant a good deal  hope i didnt scare you to death sang out tom as he climbed from his seat hans did you get heart failure  oh dom dom vot for you do him asked the german youth in a voice he tried in vain to steady i dink sure you vos going to cut off our heads off alretty  it was the steering outfit did it explained tom im awfully sorry i scared you i was scared myself i was going to fly over you and then go back when all at once i found i couldnt budge the rudders then i got alarmed thinking the machine might turn turtle on me so i shut off the engine intending to glide to earth but i didnt want to glide right into the auto sam its a good thing you thought to run backwards if you hadnt there would have been a smashup sure  so dot is der new flying machine remarked hans as he walked into the field to inspect the dartaway mine gracious she vos almost so pig like a house  want to go up hansy old boy queried tom  not for a dousand tollers dom no not for a million  youll like it hans when you get used to it  no sir nixy returned the german youth firmly i sthay py der ground on you fellers can fly und i vatch you yah  how are you going to get the machine back asked sam  sail her back answered his brother promptly but ill have to look at that steering apparatus firstand youll have to help me start  better let captain colby inspect it first advised sam  but tom did not want to wait and so he and his brother looked over the flying machine and soon found out what had gone wrong and fixed it so that the same accident might not occur again then tom got in and sam and hans started the propellers and away sailed the youth in a manner that made the german lad stare in amazement  dots fine was hanss comment say dom he peen a regular aviadventurer hey  whats that hans  dom he peen a regular aviadventurer or vot you call him  oh you mean aviator  yah dots him he peen von sure  your word was o k hans was sams comment tom is certainly an air adventurer  the two boys got into the automobile once more and were soon at the rover homestead where hans was warmly greeted by the others all but captain colby knowing him well tom had already arrived and the captain was inspecting the biplane with care  such things will happen especially with a new and stiff machine said the old aviator all you can do is to watch out and look over the machine with care every time you plan a flight  hans had much news of interest to tell about the boys who were still at putnam hall and about captain putnam and george strong the head teacher he had also seen mr and mrs laning the parents of nellie and grace and had heard something of the latest trouble with tad sobber and josiah crabtree  vy tont you got dem arrested he asked when he was told that the evildisposed pair were in that vicinity  we dont want the notoriety said dick if we had them locked up theyd be sure to drag mrs stanhope and the girls into court we are willing to let them alone if they will only let us alone  captain colby remained at the farm a week and during that time gave the rover boys as much instruction as possible in the art of flying in general and the art of managing the biplane in particular he had brought with him several books on flying and recommended that these be read carefully  you all seem to take to it naturally he said i dont believe youll have any trouble excepting on rare occasionsand every person who goes up is bound to have that  after the captain left the boys took several flights some of them quite long they sailed over dexters corners and the railroad station of oak run and at the latter place nearly scared old ricks the stationmaster into a fit by swooping down close to where he was standing dick also made a flight to the marley place and visited the snubble homestead  what did you find out asked sam when he came back from the lastnamed trip  sobber and crabtree have left the old mill answered dick the snubble boys were over there twice and they couldnt see a sign of anybody  have they any idea where they went to asked tom  no they said crabtree sold the mill property  besser you look out for dem scalavags was the advice from hans i vouldnt drust dem mit mine eyes open alretty  oh were on the watch declared tom  the next day the german youth had to leave and all the boys went down to the railroad station in the touring car to see him off old ricks was there and he glared souring at the rovers when he saw them  i guess he didnt like that flying affair was sams comment  oh hes thinking of the time tom put the cannon cracker in the bonfire and made him think some dynamite had gone off returned dick with a grin  or the time tom gave him the cigar that turned into a snake went on sam with a laugh  get out of the way get out of the way you boys cried the old stationmaster as he brushed past hitting tom in the knee with a suit case he was carrying the train that carried hans had rolled away leaving ricks and the rovers alone on the little platform  why mr ricks whats your rush asked tom sweetly going to a wedding  no i aint going to no wedding grunted old ricks i dont want you young fellers to git in my way thats all  maybe you have to testify in that case in court went on tom with a wink at his brother  aint got to testify in no court  why youre in that casei read all about it in the papers cried tom  me in a case in court asked old ricks suspiciously  sure it was a terrible trouble wasnt it went on tom i am mighty sorry for you really i am mr ricks  now as it chanced mr ricks had had some trouble with a neighbor over a fence that had blown down between the two properties the neighbor had threatened to sue him if he did not put the fence up again the rovers knew nothing about this but it had been in old rickss mind for a week  if anybody sues me hell git the wust of it growled the stationmaster savagely  its a terrible mess thats a fact went on tom the papers said he had threatened to get after you with a shotgun  a shotgun after me exclaimed old ricks and turned slightly pale  and they say you poisoned the cat put in dick  and caught the dog and starved the poor animal to death added sam  it aint soi never teched his cat nor his dog nuther roared old ricks hes a blamed fool he is  hush hush whispered tom solemnly dont speak so harshly of the dead  dead exclaimed the startled ricks whos dead  didnt you know he was found on the railroad tracks dead asked the funloving rover of course they say you let the freight train run over him but we know you wouldnt be so wicked mr ricks  dead on the tracks me let the train run over him halfwhispered the stationmaster iididnt do it say this is awful who told you this  havent you read the newspapers asked dick  that comes for being too stingy to buy a morning paper added sam  of course the local papers didnt dare to print the truth said tom but youll find a full account in the new york blizzard and the philadelphia bazoo your picture on the front page too entitled did he do it or did he did it not  say i aint done nuthin i tell ye almost shouted old ricks who was too excited to realize that the boys were making fun of him if them blamed city newspapers say i did ill sue em fer damages thats wot ill do i aint teched ham ludd nor his cat nor his dog nuther and it was the wind blew the fence down i didnt tech that nuther he paused to catch his breath where was ham killed i didnt hear of anybuddy gitting struck by a train  oh i dont know who the man was or where he was struck answered tom as he started to walk away but they are after you mr ricks if i was

the fence nuther i tell ye its an outrage to say so ill sue them newspapers fer a million dollars damages  id make it two millions answered tom calmly and then started for the automobile followed by his brothers  but see here went on the stationmaster i want to know  sorry but we havent time now put in dick hurry tom he whispered  its ham ludd coming added sam lets get outbefore the fats in the fire  and off the three rover boys ran to the automobile and were soon rolling away from the railroad station but they did not go far  im going back and watch the fun said tom and leaped out and ran up behind the station while his brothers followed him     chapter xi  off for brill college   when old ricks saw his neighbor approaching he could not at first believe his eyes then he ran up to the man who was a particularly sour individual  say i thought you was dead he gasped  dead returned ham ludd do i look like i was dead and he glared savagely at ricks i aint dead not by a jugful  humph

he was commencing to smell a mouse as the saying is  wot did tom rover say demanded ham ludd  never mind wot he said grumbled the stationmaster only you be careful o wot you say about me in the future ham ludd thets all  huh i guess that rover boy has been ajokin you agin ricky said ludd with a grin how about thet bustedup bonfire an that snaky cigar ha ha he had you them times didnt he  you shet

rover boys anyway muttered old ricks as he gritted his teeth ill be glad when they go off to college agin wish they would stay away and he went about his work  ricks and ludd will have it in for each other from now on remarked dick as he and his brothers got into the automobile to go home  yes and hell have it in for usme especially returned tom with a broad grin never mind i can stand it he added carelessly troubles past or to come never set heavily on that funloving youths shoulders  the boys had given the biplane one trial in carrying two passengers dick and sam going up together while captain colby was present on the day following the departure of hans they rearranged the seats on the dartaway and got ready to go up three strong provided the biplane would carry the load  i know she will do it if we get a more powerful engine said dick  then well get the engine returned sam  they made the start with care all the others at the homestead being present to witness the trial the dartaway went up slowly with dick in the center at the wheel and sam on one side of him and tom on the other  hurrah we are going to make it cried tom as the biplane arose like some big bird  its a strain though answered dick we wont be able to fly very high nor very long  but its great to be up together murmured sam  they flew for nearly ten minutes making wide circles and a big figure eight they went over the house and the barn and in plain sight of several surrounding farms men women and children coming out to look at them once more the rover boys were the talk of the whole countryside  aint nothing they cant do said one of the farmers living near if they tackle a thing its plumb bound to go through every time  its because they are so full of grit and push answered his wife wish our jed was like em she added wistfully  jed aint never had no chanct mirandy  boys like them rovers make their own chances silas she retorted  that evening it was tom who made a proposal that met with instant approval from his brothers  lets go to the college in the biplane he said  hurrah just the cream returned sam say wont the fellows stare when they see us  very nice but we cant very well fly all the way from here to ashton put in dick mentioning the town near which brill college was located  oh i didnt mean that explained tom i meant to fly from ashton to brill we could ship the biplane to ashton in secret put it together on the sly and create a big sensation by coming down right on the college campus  tom youre a wonder cried sam its the best plan ever oh lets do it  wonder where we could ship it to so the other fellows wouldnt get on to what was doing mused dick  why not ship it to mr sanderson suggested sam the man he mentioned was a farmer living some distance from the college the boys had once done the farmers daughter minnie a great favor saving her from insults at the hands of jerry koswell and dudd flockley  thats the talk cried tom hell take care of it and let us put it together in one of his open fields then we can make the fellows at brill open their eyes  the new idea pleased all the youths immensely and the next day a long letter of explanation was sent to mr sanderson and he was asked to telegraph a reply the biplane was taken apart and packed up for transportation and then the boys packed their trunks and dresssuit cases and got ready to go back to the greasy grind as tom expressed it  it must not be supposed that the lads had forgotten to write to the stanhopes and the lanings and to their college friends numerous letters had been mailed and about an equal number had been received the girls were all going to hope but one week later than the boys would have to depart for brill nothing more had been seen or heard of crabtree or sobber for which all were thankful  heres a letter from william philander tubbs said tom i sent him a letter just for fun asking him the style in socks this fall listen to his reply and he read the following       i have been making diligent inquiries about the shades in      socks my dearest thomas but the storekeepers seem to be a      little undecided some think that rambler red will prevail      while others favor nile green and a new shade called babys      breath personally i favor babys breath and have purchased      one dozen of that shade if i get any more definite news      about shades i will wire you because i know what a dreadful      thing it is not to have the shade that is really and truly      fashionable  three cheers for william philander and his babys breath socks cried sam hes the true and only artist  babys breath murmured tom now wouldnt that get your scalplock and then there was a merry laugh all around  there was likewise a letter from max spangler and another from stanley browne stating they were already on their way to brill then just before the boys were ready to leave home came a letter from songbird powell  ill bet its in verse said dick songbird couldnt write prose to save his life  well soon see said sam who held the communication and he tore it open you win he added and then read the following after the date line            my dearest boys           im filled with joys           to think that we           together shall be           in a week or more           oh the fun in store           and also the work           which we cant shirk           and the pleasant meetings           and pleasant greetings  he was thinking of minnie sanderson when he wrote that interrupted tom  sure thing returned dick for all of the rovers knew that the wouldbe poet was deeply smitten with the farmers daughter he had written several poems about her and had also given her several presents  well there are twelve pages of the doggerel said sam glancing over the sheets here you can read over my shoulders and this was done amid much merriment songbird had but little news and promised to be at college when they arrived  oh i hope the dartaway carries us there in good shape murmured tom it will be an arrival worth remembering  before he left home dick had a long talk with his father and his uncle randolph when he rejoined his brothers he was unusually sober  what is it dads business affairs queried sam  yes sam  are they in bad shape questioned tom quickly whats gone wrong  its something about those mining shares that dad and uncle randolph invested in answered dick ill give you the particulars later they dont want aunt martha to know about it for it will only make her worry without doing any good im afraid dad and uncle randolph are in it bad went on dick soberly  cant something be done asked tom  not just now dad is going to chicago about it next week again  does he and uncle stand to lose much questioned sam  yes a good dealmore in fact than they can afford  phew thats too bad murmured the youngest rover and tom shook his head soberly and forgot all about the parting jokes he had intended to play on aleck pop and jack ness  at last came the time for the three rover boys to leave home the biplane had been shipped to ashton by express and their trunks and suit cases had been forwarded on their railroad tickets they were going a day ahead of time and mr sanderson had agreed to meet them and take them to his home  good bye my boys said the fond father on parting take good care of yourselves  we will they answered as they shook hands  learn all you can put in randolph rover  take care and dont get into trouble admonished mrs rover and then she kissed them tenderly  dont forget to let me know how matters go in chicago dad whispered dick to his parent  ill remember my son  and if i can aid you in any way let me do iteven if i have to leave brill went on dick  there is nothing to do at present dick i must wait for that report  soon the boys were in the touring car with jack ness to bring the automobile back from the railroad station he now being able to run the machine dick was at the wheel tom had cranked up and off they sped with a merry shout and with those left behind waving their hands  let her go dick sang out tom  good bye yelled sam  good bye came back faintly from the homestead  then a turn of the road shut out the house from view once again the rover boys were off for college little did they dream of the strange adventures in store for them     chapter xii  a grand arrival   glad to see you boys youre looking prime  it was the greeting of mr sanderson as the rovers stepped from the train at ashton the farmer was waiting at the platform with a twoseated carriage to take them to his farm  how are you mr sanderson came from the three and then all continued in a chorus did the biplane get here  something got heretwo boxes an several big bundles answered the farmer i had everything carted over to my place  two boxes and four bundles said dick  right you are one of em putty heavy too  that was the engine mr sanderson vouchsafed sam  is that so well times are sure changin an bymeby the hosses wont be in it no more so you calkerlate to fly over to the college  we do if we can get the machine into shape answered tom it may be that something got broke on the way and will have to be mended he added anxiously  well we didnt break anything tom take my word on that if anythings broke the railroad company done it  the boys were soon seated in the carriage and mr sanderson took up the reins as my old readers know the farmer was proud of his horses and he had good reason to be for they started off in fine style and presently were passing everything on that long and somewhat dusty road  how is miss minnie asked tom on the way  fust rate tom she went drivin yesterday with that young feller from brill that sprouts poetry  oh then songbird has really arrived cried tom  he has mr sanderson looked serious for a moment say is he any goodor is he allwell all poetry  songbird is one of the best and smartest boys in the college mr sanderson said dick bound to put in a good word for their chum he likes to make up verses but that isnt all he can do some day hell be a good business man  well im glad to hear that answered the farmer and the three rover boys knew he was thinking of his only daughter minnie and of the attention songbird powell was paying to her  it was not long before they came in sight of the sanderson homestead pleasantly located in a grove of trees minnie sanderson was on the lookout for thema roundfaced jolly young ladyand she waved her hand as the carriage came to a halt  why didnt you come in that wonderful airship she sang out gaily im dying to see you fly  because you have the machine here answered sam  oh weve only got some bundles and they dont look a bit like a flying machine went on the girl but say she added her cheeks dimpling what a time i had yesterday keeping your secret mr powell took me out ridingshe blushed a trifleand when we came back he wanted to know what the bundles contained i told him it was some kind of machinery he saw the canvas and said he guessed pa was going to put up a windmill  thanks for keeping it dark cried dick we want to surprise everybody at brill  youll have to be careful of what you do then went on the girl some of the young men have been around and iwell i dont like it  who was around asked tom  mr flockley for one and minnie bit her lip for she had not forgotten how that dudish collegian had once insulted herthe time the rover boys had come to her rescue as related in detail in the rover boys at college  did he come to the house asked sam  oh no he merely walked through the orchard but i guess he saw some of the packages  he didnt speak to you did he asked dick bluntly  i didnt give him the chance when i saw him i walked into the house and he didnt dare to follow me  it was almost supper time and the boys had arranged to remain at the sanderson homestead instead of going to the rather poor hotel at ashton they had a merry time with the others over the repast and then even though it was late they went down to the barn to inspect the boxes and bundles comprising the dartaway  everything seems to be all right said dick we ought to be able to put her together in a day if we all work hard enough  well get up at six in the morning said sam  so it was arranged and mr sanderson said he would call them but this was unnecessary for all were up and downstairs before the appointed hour and before breakfast was served they had the boxes and bundles open and the various portions of the biplane ready for assembling  cant i help asked the farmer who was much interested in what was going on  you can help us lift the engine said dick that is rather heavy  the boys and the farmer worked until five oclock in the afternoon over the biplane knocking off a half hour for dinner for that meal they had same fried chicken and fresh vegetables and an apple pie made by minnie which tom declared was a dream  well come and board with you said dick to the girl this sort of food goes away ahead of the college stuff eh boys  indeed it does cried tom  cant be beaten put in sam and these compliments pleased the farmers daughter very much  gasoline was at hand and also oil and soon the youths had the engine of the biplane in working order but it was not started until the dartaway had been rolled off to the middle of a big field  i dont want to scare your horses and cattle explained dick to the farmer when the engine starts theyll think fourth of july has arrived  soon all was in readiness and with a final inspection of the biplane dick took his seat in the machine and called to his brothers to work the propellers bang bang bang went the cylinders and around went the big blades faster and faster until only a blur could be seen then over the field shot the dartaway and up in the air  oh my just to look at that gasped minnie just like a big bird  well ill be switched cried mr sanderson an airship sure as you are born i didnt think id live to see one my my just to see that thing asailin through the air  dick made the circuit of the field and then cut a figure eight the machine seemed to work perfectly and when he came down he was well satisfied  all aboard for brill college he cried through passage only no stopovers allowed  shall we sail over now or wait until tomorrow asked sam  oh come on now cried tom impatiently lots of fellows will be on the campus at this hour and we can do some circling around before we land  im willing said dick who is to do the steering  you do ityoure the oldest said sam  thats right added tom  i dont want all the glory insisted dick  you are not going to have went on the funloving rover see what ive got for sam and myself and he brought out a mysterious package he had brought from home it contained two silken american flags and two tin horns  well do the patriotic while you run the machine said sam  and ive got something elsebut never mind what it is went on tom  no fireworks tomthey are too dangerous in a flying machine warned dick who knew his brothers love for things that made a noise  nothing dangerous this time dick ill give you my word  the dartaway was given another inspection and then staked to the ground with a strong rope fastened by a slip knot then the engine was started up and the three lads clambered on board  good bye they cried to the sandersons  good bye and good luck answered the farmer  let us know how you arrive added his daughter  then the knot in the rope was allowed to slide and with a rush and a whizz the biplane sped over the smooth ground and then soared into the air by the time sam had hauled in the dangling rope the flying machine had left the sanderson farm far behind  oh this is simply glorious cried tom he had his flag in one hand and his horn in the other and sam was similarly equipped  of course you know the way dick said the youngest rover  oh yes its easy ill simply follow the road but i am going up a bit added dick i dont want to scare any horses or we may have some damage suits to settle  the horses will have to get used to flying machines just as they had to get used to autos was sams comment  on and on flew the dartaway dick managing the biplane as skillfully as if he was a seasoned aviator over the farms and barns and houses they sailed creating much astonishment the inhabitants came rushing forth some with milk pails and women with dish cloths and towels in their hands one boy in his excitement shied a dipper at them the object falling short of its mark by several hundred yards  we are waking folks up remarked tom as he tooted his horn and waved his flag and sam followed suit then the funloving rover placed his horn under his arm and began to fumble at something in his pocket  i see brill cried sam presently there is the main building and he pointed with his hand  i see it answered dick now for a few circles and a figure eight before we come down i hope theyll give us room to land  in a few seconds more the various buildings belonging to the institution of learning were in full view dick started up the engine with renewed speed thereby making more noise and tom and sam added to the din by blowing the horns with all their might the two boys also waved the flags  the racket had the desired effect from one building and another ran the students and the members of the faculty and also the hired help and all gazed up into the sky to learn what the noise meant  its an airship  there are three people on board  say doesnt she sail along beautifully  wonder if they are sailing across the state  maybe they are in the oceantoocean race  they look like three boys see two of them are waving flags now what do you think of that  im going to get my spyglass said one of the under teachers and ran to do so in the meantime the dartaway came closer and circled slowly over the main college building and the broad campus  look look cried several of the students what are they up to  from the bottom of the craft had suddenly burst a cluster of red white and blue tissuepaper streamers these floated under and behind the dartaway producing a beautiful effect then suddenly came floating down through the air a quantity of manycolored confettitiny bits of pretty paper that settled everywhere  the rover boys cried the teacher who had brought out his spyglass they are the three rover boys  the rover boys cried songbird powell who stood near are you sure  yes  hurrah shouted stanley browne now isnt that just like them always up to something new and original  three cheers for the rover boys called out one of the seniors and the cheers were given with a will while the dartaway continued for some time to float over the college grounds and then came settling down like some big white bird in the very center of the campus     chapter xiii  some interesting news   before the biplane had come to a complete standstill the students on the campus made a rush and surrounded the three rover boys  the grandest arrival i ever heard of cried songbird powell as he caught one after another by the hand i shall have to write some verses about this  however did you manage it queried stanley browne i didnt know you could run an aeroplane  its out of sight alretty came from max spangler but we could see it yes he added hastily  oh we thought wed give the fellows a little surprise answered dick modestly we purchased the biplane some time ago its easy to run after you get the knack of it  but carrying three went on stanley ive heard of em carrying two but not more than that  its quite a load said tom weve got to have a more powerful engine if we want to carry that many right along  and the streamers and confetti cried songbird ill bet those were toms idea  youre right answered dick  and he thought of the flags and horns too put in sam bound to place the credit where it was due  i had to do something to let off steam said tom lightly dick wouldnt allow me to fire a bomb or a cannon or anything like that he continued dryly  during this talk many of the students and instructors commenced to inspect the biplane and soon the rover boys were kept busy answering questions  well young gentlemen allow me to congratulate you on your successful flight to this place said a pleasant voice and turning the youths found themselves confronted by doctor john wallington the head of the college he smiled broadly as he shook hands this surely marks an epoch in the history of brill he went on first arrival of students by airship and he turned to professor blackie who was with him  you are right sir returned that instructor well have to make a note of it and this was done and anybody going to brill can see the record in the history book of that famous institution  look whos here suddenly cried a cheery voice and will jackson usually called spud because of his liking for potatoes pushed his way to the rover boys side i was upstairs dressing when you arrived but i saw it all from the window say that flight couldnt be beaten you must have come about three miles a minute eh puts me in mind of the time i was caught in a kansas cyclone the wind carried me off my feet and landed me high up on the side of a big building and there i had to stick until the wind went down fact and if you dont believe it some day ill show you one of the bricks from that same building i keep it to sharpen my penknife on  the same old spud cried dick while the others laughed outright telling a yarn before he even shakes hands how are you and he gave wills hand a squeeze that made the storyteller wince  well have to have some place in which to store the biplane said sam to dr wallington do you think we could put it in the boathouse for the presentor in the shed of the gymnasium  you may use the gymnasium shed if you can get the machine inside replied the head of the college i presume well have to build regular hangars hereif the students are going to own flying machines he added with a smile  well they are good advertisements doctor put in tom nothing like being uptodate you know  perhaps rover perhaps and it will be instructive to all here to watch you and your brothers manipulate the biplane but do not let the use of the machine interfere with your studies  oh well use it like we would our bicycles or a motor boat or an auto said sam we came back to make a record for ourselves  i am glad to hear it samuel very glad indeed and then the good doctor hurried away to attend to his official duties  some of the late arrivals wanted the rover boys to give another exhibition flight and for their benefit tom took a little sail by himself and then sam went up for five minutes then the biplane was rolled over to the big shed attached to the gymnasiuma place usually used for housing carriages and automobiles during athletic contests here one end was cleaned out and the dartaway was rolled in and the engine was covered with a tarpaulin brought from the boathouse  during the time that all this was being done one student of brill had kept to himself even though greatly interested in what was going on this was dudd flockley the dudish youth who had once been the crony of jerry koswell and bart larkspur there was a sneer on his handsome face  great work eh dudd said bob grimes one of the students in passing  i dont know what you mean returned flockley coolly  oh yes you do dudd retorted the other but i suppose its sour grapes for you he added pointedly for he was a friend to the rovers and knew something about the troubles of the past  bah came from dudd flockley and he turned and hurried away now those rover boys have come back i suppose theyll try to lord it over everybody just as they did before how i hate them i wish i could do something to get them in a hole he had forgotten completely the kindness the rover boys had shown him and how they had gone to the head of the college and pleaded for him so that he had been allowed to remain at brill perhaps flockley was not as wicked at heart as his former college cronies larkspur and koswell but he was equally ungrateful  soon the rover boys and their chums were up in the dormitory where they had their rooms as before tom and sam were together in number 25 with dick and songbird in number 26 and stanley and the others not far off  home again sang out tom as he dropped in an easy chair my but this looks natural he added glancing around  i want to tell you something said stanley who had followed the three brothers and songbird into one of the rooms maybe wed better shut the door he added significantly  yes hes got news added songbird say it beats the nation how some fellows hold a grudge he went on  whats the trouble now demanded dick quickly  day before yesterday i was over to ashton answered stanley after the door to the room had been closed and locked i went by the upper road and i had to pass that new roadhouse the place called the red horseshoe well who was sitting on the piazza but jerry koswell and bart larkspur they had been having a gay time i guess and both were talking loudly when they saw me they called to me to stop and then they asked me if you fellows had come back to brill  what did you tell them asked tom  i told them no but that you were expected in a few days then both of them began to brag and said they had it in for all three of you rovers  did they say what they intended to do questioned tom  not exactly but koswell intimated that if you didnt look out you might be blown up  blown up exclaimed dick and he thought instantly of what tad sobber and josiah crabtree had said to dora and nellie  thats what he said i wanted to find out what he meant but larkspur stopped him from talking and told him to shut up but dick i feel sure they mean something and all of you fellows better be on your guard added stanley earnestly  this is surely getting interesting said tom first sobber and old crabtree promise to blow us up and now koswell and larkspur propose the same thing  they must be in league with each other cried sam  it looks that wayespecially after what happened on casco bay returned dick and then he told songbird and stanley of the recent happenings near the rovers home and elsewhere  well my advice is keep your eyes wide open all the time said songbird those fellows are desperatetheir actions show itand theyll play you foul if they get half a chance  and to that advice let me add something more said stanley dont trust dudd flockley he pretended to reform for a while but behind it all i think he is as bad as ever if you gave him any information he may carry it straight to those others  thank you stanley ill remember that said dick  so will i added tom and sam nodded in approval  well to let you in behind the scenes went on dick to stanley and songbird i am not so much worried about ourselves as i am about mrs stanhope and dora and the lanings sobber and old crabtree want that fortune from treasure isle the worst way and theyll do anything to get hold of it koswell and larkspur are probably short of funds and as they like to live high theyll help sobber and crabtree all they canfor a rakeoff of the proceeds  i reckon you are right said songbird but what do all of them mean by blowing you sky high  that remains to be seen said sam  or rather felt added tom who had to have his little joke maybe theyll plant some dynamite under the college and blow us up  hardly that tom returned his older brother but they may try some kind of a dirty trick along those lines  dont worry boys dont worry cried songbird soothingly let the troubles of the future take care of themselves and then he murmured softly            though the skies be dark and dreary             and hope be almost dead           and hearts are all so weary              each one can go to bed  finished tom a fine bit of poetry truly songbird old sport  who said anything about going to bed snorted the wouldbe poet i had a finer line than that tom it waserit wasaeraoh dear youve quite driven it out of my head  never mind it will come back day after yesterday or before and sooner went on the funloving rover blandly now let us put away our things and get ready for supper im as hungry as a wolf in a famine  thats right chimed in sam aeroplaning can give one a wonderful appetite  its the air said stanley  that evening after a good meal the rover boys had to tell of their various experiences with the biplane not a student of brill had ever gone up in a flying machine although several had gone up in balloons at county fairs and elsewhere the rovers had to promise to take up half a dozen of their chums so far during the fall talk of football had filled the air but now all became flying and flying machines several of the richer students promised themselves machines in the near future  thats the talk cried tom enthusiastically then we can have some races  maybe we can even get up an intercollegiate aeroplaning contest remarked sam  im afraid its a little too early for that yet answered dick but such contests may come one of these days  the rover boys were tired out from their day of labor and excitement and ten oclock found them in their rooms ready to go to bed tom and sam had started to take off their shoes when there came a faint tap on the door and bob grimes appeared  hello bob cried tom what can i do for you  hush not so loud whispered the other student with a glance over his shoulder down the corridor listen both of you he went on hurriedly dont ask me any questions but if you dont want your biplane ruined be sure and guard it closely and having spoken thus bob grimes hurried down the corridor and out of sight     chapter xiv  the birthday feast   the two rover brothers looked at each other in amazement and for a moment neither spoke  what do you suppose he meant asked sam presently  he meant just what he said returned tom im going to tell dick and he summoned his big brother without delay  i think i can piece this together said dick i saw bob grimes talking to dudd flockley this afternoon and again after supper most likely bob got on the trail of something dudd thinks of doing he doesnt want to appear as a tattletale and at the same time he doesnt want to see our machine ruined so thats why he warned you in such a queer fashion  you must be right answered tom what shall we do  nothing tom  yes but we dont want the machine ruined or even tampered with exclaimed sam  i dont think anybody will touch it went on the eldest rover boy after you came up here i got to thinking that maybe flockley or koswell or larkspur or somebody else might try to injure the dartaway and so i went to see filbury the janitor about it his son abner is helping him around the dormitories and i hired abner for fifty cents a night to sleep in the shed and guard the biplane abner has got a shotgun and he isnt afraid of anybody so i reckon the dartaway will be perfectly safe  good for you dick cried tom say i hope if anybody does try to injure the machine abner gives him a dose of shot  i told him not to shoot anybody unless it was necessary answered dick but he may shoot into the air just to scare the intruder and raise an alarm  the next day was such a busy one for the rover boys that they had no time to do more than look at the biplane and see that it was safe abner filbury reported that he had slept in a hammock slung beside the machine and that nothing had happened to arouse him nobody but the rovers knew that he was on guard the boys wanted to tell bob grimes but that individual kept out of the way  after having settled down in their rooms and to their studies the three rover boys made several flights in the biplane including one to the sanderson farm where they discovered songbird calling on minnie both were seated in a hammock between the house and the barn and both leaped up in confusion when the biplane manipulated by tom sailed directly over their heads when the rovers came down in the big field minnie ran to greet them and later she treated them to apple pie and some milk then they set sail once more leaving their college chum to finish his interrupted visit  after this flight the boys ordered a new engine for the dartaway one which would make sailing safer especially in a stiff wind the makers said they would send the new engine immediately and a machinist to install it and they agreed to take the old engine back at cost price since it was practically new  it must not be supposed that the rover boys neglected their studies as my old readers know whatever they tackled they went at with all their might and this applied to their work as well as their play  dad sent us here to get an education said dick and while i am here i am going to study all i can there is no telling how long ill be able to remain here anyway  thinking of dads western affairs asked sam  yes i may have to take hold and help him and uncle randolph out both of them are not as young as they used to be you know  thats true dick i noticed dads hair getting pretty gray and uncles is almost white  the boys had written home and also to the stanhopes and the lanings and soon came letters in return one from mr anderson rover was of special importance       i have news out of the ordinary wrote the parent that      man crabtree and tad sobber have come back to the old mill i      got the word from peter marley he says they act very      suspiciously and that a boy who works for him overheard      crabtree and sobber talking about us i have sent for a      detective to come out from the city and watch them for a      while if anything new develops i will let you know  now what in the world can old crabtree and sobber be up to asked sam after all had read the communication  up to some trick ill bet a new hat declared tom i am glad dad sent for the detective i hope he catches them redhanded at something and locks them up  they certainly ought to be locked up was dicks comment  the boys studied hard that evening and by ten oclock all were tired out and ready to go to bed but just as they were on the point of retiring there came a knock on the door of the room occupied by tom and sam and stanley appeared  you are wanted in room 14 said the student in a loud whisper come right along  whats up asked both boys  feasticecream and cake max and spud were down to the town and they brought the stuff along come on before its too late and the icecream melts  me for the icecream cried tom and did a handspring over his bed are the others invited  surea round dozen answered stanley  room 14 was at the end of the corridor and occupied by two students named lane and parley wholesouled fellows who were always ready for a good time the room was so located that it had much more privacy than the other apartments  soon the boys had gatheredas jolly a crowd as could be found at brill max and spud had spread themselves it being the germanamerican lads birthday  say this is certainly fine cried sam as he surveyed several big cakes two hands of bananas some grapes and several bricks of icecream of various flavors  how are you going to serve the icecream asked dick  oh were all prepared cried spud and exhibited a nest of paper saucers and another of paper plates and then a handful of tin spoons i thought these would answer better than the real thing for when we have finished we wont have to wash anythingwe can throw the whole mess away  say thats spud cried the student named lane once he had to wash dishes at a picnic we went to and you ought to see the face he cut  come git busy alretty cried max as he flourished a knife and commenced to cut one of the cakes spud chop the icecream up right avay  all right me for the chopping cried spud cheerfully and soon the cream was being passed around to the assembled students and the cake and fruit followed  fine cried tom as he smacked his lips over the feast max you have my full permission to have a birthday once a week  yes and when you miss a week let spud take your place added sam  one thing i cant understand spud said dick with great seriousness and everybody present stopped eating to hear what the eldest rover might have to say  what cant you understand asked spud innocently  how you could get up a feast like this and forget to supply such an important thing  what important thing demanded spud and he suddenly looked a trifle worried  potatoes returned dick  for an instant there was silence and then as the other boys remembered wills love of potatoesa love that had given him the nickname of spud there was a wild burst of laughter  say spud thats one on you  too bad we didnt bring a few praties along son  we might have fried a few over the light eh  dont you worry dis feast aint done yet alretty cried max here is something more and going to his bureau he brought out a square box wrapped in white paper spud he gifes me a big cakenow i gif him somethings yes and he handed the box over  whats this another joke demanded the other student suspiciously  do you think i play a joke asked max with a hurt look  all right then said spud and proceeded to undo the string around the box then he took off the paper and opened the box  what a shout went up for the box was filled with potatoesplain white and sweet there were about a quart of them mixed  oh what a sell murmured spud i knew youd do something like this he added grinning sheepishly  better pass em around suggested tom  all right have one raw returned spud  hi tont gif dem avay so kvick cried max getting excited and talking more brokenly than usual besser examine dem first  examine em murmured spud oh i see he added and took up one of the potatoes why it isnt a potato at all he exclaimed as the article came apart its only a shell and its filled with candy  chocolate drops murmured sam yum yum  there are salted almonds in this one went on spud opening an imitation of a sweet potato and here are stuffed dates and this had raisins in itand here are soft gum drops say max this is certainly great how did you happen to think of it and spud looked tremendously pleased  oh i know you lof potatoes answered the germanamerican youth innocently  the candy was placed on one of the wooden plates and the almonds and raisins on another and then the good things were passed around  ill keep these as souvenirs of the occasion said spud indicating the imitation potatoes  how about it songbird cant you rise to the occasion asked dick who had noticed that the studentpoet had been unusually quiet while eating his cake and icecream  i haveerjust composed a little poem in honor of maxs birthday answered songbird if youd like me to recite  sure thing  turn on the poetry spigot songbird and let her flow  this is not yet finished butbut  give us what you have said spud and clearing his throat several times songbird began            once more a year has rolled around             as years have rolled before           once more we greet our loving friend             a true friend to the core           we hope that in the future he             will win success and fame           and go down in our history             a noble  bang came the report of a gun and the shot was so unexpected that songbird forgot what he was going to say and all those at the feast sprang to their feet bang came a second report  what does that mean cried stanley who is firing a gun this time of night  i think i know what it means exclaimed dick leaping for the door come on if you want to save the dartaway he went on to his brothers     chapter xv  a perilous flight   without waiting to get a hat or an extra coat dick dashed through the long corridor and down the broad stairs of the dormitory and tom came at his heels  whats the matter cried spud grabbing sam just as the youngest rover boy was about to follow his brothers  ill tell you when we get back answered sam dont stop me now please i may be wanted  want any help put in songbird who for the moment had forgotten what he was about to recite  i dont knowbut i guess not  well go along anyhow came from max and took after sam while several others did the same  in the meantime dick and tom had gained the lower hallway of the dormitory the door was fastened but the key was in the lock and they soon had the portal open and they leaped outside then both started in the direction of the gymnasium shed  see anybody cried tom  no its too dark answered dick but that must have been abner filburys gun  the two reports from the shotgun had aroused many in various buildings around the campus and windows were being raised and heads thrust out  whats the trouble  who fired those shots  is it a joke  there go two of the rovers  are they up to some trick  more than likely you cant keep tom rover quiet  so the comments ran on while dick and tom sped in the direction of the shed as they came closer they received a sudden challenge from the big doorway  hi dont you dare to come back here or ill shoot you the words were uttered by abner filbury who stood there shotgun in hand and lantern by his side  dont shoot ordered dick it is i dick rover whats the trouble  oh so its you mr rover returned the janitors son with a sigh of relief i was afraid them pesky rascals was acoming back  what rascals  the fellers as got at the airship while i was asleep but i guess they didnt get no chance to hurt anything went on abner hastily  who were they asked tom  i dont know they had rags tied over their faces so i couldnt see em  how many of them were there questioned dick  two  are you sure they didnt harm anything went on the eldest rover boy as he entered the shed  no i aint sure for when i woke up they was in the shed right under my hammock i got scared and i blazed away at the roof and then they got scared i can tell you they jumped and let out a yell and ran for the door and i got down and went to the door and fired the other barrel into the air as a warning then they disappeared in the darkness  i guess it was began tom when dick caught hold of his arm and silenced him  well take a look at the machine said the big brother and they went into the shed here they were soon joined by sam and the others and soon a close inspection of the biplane was in progress  i dont see any damage said dick presently  most likely they didnt have time to do any replied tom  im glad of it added sam with a sigh of relief  who would be so mean questioned stanley  ive got my suspicions but i wont say anything yet answered dick  a proctor and several instructors had come down to the shed and the situation had to be explained to them all thought it mean that anybody should try to damage the flying machine  perhaps it was merely a boyish trick said professor blackie let us hope so  maybe answered dick just the same i am glad that i placed filbury on guard and then he told the young man to keep a closer watch than before and this abner promised to do then the boys went back to the dormitory finished the feast and went to bed  a few days later came word that dora and the laning girls had arrived at hope seminary and the rovers of course made immediate preparations to visit them  well give em a surprise said tom with a grin well visit em in the dartaway and this the other brothers readily agreed to do  a message was sent to the three girls requesting them to meet the boys at a certain hour on the campus of the seminary then the rovers got the dartaway in readiness for the trip polishing up the engine and working parts until they shone like silver  if only it doesnt rain or blow too hard said sam when all was in readiness  oh well go anyway cried tom  the boys had purchased regular aviation suits which looked very neat and professionallike the new engine was in place and they had given it a good tryout and had found that it worked as well as the other and gave much more power  i think we could carry half a dozen folks now said sam after a trial with some bags of sand she takes up the extra weight without an effort  perhaps but there is no use of straining the biplane or the engine either returned dick  the morning of the allimportant day came and the boys found the wind blowing steadily from the west  rather breezy for a flight was dicks comment  do you think it will rain queried sam anxiously  not with the wind from that quarter sam but we may get more breeze than we want  oh we wont mind the wind a bit declared tom who never wanted anything to interfere with his pleasure  the boys had their regular classes to attend during the morning and also one recitation after lunch but by halfpast two all were free and after donning their aviation suits they hurried to the shed and rolled out the dartaway  pretty breezy and no mistake remarked dick as he gazed anxiously at the sky i dont know about this  oh dont say we cant go dick pleaded sam  maybe the breeze isnt so strong high up came from tom hopefully  it may be stronger tom we dont want to go up and get wrecked  oh the dartaway wont get wreckednot with that powerful engine  dick hesitated he did not like that strong breeze in the least yet he was just as anxious as his brothers to visit the seminary and meet the girls and let them see the biplane and there was something even more important on his mind  oh come ahead and take a chance cried tom well get through somehow  just what i say declared sam  who is to run the machine asked the big brother  ill run her if you want me to answered tom promptly  oh i was only thinking of the honor tom im not afraid to try it  oh you go ahead and do it put in sam who knew that his big brothers heart was set on showing dora what he could do with the flying machine  well go up and try it answered dick at last if she works all right ill head her for the seminary otherwise ill bring her down again and so it was arranged  a number of the students had come out to see the flight and they gave a cheer as the big biplane rushed over the campus and then arose like a bird in the air as the machine went up tom looked to one side and saw dudd flockley standing on the campus in company with a student named andy yates both were sneering at the rovers and their friends  the pair that tried to damage the machine muttered tom to himself he knew that since larkspur and koswell had left brill flockley and yates had become quite friendly and he also knew that yates was a spendthrift and had a reputation far from good  up and up went the biplane guided by the steady hand and keen eye of dick the wind rushed over the canvas planes and sang merrily through the wire stays the engine banged away steadily and the propellers left only a blur in the air as they kept whizzing around and around  how is it dick asked sam after a full minute had passed and they were turning in a big circle  cant tell yetpretty gusty and full of holes was the answer and dick gritted his teeth tightly and took a firmer hold of the steering wheel then the dartaway came around with a rush  wow cried tom clutching at his seat say this is some slant  hold tight yelled dick  the warning came none too soon for a gust of wind hit the biplane and all but made it turn turtle as the saying goes but dick was on the watch and he sent the tips down and soon the machine righted itself then they rushed away over the woods beyond the college buildings  going queried sam  are you game asked dick grimly  sure  what about it tom dont go if you dont think it is best  well try it dick but if you spill us outwell please choose a soft spot thats all went on tom who had to have his joke even in such a time of peril  to take that trip with such a wind blowing was not a wise move and all three of the rovers knew it but they wanted so much to see the girls and show them the biplane that they were willing to take the risk  on and on sailed the dartaway now in the teeth of the breeze and then with the wind on the quarter all of the youths clung fast constantly for their was great danger of being pitched into space they had straps for fastening themselves but hated to use these fearing that they might get in some position where a quick jump might mean safety if they were strapped in and the biplane fell they might be crushed to death under the heavy engine  most of the trip was made in the face of the wind which every instant seemed to grow stronger the dartaway acted like a thing of life swooping and careening from one side to the other dick had to manipulate the wheel and the levers constantly to keep anything like an even keel  can you keep to the course questioned tom after about half the distance to the seminary had been covered  i dont knowit depends on the wind dick replied i may go around to the westwardit seems to be better sailing that way  in the end they had to make a wide detour and dick was wondering how he was going to turn in the direction of hope seminary when the wind suddenly died down this was his chance and on the instant he headed directly for the seminary  there it is cried sam presently i see the buildings  there is the campus added tom a minute later and there are the girls waving banners at us  i see them answered dick and then he shut off the engine and silently and with the grace of a big white swan the dartaway volplaned to the earth     chapter xvi  dick and dora   oh dick how lovely  werent you afraid sam  what a big flying machine tom  such were the exclamations from dora grace and nellie as all rushed forward to where the boys were alighting from the dartaway soon they were shaking hands all around and soon other girl students were coming up to learn what the arrival of the flying machine meant  well we certainly had a great trip said dick  the wind was pretty strong put in sam  strongest wind you ever saw declared tom stoutly turned us over about steen times and rolled us into a regular ball  oh tom what an idea exclaimed nellie and began to laugh but werent you afraid she went on anxiously  what me never but sam was so afraid he shook off his shoes and one of em dropped right on a cow and  tom rover burst out grace what a storyteller you are  well grace if you dont believe it go and ask that cow went on the funloving rover soberly its lucky sam has elastics on the shoesto pull em back by if he hadnt had tom did not finish but shook his head mournfully  i am so glad you got here safely dick said dora in a low voice but oh do you think it is quite safe she went on anxiously ii dont want you to get hurt  i guess it is safe enough dora he replied not wishing to alarm her its like an autoyouve got to get used to it  i dont think id ever get used to a flying machine  maybe you would some day ill take you up and you can see how you like it but dora shook her head at this  the boys had hoped to have a quiet time with the three girls but this was not to be just then the students of the seminary gathered around and the lads were kept busy explaining about the biplane and how the engine and the steering gear worked then to show that they could run the dartaway as well as dick tom took the machine up and sam followed him each making several circles around the campus  any girls want to go up questioned tom now dont please all speak at once there was a general giggle but nobody accepted the invitation then the rovers turned to those they had come to visit and taking the hint the other girl students sauntered away  wouldnt you like some refreshments asked dora we might get some hot coffee and some cake  no well have to get back before dark answered dick so well just stay and talk awhile any special news from home  no mamma is going away for her health and mrs laning is going with her  i hope they go where old crabtree and sobber cant find them  that is what they are going to try to do dick oh dear i wish those people would never come near us again  they are up near our home now answered the eldest rover boy and told about the old mill  whatever are they up to now do you think dick  i cant imagine we are all awaiting developments  your folks ought to be on guard  they are on guardand dad has hired a detective to keep his eye on crabtree and sobber  what about your father dick you wrote that he was worried over some business matter  he is and uncle randolph is worried too dora its some business you wouldnt understandsomething about some western investment you see dad and uncle are getting old and they cant watch things as they used toand uncle randolph is all wrapped up in scientific farming just as he always was i sometimes think its time i took hold of business matters and helped them  then youd have to leave brill wouldnt you  yes but id not mind thati have a pretty good education even now and i could study in my spare moments i could take a short course instead of one of the long ones and then dora that would help out another way went on dick in a lower voice and looking over his shoulder to make sure that the others were not listening but the others had walked off to the rear of the big biplane  another way how and dora looked at him wonderingly  oh you know well enough  no i dont she replied but two bright spots began to show in her pretty cheeks making her prettier than ever  well i made up my mind that as soon as i left college i was going to get married dick went on looking her full in the eyes  oh dick and now she cast her eyes on the ground  sure dont you think its a good idea he went on and he caught her hand and held it  oh ii she blushed more than ever and could not go on  i know we are not so very old dora but on the other hand we are not so very young either and i think your mother would approve and i am sure my father wouldnt object i know he thinks you are just the finest girl in the whole worldhe said so  well mamma likes you too dickshes told me that many times  then im sure she wont object and besides when im her soninlaw ill be able to do a good deal more than i can nowabout helping her with her financial affairs and all that you know  yes i know that too  and so i think we ought to get married but of course if you object dora  did i object and she smiled just a littlea smile that set his heart bounding  then youll consent he asked eagerly will you say yes wont you and now he had hold of both of her hands and was looking her full in the eyes i want you so much doraive wanted you ever since i first met youon that little steamboat on the way to putnam hall  oh dick what an idea why you hardly knew me then  never mind i knew you well enough  what a long time ago that was murmured the girl she was still gazing fully into his eyes  yes it was a long time ago and yet somehow it seems an awfully short time too but dora you havent said yes yet wont you please say yes he pleaded in a lower voice as tom and the others started to rejoin them  yes she murmured her face becoming a rosy red yes any time you say dick if mamma is willing  you dear dear girl he cried softly oh i just wish i had you all to myself for a moment and he gave her a look that spoke volumes  well weve got to get back that is all there is to it came from sam loudly he could not help but notice how confidential dick and dora were becoming  id like to stay but weve got to make the trip before it gets too dark added tom  just as you say answered dick although he did not just then see how he was going to tear himself away  but the boys did not leave for a good quarter of an hour and during that time dick and dora somehow managed to walk to the end of the campus where there were big clumps of rose bushes and lilac shrubbery once in the shadow of these dick pulled something from a pocket and held it out to dora  if we are going to be regularly engaged you must have this he said  oh dick a diamond ring she cried as the glint of the jewel caught her eyes  hold out your hand dear he said and when she held it out he placed the ring on her finger then he took her in his arms  mine dora mine always and forever mine  always and forever dick she answered and then they kissed each other  when they rejoined the others each felt as if walking on air  but the ringtheyll be sure to see it dick whispered dora  if they dont i shall be disappointed he answered  it was grace who espied the glittering circlet first and she uttered a slight shriek then she pointed it out to her sister  a diamond ringan engagement ring she cried  oh how lovely exclaimed nellie  ladies and gentlemen the future mrs dick rover said dick just a bit awkwardly while dora blushed the color of a peony  oh dora cried grace and nellie in chorus and then each kissed her  i thought i smelt a mouse murmured sam  hail to the bride cried tom say dick isnt it proper to salute your future sisterinlaw he went on with a broad grin  i dont knowbetter ask her replied dick goodnaturedly and then tom kissed dora and sam did the same thing after that tom declared he ought to kiss the bridetobes cousins and started in and sam followed  here you kids break away cried dick finally i thought you said we had to get back before dark  kids indeed snorted tom my how old weve gotten since were engaged and then he grinned more than ever but never mind he went on to nellie in a whisper just you wait and see the diamond ring i get you one of these days and this remark made nellie blush as deeply as had dora sam said something too to grace about a ring at which she laughed merrily and slapped his face but when the boys were in the biplane and ready to sail away and he held up a finger with a ring on it and looked at her questioninglyand longinglyshe gave a quick little nod of her curly head  illustration oh dick a diamond ring she criedpage 161  all ready asked dick at last  all ready replied his brothers  then start her up cried the oldest rover boy and the others gave a turn to the propellers bang bang bang went the engine and sam and tom rushed to their seats  come again soon cried the girls  just as soon as we can was the answer  be careful pleaded dora please please be careful  well look outdont worry answered dick he had to shout to make himself heard above the noise of the motor then came the usual whizz and rush and a few seconds later the rover boys were once more in the air and bound for brill  dick would have been pleased could he have allowed his mind to linger on the conversation he had had with dora but he soon found this out of the question the wind had come up again and was now blowing as strongly as ever and he had all he could do to manage the dartaway soon the big biplane commenced to pitch and toss like a small boat on the bosom of an angry ocean  say this is getting something fierce was sams comment after a particularly thrilling dip i thought we were going right down that time  you hold tight yelled dick dont let go for an instant  im as tight as glue was the reply  hadnt you better go up a bit dick came from tom  just what i thought of doing was the answer  the rudders were shifted and swiftly the biplane mounted through space it was now growing dark and presently the panorama that had been below them vanished from view  huh this wont do cried dick i cant see how to steer  steer by the wind for awhile suggested sam  a minute later came a fierce gust of wind followed by a second and then a third around spun the biplane and then tilted up as if about to go over then came an unexpected ripping and tearing sound  its the left planeits torn loose yelled sam let her down dick before it is too late if you dont well drop to our death     chapter xvii  caught in a hailstorm   all of the rover boys realized their extreme peril yet for the moment they were powerless to do anything to help themselves dick put out his hand to stop the engine of the biplane then concluded that it might be more advantageous to keep the propellers moving  around and around spun the flying machine tossed like a chip on an angry ocean all grew dark about the three boys and each gave himself up for lost it was useless to attempt to steer so dick held the craft as she was so far as the wheel was concerned  then came a sudden sickening drop and a tilting to one side sam let out a wild yell but what he said was drowned out in the roaring of the wind and the noise of the engine then of a sudden the dartaway dove forward and the gust of air was left behind they came into a hole as it is termed by aviators and again they sank but now dick was gaining control once more and he tilted the front rudder and up they went for a hundred feet but in something of a circle because of the broken plane  cant you land gasped tom we cantcantstandthis  ill do what i can replied dick between his set teeth he knew that their very lives depended on how he handled the biplane  slowly and with great caution dick allowed the dartaway to get closer to the earth each of the boys strained his eyes to catch sight of what might be below then came another gust and this was followed by a strange rattling on the biplane small white objects were bouncing in all directions  its hail cried sam weve struck a hail squall  he was right and the hail continued to come down all around them driven by a sweeping wind that carried the dartaway hither and thither but it was one of those sudden squalls that do not last long and soon they were sailing in the clear air again and now within view of the ground below  there is a fine fieldto the right cried tom  dick nodded and not without an effort brought the biplane around then he shut off the motor and they slid to earth quicker than they had anticipated the dartaway struck the ground and bounced up and down several times on its rubbertired wheels and then came to a standstill in the midst of some brushwood poor sam was thrown out heels over head into the bushes  are you hurt sang out dick anxiously it was so dark he could not see what had become of his youngest brother  ii guess not came back from sam and he started to scramble out of the bushes say that was some sail wasnt it he continued  no more like that for me returned tom panting like a race horse are you o k dick  yes although that bumping shook me up but come fasten the dartaway down before the wind comes up again and blows it to kingdom come  this warning was necessary for the wind was still fitful and there was no telling how strong it might become all sprang forward to do what they could to save the biplane from destruction  if there was a barn handy we might use that said sam  they looked around but the only building nearby was a small cottage evidently one used by a farmers hired hands  run her around between the bushes directed dick they will protect her a little for the bushes are quite high  they found a spot between the undergrowth and into it forced the biplane until the air craft was completely surrounded the bushes broke the force of the wind and the lads had little difficulty in tying the machine fast with the ropes they always carried it was hailing again although not so heavily as before the wind was gradually going down but the sky was as dark and threatening as ever  i think it will turn into rain before very long said dick after a look around too bad it couldnt have held off half an hour longer then wed have been safe at brill  im thankful we got down safely dick said sam  oh so am i  it was a narrow escape was toms comment great hambones who would have thought wed run into such weather as this  oh hailstorms like this are not uncommon even in midsummer answered dick dont you remember the one that came and cut down our corn some years ago  yes and broke all the glass in the hothouse added sam say is the machine hurt much he went on  well have to make an examination  they looked the biplane over as best they could in the semidarkness one of the bamboo poles had been split and two of the canvas stretches were slit from end to end  not as bad as it might be said dick we can easily mend the canvas but i guess we had better get a new pole in place of that one id not care to trust it even if it were wired  perhaps we can wire it good enough to get back to brill with returned tom we cant stay here  ive had enough sailing for today cried sam let us walk back or get a carriage and leave the biplane here until some fine day when there is no wind  yes we cant use her any more today said dick let us cover the engine and walk to that cottage and find out just where we are and how we can get to brill  having arranged everything as well as the means at hand permitted the three rover boys left the vicinity of the brushwood and walked over to where the small cottage was located the ground was covered with hailstones and tom could not resist the temptation to gather up a handful and pelt his brothers  stop it cried sam and then as tom would not stop he rushed in with some of the hailstones in his hand and allowed them to slide down inside of toms collar  wow roared the funloving rover let up sam that feels as if id hit the north pole  then you let up answered sam firmly and after that tom let the hailstones alone  as they neared the cottage they saw that a lantern was lit and set on a table in the centre of the living room around the table sat three persons two young fellows and an older man evidently a farmer the three were smoking and playing cards and on the table lay some bankbills  why look at this cried dick in astonishment then he added quickly get out of sight dont show yourselves and he caught each of his brothers by the arm and led the pair to the rear of the building  whats up dick asked sam who were they  didnt you recognize those young fellows  i did cried tom in a low voice they were jerry koswell and bart larkspur  koswell and larkspur exclaimed sam are you sure  tom is right replied dick  who was the third fellow  i dont know he looked like a farmer to me  did you see the money on the table broke out tom they must have been gambling  it looked that way to me tom  if they were all ive got to say that third fellow better look out for koswell and larkspur continued tom they are sharpers at cards so dudd flockley once told me he said they got him to put up his money a number of times and each time they won he was inclined to think they didnt play fairly  well knowing them as we do id say they wouldnt be above cheating said sam but what in the world can they be doing in this outoftheway place  that remains to be found out replied his big brother maybe they were on the road and ran here for shelter from the hailstorm  im not afraid of them dick said tom  neither am i tom you know that  then whats the use of keeping out of sight id rather go in there and give them a thrashing like the one we gave them on that island  dont forget we have the dartaway here and they might take pleasure in ruining the craft or running off with her besides id like to watch them a bit and find out a little about their plans remember they want to play us some dirty trick  there they go burst out sam at that instant and motioned to the front of the cottage all looked in the direction he pointed out to see koswell and larkspur hurrying down a lane that led to a road running between the trees  you come back here that wasnt fair shouted the farm hand who had been playing cards with them come back and he rushed to the front door of the cottage and waved his arm wildly  it was fair shouted back jerry koswell  sure it was fair added bart larkspur wed come back only we are in a hurry  you cheated me stormed the farm hand and shook his fist at the pair but they paid no further attention and soon the darkness and a bend of the road hid them from view  the rover boys waited a few seconds and then knocked on the back door of the cottage the farm hand a fellow named dan murdock stamped over to the door and threw it open  what do you want he asked surlily the loss of his money had made him illtempered  why hello murdock cried sam i didnt know you lived here  oh so its you rover answered the farm hand he remembered that he had once given sam a ride and had been well paid for it caught in the hailstorm he went on a bit more pleasantly  yes these are my brothers added sam we were out and we got lost can you tell us the best road to the college  of course walk through the woods back there then take the road to the left and at the cross roads turn to the right youll see the signs so you cant go wrong  and how far is it  about two miles you can take the road yonder too but thats about a mile longer  do you live here asked dick curiously  i sleep hereme and two other hands we get our meals up to mr dawsons housethe man we work for  oh then this is the dawson farm dick remembered that mr dawson supplied butter and eggs to the college  yes sir  im glad to know that for we need some help we were out in our flying machine and had to come down over there well want somebody to look after the machine until we can fix it up and take it away of course well pay for whats done he added  oh i heard tell of that flying machine exclaimed the farm hand you sailed over this farm a couple of hours ago  he was much interested and wanted to know all about the trip and about the machine he said mr dawson was away but that the dartaway could be wheeled up into one of the big barns and left there until repaired then he agreed to get out a twoseated carriage and drive the boys over to brill inside of half an hour the biplane was safely housed and the whole party was on the way to the college  dick had warned sam and tom to remain silent concerning koswell and larkspur and it was not until they were almost to brill that he mentioned the fact that they had seen the pair running away from the cottage  seen em did you cried dan murdock say them fellers are swindlers they are they came in to git out of the hail and then they started to play cards just to while away the time so they said they asked me to play and as i couldnt work just then i consented and then they got me to put up some moneyjust to make it interestin they said they let me win a little at first and then they got me to put up more and more and then they cheated me and wiped me out  and how much did they get from you asked dick  they got nearly all my savingseighty dollars answered dan murdock grimly     chapter xviii  tom and his fun   got eighty dollars from you murmured dick thats too bad  it would be bad enough if i lost it fairly answered the farm hand but i am sure they swindled me  well you ought not to gamble put in sam who had listened to the talk with interest  i suppose thats true mumbled dan murdock but they said i might win a pile oh i was a big fooli know it now even if i didnt know it then i wish i had stopped em from leaving  why didnt you  they went so sudden likeafter they had my money one of em took out his watch and said theyd miss the train and away they started before you could say jack robinson but there aint no train this time o day  it was a trick to get away said tom  surei know that now oh if only i had my hands on em say they dont belong at brill do they went on the farm hand eagerly  no although they used to go there answered dick  then you saw em  yes we saw them running away  what are their names and when dick had mentioned them dan murdock shook his head slowly  ive heard of em before he said they used to hang around at the tavern i was a big fool no two ways about it i guess theyll keep out of my sight after this  more than likely answered dick  when the boys arrived at the college they found an anxious crowd looking for them and the biplane songbird and stanley and several others rushed to the carriage to greet them  were you wrecked  did you get a bad tumble  where did you come down  so the questions ran on and the boys had to answer as best they could everybody seemed to be glad to learn that they had escaped from the fury of the sudden hailstormthat is everybody but dudd flockley and his new crony andy yates  just like the rovers luck muttered flockley sourly theyd escape where everybody else would be smashed up  oh theyll get a smash if you give em time enough answered andy yates heartlessly he was a student who courted attention and it galled him to see the rovers the center of attraction  as soon as dick tom and sam could get time to do so they sent a message to hope seminary informing the girls that they had gotten back to brill in safety this relieved much anxiety for with the sudden coming of the wind and hail the girls had feared that the youths might be killed  after such a strenuous adventure the rover boys were content to take it easy for some time they sent to the city for a man to come and repair the dartaway and then settled down to their studies then after the biplane had been repaired they went after the machine and brought it back to brill and it was placed in the gymnasium shed with abner filbury to guard it as before  dont you want to go up songbird asked tom one afternoon after college hours  ieri dont think so answered the studentpoet gravely  rather make up verses about flying than fly eh  ieri think so tom  what have you made up about airships anything really fine songbird  well ive written a few little verses tom would you like to hear them  sure cried the funloving rover and then songbird commenced to recite            i spread my wings on the balmy air           and float and float i know not where           i rise i fall i fall i rise           for i am monarch of the skies  bang up songbird couldnt be better cried tom give us another dip like the small boy said of the icecream and the wouldbe poet continued            i rush along when skies are blue           and when it hails i sail right through           i feel  hold on songbird youve got to change that line we didnt sail right through when it hailedwe came down just as quickly as we could  oh thats only a figure of speech answered the wouldbe poet loftily and then he continued            i feel i can sail anywhere           for i am monarch of the air  good for you put in sam who was present for a no 1 firstgrade poetry apply to songbird every time  there are sixteen verses in all went on the poet eagerly the next one begins  sorry there goes the supper bell interrupted tom come on weve got to eat even if we miss the finest poem in the universe  ieri didnt hear any bell answered songbird  you didnt cried tom innocently well well come on in and see anyway and he dragged the wouldbe poet along and forced him into a crowd of students guess i was mistaken he said soberly too bad and off he ran and sam ran after him  well it wasnt half bad said the youngest rover  thats true sam returned tom and then he added with a sudden broad grin but how about an egg that was only half badwould you want to eat it some day songbird may write real poetrybut not yet  it was now ideal football weather and the football elevens the regular and the scrub were out daily for practice dick and tom had been asked to play but both had declined for they wished to pay attention to their studies and the biplane took up all their spare time sam played a little on the scrub but soon gave it up  during those days dick was more serious than usual and neither tom nor sam bothered their elder brother they knew he was thinking of his engagement to dora and also worrying over the business affairs of their father and their uncle randolph  one day tom and sam took a short trip in the biplane and persuaded stanley to go with them and the next day they took out spud but nobody else of their chums cared to go  a new arrival tomorrow cried sam one evening just from a trip to paris too  is it william philander tubbs queried tom looking up from the theme he was writing  youve struck it tom since you wrote to him about the socks he has been over to paris but he gets back to the grind tomorrowcomes in on the fourthirty train  say let us get up a reception in williams honor cried the funloving rover and as soon as the theme was finished he began to arrange his plans  the next afternoon the rovers and a crowd of their chums took one of the college carryalls and drove over to ashton station to witness the sport tom had been to town early in the morning and had arranged matters with eight colored waiters from the hotel and also with a local liveryman  as the train came in the boys and a number of others were on the watch for tubbs as soon as they saw the dudish student alight dresssuit case in hand the rovers rushed up to him  how are you sir william cried dick taking the dudes hand gravely  let me congratulate you lord tubbs cried sam bowing low  your highness will find his carriage this way put in tom taking the dresssuit case and flinging it to one of the colored men  whyerweally dont you know what doeserthis mean stammered poor william philander gazing around in astonishment  and well might he be astonished for there before him in a wideopen double row stood the eight colored men all dressed in black with broad red sashes over their breasts and cockades of red paper in their hats on the platform between the colored men was a bright red stair carpet and this carpet led directly to where a carriage was in waiting the carriage had four white horses all decorated in red ribbons and on the seat sat a driver also decorated in red  such an honor to have your lordship condescend to come to brill went on tom with a low bow  what did the queen say when she decorated you asked dick  it was a grand thing for the king to honor you so highly put in sam  i certainly envy you came from songbird who was in the secret  hope there is a good salary attached to the office was stanleys comment  ive heard it vas fife thousand pounds by the year vouchsafed max  how the girls will fall in love with you when they hear of this sighed spud  this way your excellency cried tom and led poor bewildered tubbs to the carriage  thomas my dear fellow whaterwhat does it mean gasped the dudish student his eyes opening wider and wider  oh you cant fool us tubblets whispered the funloving rover you were going to keep it a secret but we read all about it in the london paper one of the fellows sent over  read aboutahwhat please  why how the king and queen knighted you and all that philliam whilander  william philander please thomas buterthis is a mistake  no no tubby my boy no mistake at all i assure you this is in your honor solely the college faculty did itthey couldnt do less to one so decorated or knightedwhich is it please its the grandest thing that ever happened to brill  but dont you know ieri havent beenerknighted or anything else i wasnt in england i went to paris and  now now my dear boy dont try that game said tom reproachfully we all know perfectly well that you were knighted and that you are now sir tubbs p x c and all that we salute you and then tom took off his hat three cheers for sir tubbs he called loudly  the cheers were given with a will and a tiger added poor tubbs was almost stricken dumb and commenced to mop the perspiration from his forehead  dont crowd so close cried tom warningly his lordship must have air he isnt used to so much excitement stand back now then into the carriage if you please and into the turnout went poor tubbs and the next instant his hat was snatched from his head and a tall white beaver was placed in its stead then several medals of tin and brass were pinned to his coat and the crowd set up a riotous cheering  hurrah for sir tubbs  my what an honor for brill  nothing like having a real nobleman for a student  away we go pile in boys cried tom and then there was a crack of a whip and off the strange turnout started with poor tubbs on the seat looking more bewildered than ever and followed by the great carryall with the yelling and singing students who had come to greet him     chapter xix  startling news from home   here the conquering hero comes  say but he looks like a real lord doesnt he  dont forget to bow to all the people you pass sir tubbs  so the cries rang on as the carriage and the carryall rolled away from the ashton depot  say look here what does this mean stammered the dudish student i tell you im no lord or knight or anything like that i was over to paris not london dont you know weally this iservery embarrassing he pleaded wildly  stand up and make a speech when you get to the campus willie boy sang out tom give em something grand on high finance or railroad building or cooking beans or something like that  why tom weally dont you know i know nothing oferrailroads orerbeans please stop the carriage i wish to get out this iserawful dont you know fairly panted the dude he had stood up but now the carriage gave a jolt and down he sat very suddenly  on through the town and straight for the college drove the two turnouts the students yelling themselves hoarse many at brill had been let into the secret and when the grounds were reached a big crowd was congregated to take part in the sport  here they are  hurrah for lord tubbs  how are you duke william philander  do you wear the order of the red garter  no its the blue suspender he was decorated with  speech speech came the cry from every side  then the carriage came to a halt and was immediately surrounded by a howling mob a few had flowers that they threw at william philander while others had supplied themselves with stalks of celery carrot and beet tops and similar things which they sent forward with force and directness  heres a bouquet for you  my kindest regards tubbs  oh isnt it grand to be a real live emperor  hi let up will you fairly shrieked poor tubbs as the things hit him in the head and shoulders let up i tell you oh what a joke let me get out of the carriage i cant make a speech stop throwing at me oh my eye he added as a beet top caught him in the left optic then watching his chance he leaped from the carriage dove like a madman through the crowd and rushed for one of the dormitories quickly disappearing from view  good bye my boy good bye sang out several and then tom sent the dresssuit case after him and the fun came to an end  poor william philander he wont forget that in a hurry was dicks comment just the same i am afraid the sport got a little too rough at the end  maybe it did answered tom if you want it ill speak to tubbs and apologize  i see that apology in a gold frame right now declared sam with a laugh tom let him alone and hell be all right  all of the boys wondered how tubbs would act when he showed himself much to their amazement he called tom to one side that evening and shook hands cordially  it was all a mistakethis report that i haderbeen knighted dont you know he lisped but it was very nice to get up such a reception in my honor thomas really it wasalthough it got a bit rough towards the end but i know it was meant well and i thank you honestly i do and the dudish student shook toms hand again  and then for once in his life tom rover didnt know what to say as he afterwards admitted he was completely stumped poor innocent tubbs had really thought it an honor to tom that was the limit  ill never really know that chap he said to his brothers his head must be filled with sawdust and punk  well let him drop now advised dick quit your fooling tom and get at your studies you know what i told you we may have to leave brill before we anticipated and we want to get all the learning we can  have you heard anything more from dad demanded the funloving rover quickly  yes a letter came this evening that business affair is in a worse twist than ever but dad hopes he can straighten it out but he writes that he isnt feeling as well as he was if he gets sick well have to jump inor at least i willand take his place  well all jump in was sams comment id like to do something in a business way  did dad give any particulars asked tom  none but what we already know he felt too ill to write much  has he heard anything more of crabtree or sobber  nothing  during the following week there was some excitement at brill because of a football game between that college and another institution of learning it was a gala occasion and the rover boys hired a threeseated carriage and brought dora nellie and grace to the game brill won the contest and a great jubilee lasting far into the night followed the rovers and the three girls had a little feast of their own at the ashton hotel and on the way back to hope the young people sang songs and had a good time generally perhaps some very sentimental things were saidespecially between dick and dorabut if so who can blame them the placing of that engagement ring on doras finger by dick had made them both exceedingly happy  during those days the boys took several short trips in the dartaway once landing in the field on the dawson farm they sought out dan murdock and asked him if he had seen anything more of koswell and larkspur  yes i see em last week but they got out of sight in the woods and i couldnt find em answered the farm hand  around here asked dick  no that was on the edge of the big woods back of hope seminary i was driving along with some crates of eggs for the girls college when i see em sitting on a fallen tree smoking cigarettes i stopped my hosses and spoke to em and then they up and run into the woods as fast as they could go i looked for em but i couldnt git on their track nohow  what can they be doing up around hope murmured sam  maybe they are sweet on some of the girls returned tom i know they used to go up there when they attended brill  i hope if they visit hope they dont speak to dora and the others said dick as his face clouded  maybe we better warn the girls said sam  no dont do that said tom youd only scare them they know koswell and larkspur well enough dont say anything and so the matter was dropped  two days later came a special delivery letter from home that filled the three boys with intense interest       josiah crabtree and tad sobber have at last shown their      hand wrote mr anderson rover they have sent an unsigned      communication to me demanding fifty thousand dollars they      give me just two weeks in which to get the money together in      cash and place it at a certain spot along the road between      our home and oak run if the money is not forthcoming they      promise to blow up every building on the farm the      communication says you can pay half of this and get the      other half from your lady friends which means of course      the stanhopes and lanings  of all the cowardly things cried tom after listening to the above why its a regular sort of black hand communication  so it is added sam what else does dad say he went on and dick continued the reading of the letter       at first i was inclined to treat the communication lightly      and laugh at it but then came another lettera mere scrawl      stating they would give me a taste of what to expect that      night i told the detective of this and he came to the house      and remained all night with us about three oclock in the      morning there was an explosion outside and when we dressed      and ran out we found one of the chicken houses blown to      flinders by dynamite or some other explosive about one      hundred chickens were destroyed  just listen to that gasped tom oh the rascals  and uncle randolphs prize stock chickens murmured sam that must have made his heart ache  ill wager aunt martha was scared to death added tom and dick read on       of course there was great excitement and four of us the      detective ness pop and myself went after the rascals      leaving your uncle randolph to look after your aunt and the      cook both of whom were very much frightened we hunted      around until daylight but without success then we went to      the old mill in the auto but the place was deserted after      that i notified the local authorities and i have hired ten      watchmen to guard the farm and every building on it i have      also sent for two more detectives and i am hoping that      sooner or later they will be able to trace the scoundrels      and run them down  does he say how he is feeling questioned sam as his brother paused in the reading of the letter  yes he says he is about the same but that uncle randolph is very much upset over the loss of his chickens and wants to know if they hadnt better pay the money demanded  oh i hope they dont pay a cent cried tom  so do i added sam but i dont want to see them blown up either he continued seriously  none of us want that said dick but id not give them a centid be blown up a dozen times before id do it he continued firmly  do they want us home asked tom  no dad says it will do no good for us to come home he says he will write or telegraph if anything new develops he thinks with the extra watchmen on guard and the detectives at work crabtree and sobber will get scared and leave them alone  i hope they do said sam he heaved a deep sigh gracious it seems to me that no sooner are we out of one trouble than we get into another  that is true  its too badto have this piled on poor dad when hes so worried about that business affair  well you know the old saying troubles never come singly answered the older brother  after that the three boys watched the mails anxiously for over a week then came another letter from their father in which he stated that nothing new had developed then came another waituntil the day after that set by crabtree and sobber for the delivery of the fifty thousand dollarswhen dick got a telegram as follows       all quiet received another letter to which i have paid no      attention feel almost sure the rascals have left this part      of the country all fairly well  well thats some comfort was toms comment i hope they have gone away and that we never see or hear of them again  dont comfort yourself that way tom answered dick they are bound to show their hand again sooner or later we wont be safe from them until they are in jail     chapter xx  graces revelation   one clear afternoon the three rover boys decided to take a run up to hope seminary in the dartaway there was very little wind and although it was growing colder they knew they could easily bundle up in their aviation coats and boots sam and tom had been trying out the biplane and they pronounced everything in perfect order for a flight  dick let me run the machine over said sam and the big brother agreed for tom had been at the wheel on a previous occasion  the boys had no classes to attend after lunch and so got away by two oclock  i trust we can see the girls said dick as they started up the engine of the flying machine  oh theyll be at liberty after hours answered tom they always are  previous to leaving the boys had filled the oil feed and the gasoline tank so they were prepared for quite a trip  maybe we can get the girls to go up for just a little sail you know said sam i am sure the dartaway could carry them on a pinch  where would they sit in our laps asked tom with a grin  no they could sit in the seats and we could sit back of them like on a bobsled answered the youngest rover  i dont think theyll care to go up answered dick theyd be too scared as yet flying machines are hardly built for ladies but i think the time will come when they will use them  as they were in no hurry the boys took their time in sailing over the farms and country roads they did not go up very high and often saw farmers and others staring at them shouting things they could not catch  by and by flying machines will be as common as autos remarked dick but now the sight of one is a great curiosity to these folks  sam handled the machine like a veteran and even showed what he could do by making a small figure eight and a spiral dip  i wish we had a little monoplane just for one he said my couldnt a fellow scoot around then  sams got the flying bee all right cried tom  well wouldnt you like it yourself demanded the youngest rover  id rather have a big airship then i could give all my friends a ridehave a regular airship party  well id like that too was sams reply  presently they came in sight of the seminary buildings they circled around for some time and then landed at the far end of the campus a few girls were in sight but not those they had come to visit  good afternoon said dick to a girl he had met named ida strong can you tell me where i can find miss stanhope or the misses laning  the three of them went for a walk about half an hour ago replied ida strong  do you know where they went  i do not excepting that they took the road to beechwood and the girl student pointed out the highway mentioned one that ran through the big woods back of the seminary it led to the village of beechwood which was several miles beyond  thank you returned dick if we shouldnt meet them will you tell them we called in our biplane  i will said the girl  dick was about to rejoin his brothers and suggest that they go up and fly along over the woods road when another girl named bess haven came running up  oh mr rover isnt this queer she cried i thought you were hurt  hurt repeated dick puzzled how so  why dora stanhope said you werethat you had had a fall out of the flying machine  that i fell out of the machine cried dick there is some mistake here i have had no fall when did she tell you that  about half an hour ago she got some sort of a message and she was terribly upset she went off to visit you  where to  i dont know but waityes she did say you had had a fall in the woods  did she go alone and now dicks heart began to thump strangely he was thinking of their many enemies was this some new trick  no nellie and grace laning her cousins went with her  dick turned to ida strong  you saw them go  yes just as i told you oh mr rover is anything wrong  i dont knowi hope not but i think we had better go after them at once good day and dick fairly ran back to where tom and sam rested near the biplane  start her up quick he said to his brothers in a low voice something is wrong weve got to get after the girls right away  what is it demanded tom leaping to his feet while sam did the same  ill tell you when we are on the way quick start the propellers ill take the wheel and dick sprang into the seat  in another moment the engine had been started and with a rush and a whizz the dartaway left the campus dick made a turn then headed in the direction of the road through the woods he flew low and rather slowly  keep your eyes open he cautioned for any sight of the girlsor any sight of our enemies and then he related as much as he knew of what had occurred  do you think somebody sent that message to decoy dora away from the seminary dick asked sam  doesnt it look that way why should anybody send word that i was hurt when i wasnt  i think you are right declared tom i think i can see through it he went on quickly they found out they couldnt dynamite dad or uncle randolph into giving up that money and they couldnt get at mrs stanhope or mrs laning to get it so now they are going to see what they can do through doraand maybe nellie and grace  thats exactly the way i figure it exclaimed dick and the sooner we reach the girls the better for all we know it may even now be too late  oh let us hope not cried sam  did they go on foot asked tom  yes  were they to meet anybody  i dont know miss haven said they went off in a great hurrywhich was natural if they thought i had tumbled out of the biplane and been hurt i suppose poor dora was scared half to death and dick heaved a long sigh  as the flying machine swept along over the woods and the roadway the three youths kept their eyes on the alert for a sight of the girls for a long time they saw nothing out of the ordinary then sam uttered a cry  see see there is grace she is waving her handkerchief at us  all looked in the direction indicated and at a spot along the road where there was quite a cleared space they saw grace laning standing on a flat rock waving frantically at them they had to make a circle and then with care dick brought the biplane down into the roadway  what is it grace yelled sam as he leaped from his seat where are the others  oh sam moaned the girl and then they saw that her hair was awry and her shoes were covered with dust oh save them go after them at once and then she staggered forward and fainted in sams arms  the three rovers were greatly alarmed and for the moment did not know what to do then dick rushed to the side of the roadway where some water trickled along in a hollow and brought some using a collapsible cup they carried when on a trip with this they bathed graces face and they forced a little water into her mouth and soon she opened her eyes and stared around her  go away go away dont touch me she gasped  hush grace you are safe answered sam gently  oh sam i forgot she struggled to her feet he still supporting her diddid you find them did you bring them back she asked wildly  you mean dora and nellie asked dick and tom in a breath  yes yes  we dont know where they are tell us about it went on dick  oh its terrible cried grace and now the tears began to course down her cheeks we got a noteat least dora didstating you had had a fall from the biplane and were hurt the note was signed tom and we of course thought tom had sent it it said to keep the matter quiet but to come without delaydown this road to the old white cottage so the three of us started off as soon as we could dora was so afraid it was serious she ran nearly all the way and nellie and i ran too we had thought you were at the cottage but when we got there we didnt see anybody while we hunted around a big touring car one of the kind with a closed coach top dashed up there was a man running the car and another man inside a fellow who looked like a doctor the driver asked if we were the girls who had come to see dick rover the aviator and we said yes then he said the car had been sent for us and for the doctor and for us to get in and he would take us to dick rover at once we got in and then before we knew it the touring car was rushing along the road at a great rate of speed we asked the doctor about you dick but he said he hadnt seen you yet then we asked the driver but he acted so queer we began to get suspicious then oh wasnt it strange nellie saw a card on the floor of the car and picked it up and it was josiah crabtrees visiting card she showed it to dora and i and dora screamed and wanted to leap out of the car but the doctorif he was a doctorheld her and held nellie too but i was too much for him i dont know how i did it but just as we were rounding a curve rather slowly i flung myself out of the door and i landed in some bushes i got scratched a little as you can see but i wasnt hurt and i started to run back to the seminary and was doing that when i saw your flying machine you know the rest and now grace stopped too exhausted to say another word  and the touring car went on queried dick  yes yes i saw the man shut the door too oh dick they have carried poor nellie and dora off just as they carried doras mother off  they kept to this road  i believe so i dont know of any cross road this side of beechwood  then well get after them at once declared dick sam do you want to take grace back or come with us  wellier  go with them samthey may need you broke in the girl quickly i can go back alone and ill send word to the authorities over the telephone hurry hurry or it will be too late  the boys needed no further urging dick and tom ran for the flying machine and soon the explosions of the motor filled the crisp autumn air then all the boys leaped on board dick was at the wheel and he sent the dartaway along at a good rate of speed sam looked back to see grace hurrying in the direction of hope seminary  i hope she gets back safely he said anxiously  i think she will answered tom those rascals are all further along the roadwaiting for nellie and dora  keep your eyes open put in dick dont let anything escape you we must spot that auto without fail     chapter xxi  following dora and nellie   the nerves of the rover boys were on edge dick and tom were particularly anxious for those who had been thus rudely carried off were very dear to them  i wonder who that socalled doctor was mused sam as the dartaway sailed along keeping over the road as well as the windings through the dense woods permitted  most likely some tool of crabtree or sobber or both answered tom  do you think koswell and larkspur are in this game  perhaps they are cried dick it would be just like them to join forces with crabtree and sobber they are down and out and need money and all of them would expect to get a big stake out of this  then you think they carried the girls off for money questioned tom  i do tom you hit the truth when you said they found out they couldnt do anything at the farm and couldnt reach mrs stanhope and mrs laning the only things left were to try to reach us or the girls  and they didnt dare tackle us put in sam  do you suppose that mrs sobber is in this continued tom referring to a relative of tad sobber who had assisted once in the carrying off of mrs stanhope  she may be although she was pretty well scared that other time replied his older brother  the boys relapsed into silence each busy with his own thoughts all were anxious to catch a glimpse of the enclosed touring car but they came within sight of the village of beechwood without encountering a turnout of any sort  ill land here and make some inquiries said dick  yes if the auto went through here somebody must have seen it said tom  a landing was made directly on the village green in front of the postoffice and a small crowd quickly collected  its them young fellers from brill cried one of the villagers i heard tell they had an airship  that aint no airship its an aryplane said another they dont lift up like no balloonthey sail like a bird on them canvas wings  wot makes the thing go job  them wooden things they go round like windmills  say we want some information and we want it quick cried dick have any of you seen a big auto go through here an enclosed autoone with a coachlike body  sure we did cried one of the villagers by heck the thing nearly killed si levering it did si was crossin the road when whizz bang shoo that auto went past him like a streak o greased lightnin si jumped back an sit hisself down in the waterin trough an got hisself all wet  which way did the auto go went on dick  right straight ahead  no it didnt nuther put in a farmer who had just arrived in the village it took the road to shepleytowni see it  which is that questioned tom  you go up this road about a mile an then take the cross road to the left you cant miss it cause theres a big tree on the corner that was struck by lightnin  all right well go to the corner that was struck by lightning said tom who could not help joking even in that moment of anxiety  i didnt say the corner was struckit was the tree explained the farmer soberly  all right much obliged answered tom and then the three boys started up the engine once more the villagers had crowded around but as those explosions rent the air several leaped back and then the whole crowd ran for their lives  shes goin up one yelled  is the engine goin to bust asked another  look out jim or shell mow ye down like a mowin machine  clear the track cried sam and then with the usual rush and roar the dartaway leaped over the village green and arose in the air leaving the gaping and wondering crowd behind  it was an easy run up to the blasted tree and sighting this dick headed the biplane along the road that led to shepleytown  how far is that place asked sam  i think it is about six or seven miles answered tom i was there once on a bicyclewent after nuts with stanley and songbird  what to the town questioned sam with a grin  no the woods back of the town sam say thats one on meas bad as that countrymans struckbylightning corner and tom grinned too  on and on swept the flying machine the boys watching every rod of the winding road below once tom gave a cry as they saw a turnout at a distance but it proved to be nothing but a tinware peddlers wagon on the ground lay various pieces of tinware scattering over a distance of fifty feet  look at that cried sam he must have had an accident  say maybe that auto struck his wagon exclaimed tom  it looks that way was dicks comment  shall we land and question him  whats the use we know the machine came this way thats enough for the present we dont want to lose a minute more than is necessary  say we were chumps that we didnt telephone ahead from beechwood cried sam we might have had that auto stopped when it went through shepleytown  it couldnt be done for there is no line from beechwood to shepleytown answered dick the line only runs the other way  the route was now over a dense woods and the boys had to sail slowly for fear of passing the automobile while the latter was running under the overhanging trees once they saw something that looked like an automobile and dick had to sail in a circle and come back to make sure but it proved to be only a twoseated carriage and they passed on  shepleytown proved to be quite a place with a main street containing a dozen stores it connected by stage with chaplet which was a railroad center five miles away  the coming of the boys created as much of a sensation as had their arrival at beechwood and once more the biplane was surrounded  sure i saw that mobile you are after said one man in answer to their questions it was running putty lively an no mistake it went past the mill an took the old snagtown road queer too cause that road aint half as good as the chaplet turnpike  did you see who was in the auto queried dick  i think a couple o men an some girls i couldnt see very well the machine run so fast i had to hold my hoss for i was afraid theyd run into me  several others had also seen the big enclosed touring car and all were sure it had taken to the old snagtown road  where does that road run to asked dick  goes over the hills to what used to be snagtown answered one of the men but there aint no town now since the mills closed downonly empty houses  just the place theyd be likely to head for cried tom in a low voice to his brothers come on hurry up  sam and dick needed no urging and having thanked the men for their information they started up the engine once more  how far is it to that deserted village called out tom as the dartaway was about to move off  six miles shouted one of the crowd that is by the road the way youre going it aint moren four and this answer made the crowd laugh  four miles murmured dick we ought to be able to head them off  i wish we were armed came from tom we may have some desperate characters to deal with  we might go back and get pistols suggested sam  dick thought for a moment he knew well how desperate their enemies might become he hated to lose the time but he realized it would be worse than useless to face a gang of four or more emptyhanded there was no telling what sobber crabtree and the others might do if cornered  i guess wed better go back and arm ourselves he said it will create talk but that cant be helped  it will create talk anyway as soon as it is known that dora and nellie have been carried off answered tom  what do you care for the talk cried sam what we want to do is to save the girlsand put those rascals where they belong in jail  then the biplane was turned back in a circle and soon the boys were back in shepleytown much to the astonishment of those who had but a few moments before seen them leave     chapter xxii  over the big woods   is there a hardware store handy asked dick of the first man who came up he had told his brothers to let him do the talking  surebill simmonss place just down the street answered the man pointing with his finger  thank you tom bring that fivegallon gasoline can with you sam you mind the machine went on dick loudly  all right answered the brothers and tom got the can in question and he and dick started for the store  humph got to have gasoline to run em eh said one of the men to sam  yes indeed answered the youngest rover  well bill simmons can give ye all ye want pervidin ye pay for it chuckled the man he keeps gasoline fer auto fellers an fer farmers as has gasoline engines  dick and tom hurried to the hardware store and asked the proprietor about gasoline while he was filling the can they looked at an assortment of pistols that were exhibited in a showcase  they look pretty good said dick when the hardware man came towards them  are good too wouldnt you like to buy a good shooter he added anxious to do business  show me a really good fiveshooter said dick and several were quickly handed over he selected one and tom selected another  have to get one for sam too whispered tom  sure replied his brother and this was done and they also purchased the necessary cartridges  now you are well armedif anybody tries to steal your airship said bill simmons  we dont want the machine stolen or tampered with answered dick we cant afford to take chances if a fellow tampered with our machine it might go wrong when it was in the air and wed get our necks broken and then dick and tom hurried back to the dartaway carrying the can of gasoline between them the can was fastened where it belongedfor the regular tank had still plenty of gasoline in itand then the boys sailed away once more over the winding road leading to snagtown  thats a dandy revolver exclaimed sam on receiving one of the weapons with some cartridges and loaded too now i guess we are ready for those rascals he added with satisfaction  remember we are not to use any firearms unless it becomes absolutely necessary said dick firmly  yes but i am not going to give them a chance to down me and get away with nellie cried tom stoutly  oh no tom well not allow that returned his big brother with equal firmness  it seems to be getting a bit cloudy said sam a minute later wonder if it will rain  i dont think that is rain sam answered dick its worse than that for us  you mean wind  yes  dick was right and presently the first puff of the coming breeze hit the dartaway and sent the aircraft up on a slant dick promptly moved the tips and one of the rudders and the flying machine came along on a level but from then on the oldest rover boy had all he could do to keep to the course for the breeze became stronger and stronger  its too bad murmured tom as he clung to his seat hang the luck why couldnt that wind have kept off for an hour longer  you fellows keep your eyes on the road sang out dick ive got to give all my attention to the biplane  all right was the answer of the others  after that but little was said for dick had to watch every movement of the dartaway with care and his hands and feet were constantly on the alert to make whatever shift seemed necessary sam and tom strained their eyes to catch sight of the enclosed touring car which they had learned was painted a dark blue  the wind kept growing stronger and stronger coming in fitful gusts that were particularly bad for such a flying machine as the boys possessed once came a gust that sent them spinning far out of their course  phew this is getting pretty wild gasped sam dick can you manage her  not if it gets any worse was the grim answer  dont take too much of a chance put in tom we dont want to get wrecked in this wilderness  his reference to a wilderness was not without reason for below them stretched a series of hills and valleys covered with stunted trees and clumps of brushwood not a house was in sight  this is what youd call lonesomehurst murmured sam  do you see any place where we can land was dicks question a little later after he had battled with another angry gust and then run through a particularly trying soft spot  nothing around here answered tom  i see something of a clearing over to the left came from sam i dont know what it amounts to though its too far off  well look at it said dick in a low voice  he had to fairly battle his way along so fierce were the gusts of wind he made something of an oval and presently found himself over a spot covered with grass and low bushes then came another gust of wind and without waiting longer he shut off the engine and the dartaway came down with a bump that threatened to break the wheels on which it rested they swept through the bushes and then tilted up beside several small trees  hold her down shouted dick tie her fast before the wind turns her over  all set to work and not without great difficulty they managed to run the biplane directly between several trees and some clumps of bushes  fasten every rope well sang out dick unless i miss my guess this is going to be a corker of a blow  i dont think it will be as bad as it was during that hailstorm answered tom but it is bad enough  the ropes were all well secured and then the boys breathed easier down on the ground the wind did not appear to be so powerful and they felt that unless it increased greatly the dartaway way would be safe in her berth among the trees and bushes  well whats the next move questioned sam after they had rested for a moment from their labors  i hardly know what to say answered his eldest brother we can hardly follow that auto on foot  the worst of it is it will be growing dark before long put in tom what are we going to do then i thought wed catch up to that auto long before this  they talked the matter over but could arrive at no satisfactory conclusion  im almost sorry we came down said dick we might have gotten throughalthough the wind is worse than it was  no we couldnt do anything in this windwed simply wreck the dartaway said sam but come on lets go as far as we can we can come back for the biplane any time  while under such a strain of mind the boys could not remain quiet and so they set off through the woods in the direction of the road it was hard walking and several times they had to literally force their way through the brushwood then they came to a swamp and had to make a detour for fear of getting stuck in the mud when they at last reached the road they were wellnigh exhausted  ill have to rest just a minute panted sam say that was something fierce wasnt it and he sank on a rock  listen i think i hear somebody coming cried dick  all strained their ears and presently made out the sounds of a farm wagon moving slowly over the rocky roadway that was hidden by the trees then the turnout came into view loaded with freshlycut cord wood and drawn by a pair of bony white horses on the seat of the wagon sat an aged colored man talking volubly to his team  hello there uncle cried dick as the wagon came closer stop a minute i want to talk to you  what youall wants demanded the colored man nervously for the spot was a particularly lonely one  did you come from the direction of snagtown went on dick  dats wot i did sah  did you see anything of a big automobile going that way one with a coach top  at this question the aged colored man blinked his eyes and shifted uneasily he glanced back over his load of wood  ii aint got nuffin to say boss i aint got nuffin to say he answered finally and prepared to drive on  oh yes you have got something to sayand you are going to say it cried dick and he ran forward in front of the horses and caught hold of one by the bit     chapter xxiii  at close quarters   say you dun let my hosses alone cried the colored man in fright  dont you dare to drive away until you have answered our questions returned dick firmly  ii dont want to git in no trouble bossdeed i dont wailed the driver of the farm wagon  well you answer our questions and tell us the strict truth  ii didnt do nuffin give youall my word i didnt  but you saw the auto with the men and the girls in it cried dick sharply  yeas sah ii did sah was the stammeredout reply  where did you see them  down in snagtown sah  what were the folks in the auto doing  da was awaitin fo one of de men to fix up de wheel de rubber on de wheel dun got busted  i see and what were the men in the auto and the girls doing went on dick quickly  say boss i dont want no trouble deed i dont i didnt do nuffin i jess looked at em dats all an dat one man he said hed mak me suffer if i opened my mouf bout wot i saw explained the aged colored man in a trembling voice ise an honest hardworkin man i is i works fo massah sheldon fo sixteen years now an hell dun tole yoall ise honest an  all right i believe you are honest answered dick in a kindlier tone but those men are rascals and we want to catch them they carried those two girls off against their will  dats wot i was suspicioned of boss fo de young ladies was acryin hard an wanted to git out an de men wouldnt let em i wanted to do sumfing fo em but the men tole me go mind my own business or git my haid busted so i drove on  how many men were there  three men sides de man wot was amendin de busted wheel  the doctor and crabtree and sobber murmured tom  or koswell and larkspur added sam  how far away from here is that place went on dick  about a mile an a half sah but the road am putty stony an rough sah  can a fellow ride horseback on those horses  yo might sah if yo had a saddle but da aint no saddle is yoall thinkin of goin  well take those horses cut in dick shortly now dont worry well pay you well for using them and see that they come back safely we have got to save those two girls and well put those men in prison if we can  the old colored man was so amazed that he was all but bewildered he did not want to let the horses go but the boys gave him no choice in the matter they unharnessed the steeds and took the blankets on the wagon seat for saddles  sam i guess tom and i had better go on ahead said dick you can follow on foot if you want to and you can come too if you wish he added to the colored man  say aint you afraid ob gitting shot or sumfing like dat asked the driver of the wagon  maybe we can do a little shooting ourselves answered dick grimly  is yoall armed  we are  den ill follow on foot wid dis young genmen said the colored man he was afraid that if he did not follow he would not get the team back  once on horseback dick and tom did not linger along the rough hill road they sped urging the bony steeds along as best they could fortunately there were no side trails to bewilder them  i hope we get there in time remarked tom as they proceeded  so do i answered dick if they had a blowout it may take that chauffeur quite some time to put on a new inner tube and a shoe  if he had only busted his engine murmured tom  the way now became so rough that they had all they could do to keep on the horses and they wondered at the men in the automobile traveling such a road  i suppose they came because its so lonely said dick they knew theyd be sure to meet more or less carriages and wagons on the turnpike and if the girls screamed they might be rescued  at last they topped a hill and could see on the top of the next hill a deserted house the first of the deserted village of snagtown this made them renew their efforts and soon they were struggling up the hill towards the house  hark burst out tom suddenly whats that  an engine exclaimed his brother they must have started up their auto  if thats the case the wheel must be mended  yes come on there is no time to lose  past the deserted house they rode and then around a turn where were located several other houses and barns then they came in sight of the deserted mill down in a hollow by a stream further still was a bridge and not far from this structure stood a big enclosed touring car painted dark blue  there it is theres the auto cried dick  and they are starting up added his brother hi stop stop you rascals he yelled  the horses clattered through the lonely street of the deserted village and the noise they made and the shouting made those in the automobile look back  two men on horseback cried one of the men  the rover boys dick and tom exclaimed another hurry up  its old crabtree cried dick as he saw the head of that individual thrust out of the touring car and tad sobber he added as a second head appeared  illustration just as the machine reached the other side the bridge went down with a crashpage 228  stop stop you rascals continued tom dont you dare to go another step  save us save us came in girlish voices from the interior of the touring car oh dick oh tom save us  hurry upstart her up screamed tad sobber frantically to the chauffeur put on all power  the driver was already in his seat and the motor was humming loudly he threw in the low gear and off the touring car started slowly after it clattered dick and tom still a hundred feet in the rear  let me get out screamed dora oh let me get out  yes yes pleaded nellie please let us get out  stop your noise and sit still commanded josiah crabtree and he and sobber and the third fellow forced the two girls back on the seat  dick and tom urged the horses forward with all speed but before they could reach the touring car the chauffeur threw in second speed and then quickly changed to high and away the automobile rattled over the rickety bridge the structure had not been built for such a weight and just as the machine reached the other side the bridge went down with a crash  look out yelled dick and the warning came none too soon for both he and tom were almost on the bridge they turned their horses just in time came to a sudden halt in some bushes and stared blankly at each other  gone cried tom hollowly oh what luck  quick your pistol tom cried dick suddenly  but the girls began the other  dont shoot at the car shoot at the tires explained dick and then he whipped out his own weapon got into range and began to blaze away  each of the boys fired three shots one hit the back lamp of the automobile smashing the red glass and another hit the differential case and glanced off but the wheels remained untouched and in a few seconds the big touring car was out of sight around a bend the lads heard a scream from the two girls and then all that reached their strained ears was the sound of the motor growing fainter and fainter until it died out altogether  dick and tom felt sick at heart they had been so near to rescuing the girls and now they seemed as far off as ever each heaved a deep sigh  i suppose we cant follow them with the bridge down said tom  we might ford the stream said dick but what would be the use of trying to follow on horseback they know we are after them and they will put on all the speed possible  well whats to do next dick  i dont know  im not going to sit still and do nothing  neither am i tom but what to do next i really dont know     chapter xxiv  at the swamp   where are they didnt you catch up to them who fired those shots  it was sam who shouted the words as he came up on a run followed by the aged negro  they got away answered dick bitterly we were just a minute too late  cant you go after them  not on horseback sam  and if the horses were all right look there cried tom and pointed to the fallen bridge  down what did it the auto  yes  fo de lan sake burst out the negro farm hand de bridge hab gone bust down say how is weall to git ober dat stream after dis  i give it up said tom the authorities will have to rebuild it i guess  nobudy aint gwine to do dat boss kase why kase dis road was built fo de mill an de people wot lived heah now de mill aint runnin an de people moved away da aint much use fo the road an nobuddy aint gwine to put up de bridgean ike henry dats me has got to tote things round by de udder road after dis he added ruefully  well we cant bother about the bridge replied dick the authorities can fight it out with those fellows who are running the auto  but the shots queried sam he had dropped on a flat rock to rest  we tried to hit the tiresbut we failed explained tom the auto was moving too fast and the trees and bushes were in the way besides we didnt want to hit the girls  dick and tom walked down to the stream it was not very deep and they concluded that they could easily get to the other side by leaping from one bit of wreckage to anotherthus keeping from getting wetfor at that season of the year the water was decidedly cold  let us go over and climb to the top of the next hill said dick we may be able to see which direction the auto takes  the others were willing and telling the colored man to wait a while for them and promising him good pay they climbed over the sunken bridge to the other shore of the stream then they raced along the rocky road around a bend and up a steep hill that all but winded them  i see the machine cried tom who was the first to top the rise look and he pointed with his hand down in the valley that lay stretched out before them like a map in the gathering darkness  at a great distance moving at a fair rate of speed was the enclosed touring car containing dora and nellie and their abductors it was headed for a distant main road lined here and there with farmhouses and outbuildings presently it turned into this mainroad and started westward at an increased rate of speed  my see them streak along murmured sam  they are evidently going to put as much distance as they can between themselves and us returned tom  say do you see any telephone wires asked dick anxiously  not a wire came from his brothers after a long look for lines and poles  neither do i i guess they havent any connections at those farmhouses so it will be useless to walk there  but what shall we do dick asked tom impatiently we cant sit still and do nothing  well go back to the dartaway and fly after them  but the wind began sam  it has gone down a little i think sam and anyway weve got to take a chanceits the only thing left if you dont want to go  dick stop right there if you go ill go cried the youngest rover firmly im as much interested in this as anybody even though grace isnt there he added with a show of color in his round cheeks  but little more was said just then the three boys ran down the hill to the stream and crawled back over the wreckage  i guess those horses can carry the lot of us said dick and so it was arranged dick and sam getting on the back of one steed and tom and ike henry on the other the boys asked the colored man about telephone connections but he could give them little information excepting to state that his employer had no such convenience  at last the boys reached the spot where they had come out of the woods after leaving the dartaway and skirting the swamp  have you a lantern on the wagon asked dick of ike henry  yes sah  then well have to buy or borrow it my man supposing i give you two dollars for the use of the horses and another dollar for the lantern how will that strike you  dats all right boss answered ike henry who remembered that the lantern had cost but seventyfive cents  dick passed over the bills and received the lantern which was filled with oil and also a box of matches which ike henry chanced to carry  wot youall gwine to do now asked the colored man as he prepared to hitch up his team again  we are going back into the woods where we left our flying machine answered tom  youall be careful dat yo dont git in de swamp dat am a terribul bad spot  well be careful  tell me where does that mainroad on the other side of the river run to put in dick  dat road queried ike henry dat way or dat way and he motioned first to the east and then to the west  i mean to the westward  why dats de way to git to sherodburg an fremville  do you know how far those places are  sherodburg am bout eight miles fremville am bout twenty or moah  all right come on boys said dick good night ike  good night sah much erbliged cried the aged colored man hope yoall dun catch dem rascals he added earnestly  well do our best answered tom  in a few seconds more the rover boys had plunged into the woods here it was quite dark and dick took the lead holding the lantern close to the ground so that he might follow the trail he and his brothers had made on leaving the dartaway all were gratified to find that the wind had died down completely  i dont know how a run in the darkness will go said dick but we can try it but i dont see how we are to steer  ive got my pocket compass with me answered sam that may help some we know those towns are west of us we can sail along until we see the lights and then go down and ask about the touring car  a good idea sam  skirting the swamp with only the rays from the lantern to aid them was no easy task and once tom slipped from a clump of rushes and went down over his ankles in soft mud  hi hi help me out he yelled quick before i get in any deeper  stand still called back dick and placed the lantern in another clump of rushes then he caught hold of a tree that was handy and took a grip on sams hand now catch hold of tom he went on and the youngest rover did so then came a long and strong pull and with a sucking sound poor tom came out of the sticky mud and landed beside his brothers  wow thats a mess said the funloving rover as he surveyed his feet plastered thick with the mud  stick to the dry ground after this advised dick come on the dead leaves will soon brush that mud off and forward he went once more holding the lantern as before in a little while after this the swamp was left behind and then progress through the woods was more agreeable  dick dont you think we ought to be getting to the dartaway pretty soon asked tom after a quarter of an hour more had passed and they were still moving forward  yes  it didnt seem so far away as this put in sam are you sure you are following the trail  you can see for yourselves answered dick and held the lantern close to the ground  footsteps sure enough murmured tom then of a sudden he bent closer but look he cried they are not ours  what exclaimed his two brothers in surprise  these footprints are not oursthey are altogether too big we have picked up and are following the wrong trail     chapter xxv  the trail of the touring car   all started in astonishment at the footprints before them what tom had said was truethe prints were altogether too large to have been made by their own feet in walking through the woods  how could i have made such a mistake murmured dick  i wonder where you got mixed up said sam i looked at the prints down by the swamp they seemed to be o k there  then that is where i must have gotten mixed upmaybe after we pulled tom from the mud  well have to go back came from tom too bad but it cant be helped i dont blame you dick he added hastily  neither do i put in sam anybody might make such a mistake with nothing but that smoky lantern to guide him  they turned back and after a while reached the edge of the swamp here after a long search they found their own footprints  now we are all right cried sam come on  yes and let us be careful that we dont make another mistake added tom  i dont know about this said dick hesitatingly somehow it doesnt look altogether right to me  why not queried his two brothers  it doesnt seem to be the right direction but they are our footprints so we may as well follow them  they went on and proceeded for several hundred feet in silence then tom uttered a cry of dismay  well this beats the dutch he gasped  whats wrong now asked dick  do you know what we are doing we are heading for the road again instead of for the place where we left the dartaway  tom gasped sam are you sure  i am see that fallen tree we are about half way between the road and the swamp  yes i remember the tree and you are right said dick this is too bad and when we are in such a hurry too his voice had a note of despair in it  well keep to this trail now said sam dont miss itonly follow it backwards  once more the three rover boys turned and now they scanned every foot of the trail with care again they passed the swamp and there discovered how they had made a false turn then they hurried forward under the trees and through the bushes  the darkness of night had closed in all around them and the only light was that of the smoky lantern and from the few stars that shone down through the tree tops everything was silent excepting for the occasional note of a tree toad or the glunk of a frog in the swamp  we ought to be there by now said sam a few minutes later  there she is cried dick swinging the lamp up over his head and in the widening circle of light the three youths beheld the biplane resting exactly as they had left the craft  thank goodness cried tom i was beginning to think we had made another mistake  they hung the lantern on a tree limb and then lit the lights attached to the biplane for they had insisted that the dartaway be supplied with thesenot for the purpose of flying at night but so that the machine could be lit up in the dark if it rested in the road or in some other place where some person or vehicle might run into it  it was an easy task to bring the biplane out into the opening in the woods and this done the boys took a general view of the situation so that they might get their bearings then all but one lantern were extinguished and the engine was started up and they got aboard the craft dick taking the wheel  now sam it is up to you to give me the points of the compass said dick and tom you keep your eyes open for the lights of sherodburg and fremville  into the sky with its twinkling stars swept the dartaway and sam gave the direction to be taken by consulting the tiny pocket compass he carried of course these directions were crude but they were better than nothing and soon tom cried out that he could make out the lights of a settlement in the dim distance  that must be sherodburg said dick  why stop there asked tom i dont think the touring car did more than likely they streaked through for all they were worth why not go on straight to fremville that is a much larger town and well be sure to find a telephone there or a telegraph office  just what i was thinking replied his big brother  they swept over sherodburg five minutes later dipping down so low that they could see every house and every store they looked along the main street for the touring car but only carriages and farm wagons were in view  i wish we had a searchlight said dick with a sigh if we had one we could easily keep that highway in view all the way to fremville  well we havent one so well have to make out without it answered tom fly as low as you can and well try to keep the highway in sight most of the farmhouses have lights in em and that will help a little  dick flew as low as seemed advisable and by straining their eyes the boys managed to make out the winding road lined on either side with farms and patches of woods occasionally they swept over small collections of houseshamlets located between the town they had left behind and the one they were approaching  the breeze had died down utterly so dick had little trouble in manipulating the biplane he sent the dartaway onward at a good rate of speed the engine making a noise like a battery of gatling guns more than likely many a farmer and his family were astonished at the sounds and wondered what they meant if any saw the biplane the rovers did not know it  i guess we are coming up to fremville now said sam when the distant lights of a town showed on the horizon well have to look for some safe place to land and that is not so easy in the darkness  dick slowed down the motor as they drew closer to the town which was composed of several streets of stores half a dozen churches some schools and a hundred or more houses he made a circle and then seeing a level field back of some of the houses headed for it and shut off the engine they landed without anybody seeing them do it  tom i think you had better watch the machine while sam and i make some inquiries said dick as he alighted  oh dont you think i had better go too asked tom anxiously  we cant leave the dartaway alone  at that moment a man came out of the darkness attracted by the voices he was surprised to see the biplane he told the lads that his house was close by and wanted to know what they were doing  we are on the trail of a big enclosed touring car that came this way answered dick did you see anything of it  say that must be the machine jim hickey told about cried the man jim said it went tearin through like mad about half an hour ago  which way was it headed asked tom eagerly  i dont knowi didnt ask jim could tell you  where is he  jim why he keeps the barber shop down on the corner of main street and lumber alley  do you know if he is at his barber shop now asked dick  he must behe was going there when he saw the auto  the boys waited no longer but asking the man to look after the dartaway during their absence they hurried to the main street of the town and then to the barber shop in question jim hickey was busy shaving a customer but he was willing to suspend operations long enough to answer the rover boys  did i see the car he cried if i hadnt id be a dead man this minit he cried she was going some she was  which way did the car go asked all the boys  down main street to the bridge and then turned around the church corner  where does that road lead to asked tom  leads to plankville and bulltown  yes but they cant git through on that road put in the customer wiping the lather from around his mouth so he could talk the bridge is shut offtheyre fixin itwent at the work this morning  you are sure about that queried dick eagerly  sure i saw em takin up the plankin of the bridge they will have to come back  how far is that bridge from here  about three miles  is there any other side road put in sam  none that would be good enough for an auto the north road is all sand an mud  come on cried dick to his brothers i think weve cornered them come on and he rushed from the barber shop and sam and tom followed leaving the barber and his customer staring after them in astonishment     chapter xxvi  the moonlit trail   once in the street the three rover boys halted and looked at each other the same thought was in the mind of each should they follow the touring car on foot or go back for the airship  well get the dartaway cried dick we can follow them so much more quickly that way  at top speed they raced for the spot where they had left the biplane they found the strange man on guard smoking his pipe  we saw the barber said dick and now we are going after that touring car and the fellows in it much obliged for looking after the biplane and he handed the man a silver half dollar  thank you said the man want to catch em eh  yes they are rascals who ought to be in jail answered tom and then before the man could ask any more questions the boys started up the engine and propellers and swept into the air once more  the late moon had come up and this light added to that of the stars made it possible for them to keep the road well in view over the town they swept and then over the church near the bridge then they commenced to follow the road leading to plankville and bulltown  it must be confessed that all of the youths were deeply excited and tom and sam looked to their pistols to make certain that the weapons were ready for use they felt that the rascals who had abducted dora and nellie in such a highhanded fashion would not give in without a struggle  as they went on dick slowed down the engine and ran closer and closer to the road  there is a sign and a big plank closing the road cried tom presently and there is the bridge just ahead  scarcely had he spoken when dick shut off the engine entirely and volplaned to the broad roadway and only a short distance from the bridge all looked around eagerly not a sign of a touring car could be seen  maybe they made a mistake commenced sam when dick who was examining the ground uttered a cry  here are the tracks of the rubber tires exclaimed the eldest rover boy see they pushed the plank aside and steered right for the bridge  but did they get over asked his brothers  i suppose so wait ill go over and see  lantern in hand dick crossed on the beams of the wooden bridge on the opposite side he saw the same tracks of the tires in the dust and dirt  yes they came over he shouted  but the planking came from tom  they must have thrown it into place to cross and then taken it up again so that they couldnt be followedthat is in a carriage or an auto or on horseback  yes but they cant stop a biplane cried sam eagerly and this must have taken time to do we must be close behind them  lets get right after em put in tom and all three ran once more for the dartaway and soon the quick explosions of the motor sounded on the night air  if the boys had been excited before they were more so now for they realized that the touring car at the best could be but a few miles away could they catch up to it before those running the machine had a chance to slip them in the darkness  they must have their lights lit said dick theyd not dare run without them look and see if you cant spot their headlights their taillight we smashed with a pistol shot  on and on swept the biplane as the late moon came up higher the way became brighter until they could distinguish the road below quite plainly but nothing like a touring car came into view  they must have had more time than we thought or else they ran mighty fast remarked dick after several miles had been covered  presently they saw two bright lights coming towards them down on the road at once dick shut off the power and allowed the biplane to come down in the centre of the highway then tom waved the lantern and at the same time all three lads took hold of their pistols  it was a runabout that was coming up an old affair carrying two men that looked like farmers  hello whats this a holdup cried one of the men by gum if it aint an airship he gasped as his machine came to a standstill in front of the dartaway  wed like some information said dick stepping forward and holding up the lantern we are looking for a big enclosed touring car that came this way did you meet it on the road  a tourin car no we didnt meet any kind o an auto  none at all  nary a one answered the second man  may i ask how far youve come went on dick  we came from plankville  how far is that  about six miles  are there any side roads between here and plankville  plenty of em but none good enough fer a car them that aint sand is mud an deep mud too this is the only road in these parts fit for autoing  you are sure that car didnt go through plankville it was a big enclosed car painted dark blue  i was sittin on the hotel stoop fer an hour before we came along an there wasnt nary a car went through  well that car was on this road said tom it must have gone somewhere  i dont see where it could go said the second man and shook his head slowly all the side roads is terrible in these parts  well we are much obliged for the information said dick wait well soon have our biplane out of the way and then he and his brothers wheeled it to one side so the runabout could pass  the men were curious to see the machine fly and remained while the boys started up the engine  what are you going to do next whispered sam  well take a look at the side roads replied dick maybe the touring car tried one of them and got stuck i hope it did  with a rush and a roar the dartaway sped down the highway and then arose in the air and as it did this the men in the runabout gave a cheer and clapped their hands then the rover boys continued their hunt  they kept close to the main road and did not fly any higher than was necessary whenever they reached a side road dick would make a circle coming back to the highway and going forward thus they kept on until they came in sight of plankville  hark cried sam as a distant bell tolled out ten oclock  only ten oclock murmured tom it seems like a week since we left brill  and we havent had supper yet went on the youngest rover  who wants any supper came from dick im sure i dont  not a mouthful until we rescue dora and nellie answered tom  id like a drinkim as dry as a herring said sam  well look for water when we go down again answered dick  presently they descended once more and as a brook was handy each drank his fill then dick turned back in the direction from which they had come  now what demanded tom  im going to find out where they went tom they didnt come this far i am sure of that  why  because i cant find their tracks in the road the tracks of the runabout are there and thats all they didnt come this far they stopped or branched off somewhere between here and that bridge the road men are repairing  why cant we search the road for tracks asked sam  just what i am going to do we can go down every half mile or so and look the ground over  this was done three times and twice they saw no tracks then they located them once more about half way between the bridge and plankville  perhaps we had better follow them up on foot for awhile suggested dick they arent in the roadway half a mile from here  well there are no side roads nearby returned tom and no houses or barns either he added searching the moonlit landscape  lantern in hand dick led the way the others following thus several hundred feet were covered then all came to a halt and stared at each other the tracks of the touring car led from the roadway directly into a big field backed up by what looked to be a dense woods  we are getting closer cried dick now to put the dartaway in a safe place and then well follow them on foot     chapter xxvii  the chauffeur of the touring car   let us run the biplane down the road a way and then into another field and down among the trees suggested tom no use of leaving it too near heresome of that gang might come and ruin it  toms advice was considered good and once more the three rover boys hurried to the dartaway as there was still no wind it was an easy matter to roll the machine along on its wheels they found a field where the fence was down and ran the biplane across this and in among some trees and bushes  are you going to take the lantern asked sam it seems to me it wont be wise to let them see us at first  ill take it along unlit answered his big brother it may come in handy later  let us get some clubs suggested tom they may come in handier than the pistols  right you are cried dick we dont want any shooting if it can be avoided  evidently you think they are close at hand remarked sam while they were cutting stout sticks from among the brushwood  they cant have gone so very far in that dense woods answered tom why the auto couldnt get through  at last the boys were ready to continue the search and stick and lantern in hand dick led the way with tom and sam close behind they had to bend close to the ground to make sure that they were following the tracks of the touring car  the trail led among the trees onto what was evidently a road used for hauling out timber following this for about a quarter of a mile the youths discovered a dark object resting near what looked to be the end of the road  its the auto whispered dick  anybody around questioned tom in an equally low voice  i dont know be careful and well see  with extreme caution the boys walked closer to the touring car and then all around it nobody was at hand and not a sound broke the silence of the night  deserted whispered sam where did they go to i wonder  hush returned dick they may be close enough to hear you  with strained ears the rover boys listened for some sound that might indicate the presence in that vicinity of those they were after but they heard nothing but the call of a night bird and the faroff hoot of an owl  they have gone on said dick at last well have to find the trail and follow maybe ill have to light the lantern  say let us fix the auto firstso they cant use it if they come back exclaimed tom  a good idea tom answered his big brother and as soon as dick had lighted the lantern tom and sam set to work to render the touring car unusable for the time being by turning off the flow of gasoline from the tank and disconnecting the spark plugs  that will keep em guessing for a while if they try to run it was sams comment  in the meantime dick was examining the ground and soon he found the mark of many footprints in the moss and leaves they led along a welldefined footpath running through the woods and up something of a hill  they went this way he said the fact is i dont see how they could go any otherthe brushwood is so thick  maybe theres a house back there suggested tom  i shouldnt be surprised that path must lead to somewhere  the boys had just started to move along the footpath when from out of the darkness came an unexpected hail  hello there who are you  the call came from ahead and at a turn of the trail the lads saw by the dim rays of the lantern the form of a man wearing a fur coat and an automobile cap  the driver of the car burst out dick  i say who are you called the man coming to a halt evidently he was coming back to take care of the automobile or run it away  hello yourself answered dick boldly what are you doing here this time of night  humph is that any of your business growled the man he was evidently a rough customer and not pleased at being thus surprised  i dont know perhaps answered dick drawing closer dont let him get away he whispered to his brothers  the boys made a rush forward raising their sticks as they did so and before the man could think of retreating they had him surrounded  say look here what does this mean demanded the fellow trying to put on a bold front although he was much disturbed  youll find out what it means before we are done with you cried tom hotly more than likely it means states prison for you  states prison the man shrank back whyeri havent done anything wrong  oh of course not returned dick sarcastically abducting two young ladies isnt wrong i suppose  i didnt abduct anybody growled the man somebody hired my car thats all i know now the job is done and im going about my business  not just yet said dick quietly but firmly tell me what have they done with the two young ladies  that aint my business commenced the chauffeur savagely you let me go or illoh  he stopped short and let out a yell of pain and fright he had tried to push dick out of his path the oldest rover boy had dropped the lantern and struck out fairly and squarely with his fist and the blow had landed on the mans jaw nearly taking him from his feet  now behave yourself and come along cried dick and caught the man by the arm dont let him escape he cried to his brothers use your sticks and your pistols too if it is necessary  the boys closed in and the sight of the sticks and the pistols frightened the chauffeur greatly he saw that he was trapped and that resistance might put him in a worse hole  i didnt do it he whined as the boys hurried him back towards the automobile i was hired for a certain job thats all the men said they had a right to carry the young ladies offthat one of em was the old mans stepdaughter and that both of em had run away from a girls school and wouldnt learn their lessons  and you mean to tell me that you believe such stuff snorted tom  well thats what they told me answered the man doggedly they hired the car first without telling me what sort of a job it was then they told me they wouldnt give me a cent if i didnt do what i was told to do im a poor man and  you tell it well but i dont believe a word of it interrupted dick you have committed a serious crime and the only way in which you can help yourself at all is by helping us  will you let me go if i help you demanded the chauffeur eagerly  well see about that later answered dick briefly for the present we intend to keep you a prisoner  a prisoner you havent any right  well take the right  thats the talk put in tom  by this time the party had reached the automobile as dick had surmised several straps and ropes lay in the box under the back seat and with these they bound the mans hands behind him once he started to resist but when tom raised his shining pistol he wilted  now you tell me where they took the young ladies said dick after the fellow had been strapped fast to his own automobile  they took em up to the house  what house  the old mansion back there on the hill  who was in the crowd  the old man and the old lady and the two young ladies and the three young men and the doctor  the old lady cried dick who was she what was her name  i think they called her sobber same as one of the young fellows they had her along to look after the girls  it must be the one from boston cried sam tads aunt or whatever she is  where did they pick her up asked dick  down at fremville she was waiting with one of the young men a chap they called koswell  are they all up at that old mansion now  i suppose so they were there when i left  who lives at the place  i dont knowi didnt see anybody     chapter xxviii  at the old mansion   after that the chauffeur became more communicative and in a few words told how he had been engaged by koswell and larkspur to do a certain job that they said might take the best part of the afternoon and night they had told him that a certain college professor at brill had a wayward stepdaughter and that the daughter and her school chum had grossly insulted a lady teacher and were in danger of being arrested the old professor wanted to get the two girls away and place them under the care of an old lady a distant relative who would know how to manage them he had been promised fifty dollars if he would do the work and say nothing about it to anybody he being informed that the old professor wanted to avoid all publicity and also wished to shield his stepdaughter  they told me first there were three girls went on the man and so there were but one got away somehow so then we took only the two  but you heard what the girls said didnt you asked dick sharply  i was paying attention to running my car mumbled the chauffeur  how about when i and my brother came after you on horseback why didnt you stop and find out what we wanted  the young fellow sobber said you were from the school where the young ladies attended and that maybe you wanted to arrest them they made me go on  that sounds pretty fishy to me returned dick still i wont condemn you until this whole thing is cleared up just now weve got to find those young ladies  going to leave me tied up cried the chauffeur  yes until we get back  that aint fair nohow  well fair or not thats the way it is going to be put in tom my own opinion is you are almost as guilty as anybody you didnt plan this thing but you were perfectly willing to do your share in carrying it out  the chauffeur begged and pleaded but the three boys would not listen to him all were eager to go on to ascertain what had become of dora and nellie they felt that the girls must be suffering intensely even though mrs sobber was with them  no use of taking the lantern we can easily find the way said dick id rather have the stick handy and my pistol  leaving the chauffeur grumbling roundly the three rover boys hurried along the woodland trail it made half a dozen turns the last around a spring of pure cold water which the tiredout lads could not resist each got a good drink and felt much refreshed all were too excited to notice their hunger even though they had not tasted a mouthful of food since the noon lunch  i see the house whispered sam presently and pointed ahead and his brothers nodded  set in a cleared space was an old stone mansion two stories high and with several wings the porch was badly rotted the chimney top gone and the whole structure showed signs of decay around the place was what had once been a wellkept flower garden now overrun with a tangle of dead flowers stalks and untrimmed rose bushes evidently no one had done any work around the place for several years  just the kind of a place those chaps would pick out whispered dick to his brothers they never suspected anybody would trace em i suppose they found out the old mansion was not being used and they either hired it or took possession without asking  i begin to think this was all a welllaid plot said sam  sure thing muttered tom the only tripup they made was when they didnt catch grace as well as nellie and dora  and when old crabtree dropped that visiting card added dick  the boys saw that lights were burning in one of the lower rooms of the old mansion and in two of the upper rooms  i guess they are all there said dick  cant we get closer and make sure pleaded tom  we dont want them to see us tom  why not  because it might spoil everything remember they are four or five strong not counting the woman and she would probably fight as hard as anybody if cornered  five queried sam  yes counting that fellow the girls took for a doctor  oh yes id forgotten him the machine certainly had a load coming to the place  if the girls are thereand safe for the time beingi know what id like to do went on the big brother after a pause  what  go to the nearest town and notify the authorities and make that whole crowd prisoners  that would be fine cried tom but can we do it they might try to slip away  that is true although i doubt it i think their plan is now they are here to lay low theyll think they are perfectly safe here most likely theyll send some kind of a letter to dad and to mrs stanhope and mrs laning asking for money and then theyll wait for answers theyll want us to pay a big sum for the release of dora and nellie  if only we could capture them ourselves murmured tom his eyes glistening dont you think we can do it with the sticks and pistols  we might tombut it would be a big risk those fellows are desperate sobber especially and they must be armed too there is no use of our getting shot if it can be avoided  with extreme caution the three boys walked around the old mansion in one of the upper rooms the curtains of which had been drawn they could make out several forms moving about  there i think that was nellie cried tom as a shadow appeared on the curtain  and there is that woman added sam as another form appeared and vanished  id like to know if dora is there murmured dick  they waited for a minute and saw several shadows pass and repass the curtain they were sure nellie was there but were not so certain about her cousin the woman was mrs sobber beyond a doubt  if they leave the girls in that room and alonewith that window unlocked began dick  the woman may stay with them interrupted tom  get backsomebody is coming whispered sam and dragged his brothers down behind some rose bushes  two persons were coming out of the old mansion one carried a lantern and what looked to be some bed slats and the other a ladder they were tad sobber and jerry koswell  do you think the ladder is long enough they heard koswell ask  i guess soill soon see answered tad sobber  the pair walked around to the side of the house and the ladder was placed in position under the window of the room the boys had been watching then sobber went up with the slats and some nails and a hammer and commenced to nail the slats across the window  hes going to make a regular prison cell of the room whispered tom oh if only i dared to run in and yank that ladder from under him he added with grim humor  hush or theyll hear you warned dick i am glad to see this he went on in a low whisper it shows that they think they havent been followed and are safe now to get to the nearest town notify the authorities and bag the bunch of them  if we could only get some word to the girls murmured tom  yes tom that would be very nice but we cant afford to take the chance if some of those rascals get away sooner or later theyll make more trouble for us  i know that  i think one of us might remain here on guard while the others go to town for help  how are you going to get to town  ive got a plan for that and dick smiled faintly ill make our friend the chauffeur do us a good turn  what will you go in that touring car cried sam  why not its a big roomy car and can carry a lot of officers of the law and we know it can make speed  all right dick go ahead i guess you know the right thing to do  after a few words it was decided that tom should remain on guard while dick and sam went for assistance dick cautioned tom not to show himself  if you do you may spoil everything said he  all right ill lay low answered tom that is unless i find out that the girls actually need me he added i wont stand it if that old woman or crabtree illtreats them  no if they try that sail in and do what you can to save them said dick     chapter xxix  the arm of the law   soon dick and sam were on the way to where they had left the chauffeur and the big touring car they fairly ran down the woodland trail stumbling over the rocks and tree roots in the darkness once sam went down and scratched his hand but he got up without complaining  they were almost in sight of the machine when they heard a peculiar sound dicks heart gave a bound  listen he cried hes trying to crank up he must have gotten free of his bonds  the oldest rover boy was right the chauffeur had worked at the straps and ropes until he had liberated himself now he was working at the crank of the touring car hoping to get away in the machine  he wont get started muttered sam remembering what he and tom had done to the automobile  they sneaked up behind the man and before he could resist had thrown him flat on his back then while dick held him down sam ran and got the straps and ropes  you let me go yelled the man let me go or it will be the worse for you and he tried to get away but then dick put a pistol to his head and he collapsed and offered no more resistance  as soon as the chauffeur was again secured the boys bundled him into the enclosed portion of the car and tied him fast to the foot rail and the robe rail then the youths lost no time in readjusting the machine so it could be used and lighting all the front lamps  if they hear us theyll think it is the chauffeur going away said dick  can you run her dick asked his brother  i think so it seems to be a good deal like our car at home only larger  it was agreed that sam should get into the coach part and watch the prisoner while dick ran the car then dick started up the machine backed out and turned around and then made his way out of the woods and across the field to the highway at first he ran cautiously but as soon as he became accustomed to the car he turned on the speed and spun along at the rate of thirty miles an hour in the direction of plankville  how is she going asked sam from behind  fine how is that prisoner  as mad as a hornet and there was a chuckle in sams tone  it was not long before they came in sight of plankville and dick slowed down a little he ran directly up to the hotel where several men were on the point of separating for the night  i want to get some officers of the law he cried where can i find them  well youve got one of em right here answered one of the men stepping forward what do you want  who are you  i am jackson fells and i happen to be sheriff of this county  the sheriff burst out dick just the man id like to meet sheriff ive got a prisoner for you and i want you to raise a posse as quickly as you can and round up five or six other persons  eh what a prisoner cried the sheriff where is he  tied up good and tight inside the car tell me where to take him will you  hum well i guess you better take him over to my office first and well look into this said the sheriff its right around the corner i was just going home  the county official got into the car and the other men followed on foot anxious to see what was going on in less than a minute they reached the sheriffs office and several lamps were lit and the chauffeur was brought in  it took quite some time for dick and sam to make themselves clear and get sheriff fells to move the driver of the big touring car was questioned and then placed in charge of the keeper of the lockup  maybe youll get off easy if you turn states evidence said one of the men present youd better do it too for this is a serious case  im willing to tell all i know growled the prisoner i was led into this before i knew what was going on  were going to use the car to round up the others added dick  go ahead i dont care it dont belong to me anywayi hired it from my boss  then well settle with your boss said sam  one of the men present was a constable and another a special policeman and both said they would go along with the sheriff and the boys the posse went well armed for dick had warned them that some of the rascals to be rounded up were desperate characters  we dont want any of them to get away said the oldest rover boy we want to make each one a prisoner  dont you worry young man they wont get away from me answered the sheriff i used to be on the new york force before i moved out here and i know that class of scoundrels i know that old stone house and when we get there well fix a plan to bag every one of em  all were soon in the touring car and once more dick put on the speed they ran so fast it made the constable chuckle  gee whizz he murmured were exceedin the speed limit sheriff dont you think id better hop out an arrest the bunch  necessity knows no law quoted the county official just the same young man dont you land us head up in a ditch he added to dick  the boys were on the watch and presently saw the field from which they had come and steered into it then they ran into the woods and brought the car to a standstill just where it had been before  now i think you had better be as quiet as possible said dick  right you are returned the sheriff and gave orders to his men to that effect  as silently as so many ghosts the posse and dick and sam hurried along the woodland trail in the direction of the old stone mansion soon they came in sight of the place as they did so tom came to meet them  anything new questioned dick in a whisper  the men folks are in the sitting room of the place answered tom  in the sitting room as late as this wouldnt you think theyd retire said sam  they are quarrelling went on tom and now he was chuckling  quarrelling over what  over the way they are going to divide the money they squeeze out of dad and mrs stanhope and mrs laning theyve got it all cut and dried that they are going to get forty or fifty thousand dollars before they send nellie and dora back to school and crabtree and sobber want the lions share while koswell and larkspur and that other chap the doctorif he is onewant just as much they are at it hot and heavy  what of the girls  they must still be in the upper room and the woman is either with them or next door to them  tom was glad to see the sheriff and his men and in a very few words the county official outlined his plan for capturing the evildoers in the old stone mansion  well let them believe that i brought about a dozen men with me said sheriff fells that will most likely take the starch right out of them then before they can think of resisting ill clap the irons on them you thompson can stay out in front and you rapp can walk around to the rear if they run plug them in the legs added the sheriff grimly it had been a long time since he had had such an important case to deal with and he intended to make the best showing possible  we can go in with you cant we asked dick  certainly and dont hesitate to show your guns boys but dont use them unless they show fight and try to get away  they are not going to get away cried tom sturdily this is the time we are going to round em up every one  a few further directions were given by the sheriff and then he and the three rover boys advanced to the front door of the old mansion at the same time with pistol in hand the officer named thompson remained where he was while he named rapp walked around to guard the rear  the door was unlocked for those inside had not dreamed of being disturbed on tiptoes the party entered the dark hallway to keep out the cold the door to the sitting room had been closed from within the room came a murmur of voices  well then thats settled came from tad sobber  i think we ought to have more money grumbled koswell  you will be getting your full share said josiah crabtree tartly  and youll be getting what is coming to you in another minute chuckled tom  advancing to the door the sheriff paused for a moment and then threw it wide open at the same time holding up a brace of pistols  hands up he cried sternly hands up all of you in the name of the law     chapter xxx  the roundupconclusion   whats this  its the rovers  who is this manan officer  we are caught  let me get out of here  these and various other exclamations rent the air when those in the sitting room of the mansion beheld the sheriff of the county and the three rover boys standing at the doorway each armed all leaped to their feet and every one present tried to get out of range of the sheriffs pistols  the game is up gentlemen went on sheriff fells the best thing you can do is to submit quietly ive got fifteen men outside to take care of you  caught burst out bart larkspur hoarsely and sank on a chair all but overcome oh why did i go into this scheme  thethere isersome mistake stammered josiah crabtree whose face had gone the color of white chalk  yes a big mistake crabtreeand you and the others are going to pay for it answered dick  ill not submit yelled tad sobber and sneaking up behind koswell he sent that individual flying into the sheriff then he leaped towards one of the windows at the same moment crabtree leaped for another window  but the rover boys were too quick for them and while the sheriff continued to cover koswell and the socalled doctor and also kept an eye on larkspur the lads leaped on their old enemies with a rapid swing of his right hand tom gave sobber a blow on the jaw that sent him staggering against the wall at the same time dick attacked josiah crabtree  that for abducting dora stanhope and her mother he exclaimed and his fist landed on crabtrees nose with such force that the former teacher was sent spinning across the room he let out a yell of agony and another yell when dick hit him in the left eye  dont dont i beg of you rover he whined  while this was going on koswell tried to dodge behind larkspur and go out by a side door but sam put out his foot and tripped the rascal up and then sat on him  the noise downstairs reached the ears of those above and in a few seconds mrs sobber appeared at the head of the stairs with a lighted candle  what is going on down there she asked  madam you keep where you are shouted the sheriff this house is surrounded by officers of the law dont you dare to come down  oh dear me shrieked the woman  sam go up and see if the girls are safe cried dick we can take care of things down here dont let that woman get away  ill take care of that woman never fear answered the youngest rover  the sheriff had brought along all the handcuffs necessary and in a few seconds he had handcuffed koswell he threw a pair of the steel bracelets to dick and another pair to tom and the rovers had the satisfaction of handcuffing josiah crabtree and tad sobber then the sheriff made prisoners of the rest of the crowd and called in the two men from the outside at the same time shouting loudly you other fellows remain where you are as if the force of a dozen or more were still there  can we go upstairs now asked dick  sure you can said the sheriff with a little grin but ill have to go alongto get the evidence you know  up the stairs bounded dick and tom they found mrs sobber in a corner of the hallway the lighted candle on a dusty stand at a nearby door sam was inserting a key in the lock  just got the key from the woman he explained can we come in he called out  yes yes came eagerly from dora and nellie  the youngest rover opened the door and like a flash dick and tom sped past him and into the room dora and nellie rushed to meet them laughing and crying hysterically  oh dick dick burst out poor dora and then sank into his arms too weak to stand  dora he murmured oh this is awful well it shall never happen again never and he pressed her to him  oh tom how glad i am that you came said nellie as she clung to him  they didnt hurt you did they demanded dick  they carried us offthat was enough answered dora oh sam what of grace  it was grace who told us answered the youngest rover she got away from them you know  we hoped so but we werent sure they wouldnt tell us about her said nellie are you alone  no indeed we have the sheriff and his posse with us every one of the rascals is under arrest  good it is what they deserve  have you got mr crabtree faltered dora  yes returned dick and this time well take care that he is put where he will never bother you and your mother again he continued  although told to do so by mrs sobber the girls had refused to go to bed and were fully dressed they had been offered supper by the woman but had found it impossible to eat  well we havent had a mouthful ourselves said sam  but we are going to have the finest kind of a spread just as soon as we get to town and those rascals are locked up added tom  but how did you manage to follow us so quickly asked dora wonderingly  we came to hope to call on you in the dartaway dick explained and we followed most of the way by biplane  then you have the flying machine here  yes although we didnt bring it very close to the house  what are you going to do with me cried mrs sobber oh please do not send me to prison tad made me do it  this case is now in the hands of the law answered dick coldly then the sheriff who had said nothing came forward and handcuffed the woman and marched her downstairs  when the rovers and the girls went below they found that all of the prisoners had been marched outside the sheriff was anxious to get them to the jail and the boys did not blame him  i dont see how that auto is going to hold all of us said the county official reckon well be kind of crowded  oh id hate to ride with those bad men murmured dora id rather walk  so would i added nellie  its too far to walk answered dick but ill tell you what you might do if you are willing to risk it you might sail to town in the dartaway  dick if you do it so will i cried dora  you wont be afraid he asked anxiously  why should i be she murmured if anything happened to you why iid just as soon have it happen to me too  ill go if tom goes put in nellie i dont want to go anywhere near those horrid men  someone will have to run the touring car said dick  i can do thatif you will look after the girls answered sam promptly and so it was finally arranged a few minutes later the prisoners were marched off by the sheriff and his men and sam dick and tom and the two girls went ahead to walk to where the biplane had been left among the trees  the girls were a little frightened at first but did their best not to show it dora sat as close to dick as she could and tom held nellie in a seat in front of him up into the air rushed the dartaway and both girls gave a little gasp dick did not sail high nor did he put on much speed since there was no need  i see something in the road cried tom after they had been sailing along for several minutes its the auto with the sheriffs crowd and the prisoners and then dick swept down close to the turnout and sam gave three blasts on the horn to let them know he saw them then the biplane and the touring car continued on the way to plankville  news of the intended arrest had been circulated and a crowd was in waiting at the sheriffs office when they arrived as it was past midnight the hearing was a brief one and soon the prisoners were placed behind the bars to await the further action of the law then the rovers and the girls were told they could go where they pleased so long as they agreed to appear when wanted  well appear all right enough cried tom why mr sheriff you couldnt beat us away with a club we intend to see to it that every one of those rascals gets what is coming to him  i reckon youve got a good enough case answered the county official grimly  the hotel keeper had been at the hearing and he readily offered to give the girls a room next to that occupied by himself and his wife and give the boys rooms also and he likewise agreed to get the party a substantial midnight supper  but we must send word to the folks first said dora  yes answered dick and this was soon done although they had to get a telegraph operator out of bed to do it but as the man was well paid for his trouble he did not mind this  and now to get back to hope and to brill cried tom the following morning when the boys and girls were dining again how shall we go  weve got to get the dartaway back said sam i can do that if you folks want to go by train trolley and stage  its a longwinded trip that way answered tom wed have to make five changes i asked the sheriff about it  do you boys want us to go in the biplane asked nellie  would you go asked tom eagerly  i will if dora will  ill go if dick wishes it said dora with a fond glance at the youth who was some day to be her husband  so it was settled that all should travel in the flying machine and the boys at once set to work to go over the biplane
