each have a cake of sesameand ten pound lucian  the fisherman   my first duty this evening is to ask your pardon for the ambiguity of title under which the subject of lecture has been announced  for indeed i am not going to talk of kings known as regnant nor of treasuries understood to contain wealth but of quite another order of royalty and another material of riches than those usually acknowledged  i had even intended to ask your attention for a little while on trust and as sometimes one contrives in taking a friend to see a favourite piece of scenery to hide what i wanted most to show with such imperfect cunning as i might until we unexpectedly reached the best point of view by winding paths  but and as also i have heard it said by men practised in public address that hearers are never so much fatigued as by the endeavour to follow a speaker who gives them no clue to his purposei will take the slight mask off at once and tell you plainly that i want to speak to you about the treasures hidden in books and about the way we find them and the way we lose them  a grave subject you will say and a wide one  yes so wide that i shall make no effort to touch the compass of it  i will try only to bring before you a few simple thoughts about reading which press themselves upon me every day more deeply as i watch the course of the public mind with respect to our daily enlarging means of education and the answeringly wider spreading on the levels of the irrigation of literature  it happens that i have practically some connexion with schools for different classes of youth and i receive many letters from parents respecting the education of their children  in the mass of these letters i am always struck by the precedence which the idea of a position in life takes above all other thoughts in the parents more especially in the mothersminds  the education befitting such and such a station in lifethis is the phrase this the object always  they never seek as far as i can make out an education good in itself even the conception of abstract rightness in training rarely seems reached by the writers  but an education which shall keep a good coat on my sons backwhich shall enable him to ring with confidence the visitors bell at doublebelled doors which shall result ultimately in establishment of a double belled door to his own housein a word which shall lead to advancement in lifethis we pray for on bent kneesand this is all we pray for  it never seems to occur to the parents that there may be an education which in itself is advancement in lifethat any other than that may perhaps be advancement in death and that this essential education might be more easily got or given than they fancy if they set about it in the right way while it is for no price and by no favour to be got if they set about it in the wrong  indeed among the ideas most prevalent and effective in the mind of this busiest of countries i suppose the firstat least that which is confessed with the greatest frankness and put forward as the fittest stimulus to youthful exertionis this of advancement in life  may i ask you to consider with me what this idea practically includes and what it should include  practically then at present advancement in life means becoming conspicuous in life obtaining a position which shall be acknowledged by others to be respectable or honourable  we do not understand by this advancement in general the mere making of money but the being known to have made it not the accomplishment of any great aim but the being seen to have accomplished it  in a word we mean the gratification of our thirst for applause  that thirst if the last infirmity of noble minds is also the first infirmity of weak ones and on the whole the strongest impulsive influence of average humanity  the greatest efforts of the race have always been traceable to the love of praise as its greatest catastrophes to the love of pleasure  i am not about to attack or defend this impulse  i want you only to feel how it lies at the root of effort especially of all modern effort  it is the gratification of vanity which is with us the stimulus of toil and balm of repose so closely does it touch the very springs of life that the wounding of our vanity is always spoken of and truly as in its measure mortal we call it mortification using the same expression which we should apply to a gangrenous and incurable bodily hurt  and although a few of us may be physicians enough to recognise the various effect of this passion upon health and energy i believe most honest men know and would at once acknowledge its leading power with them as a motive the seaman does not commonly desire to be made captain only because he knows he can manage the ship better than any other sailor on board  he wants to be made captain that he may be called captain the clergyman does not usually want to be made a bishop only because he believes that no other hand can as firmly as his direct the diocese through its difficulties  he wants to be made bishop primarily that he may be called my lord  and a prince does not usually desire to enlarge or a subject to gain a kingdom because he believes no one else can as well serve the state upon its throne but briefly because he wishes to be addressed as your majesty by as many lips as may be brought to such utterance  this then being the main idea of advancement in life the force of it applies for all of us according to our station particularly to that secondary result of such advancement which we call getting into good society  we want to get into good society not that we may have it but that we may be seen in it and our notion of its goodness depends primarily on its conspicuousness  will you pardon me if i pause for a moment to put what i fear you may think an impertinent question  i never can go on with an address unless i feel or know that my audience are either with me or against me  i do not much care which in beginning but i must know where they are and i would fain find out at this instant whether you think i am putting the motives of popular action too low  i am resolved tonight to state them low enough to be admitted as probable for whenever in my writings on political economy i assume that a little honesty or generosityor what used to be called virtuemay be calculated upon as a human motive of action people always answer me saying you must not calculate on that  that is not in human nature  you must not assume anything to be common to men but acquisitiveness and jealousy no other feeling ever has influence on them except accidentally and in matters out of the way of business  i begin accordingly tonight low in the scale of motives but i must know if you think me right in doing so  therefore let me ask those who admit the love of praise to be usually the strongest motive in mens minds in seeking advancement and the honest desire of doing any kind of duty to be an entirely secondary one to hold up their hands  about a dozen hands held upthe audience partly not being sure the lecturer is serious and partly shy of expressing opinion  i am quite seriousi really do want to know what you think however i can judge by putting the reverse question  will those who think that duty is generally the first and love of praise the second motive hold up their hands  one hand reported to have been held up behind the lecturer  very good  i see you are with me and that you think i have not begun too near the ground  now without teasing you by putting farther question i venture to assume that you will admit duty as at least a secondary or tertiary motive you think that the desire of doing something useful or obtaining some real good is indeed an existent collateral idea though a secondary one in most mens desire of advancement  you will grant that moderately honest men desire place and office at least in some measure for the sake of beneficent power and would wish to associate rather with sensible and wellinformed persons than with fools and ignorant persons whether they are seen in the company of the sensible ones or not  and finally without being troubled by repetition of any common truisms about the preciousness of friends and the influence of companions you will admit doubtless that according to the sincerity of our desire that our friends may be true and our companions wiseand in proportion to the earnestness and discretion with which we choose bothwill be the general chances of our happiness and usefulness  but granting that we had both the will and the sense to choose our friends well how few of us have the power or at least how limited for most is the sphere of choice  nearly all our associations are determined by chance or necessity and restricted within a narrow circle  we cannot know whom we would and those whom we know we cannot have at our side when we most need them all the higher circles of human intelligence are to those beneath only momentarily and partially open  we may by good fortune obtain a glimpse of a great poet and hear the sound of his voice or put a question to a man of science and be answered good humouredly  we may intrude ten minutes talk on a cabinet minister answered probably with words worse than silence being deceptive or snatch once or twice in our lives the privilege of throwing a bouquet in the path of a princess or arresting the kind glance of a queen  and yet these momentary chances we covet and spend our years and passions and powers in pursuit of little more than these while meantime there is a society continually open to us of people who will talk to us as long as we like whatever our rank or occupationtalk to us in the best words they can choose and of the things nearest their hearts  and this society because it is so numerous and so gentle and can be kept waiting round us all day longkings and statesmen lingering patiently not to grant audience but to gain itin those plainly furnished and narrow anterooms our bookcase shelveswe make no account of that companyperhaps never listen to a word they would say all day long  you may tell me perhaps or think within yourselves that the apathy with which we regard this company of the noble who are praying us to listen to them and the passion with which we pursue the company probably of the ignoble who despise us or who have nothing to teach us are grounded in thisthat we can see the faces of the living men and it is themselves and not their sayings with which we desire to become familiar  but it is not so suppose you never were to see their facessuppose you could be put behind a screen in the statesmans cabinet or the princes chamber would you not be glad to listen to their words though you were forbidden to advance beyond the screen  and when the screen is only a little less folded in two instead of four and you can be hidden behind the cover of the two boards that bind a book and listen all day long not to the casual talk but to the studied determined chosen addresses of the wisest of menthis station of audience and honourable privy council you despise  but perhaps you will say that it is because the living people talk of things that are passing and are of immediate interest to you that you desire to hear them  nay that cannot be so for the living people will themselves tell you about passing matters much better in their writings than in their careless talk  yet i admit that this motive does influence you so far as you prefer those rapid and ephemeral writings to slow and enduring writingsbooks properly so called  for all books are divisible into two classes the books of the hour and the books of all time  mark this distinctionit is not one of quality only  it is not merely the bad book that does not last and the good one that does  it is a distinction of species  there are good books for the hour and good ones for all time bad books for the hour and bad ones for all time  i must define the two kinds before i go farther  the good book of the hour theni do not speak of the bad ones is simply the useful or pleasant talk of some person whom you cannot otherwise converse with printed for you  very useful often telling you what you need to know very pleasant often as a sensible friends present talk would be  these bright accounts of travels goodhumoured and witty discussions of question lively or pathetic storytelling in the form of novel firm facttelling by the real agents concerned in the events of passing historyall these books of the hour multiplying among us as education becomes more general are a peculiar possession of the present age  we ought to be entirely thankful for them and entirely ashamed of ourselves if we make no good use of them  but we make the worst possible use if we allow them to usurp the place of true books for strictly speaking they are not books at all but merely letters or newspapers in good print  our friends letter may be delightful or necessary today  whether worth keeping or not is to be considered  the newspaper may be entirely proper at breakfast time but assuredly it is not reading for all day  so though bound up in a volume the long letter which gives you so pleasant an account of the inns and roads and weather last year at such a place or which tells you that amusing story or gives you the real circumstances of such and such events however valuable for occasional reference may not be in the real sense of the word a book at all nor in the real sense to be read  a book is essentially not a talking thing but a written thing and written not with a view of mere communication but of permanence  the book of talk is printed only because its author cannot speak to thousands of people at once if he could he wouldthe volume is mere multiplication of his voice  you cannot talk to your friend in india if you could you would you write instead  that is mere conveyance of voice  but a book is written not to multiply the voice merely not to carry it merely but to perpetuate it  the author has something to say which he perceives to be true and useful or helpfully beautiful  so far as he knows no one has yet said it so far as he knows no one else can say it  he is bound to say it clearly and melodiously if he may clearly at all events in the sum of his life he finds this to be the thing or group of things manifest to himthis the piece of true knowledge or sight which his share of sunshine and earth has permitted him to seize  he would fain set it down for ever engrave it on rock if he could saying this is the best of me for the rest i ate and drank and slept loved and hated like another my life was as the vapour and is not but this i saw and knew  this if anything of mine is worth your memory  that is his writing it is in his small human way and with whatever degree of true inspiration is in him his inscription or scripture  that is a book  perhaps you think no books were ever so written  but again i ask you do you at all believe in honesty or at all in kindness or do you think there is never any honesty or benevolence in wise people  none of us i hope are so unhappy as to think that  well whatever bit of a wise mans work is honestly and benevolently done that bit is his book or his piece of art 5 it is mixed always with evil fragmentsilldone redundant affected work  but if you read rightly you will easily discover the true bits and those are the book  now books of this kind have been written in all ages by their greatest men by great readers great statesmen and great thinkers  these are all at your choice and life is short  you have heard as much beforeyet have you measured and mapped out this short life and its possibilities  do you know if you read this that you cannot read thatthat what you lose today you cannot gain tomorrow  will you go and gossip with your housemaid or your stableboy when you may talk with queens and kings or flatter yourself that it is with any worthy consciousness of your own claims to respect that you jostle with the hungry and common crowd for entree here and audience there when all the while this eternal court is open to you with its society wide as the world multitudinous as its days the chosen and the mighty of every place and time  into that you may enter always in that you may take fellowship and rank according to your wish from that once entered into it you can never be outcast but by your own fault by your aristocracy of companionship there your own inherent aristocracy will be assuredly tested and the motives with which you strive to take high place in the society of the living measured as to all the truth and sincerity that are in them by the place you desire to take in this company of the dead  the place you desire and the place you fit yourself for i must also say because observe this court of the past differs from all living aristocracy in this it is open to labour and to merit but to nothing else  no wealth will bribe no name overawe no artifice deceive the guardian of those elysian gates  in the deep sense no vile or vulgar person ever enters there  at the portieres of that silent faubourg st germain there is but brief question do you deserve to enter  pass  do you ask to be the companion of nobles make yourself noble and you shall be  do you long for the conversation of the wise  learn to understand it and you shall hear it  but on other termsno  if you will not rise to us we cannot stoop to you  the living lord may assume courtesy the living philosopher explain his thought to you with considerate pain but here we neither feign nor interpret you must rise to the level of our thoughts if you would be gladdened by them and share our feelings if you would recognise our presence  this then is what you have to do and i admit that it is much you must in a word love these people if you are to be among them no ambition is of any use  they scorn your ambition  you must love them and show your love in these two following ways  1  first by a true desire to be taught by them and to enter into their thoughts  to enter into theirs observe not to find your own expressed by them  if the person who wrote the book is not wiser than you you need not read it if he be he will think differently from you in many respects  2  very ready we are to say of a book how good this isthats exactly what i think  but the right feeling is how strange that is  i never thought of that before and yet i see it is true or if i do not now i hope i shall some day  but whether thus submissively or not at least be sure that you go to the author to get at his meaning not to find yours  judge it afterwards if you think yourself qualified to do so but ascertain it first  and be sure also if the author is worth anything that you will not get at his meaning all at oncenay that at his whole meaning you will not for a long time arrive in any wise  not that he does not say what he means and in strong words too but he cannot say it all and what is more strange will not but in a hidden way and in parables in order that he may be sure you want it  i cannot quite see the reason of this nor analyse that cruel reticence in the breasts of wise men which makes them always hide their deeper thought  they do not give it you by way of help but of reward and will make themselves sure that you deserve it before they allow you to reach it  but it is the same with the physical type of wisdom gold  there seems to you and me no reason why the electric forces of the earth should not carry whatever there is of gold within it at once to the mountain tops so that kings and people might know that all the gold they could get was there and without any trouble of digging or anxiety or chance or waste of time cut it away and coin as much as they needed  but nature does not manage it so  she puts it in little fissures in the earth nobody knows where  you may dig long and find none you must dig painfully to find any  and it is just the same with mens best wisdom  when you come to a good book you must ask yourself am i inclined to work as an australian miner would  are my pickaxes and shovels in good order and am i in good trim myself my sleeves well up to the elbow and my breath good and my temper  and keeping the figure a little longer even at cost of tiresomeness for it is a thoroughly useful one the metal you are in search of being the authors mind or meaning his words are as the rock which you have to crush and smelt in order to get at it  and your pickaxes are your own care wit and learning your smelting furnace is your own thoughtful soul  do not hope to get at any good authors meaning without those tools and that fire often you will need sharpest finest chiselling and patientest fusing before you can gather one grain of the metal  and therefore first of all i tell you earnestly and authoritatively i know i am right in this you must get into the habit of looking intensely at words and assuring yourself of their meaning syllable by syllablenay letter by letter  for though it is only by reason of the opposition of letters in the function of signs to sounds in the function of signs that the study of books is called literature and that a man versed in it is called by the consent of nations a man of letters instead of a man of books or of words you may yet connect with that accidental nomenclature this real fact that you might read all the books in the british museum if you could live long enough and remain an utterly illiterate uneducated person but that if you read ten pages of a good book letter by letterthat is to say with real accuracy you are for evermore in some measure an educated person  the entire difference between education and noneducation as regards the merely intellectual part of it consists in this accuracy  a well educated gentleman may not know many languagesmay not be able to speak any but his ownmay have read very few books  but whatever language he knows he knows precisely whatever word he pronounces he pronounces rightly above all he is learned in the peerage of words knows the words of true descent and ancient blood at a glance from words of modern canaille remembers all their ancestry their intermarriages distant relationships and the extent to which they were admitted and offices they held among the national noblesse of words at any time and in any country  but an uneducated person may know by memory many languages and talk them all and yet truly know not a word of anynot a word even of his own  an ordinarily clever and sensible seaman will be able to make his way ashore at most ports yet he has only to speak a sentence of any language to be known for an illiterate person  so also the accent or turn of expression of a single sentence will at once mark a scholar  and this is so strongly felt so conclusively admitted by educated persons that a false accent or a mistaken syllable is enough in the parliament of any civilized nation to assign to a man a certain degree of inferior standing for ever  and this is right but it is a pity that the accuracy insisted on is not greater and required to a serious purpose  it is right that a false latin quantity should excite a smile in the house of commons but it is wrong that a false english meaning should not excite a frown there  let the accent of words be watched and closely  let their meaning be watched more closely still and fewer will do the work  a few words well chosen and distinguished will do work that a thousand cannot when every one is acting equivocally in the function of another  yes and words if they are not watched will do deadly work sometimes  there are masked words droning and skulking about us in europe just nowthere never were so many owing to the spread of a shallow blotching blundering infectious information or rather deformation everywhere and to the teaching of catechisms and phrases at school instead of human meaningsthere are masked words abroad i say which nobody understands but which everybody uses and most people will also fight for live for or even die for fancying they mean this or that or the other of things dear to them  for such words wear chameleon cloaksgroundlion cloaks of the colour of the ground of any mans fancy  on that ground they lie in wait and rend them with a spring from it  there never were creatures of prey so mischievous never diplomatists so cunning never poisoners so deadly as these masked words they are the unjust stewards of all mens ideas  whatever fancy or favourite instinct a man most cherishes he gives to his favourite masked word to take care of for him the word at last comes to have an infinite power over himyou cannot get at him but by its ministry  and in languages so mongrel in breed as the english there is a fatal power of equivocation put into mens hands almost whether they will or no in being able to use greek or latin words for an idea when they want it to be awful and saxon or otherwise common words when they want it to be vulgar  what a singular and salutary effect for instance would be produced on the minds of people who are in the habit of taking the form of the word they live by for the power of which that word tells them if we always either retained or refused the greek form biblos or biblion as the right expression for bookinstead of employing it only in the one instance in which we wish to give dignity to the idea and translating it into english everywhere else  how wholesome it would be for many simple persons if in such places for instance as acts xix 19 we retained the greek expression instead of translating it and they had to readmany of them also which used curious arts brought their bibles together and burnt them before all men and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver  or if on the other hand we translated where we retain it and always spoke of the holy book instead of holy bible it might come into more heads than it does at present that the word of god by which the heavens were of old and by which they are now kept in store 6 cannot be made a present of to anybody in morocco binding nor sown on any wayside by help either of steam plough or steam press but is nevertheless being offered to us daily and by us with contumely refused and sown in us daily and by us as instantly as may be choked  so again consider what effect has been produced on the english vulgar mind by the use of the sonorous latin form damno in translating the greek greek text which cannot be reproduced when people charitably wish to make it forcible and the substitution of the temperate condemn for it when they choose to keep it gentle and what notable sermons have been preached by illiterate clergymen onhe that believeth not shall be damned though they would shrink with horror from translating heb xi 7 the saving of his house by which he damned the world or john viii 1011 woman hath no man damned thee  she saith no man lord  jesus answered her neither do i damn thee  go and sin no more  and divisions in the mind of europe which have cost seas of blood and in the defence of which the noblest souls of men have been cast away in frantic desolation countless as forestleavesthough in the heart of them founded on deeper causeshave nevertheless been rendered practically possible mainly by the european adoption of the greek word for a public meeting ecclesia to give peculiar respectability to such meetings when held for religious purposes and other collateral equivocations such as the vulgar english one of using the word priest as a contraction for presbyter  now in order to deal with words rightly this is the habit you must form  nearly every word in your language has been first a word of some other languageof saxon german french latin or greek not to speak of eastern and primitive dialects  and many words have been all thesethat is to say have been greek first latin next french or german next and english last  undergoing a certain change of sense and use on the lips of each nation but retaining a deep vital meaning which all good scholars feel in employing them even at this day  if you do not know the greek alphabet learn it young or oldgirl or boywhoever you may be if you think of reading seriously which of course implies that you have some leisure at command learn your greek alphabet then get good dictionaries of all these languages and whenever you are in doubt about a word hunt it down patiently  read max mullers lectures thoroughly to begin with and after that never let a word escape you that looks suspicious  it is severe work but you will find it even at first interesting and at last endlessly amusing  and the general gain to your character in power and precision will be quite incalculable  mind this does not imply knowing or trying to know greek or latin or french  it takes a whole life to learn any language perfectly  but you can easily ascertain the meanings through which the english word has passed and those which in a good writers work it must still bear  and now merely for examples sake i will with your permission read a few lines of a true book with you carefully and see what will come out of them  i will take a book perfectly known to you all  no english words are more familiar to us yet few perhaps have been read with less sincerity  i will take these few following lines of lycidas   last came and last did go the pilot of the galilean lake two massy keys he bore of metals twain the golden opes the iron shuts amain he shook his mitred locks and stern bespake how well could i have spared for thee young swain enow of such as for their bellies sake creep and intrude and climb into the fold of other care they little reckoning make than how to scramble at the shearers feast and shove away the worthy bidden guest blind mouths that scarce themselves know how to hold a sheephook or have learnd aught else the least that to the faithful herdmans art belongs what recks it them  what need they  they are sped and when they list their lean and flashy songs grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw the hungry sheep look up and are not fed but swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw rot inwardly and foul contagion spread besides what the grim wolf with privy paw daily devours apace and nothing said   let us think over this passage and examine its words  first is it not singular to find milton assigning to st peter not only his full episcopal function but the very types of it which protestants usually refuse most passionately  his mitred locks milton was no bishoplover how comes st peter to be mitred two massy keys he bore  is this then the power of the keys claimed by the bishops of rome and is it acknowledged here by milton only in a poetical licence for the sake of its picturesqueness that he may get the gleam of the golden keys to help his effect  do not think it  great men do not play stage tricks with the doctrines of life and death  only little men do that  milton means what he says and means it with his might toois going to put the whole strength of his spirit presently into the saying of it  for though not a lover of false bishops he was a lover of true ones and the lakepilot is here in his thoughts the type and head of true episcopal power  for milton reads that text i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven quite honestly  puritan though he be he would not blot it out of the book because there have been bad bishops nay in order to understand him we must understand that verse first it will not do to eye it askance or whisper it under our breath as if it were a weapon of an adverse sect  it is a solemn universal assertion deeply to be kept in mind by all sects  but perhaps we shall be better able to reason on it if we go on a little farther and come back to it  for clearly this marked insistence on the power of the true episcopate is to make us feel more weightily what is to be charged against the false claimants of episcopate or generally against false claimants of power and rank in the body of the clergy they who for their bellies sake creep and intrude and climb into the fold  never think milton uses those three words to fill up his verse as a loose writer would  he needs all the threeespecially those three and no more than thosecreep and intrude and climb no other words would or could serve the turn and no more could be added  for they exhaustively comprehend the three classes correspondent to the three characters of men who dishonestly seek ecclesiastical power  first those who creep into the fold who do not care for office nor name but for secret influence and do all things occultly and cunningly consenting to any servility of office or conduct so only that they may intimately discern and unawares direct the minds of men  then those who intrude thrust that is themselves into the fold who by natural insolence of heart and stout eloquence of tongue and fearlessly perseverant selfassertion obtain hearing and authority with the common crowd lastly those who climb who by labour and learning both stout and sound but selfishly exerted in the cause of their own ambition gain high dignities and authorities and become lords over the heritage though not ensamples to the flock  now go on   of other care they little reckoning make than how to scramble at the shearers feast blind mouths   i pause again for this is a strange expression a broken metaphor one might think careless and unscholarly  not so  its very audacity and pithiness are intended to make us look close at the phrase and remember it  those two monosyllables express the precisely accurate contraries of right character in the two great offices of the churchthose of bishop and pastor  a bishop means a person who sees  a pastor means a person who feeds  the most unbishoply character a man can have is therefore to be blind  the most unpastoral is instead of feeding to want to be fedto be a mouth  take the two reverses together and you have blind mouths  we may advisably follow out this idea a little  nearly all the evils in the church have arisen from bishops desiring power more than light they want authority not outlook  whereas their real office is not to rule though it may be vigorously to exhort and rebuke  it is the kings office to rule the bishops office is to oversee the flock to number it sheep by sheep to be ready always to give full account of it  now it is clear he cannot give account of the souls if he has not so much as numbered the bodies of his flock  the first thing therefore that a bishop has to do is at least to put himself in a position in which at any moment he can obtain the history from childhood of every living soul in his diocese and of its present state  down in that back street bill and nancy knocking each others teeth outdoes the bishop know all about it has he his eye upon them  has he had his eye upon them  can he circumstantially explain to us how bill got into the habit of beating nancy about the head  if he cannot he is no bishop though he had a mitre as high as salisbury steeple he is no bishophe has sought to be at the helm instead of the masthead he has no sight of things  nay you say it is not his duty to look after bill in the back street  what the fat sheep that have full fleecesyou think it is only those he should look after while go back to your milton the hungry sheep look up and are not fed besides what the grim wolf with privy paw bishops knowing nothing about it daily devours apace and nothing said  but thats not our idea of a bishop 7 perhaps not but it was st pauls and it was miltons  they may be right or we may be but we must not think we are reading either one or the other by putting our meaning into their words  i go on    but swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw   this is to meet the vulgar answer that if the poor are not looked after in their bodies they are in their souls they have spiritual food  and milton says they have no such thing as spiritual food they are only swollen with wind  at first you may think that is a coarse type and an obscure one  but again it is a quite literally accurate one  take up your latin and greek dictionaries and find out the meaning of spirit  it is only a contraction of the latin word breath and an indistinct translation of the greek word for wind  the same word is used in writing the wind bloweth where it listeth and in writing so is every one that is born of the spirit born of the breath that is for it means the breath of god in soul and body  we have the true sense of it in our words inspiration and expire  now there are two kinds of breath with which the flock may be filledgods breath and mans  the breath of god is health and life and peace to them as the air of heaven is to the flocks on the hills but mans breaththe word which he calls spiritualis disease and contagion to them as the fog of the fen  they rot inwardly with it they are puffed up by it as a dead body by the vapours of its own decomposition  this is literally true of all false religious teaching the first and last and fatalest sign of it is that puffing up  your converted children who teach their parents your converted convicts who teach honest men your converted dunces who having lived in cretinous stupefaction half their lives suddenly awaking to the fact of there being a god fancy themselves therefore his peculiar people and messengers your sectarians of every species small and great catholic or protestant of high church or low in so far as they think themselves exclusively in the right and others wrong and preeminently in every sect those who hold that men can be saved by thinking rightly instead of doing rightly by word instead of act and wish instead of workthese are the true fog children clouds these without water bodies these of putrescent vapour and skin without blood or flesh  blown bagpipes for the fiends to pipe withcorrupt and corrupting swollen with wind and the rank mist they draw  lastly let us return to the lines respecting the power of the keys for now we can understand them  note the difference between milton and dante in their interpretation of this power  for once the latter is weaker in thought he supposes both the keys to be of the gate of heaven one is of gold the other of silver  they are given by st peter to the sentinel angel and it is not easy to determine the meaning either of the substances of the three steps of the gate or of the two keys  but milton makes one of gold the key of heaven the other of iron the key of the prison in which the wicked teachers are to be bound who have taken away the key of knowledge yet entered not in themselves  we have seen that the duties of bishop and pastor are to see and feed and of all who do so it is said he that watereth shall be watered also himself  but the reverse is truth also  he that watereth not shall be withered himself and he that seeth not shall himself be shut out of sightshut into the perpetual prison house  and that prison opens here as well as hereafter  he who is to be bound in heaven must first be bound on earth  that command to the strong angels of which the rockapostle is the image take him and bind him hand and foot and cast him out issues in its measure against the teacher for every help withheld and for every truth refused and for every falsehood enforced so that he is more strictly fettered the more he fetters and farther outcast as he more and more misleads till at last the bars of the iron cage close upon him and as the golden opes the iron shuts amain  we have got something out of the lines i think and much more is yet to be found in them but we have done enough by way of example of the kind of wordbyword examination of your author which is rightly called reading watching every accent and expression and putting ourselves always in the authors place annihilating our own personality and seeking to enter into his so as to be able assuredly to say thus milton thought not thus i thought in misreading milton  and by this process you will gradually come to attach less weight to your own thus i thought at other times  you will begin to perceive that what you thought was a matter of no serious importancethat your thoughts on any subject are not perhaps the clearest and wisest that could be arrived at thereupon in fact that unless you are a very singular person you cannot be said to have any thoughts at all that you have no materials for them in any serious matters 8no right to think but only to try to learn more of the facts  nay most probably all your life unless as i said you are a singular person you will have no legitimate right to an opinion on any business except that instantly under your hand  what must of necessity be done you can always find out beyond question how to do  have you a house to keep in order a commodity to sell a field to plough a ditch to cleanse  there need be no two opinions about these proceedings it is at your peril if you have not much more than an opinion on the way to manage such matters  and also outside of your own business there are one or two subjects on which you are bound to have but one opinion  that roguery and lying are objectionable and are instantly to be flogged out of the way whenever discoveredthat covetousness and love of quarrelling are dangerous dispositions even in children and deadly dispositions in men and nationsthat in the end the god of heaven and earth loves active modest and kind people and hates idle proud greedy and cruel oneson these general facts you are bound to have but one and that a very strong opinion  for the rest respecting religions governments sciences arts you will find that on the whole you can know nothingjudge nothing that the best you can do even though you may be a well educated person is to be silent and strive to be wiser every day and to understand a little more of the thoughts of others which so soon as you try to do honestly you will discover that the thoughts even of the wisest are very little more than pertinent questions to put the difficulty into a clear shape and exhibit to you the grounds for indecision that is all they can generally do for you and well for them and for us if indeed they are able to mix the music with our thoughts and sadden us with heavenly doubts  this writer from whom i have been reading to you is not among the first or wisest  he sees shrewdly as far as he sees and therefore it is easy to find out its full meaning but with the greater men you cannot fathom their meaning they do not even wholly measure it themselvesit is so wide  suppose i had asked you for instance to seek for shakespeares opinion instead of miltons on this matter of church authorityor for dantes  have any of you at this instant the least idea what either thought about it  have you ever balanced the scene with the bishops in richard iii against the character of cranmer the description of st francis and st dominic against that of him who made virgil wonder to gaze upon himdisteso tanto vilmente nell eterno esilio or of him whom dante stood beside come l frate che confessa lo perfido assassin 9  shakespeare and alighieri knew men better than most of us i presume  they were both in the midst of the main struggle between the temporal and spiritual powers  they had an opinion we may guess  but where is it  bring it into court  put shakespeares or dantes creed into articles and send it up for trial by the ecclesiastical courts  you will not be able i tell you again for many and many a day to come at the real purposes and teaching of these great men but a very little honest study of them will enable you to perceive that what you took for your own judgment was mere chance prejudice and drifted helpless entangled weed of castaway thought nay you will see that most mens minds are indeed little better than rough heath wilderness neglected and stubborn partly barren partly overgrown with pestilent brakes and venomous windsown herbage of evil surmise that the first thing you have to do for them and yourself is eagerly and scornfully to set fire to this burn all the jungle into wholesome ashheaps and then plough and sow  all the true literary work before you for life must begin with obedience to that order break up your fallow ground and sow not among thorns  ii  10 having then faithfully listened to the great teachers that you may enter into their thoughts you have yet this higher advance to makeyou have to enter into their hearts  as you go to them first for clear sight so you must stay with them that you may share at last their just and mighty passion  passion or sensation  i am not afraid of the word still less of the thing you have heard many outcries against sensation lately but i can tell you it is not less sensation we want but more  the ennobling difference between one man and anotherbetween one animal and anotheris precisely in this that one feels more than another if we were sponges perhaps sensation might not be easily got for us if we were earthworms liable at every instant to be cut in two by the spade perhaps too much sensation might not be good for us but being human creatures it is good for us nay we are only human in so far as we are sensitive and our honour is precisely in proportion to our passion  you know i said of that great and pure society of the dead that it would allow no vain or vulgar person to enter there  what do you think i meant by a vulgar person  what do you yourselves mean by vulgarity  you will find it a fruitful subject of thought but briefly the essence of all vulgarity lies in want of sensation simple and innocent vulgarity is merely an untrained and undeveloped bluntness of body and mind but in true inbred vulgarity there is a dreadful callousness which in extremity becomes capable of every sort of bestial habit and crime without fear without pleasure without horror and without pity  it is in the blunt hand and the dead heart in the diseased habit in the hardened conscience that men become vulgar they are for ever vulgar precisely in proportion as they are incapable of sympathyof quick understandingof all that in deep insistence on the common but most accurate term may be called the tact or touchfaculty of body and soul  that tact which the mimosa has in trees which the pure woman has above all creaturesfineness and fulness of sensation beyond reason the guide and sanctifier of reason itself  reason can but determine what is true it is the godgiven passion of humanity which alone can recognise what god has made good  we come then to that great concourse of the dead not merely to know from them what is true but chiefly to feel with them what is just now to feel with them we must be like them and none of us can become that without pains  as the true knowledge is disciplined and tested knowledgenot the first thought that comes so the true passion is disciplined and tested passionnot the first passion that comes  the first that come are the vain the false the treacherous if you yield to them they will lead you wildly and far in vain pursuit in hollow enthusiasm till you have no true purpose and no true passion left  not that any feeling possible to humanity is in itself wrong but only wrong when undisciplined  its nobility is in its force and justice it is wrong when it is weak and felt for paltry cause  there is a mean wonder as of a child who sees a juggler tossing golden balls and this is base if you will  but do you think that the wonder is ignoble or the sensation less with which every human soul is called to watch the golden balls of heaven tossed through the night by the hand that made them  there is a mean curiosity as of a child opening a forbidden door or a servant prying into her masters businessand a noble curiosity questioning in the front of danger the source of the great river beyond the sandthe place of the great continents beyond the sea a nobler curiosity still which questions of the source of the river of life and of the space of the continent of heaventhings which the angels desire to look into  so the anxiety is ignoble with which you linger over the course and catastrophe of an idle tale but do you think the anxiety is less or greater with which you watch or ought to watch the dealings of fate and destiny with the life of an agonized nation  alas it is the narrowness selfishness minuteness of your sensation that you have to deplore in england at this daysensation which spends itself in bouquets and speeches  in revellings and junketings in sham fights and gay puppet shows while you can look on and see noble nations murdered man by man without an effort or a tear  i said minuteness and selfishness of sensation but it would have been enough to have said injustice or unrighteousness of sensation  for as in nothing is a gentleman better to be discerned from a vulgar person so in nothing is a gentle nation such nations have been better to be discerned from a mob than in thisthat their feelings are constant and just results of due contemplation and of equal thought  you can talk a mob into anything its feelings may beusually areon the whole generous and right but it has no foundation for them no hold of them you may tease or tickle it into any at your pleasure it thinks by infection for the most part catching an opinion like a cold and there is nothing so little that it will not roar itself wild about when the fit is onnothing so great but it will forget in an hour when the fit is past  but a gentlemans or a gentle nations passions are just measured and continuous  a great nation for instance does not spend its entire national wits for a couple of months in weighing evidence of a single ruffians having done a single murder and for a couple of years see its own children murder each other by their thousands or tens of thousands a day considering only what the effect is likely to be on the price of cotton and caring no wise to determine which side of battle is in the wrong  neither does a great nation send its poor little boys to jail for stealing six walnuts and allow its bankrupts to steal their hundreds of thousands with a bow and its bankers rich with poor mens savings to close their doors under circumstances over which they have no control with a by your leave and large landed estates to be bought by men who have made their money by going with armed steamers up and down the china seas selling opium at the cannons mouth and altering for the benefit of the foreign nation the common highwaymans demand of your money or your life into that of your money and your life  neither does a great nation allow the lives of its innocent poor to be parched out of them by fog fever and rotted out of them by dunghill plague for the sake of sixpence a life extra per week to its landlords 11 and then debate with drivelling tears and diabolical sympathies whether it ought not piously to save and nursingly cherish the lives of its murderers also a great nation having made up its mind that hanging is quite the wholesomest process for its homicides in general can yet with mercy distinguish between the degrees of guilt in homicides and does not yelp like a pack of frostpinched wolfcubs on the blood track of an unhappy crazed boy or greyhaired clodpate othello perplexed i the extreme at the very moment that it is sending a minister of the crown to make polite speeches to a man who is bayoneting young girls in their fathers sight and killing noble youths in cool blood faster than a country butcher kills lambs in spring  and lastly a great nation does not mock heaven and its powers by pretending belief in a revelation which asserts the love of money to be the root of all evil and declaring at the same time that it is actuated and intends to be actuated in all chief national deeds and measures by no other love 12  my friends i do not know why any of us should talk about reading we want some sharper discipline than that of reading but at all events be assured we cannot read  no reading is possible for a people with its mind in this state  no sentence of any great writer is intelligible to them  it is simply and sternly impossible for the english public at this moment to understand any thoughtful writingso incapable of thought has it become in its insanity of avarice  happily our disease is as yet little worse than this incapacity of thought it is not corruption of the inner nature we ring true still when anything strikes home to us and though the idea that everything should pay has infected our every purpose so deeply that even when we would play the good samaritan we never take out our two pence and give them to the host without saying when i come again thou shalt give me fourpence there is a capacity of noble passion left in our hearts core  we show it in our workin our wareven in those unjust domestic affections which make us furious at a small private wrong while we are polite to a boundless public one  we are still industrious to the last hour of the day though we add the gamblers fury to the labourers patience we are still brave to the death though incapable of discerning true cause for battle and are still true in affection to our own flesh to the death as the seamonsters are and the rock eagles  and there is hope for a nation while this can be still said of it  as long as it holds its life in its hand ready to give it for its honour though a foolish honour for its love though a selfish love and for its business though a base business there is hope for it  but hope only for this instinctive reckless virtue cannot last  no nation can last which has made a mob of itself however generous at heart  it must discipline its passions and direct them or they will discipline it one day with scorpion whips  above all a nation cannot last as a moneymaking mob  it cannot with impunityit cannot with existencego on despising literature despising science despising art despising nature despising compassion and concentrating its soul on pence  do you think these are harsh or wild words  have patience with me but a little longer  i will prove their truth to you clause by clause  i  i say first we have despised literature  what do we as a nation care about books  how much do you think we spend altogether on our libraries public or private as compared with what we spend on our horses  if a man spends lavishly on his library you call him mada bibliomaniac  but you never call any one a horsemaniac though men ruin themselves every day by their horses and you do not hear of people ruining themselves by their books  or to go lower still how much do you think the contents of the bookshelves of the united kingdom public and private would fetch as compared with the contents of its winecellars  what position would its expenditure on literature take as compared with its expenditure on luxurious eating  we talk of food for the mind as of food for the body  now a good book contains such food inexhaustibly it is a provision for life and for the best part of us yet how long most people would look at the best book before they would give the price of a large turbot for it  though there have been men who have pinched their stomachs and bared their backs to buy a book whose libraries were cheaper to them i think in the end than most mens dinners are  we are few of us put to such trial and more the pity for indeed a precious thing is all the more precious to us if it has been won by work or economy and if public libraries were half so costly as public dinners or books cost the tenth part of what bracelets do even foolish men and women might sometimes suspect there was good in reading as well as in munching and sparkling whereas the very cheapness of literature is making even wise people forget that if a book is worth reading it is worth buying  no book is worth anything which is not worth much nor is it serviceable until it has been read and reread and loved and loved again and marked so that you can refer to the passages you want in it as a soldier can seize the weapon he needs in an armoury or a housewife bring the spice she needs from her store  bread of flour is good but there is bread sweet as honey if we would eat it in a good book and the family must be poor indeed which once in their lives cannot for such multipliable barleyloaves pay their bakers bill  we call ourselves a rich nation and we are filthy and foolish enough to thumb each others books out of circulating libraries  ii  i say we have despised science  what you exclaim are we not foremost in all discovery 13 and is not the whole world giddy by reason or unreason of our inventions  yes but do you suppose that is national work  that work is all done in spite of the nation by private peoples zeal and money  we are glad enough indeed to make our profit of science we snap up anything in the way of a scientific bone that has meat on it eagerly enough but if the scientific man comes for a bone or a crust to us that is another story  what have we publicly done for science  we are obliged to know what oclock it is for the safety of our ships and therefore we pay for an observatory and we allow ourselves in the person of our parliament to be annually tormented into doing something in a slovenly way for the british museum sullenly apprehending that to be a place for keeping stuffed birds in to amuse our children  if anybody will pay for their own telescope and resolve another nebula we cackle over the discernment as if it were our own if one in ten thousand of our hunting squires suddenly perceives that the earth was indeed made to be something else than a portion for foxes and burrows in it himself and tells us where the gold is and where the coals we understand that there is some use in that and very properly knight him  but is the accident of his having found out how to employ himself usefully any credit to us the negation of such discovery among his brother squires may perhaps be some discredit to us if we would consider of it  but if you doubt these generalities here is one fact for us all to meditate upon illustrative of our love of science  two years ago there was a collection of the fossils of solenhofen to be sold in bavaria the best in existence containing many specimens unique for perfectness and one unique as an example of a species a whole kingdom of unknown living creatures being announced by that fossil this collection of which the mere market worth among private buyers would probably have been some thousand or twelve hundred pounds was offered to the english nation for seven hundred  but we would not give seven hundred and the whole series would have been in the munich museum at this moment if professor owen 14 had not with loss of his own time and patient tormenting of the british public in person of its representatives got leave to give four hundred pounds at once and himself become answerable for the other three which the said public will doubtless pay him eventually but sulkily and caring nothing about the matter all the while only always ready to cackle if any credit comes of it  consider i beg of you arithmetically what this fact means  your annual expenditure for public purposes a third of it for military apparatus is at least 50 millions  now 700l is to 50000000l roughly as seven pence to two thousand pounds  suppose then a gentleman of unknown income but whose wealth was to be conjectured from the fact that he spent two thousand a year on his parkwalls and footmen only professes himself fond of science and that one of his servants comes eagerly to tell him that an unique collection of fossils giving clue to a new era of creation is to be had for the sum of seven pence sterling and that the gentleman who is fond of science and spends two thousand a year on his park answers after keeping his servant waiting several months well  ill give you fourpence for them if you will be answerable for the extra threepence yourself till next year  iii  i say you have despised art  what you again answer have we not art exhibitions miles long and do we not pay thousands of pounds for single pictures and have we not art schools and institutionsmore than ever nation had before  yes truly but all that is for the sake of the shop  you would fain sell canvas as well as coals and crockery as well as iron you would take every other nations bread out of its mouth if you could 15 not being able to do that your ideal of life is to stand in the thoroughfares of the world like ludgate apprentices screaming to every passerby what dye lack  you know nothing of your own faculties or circumstances you fancy that among your damp flat fat fields of clay you can have as quick artfancy as the frenchman among his bronzed vines or the italian under his volcanic cliffs that art may be learned as bookkeeping is and when learned will give you more books to keep  you care for pictures absolutely no more than you do for the bills pasted on your dead walls  there is always room on the walls for the bills to be readnever for the pictures to be seen  you do not know what pictures you have by repute in the country nor whether they are false or true nor whether they are taken care of or not in foreign countries you calmly see the noblest existing pictures in the world rotting in abandoned wreckin venice you saw the austrian guns deliberately pointed at the palaces containing them and if you heard that all the fine pictures in europe were made into sandbags tomorrow on the austrian forts it would not trouble you so much as the chance of a brace or two of game less in your own bags in a days shooting  that is your national love of art  iv  you have despised nature that is to say all the deep and sacred sensations of natural scenery  the french revolutionists made stables of the cathedrals of france you have made racecourses of the cathedrals of the earth  your one conception of pleasure is to drive in railroad carriages round their aisles and eat off their altars 16 you have put a railroadbridge over the falls of schaffhausen  you have tunnelled the cliffs of lucerne by tells chapel you have destroyed the clarens shore of the lake of geneva there is not a quiet valley in england that you have not filled with bellowing fire there is no particle left of english land which you have not trampled coal ashes into 17nor any foreign city in which the spread of your presence is not marked among its fair old streets and happy gardens by a consuming white leprosy of new hotels and perfumers shops  the alps themselves which your own poets used to love so reverently you look upon as soaped poles in a bear garden which you set yourselves to climb and slide down again with shrieks of delight  when you are past shrieking having no human articulate voice to say you are glad with you fill the quietude of their valleys with gunpowder blasts and rush home red with cutaneous eruption of conceit and voluble with convulsive hiccough of selfsatisfaction  i think nearly the two sorrowfullest spectacles i have ever seen in humanity taking the deep inner significance of them are the english mobs in the valley of chamouni amusing themselves with firing rusty howitzers and the swiss vintagers of zurich expressing their christian thanks for the gift of the vine by assembling in knots in the towers of the vineyards and slowly loading and firing horsepistols from morning till evening  it is pitiful to have dim conceptions of duty more pitiful it seems to me to have conceptions like these of mirth  lastly  you despise compassion  there is no need of words of mine for proof of this  i will merely print one of the newspaper paragraphs which i am in the habit of cutting out and throwing into my storedrawer here is one from a daily telegraph of an early date this year 1867 date which though by me carelessly left unmarked is easily discoverable for on the back of the slip there is the announcement that yesterday the seventh of the special services of this year was performed by the bishop of ripon in st pauls it relates only one of such facts as happen now daily this by chance having taken a form in which it came before the coroner  i will print the paragraph in red  be sure the facts themselves are written in that colour in a book which we shall all of us literate or illiterate have to read our page of some day   an inquiry was held on friday by mr richards deputy coroner at the white horse tavern christ church spitalfields respecting the death of michael collins aged 58 years  mary collins a miserable looking woman said that she lived with the deceased and his son in a room at 2 cobbs court christ church  deceased was a translator of boots  witness went out and bought old boots deceased and his son made them into good ones and then witness sold them for what she could get at the shops which was very little indeed  deceased and his son used to work night and day to try and get a little bread and tea and pay for the room 2s a week so as to keep the home together  on fridaynightweek deceased got up from his bench and began to shiver  he threw down the boots saying somebody else must finish them when i am gone for i can do no more  there was no fire and he said i would be better if i was warm  witness therefore took two pairs of translated boots 18 to sell at the shop but she could only get 14d for the two pairs for the people at the shop said we must have our profit witness got 14lb of coal and a little tea and bread  her son sat up the whole night to make the translations to get money but deceased died on saturday morning  the family never had enough to eatcoroner  it seems to me deplorable that you did not go into the workhouse  witness  we wanted the comforts of our little home  a juror asked what the comforts were for he only saw a little straw in the corner of the room the windows of which were broken  the witness began to cry and said that they had a quilt and other little things  the deceased said he never would go into the workhouse  in summer when the season was good they sometimes made as much as 10s profit in the week  they then always saved towards the next week which was generally a bad one  in winter they made not half so much  for three years they had been getting from bad to worsecornelius collins said that he had assisted his father since 1847  they used to work so far into the night that both nearly lost their eyesight  witness now had a film over his eyes  five years ago deceased applied to the parish for aid  the relieving officer gave him a 4lb loaf and told him if he came again he should get the stones 19  that disgusted deceased and he would have nothing to do with them since  they got worse and worse until last friday week when they had not even a halfpenny to buy a candle  deceased then lay down on the straw and said he could not live till morninga juror  you are dying of starvation yourself and you ought to go into the house until the summer witness  if we went in we should die  when we come out in the summer we should be like people dropped from the sky  no one would know us and we would not have even a room  i could work now if i had food for my sight would get better  dr g p walker said deceased died from syncope from exhaustion from want of food  the deceased had had no bedclothes  for four months he had had nothing but bread to eat  there was not a particle of fat in the body there was no disease but if there had been medical attendance he might have survived the syncope or fainting  the coroner having remarked upon the painful nature of the case the jury returned the following verdict  that deceased died from exhaustion from want of food and the common necessaries of life also through want of medical aid   why would witness not go into the workhouse you ask  well the poor seem to have a prejudice against the workhouse which the rich have not for of course everyone who takes a pension from government goes into the workhouse on a grand scale  20 only the workhouses for the rich do not involve the idea of work and should be called playhouses  but the poor like to die independently it appears perhaps if we made the playhouses for them pretty and pleasant enough or gave them their pensions at home and allowed them a little introductory peculation with the public money their minds might be reconciled to the conditions  meantime here are the facts  we make our relief either so insulting to them or so painful that they rather die than take it at our hands or for third alternative we leave them so untaught and foolish that they starve like brute creatures wild and dumb not knowing what to do or what to ask  i say you despise compassion if you did not such a newspaper paragraph would be as impossible in a christian country as a deliberate assassination permitted in its public streets 21 christian did i say  alas if we were but wholesomely un christian it would be impossible  it is our imaginary christianity that helps us to commit these crimes for we revel and luxuriate in our faith for the lewd sensation of it dressing it up like everything else in fiction  the dramatic christianity of the organ and aisle of dawnservice and twilightrevivalthe christianity which we do not fear to mix the mockery of pictorially with our play about the devil in our satanellasrobertsfausts chanting hymns through traceried windows for background effect and artistically modulating the dio through variation on variation of mimicked prayer  while we distribute tracts next day for the benefit of uncultivated swearers upon what we suppose to be the signification of the third commandment this gaslighted and gas inspired christianity we are triumphant in and draw back the hem of our robes from the touch of the heretics who dispute it  but to do a piece of common christian righteousness in a plain english word or deed to make christian law any rule of life and found one national act or hope thereonwe know too well what our faith comes to for that  you might sooner get lightning out of incense smoke than true action or passion out of your modern english religion you had better get rid of the smoke and the organ pipes both leave them and the gothic windows and the painted glass to the property man give up your carburetted hydrogen ghost in one healthy expiration and look after lazarus at the doorstep  for there is a true church wherever one hand meets another helpfully and that is the only holy or mother church which ever was or ever shall be  all these pleasures then and all these virtues i repeat you nationally despise  you have indeed men among you who do not by whose work by whose strength by whose life by whose death you live and never thank them  your wealth your amusement your pride would all be alike impossible but for those whom you scorn or forget  the policeman who is walking up and down the black lane all night to watch the guilt you have created there and may have his brains beaten out and be maimed for life at any moment and never be thanked the sailor wrestling with the seas rage the quiet student poring over his book or his vial the common worker without praise and nearly without bread fulfilling his task as your horses drag your carts hopeless and spurned of all  these are the men by whom england lives but they are not the nation they are only the body and nervous force of it acting still from old habit in a convulsive perseverance while the mind is gone  our national wish and purpose are only to be amused our national religion is the performance of church ceremonies and preaching of soporific truth or untruths to keep the mob quietly at work while we amuse ourselves and the necessity for this amusement is fastening on us as a feverous disease of parched throat and wandering eyessenseless dissolute merciless  how literally that word disease the negation and impossibility of ease expresses the entire moral state of our english industry and its amusements  when men are rightly occupied their amusement grows out of their work as the colourpetals out of a fruitful flowerwhen they are faithfully helpful and compassionate all their emotions become steady deep perpetual and vivifying to the soul as the natural pulse to the body  but now having no true business we pour our whole masculine energy into the false business of moneymaking and having no true emotion we must have false emotions dressed up for us to play with not innocently as children with dolls but guiltily and darkly as the idolatrous jews with their pictures on cavern walls which men had to dig to detect  the justice we do not execute we mimic in the novel and on the stage for the beauty we destroy in nature we substitute the metamorphosis of the pantomime and the human nature of us imperatively requiring awe and sorrow of some kind for the noble grief we should have borne with our fellows and the pure tears we should have wept with them we gloat over the pathos of the police court and gather the nightdew of the grave  it is difficult to estimate the true significance of these things the facts are frightful enoughthe measure of national fault involved in them is perhaps not as great as it would at first seem we permit or cause thousands of deaths daily but we mean no harm we set fire to houses and ravage peasants fields yet we should be sorry to find we had injured anybody  we are still kind at heart still capable of virtue but only as children are  chalmers at the end of his long life having had much power with the public being plagued in some serious matter by a reference to public opinion uttered the impatient exclamation the public is just a great baby  and the reason that i have allowed all these graver subjects of thought to mix themselves up with an inquiry into methods of reading is that the more i see of our national faults or miseries the more they resolve themselves into conditions of childish illiterateness and want of education in the most ordinary habits of thought  it is i repeat not vice not selfishness not dulness of brain which we have to lament but an unreachable schoolboys recklessness only differing from the true schoolboys in its incapacity of being helped because it acknowledges no master  there is a curious type of us given in one of the lovely neglected works of the last of our great painters  it is a drawing of kirkby lonsdale churchyard and of its brook and valley and hills and folded morning sky beyond  and unmindful alike of these and of the dead who have left these for other valleys and for other skies a group of schoolboys have piled their little books upon a grave to strike them off with stones  so also we play with the words of the dead that would teach us and strike them far from us with our bitter reckless will little thinking that those leaves which the wind scatters had been piled not only upon a gravestone but upon the seal of an enchanted vaultnay the gate of a great city of sleeping kings who would awake for us and walk with us if we knew but how to call them by their names  how often even if we lift the marble entrance gate do we but wander among those old kings in their repose and finger the robes they lie in and stir the crowns on their foreheads and still they are silent to us and seem but a dusty imagery because we know not the incantation of the heart that would wake themwhich if they once heard they would start up to meet us in their power of long ago narrowly to look upon us and consider us and as the fallen kings of hades meet the newly fallen saying art thou also become weak as weart thou also become one of us so would these kings with their undimmed unshaken diadems meet us saying art thou also become pure and mighty of heart as weart thou also become one of us  mighty of heart mighty of mindmagnanimousto be this is indeed to be great in life to become this increasingly is indeed to advance in lifein life itselfnot in the trappings of it my friends do you remember that old scythian custom when the head of a house died  how he was dressed in his finest dress and set in his chariot and carried about to his friends houses and each of them placed him at his tables head and all feasted in his presence  suppose it were offered to you in plain words as it is offered to you in dire facts that you should gain this scythian honour gradually while you yet thought yourself alive  suppose the offer were this  you shall die slowly your blood shall daily grow cold your flesh petrify your heart beat at last only as a rusted group of iron valves  your life shall fade from you and sink through the earth into the ice of caina but day by day your body shall be dressed more gaily and set in higher chariots and have more orders on its breastcrowns on its head if you will men shall bow before it stare and shout round it crowd after it up and down the streets build palaces for it feast with it at their tables heads all the night long your soul shall stay enough within it to know what they do and feel the weight of the golden dress on its shoulders and the furrow of the crownedge on the skullno more  would you take the offer verbally made by the deathangel would the meanest among us take it think you  yet practically and verily we grasp at it every one of us in a measure many of us grasp at it in its fulness of horror  every man accepts it who desires to advance in life without knowing what life is who means only that he is to get more horses and more footmen and more fortune and more public honour andnot more personal soul  he only is advancing in life whose heart is getting softer whose blood warmer whose brain quicker whose spirit is entering into living 22 peace  and the men who have this life in them are the true lords or kings of the earththey and they only  all other kingships so far as they are true are only the practical issue and expression of theirs if less than this they are either dramatic royaltiescostly shows set off indeed with real jewels instead of tinselbut still only the toys of nations or else they are no royalties at all but tyrannies or the mere active and practical issue of national folly for which reason i have said of them elsewhere visible governments are the toys of some nations the diseases of others the harness of some the burdens of more  but i have no words for the wonder with which i hear kinghood still spoken of even among thoughtful men as if governed nations were a personal property and might be bought and sold or otherwise acquired as sheep of whose flesh their king was to feed and whose fleece he was to gather as if achilles indignant epithet of base kings peopleeating were the constant and proper title of all monarchs and the enlargement of a kings dominion meant the same thing as the increase of a private mans estate  kings who think so however powerful can no more be the true kings of the nation than gadflies are the kings of a horse they suck it and may drive it wild but do not guide it  they and their courts and their armies are if one could see clearly only a large species of marsh mosquito with bayonet proboscis and melodious bandmastered trumpeting in the summer air the twilight being perhaps sometimes fairer but hardly more wholesome for its glittering mists of midge companies  the true kings meanwhile rule quietly if at all and hate ruling too many of them make il gran rifiuto and if they do not the mob as soon as they are likely to become useful to it is pretty sure to make its gran rifiuto of them  yet the visible king may also be a true one some day if ever day comes when he will estimate his dominion by the force of itnot the geographical boundaries  it matters very little whether trent cuts you a cantel out here or rhine rounds you a castle less there but it does matter to you king of men whether you can verily say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh  whether you can turn your people as you can trentand where it is that you bid them come and where go  it matters to you king of men whether your people hate you and die by you or love you and live by you  you may measure your dominion by multitudes better than by miles and count degrees of love latitude not from but to a wonderfully warm and infinite equator  measurenay you cannot measure  who shall measure the difference between the power of those who do and teach and who are greatest in the kingdoms of earth as of heavenand the power of those who undo and consumewhose power at the fullest is only the power of the moth and the rust  strange to think how the mothkings lay up treasures for the moth and the rustkings who are to their peoples strength as rust to armour lay up treasures for the rust and the robberkings treasures for the robber but how few kings have ever laid up treasures that needed no guardingtreasures of which the more thieves there were the better  broidered robe only to be rent helm and sword only to be dimmed jewel and gold only to be scatteredthere have been three kinds of kings who have gathered these  suppose there ever should arise a fourth order of kings who had read in some obscure writing of long ago that there was a fourth kind of treasure which the jewel and gold could not equal neither should it be valued with pure gold  a web made fair in the weaving by athenas shuttle an armour forged in divine fire by vulcanian force a gold to be mined in the very suns red heart where he sets over the delphian cliffsdeeppictured tissueimpenetrable armourpotable goldthe three great angels of conduct toil and thought still calling to us and waiting at the posts of our doors to lead us with their winged power and guide us with their unerring eyes by the path which no fowl knoweth and which the vultures eye has not seen  suppose kings should ever arise who heard and believed this word and at last gathered and brought forth treasures ofwisdomfor their people  think what an amazing business that would be  how inconceivable in the state of our present national wisdom  that we should bring up our peasants to a book exercise instead of a bayonet exercise organise drill maintain with pay and good generalship armies of thinkers instead of armies of stabbersfind national amusement in readingrooms as well as riflegrounds give prizes for a fair shot at a fact as well as for a leaden splash on a target  what an absurd idea it seems put fairly in words that the wealth of the capitalists of civilised nations should ever come to support literature instead of war  have yet patience with me while i read you a single sentence out of the only book properly to be called a book that i have yet written myself the one that will stand if anything stand surest and longest of all work of mine   it is one very awful form of the operation of wealth in europe that it is entirely capitalists wealth which supports unjust wars  just wars do not need so much money to support them for most of the men who wage such wage them gratis but for an unjust war mens bodies and souls have both to be bought and the best tools of war for them besides which make such war costly to the maximum not to speak of the cost of base fear and angry suspicion between nations which have not grace nor honesty enough in all their multitudes to buy an hours peace of mind with as at present france and england purchasing of each other ten millions sterling worth of consternation annually a remarkably light crop half thorns and half aspen leaves sown reaped and granaried by the science of the modern political economist teaching covetousness instead of truth  and all unjust war being supportable if not by pillage of the enemy only by loans from capitalists these loans are repaid by subsequent taxation of the people who appear to have no will in the matter the capitalists will being the primary root of the war but its real root is the covetousness of the whole nation rendering it incapable of faith frankness or justice and bringing about therefore in due time his own separate loss and punishment to each person   france and england literally observe buy panic of each other they pay each of them for ten thousandthousandpoundsworth of terror a year  now suppose instead of buying these ten millions worth of panic annually they made up their minds to be at peace with each other and buy ten millions worth of knowledge annually and that each nation spent its ten thousand thousand pounds a year in founding royal libraries royal art galleries royal museums royal gardens and places of rest  might it not be better somewhat for both french and english  it will be long yet before that comes to pass  nevertheless i hope it will not be long before royal or national libraries will be founded in every considerable city with a royal series of books in them the same series in every one of them chosen books the best in every kind prepared for that national series in the most perfect way possible their text printed all on leaves of equal size broad of margin and divided into pleasant volumes light in the hand beautiful and strong and thorough as examples of binders work and that these great libraries will be accessible to all clean and orderly persons at all times of the day and evening strict law being enforced for this cleanliness and quietness  i could shape for you other plans for artgalleries and for natural history galleries and for many preciousmany it seems to me needfulthings but this book plan is the easiest and needfullest and would prove a considerable tonic to what we call our british constitution which has fallen dropsical of late and has an evil thirst and evil hunger and wants healthier feeding you have got its corn laws repealed for it try if you cannot get corn laws established for it dealing in a better breadbread made of that old enchanted arabian grain the sesame which opens doors doors not of robbers but of kings treasuries    lecture iililies of queens gardens    be thou glad oh thirsting desert let the desert be made cheerful and bloom as the lily and the barren places of jordan shall run wild with woodisaiah xxxv  i septuagint   it will perhaps be well as this lecture is the sequel of one previously given that i should shortly state to you my general intention in both  the questions specially proposed to you in the first namely how and what to read rose out of a far deeper one which it was my endeavour to make you propose earnestly to yourselves namely why to read  i want you to feel with me that whatever advantages we possess in the present day in the diffusion of education and of literature can only be rightly used by any of us when we have apprehended clearly what education is to lead to and literature to teach  i wish you to see that both welldirected moral training and wellchosen reading lead to the possession of a power over the illguided and illiterate which is according to the measure of it in the truest sense kingly conferring indeed the purest kingship that can exist among men  too many other kingships however distinguished by visible insignia or material power being either spectral or tyrannousspectralthat is to say aspects and shadows only of royalty hollow as death and which only the likeness of a kingly crown have on or elsetyrannousthat is to say substituting their own will for the law of justice and love by which all true kings rule  there is then i repeatand as i want to leave this idea with you i begin with it and shall end with itonly one pure kind of kingship an inevitable and eternal kind crowned or not the kingship namely which consists in a stronger moral state and a truer thoughtful state than that of others enabling you therefore to guide or to raise them  observe that word state we have got into a loose way of using it  it means literally the standing and stability of a thing and you have the full force of it in the derived word statuethe immovable thing  a kings majesty or state then and the right of his kingdom to be called a state depends on the movelessness of both without tremor without quiver of balance established and enthroned upon a foundation of eternal law which nothing can alter nor overthrow  believing that all literature and all education are only useful so far as they tend to confirm this calm beneficent and therefore kingly powerfirst over ourselves and through ourselves over all around usi am now going to ask you to consider with me farther what special portion or kind of this royal authority arising out of noble education may rightly be possessed by women and how far they also are called to a true queenly powernot in their households merely but over all within their sphere  and in what sense if they rightly understood and exercised this royal or gracious influence the order and beauty induced by such benignant power would justify us in speaking of the territories over which each of them reigned as queens gardens  and here in the very outset we are met by a far deeper question whichstrange though this may seemremains among many of us yet quite undecided in spite of its infinite importance  we cannot determine what the queenly power of women should be until we are agreed what their ordinary power should be  we cannot consider how education may fit them for any widely extending duty until we are agreed what is their true constant duty  and there never was a time when wilder words were spoken or more vain imagination permitted respecting this questionquite vital to all social happiness  the relations of the womanly to the manly nature their different capacities of intellect or of virtue seem never to have been yet estimated with entire consent  we hear of the mission and of the rights of woman as if these could ever be separate from the mission and the rights of manas if she and her lord were creatures of independent kind and of irreconcilable claim  this at least is wrong  and not less wrongperhaps even more foolishly wrong for i will anticipate thus far what i hope to proveis the idea that woman is only the shadow and attendant image of her lord owing him a thoughtless and servile obedience and supported altogether in her weakness by the preeminence of his fortitude  this i say is the most foolish of all errors respecting her who was made to be the helpmate of man  as if he could be helped effectively by a shadow or worthily by a slave  let us try then whether we cannot get at some clear and harmonious idea it must be harmonious if it is true of what womanly mind and virtue are in power and office with respect to mans and how their relations rightly accepted aid and increase the vigour and honour and authority of both  and now i must repeat one thing i said in the last lecture  namely that the first use of education was to enable us to consult with the wisest and the greatest men on all points of earnest difficulty that to use books rightly was to go to them for help  to appeal to them when our own knowledge and power of thought failed  to be led by them into wider sightpurer conceptionthan our own and receive from them the united sentence of the judges and councils of all time against our solitary and unstable opinion  let us do this now  let us see whether the greatest the wisest the puresthearted of all ages are agreed in any wise on this point let us hear the testimony they have left respecting what they held to be the true dignity of woman and her mode of help to man  and first let us take shakespeare  note broadly in the outset shakespeare has no heroeshe has only heroines  there is not one entirely heroic figure in all his plays except the slight sketch of henry the fifth exaggerated for the purposes of the stage and the still slighter valentine in the two gentlemen of verona  in his laboured and perfect plays you have no hero  othello would have been one if his simplicity had not been so great as to leave him the prey of every base practice round him but he is the only example even approximating to the heroic type coriolanuscaesarantony stand in flawed strength and fall by their vanitieshamlet is indolent and drowsily speculative romeo an impatient boy the merchant of venice languidly submissive to adverse fortune kent in king lear is entirely noble at heart but too rough and unpolished to be of true use at the critical time and he sinks into the office of a servant only  orlando no less noble is yet the despairing toy of chance followed comforted saved by rosalind  whereas there is hardly a play that has not a perfect woman in it steadfast in grave hope and errorless purpose cordelia desdemona isabella hermione imogen queen catherine perdita sylvia viola rosalind helena and last and perhaps loveliest virgilia are all faultless conceived in the highest heroic type of humanity  then observe secondly  the catastrophe of every play is caused always by the folly or fault of a man the redemption if there be any is by the wisdom and virtue of a woman and failing that there is none  the catastrophe of king lear is owing to his own want of judgment his impatient vanity his misunderstanding of his children the virtue of his one true daughter would have saved him from all the injuries of the others unless he had cast her away from him as it is she all but saves him  of othello i need not trace the talenor the one weakness of his so mighty love nor the inferiority of his perceptive intellect to that even of the second woman character in the play the emilia who dies in wild testimony against his error   oh murderous coxcomb what should such a fool do with so good a wife   in romeo and juliet the wise and brave stratagem of the wife is brought to ruinous issue by the reckless impatience of her husband in winters tale and in cymbeline the happiness and existence of two princely households lost through long years and imperilled to the death by the folly and obstinacy of the husbands are redeemed at last by the queenly patience and wisdom of the wives  in measure for measure the foul injustice of the judge and the foul cowardice of the brother are opposed to the victorious truth and adamantine purity of a woman  in coriolanus the mothers counsel acted upon in time would have saved her son from all evil his momentary forgetfulness of it is his ruin her prayer at last granted saves himnot indeed from death but from the curse of living as the destroyer of his country  and what shall i say of julia constant against the fickleness of a lover who is a mere wicked childof helena against the petulance and insult of a careless youthof the patience of hero the passion of beatrice and the calmly devoted wisdom of the unlessoned girl who appears among the helplessness the blindness and the vindictive passions of men as a gentle angel bringing courage and safety by her presence and defeating the worst malignities of crime by what women are fancied most to fail in precision and accuracy of thought  observe further among all the principal figures in shakespeares plays there is only one weak womanophelia and it is because she fails hamlet at the critical moment and is not and cannot in her nature be a guide to him when he needs her most that all the bitter catastrophe follows  finally though there are three wicked women among the principal figureslady macbeth regan and goneril they are felt at once to be frightful exceptions to the ordinary laws of life fatal in their influence also in proportion to the power for good which they have abandoned  such in broad light is shakespeares testimony to the position and character of women in human life  he represents them as infallibly faithful and wise counsellorsincorruptibly just and pure examplesstrong always to sanctify even when they cannot save  not as in any wise comparable in knowledge of the nature of man still less in his understanding of the causes and courses of fate but only as the writer who has given us the broadest view of the conditions and modes of ordinary thought in modern society i ask you next to receive the witness of walter scott  i put aside his merely romantic prose writings as of no value and though the early romantic poetry is very beautiful its testimony is of no weight other than that of a boys ideal  but his true works studied from scottish life bear a true witness and in the whole range of these there are but three men who reach the heroic type 23dandie dinmont rob roy and claverhouse of these one is a border farmer another a freebooter the third a soldier in a bad cause  and these touch the ideal of heroism only in their courage and faith together with a strong but uncultivated or mistakenly applied intellectual power while his younger men are the gentlemanly playthings of fantastic fortune and only by aid or accident of that fortune survive not vanquish the trials they involuntarily sustain  of any disciplined or consistent character earnest in a purpose wisely conceived or dealing with forms of hostile evil definitely challenged and resolutely subdued there is no trace in his conceptions of young men  whereas in his imaginations of womenin the characters of ellen douglas of flora macivor rose bradwardine catherine seyton diana vernon lilias redgauntlet alice bridgenorth alice lee and jeanie deanswith endless varieties of grace tenderness and intellectual power we find in all a quite infallible sense of dignity and justice a fearless instant and untiring selfsacrifice to even the appearance of duty much more to its real claims and finally a patient wisdom of deeplyrestrained affection which does infinitely more than protect its objects from a momentary error it gradually forms animates and exalts the characters of the unworthy lovers until at the close of the tale we are just able and no more to take patience in hearing of their unmerited success  so that in all cases with scott as with shakespeare it is the woman who watches over teaches and guides the youth it is never by any chance the youth who watches over or educates his mistress  next take though more briefly graver testimonythat of the great italians and greeks  you know well the plan of dantes great poem that it is a lovepoem to his dead lady a song of praise for her watch over his soul  stooping only to pity never to love she yet saves him from destructionsaves him from hell  he is going eternally astray in despair she comes down from heaven to his help and throughout the ascents of paradise is his teacher interpreting for him the most difficult truths divine and human and leading him with rebuke upon rebuke from star to star  i do not insist upon dantes conception if i began i could not cease  besides you might think this a wild imagination of one poets heart  so i will rather read to you a few verses of the deliberate writing of a knight of pisa to his living lady wholly characteristic of the feeling of all the noblest men of the thirteenth or early fourteenth century preserved among many other such records of knightly honour and love which dante rossetti has gathered for us from among the early italian poets   for lo thy law is passed that this my love should manifestly be to serve and honour thee and so i do and my delight is full accepted for the servant of thy rule  without almost i am all rapturous since thus my will was set to serve thou flower of joy thine excellence nor ever seems it anything could rouse a pain or a regret  but on thee dwells my every thought and sense considering that from thee all virtues spread as from a fountain head that in thy gift is wisdoms best avail and honour without fail with whom each sovereign good dwells separate fulfilling the perfection of thy state  lady since i conceived thy pleasurable aspect in my heart my life has been apart in shining brightness and the place of truth which till that time good sooth groped among shadows in a darkend place where many hours and days it hardly ever had rememberd good but now my servitude is thine and i am full of joy and rest a man from a wild beast thou madest me since for thy love i lived   you may think perhaps a greek knight would have had a lower estimate of women than this christian lover  his spiritual subjection to them was indeed not so absolute but as regards their own personal character it was only because you could not have followed me so easily that i did not take the greek women instead of shakespeares and instance for chief ideal types of human beauty and faith the simple mothers and wifes heart of andromache the divine yet rejected wisdom of cassandra the playful kindness and simple princesslife of happy nausicaa the housewifely calm of that of penelope with its watch upon the sea the ever patient fearless hopelessly devoted piety of the sister and daughter in antigone the bowing down of iphigenia lamblike and silent and finally the expectation of the resurrection made clear to the soul of the greeks in the return from her grave of that alcestis who to save her husband had passed calmly through the bitterness of death  now i could multiply witness upon witness of this kind upon you if i had time  i would take chaucer and show you why he wrote a legend of good women but no legend of good men  i would take spenser and show you how all his fairy knights are sometimes deceived and sometimes vanquished but the soul of una is never darkened and the spear of britomart is never broken  nay i could go back into the mythical teaching of the most ancient times and show you how the great peopleby one of whose princesses it was appointed that the lawgiver of all the earth should be educated rather than by his own kindredhow that great egyptian people wisest then of nations gave to their spirit of wisdom the form of a woman and into her hand for a symbol the weavers shuttle and how the name and the form of that spirit adopted believed and obeyed by the greeks became that athena of the olivehelm and cloudy shield to faith in whom you owe down to this date whatever you hold most precious in art in literature or in types of national virtue  but i will not wander into this distant and mythical element i will only ask you to give its legitimate value to the testimony of these great poets and men of the worldconsistent as you see it is on this head  i will ask you whether it can be supposed that these men in the main work of their lives are amusing themselves with a fictitious and idle view of the relations between man and woman nay worse than fictitious or idle for a thing may be imaginary yet desirable if it were possible  but this their ideal of woman is according to our common idea of the marriage relation wholly undesirable  the woman we say is not to guide nor even to think for herself  the man is always to be the wiser he is to be the thinker the ruler the superior in knowledge and discretion as in power  is it not somewhat important to make up our minds on this matter are all these great men mistaken or are we  are shakespeare and aeschylus dante and homer merely dressing dolls for us or worse than dolls unnatural visions the realization of which were it possible would bring anarchy into all households and ruin into all affections  nay if you can suppose this take lastly the evidence of facts given by the human heart itself  in all christian ages which have been remarkable for their purity or progress there has been absolute yielding of obedient devotion by the lover to his mistress  i say obedientnot merely enthusiastic and worshipping in imagination but entirely subject receiving from the beloved woman however young not only the encouragement the praise and the reward of all toil but so far as any choice is open or any question difficult of decision the direction of all toil  that chivalry to the abuse and dishonour of which are attributable primarily whatever is cruel in war unjust in peace or corrupt and ignoble in domestic relations and to the original purity and power of which we owe the defence alike of faith of law and of love that chivalry i say in its very first conception of honourable life assumes the subjection of the young knight to the command should it even be the command in capriceof his lady  it assumes this because its masters knew that the first and necessary impulse of every truly taught and knightly heart is this of blind service to its lady  that where that true faith and captivity are not all wayward and wicked passion must be and that in this rapturous obedience to the single love of his youth is the sanctification of all mans strength and the continuance of all his purposes  and this not because such obedience would be safe or honourable were it ever rendered to the unworthy but because it ought to be impossible for every noble youthit is impossible for every one rightly trainedto love any one whose gentle counsel he cannot trust or whose prayerful command he can hesitate to obey  i do not insist by any farther argument on this for i think it should commend itself at once to your knowledge of what has been and to your feeling of what should be  you cannot think that the buckling on of the knights armour by his ladys hand was a mere caprice of romantic fashion  it is the type of an eternal truth that the souls armour is never well set to the heart unless a womans hand has braced it and it is only when she braces it loosely that the honour of manhood fails  know you not those lovely linesi would they were learned by all youthful ladies of england   ah wasteful womanshe who may on her sweet self set her own price knowing he cannot choose but pay  how has she cheapend paradise how given for nought her priceless gift how spoiled the bread and spilld the wine which spent with due respective thrift had made brutes men and men divine 24   thus much then respecting the relations of lovers i believe you will accept  but what we too often doubt is the fitness of the continuance of such a relation throughout the whole of human life we think it right in the lover and mistress not in the husband and wife  that is to say we think that a reverent and tender duty is due to one whose affection we still doubt and whose character we as yet do but partially and distantly discern and that this reverence and duty are to be withdrawn when the affection has become wholly and limitlessly our own and the character has been so sifted and tried that we fear not to entrust it with the happiness of our lives  do you not see how ignoble this is as well as how unreasonable  do you not feel that marriagewhen it is marriage at allis only the seal which marks the vowed transition of temporary into untiring service and of fitful into eternal love  but how you will ask is the idea of this guiding function of the woman reconcilable with a true wifely subjection  simply in that it is a guiding not a determining function  let me try to show you briefly how these powers seem to be rightly distinguishable  we are foolish and without excuse foolish in speaking of the superiority of one sex to the other as if they could be compared in similar things  each has what the other has not  each completes the other and is completed by the other  they are in nothing alike and the happiness and perfection of both depends on each asking and receiving from the other what the other only can give  now their separate characters are briefly these  the mans power is active progressive defensive  he is eminently the doer the creator the discoverer the defender  his intellect is for speculation and invention his energy for adventure for war and for conquest wherever war is just wherever conquest necessary but the womans power is for rule not for battleand her intellect is not for invention or creation but for sweet ordering arrangement and decision  she sees the qualities of things their claims and their places  her great function is praise she enters into no contest but infallibly adjudges the crown of contest  by her office and place she is protected from all danger and temptation  the man in his rough work in open world must encounter all peril and trialto him therefore must be the failure the offence the inevitable error  often he must be wounded or subdued often misled and always hardened  but he guards the woman from all this within his house as ruled by her unless she herself has sought it need enter no danger no temptation no cause of error or offence  this is the true nature of homeit is the place of peace the shelter not only from all injury but from all terror doubt and division  in so far as it is not this it is not home so far as the anxieties of the outer life penetrate into it and the inconsistentlyminded unknown unloved or hostile society of the outer world is allowed by either husband or wife to cross the threshold it ceases to be home it is then only a part of that outer world which you have roofed over and lighted fire in  but so far as it is a sacred place a vestal temple a temple of the hearth watched over by household gods before whose faces none may come but those whom they can receive with loveso far as it is this and roof and fire are types only of a nobler shade and lightshade as of the rock in a weary land and light as of the pharos in the stormy seaso far it vindicates the name and fulfils the praise of home  and wherever a true wife comes this home is always round her  the stars only may be over her head the glowworm in the nightcold grass may be the only fire at her foot but home is yet wherever she is and for a noble woman it stretches far round her better than ceiled with cedar or painted with vermilion shedding its quiet light far for those who else were homeless  this then i believe to bewill you not admit it to bethe womans true place and power  but do not you see that to fulfil this she mustas far as one can use such terms of a human creaturebe incapable of error  so far as she rules all must be right or nothing is  she must be enduringly incorruptibly good instinctively infallibly wisewise not for selfdevelopment but for selfrenunciation  wise not that she may set herself above her husband but that she may never fail from his side  wise not with the narrowness of insolent and loveless pride but with the passionate gentleness of an infinitely variable because infinitely applicable modesty of servicethe true changefulness of woman  in that great sensela donna e mobile not qual pium al vento no nor yet variable as the shade by the light quivering aspen made but variable as the light manifold in fair and serene division that it may take the colour of all that it falls upon and exalt it  ii  i have been trying thus far to show you what should be the place and what the power of woman  now secondly we ask what kind of education is to fit her for these  and if you indeed think this a true conception of her office and dignity it will not be difficult to trace the course of education which would fit her for the one and raise her to the other  the first of our duties to herno thoughtful persons now doubt thisis to secure for her such physical training and exercise as may confirm her health and perfect her beauty the highest refinement of that beauty being unattainable without splendour of activity and of delicate strength  to perfect her beauty i say and increase its power it cannot be too powerful nor shed its sacred light too far  only remember that all physical freedom is vain to produce beauty without a corresponding freedom of heart there are two passages of that poet who is distinguished it seems to me from all othersnot by power but by exquisite rightness which point you to the source and describe to you in a few syllables the completion of womanly beauty  i will read the introductory stanzas but the last is the one i wish you specially to notice   three years she grew in sun and shower then nature said a lovelier flower on earth was never sown this child i to myself will take she shall be mine and i will make a lady of my own  myself will to my darling be both law and impulse and with me the girl in rock and plain in earth and heaven in glade and bower shall feel an overseeing power to kindle or restrain  the floating clouds their state shall lend to her for her the willow bend nor shall she fail to see even in the motions of the storm grace that shall mould the maidens form by silent sympathy  and vital feelings of delight shall rear her form to stately height  her virgin bosom swell such thoughts to lucy i will give while she and i together live here in this happy dell 25   vital feelings of delight observe  there are deadly feelings of delight but the natural ones are vital necessary to very life  and they must be feelings of delight if they are to be vital  do not think you can make a girl lovely if you do not make her happy there is not one restraint you put on a good girls naturethere is not one check you give to her instincts of affection or of effort which will not be indelibly written on her features with a hardness which is all the more painful because it takes away the brightness from the eyes of innocence and the charm from the brow of virtue  this for the means  now note the end  take from the same poet in two lines a perfect description of womanly beauty    a countenance in which did meet sweet records promises as sweet   the perfect loveliness of a womans countenance can only consist in that majestic peace which is founded in the memory of happy and useful yearsfull of sweet records and from the joining of this with that yet more majestic childishness which is still full of change and promiseopening alwaysmodest at once and bright with hope of better things to be won and to be bestowed  there is no old age where there is still that promise  thus then you have first to mould her physical frame and then as the strength she gains will permit you to fill and temper her mind with all knowledge and thoughts which tend to confirm its natural instincts of justice and refine its natural tact of love  all such knowledge should be given her as may enable her to understand and even to aid the work of men  and yet it should be given not as knowledgenot as if it were or could be for her an object to know but only to feel and to judge  it is of no moment as a matter of pride or perfectness in herself whether she knows many languages or one but it is of the utmost that she should be able to show kindness to a stranger and to understand the sweetness of a strangers tongue  it is of no moment to her own worth or dignity that she should be acquainted with this science or that but it is of the highest that she should be trained in habits of accurate thought that she should understand the meaning the inevitableness and the loveliness of natural laws and follow at least some one path of scientific attainment as far as to the threshold of that bitter valley of humiliation into which only the wisest and bravest of men can descend owning themselves for ever children gathering pebbles on a boundless shore  it is of little consequence how many positions of cities she knows or how many dates of events or names of celebrated personsit is not the object of education to turn the woman into a dictionary but it is deeply necessary that she should be taught to enter with her whole personality into the history she reads to picture the passages of it vitally in her own bright imagination to apprehend with her fine instincts the pathetic circumstances and dramatic relations which the historian too often only eclipses by his reasoning and disconnects by his arrangement  it is for her to trace the hidden equities of divine reward and catch sight through the darkness of the fateful threads of woven fire that connect error with retribution  but chiefly of all she is to be taught to extend the limits of her sympathy with respect to that history which is being for ever determined as the moments pass in which she draws her peaceful breath and to the contemporary calamity which were it but rightly mourned by her would recur no more hereafter  she is to exercise herself in imagining what would be the effects upon her mind and conduct if she were daily brought into the presence of the suffering which is not the less real because shut from her sight she is to be taught somewhat to understand the nothingness of the proportion which that little world in which she lives and loves bears to the world in which god lives and lovesand solemnly she is to be taught to strive that her thoughts of piety may not be feeble in proportion to the number they embrace nor her prayer more languid than it is for the momentary relief from pain of her husband or her child when it is uttered for the multitudes of those who have none to love themand is for all who are desolate and oppressed  thus far i think i have had your concurrence perhaps you will not be with me in what i believe is most needful for me to say  there is one dangerous science for womenone which they must indeed beware how they profanely touchthat of theology  strange and miserably strange that while they are modest enough to doubt their powers and pause at the threshold of sciences where every step is demonstrable and sure they will plunge headlong and without one thought of incompetency into that science in which the greatest men have trembled and the wisest erred  strange that they will complacently and pridefully bind up whatever vice or folly there is in them whatever arrogance petulance or blind incomprehensiveness into one bitter bundle of consecrated myrrh strange in creatures born to be love visible that where they can know least they will condemn first and think to recommend themselves to their master by crawling up the steps of his judgmentthrone to divide it with him  strangest of all that they should think they were led by the spirit of the comforter into habits of mind which have become in them the unmixed elements of home discomfort and that they dare to turn the household gods of christianity into ugly idols of their ownspiritual dolls for them to dress according to their caprice and from which their husbands must turn away in grieved contempt lest they should be shrieked at for breaking them  i believe then with this exception that a girls education should be nearly in its course and material of study the same as a boys but quite differently directed  a woman in any rank of life ought to know whatever her husband is likely to know but to know it in a different way  his command of it should be foundational and progressive hers general and accomplished for daily and helpful use  not but that it would often be wiser in men to learn things in a womanly sort of way for present use and to seek for the discipline and training of their mental powers in such branches of study as will be afterwards fittest for social service but speaking broadly a man ought to know any language or science he learns thoroughlywhile a woman ought to know the same language or science only so far as may enable her to sympathise in her husbands pleasures and in those of his best friends  yet observe with exquisite accuracy as far as she reaches  there is a wide difference between elementary knowledge and superficial knowledgebetween a firm beginning and an infirm attempt at compassing  a woman may always help her husband by what she knows however little by what she halfknows or misknows she will only tease him  and indeed if there were to be any difference between a girls education and a boys i should say that of the two the girl should be earlier led as her intellect ripens faster into deep and serious subjects  and that her range of literature should be not more but less frivolous calculated to add the qualities of patience and seriousness to her natural poignancy of thought and quickness of wit and also to keep her in a lofty and pure element of thought  i enter not now into any question of choice of books only let us be sure that her books are not heaped up in her lap as they fall out of the package of the circulating library wet with the last and lightest spray of the fountain of folly  or even of the fountain of wit for with respect to the sore temptation of novel reading it is not the badness of a novel that we should dread so much as its overwrought interest  the weakest romance is not so stupefying as the lower forms of religious exciting literature and the worst romance is not so corrupting as false history false philosophy or false political essays  but the best romance becomes dangerous if by its excitement it renders the ordinary course of life uninteresting and increases the morbid thirst for useless acquaintance with scenes in which we shall never be called upon to act  i speak therefore of good novels only and our modern literature is particularly rich in types of such  well read indeed these books have serious use being nothing less than treatises on moral anatomy and chemistry studies of human nature in the elements of it  but i attach little weight to this function  they are hardly ever read with earnestness enough to permit them to fulfil it  the utmost they usually do is to enlarge somewhat the charity of a kind reader or the bitterness of a malicious one for each will gather from the novel food for her own disposition  those who are naturally proud and envious will learn from thackeray to despise humanity those who are naturally gentle to pity it those who are naturally shallow to laugh at it  so also there might be a serviceable power in novels to bring before us in vividness a human truth which we had before dimly conceived but the temptation to picturesqueness of statement is so great that often the best writers of fiction cannot resist it and our views are rendered so violent and onesided that their vitality is rather a harm than good  without however venturing here on any attempt at decision how much novel reading should be allowed let me at least clearly assert thisthat whether novels or poetry or history be read they should be chosen not for their freedom from evil but for their possession of good  the chance and scattered evil that may here and there haunt or hide itself in a powerful book never does any harm to a noble girl but the emptiness of an author oppresses her and his amiable folly degrades her  and if she can have access to a good library of old and classical books there need be no choosing at all  keep the modern magazine and novel out of your girls way turn her loose into the old library every wet day and let her alone  she will find what is good for her you cannot  for there is just this difference between the making of a girls character and a boysyou may chisel a boy into shape as you would a rock or hammer him into it if he be of a better kind as you would a piece of bronze  but you cannot hammer a girl into anything  she grows as a flower doesshe will wither without sun she will decay in her sheath as a narcissus will if you do not give her air enough she may fall and defile her head in dust if you leave her without help at some moments of her life but you cannot fetter her she must take her own fair form and way if she take any and in mind as in body must have always   her household motions light and free and steps of virgin liberty   let her loose in the library i say as you do a fawn in a field it knows the bad weeds twenty times better than you and the good ones too and will eat some bitter and prickly ones good for it which you had not the slightest thought would have been so  then in art keep the finest models before her and let her practice in all accomplishments be accurate and thorough so as to enable her to understand more than she accomplishes  i say the finest modelsthat is to say the truest simplest usefullest note those epithets  they will range through all the arts  try them in music where you might think them the least applicable  i say the truest that in which the notes most closely and faithfully express the meaning of the words or the character of intended emotion again the simplest that in which the meaning and melody are attained with the fewest and most significant notes possible and finally the usefullest that music which makes the best words most beautiful which enchants them in our memories each with its own glory of sound and which applies them closest to the heart at the moment we need them  and not only in the material and in the course but yet more earnestly in the spirit of it let a girls education be as serious as a boys  you bring up your girls as if they were meant for sideboard ornaments and then complain of their frivolity  give them the same advantages that you give their brothersappeal to the same grand instincts of virtue in them teach them also that courage and truth are the pillars of their being do you think that they would not answer that appeal brave and true as they are even now when you know that there is hardly a girls school in this christian kingdom where the childrens courage or sincerity would be thought of half so much importance as their way of coming in at a door and when the whole system of society as respects the mode of establishing them in life is one rotten plague of cowardice and imposturecowardice in not daring to let them live or love except as their neighbours choose and imposture in bringing for the purposes of our own pride the full glow of the worlds worst vanity upon a girls eyes at the very period when the whole happiness of her future existence depends upon her remaining undazzled  and give them lastly not only noble teachings but noble teachers you consider somewhat before you send your boy to school what kind of a man the master iswhatsoever kind of a man he is you at least give him full authority over your son and show some respect to him yourselfif he comes to dine with you you do not put him at a side table  you know also that at college your childs immediate tutor will be under the direction of some still higher tutorfor whom you have absolute reverence  you do not treat the dean of christ church or the master of trinity as your inferiors  but what teachers do you give your girls and what reverence do you show to the teachers you have chosen  is a girl likely to think her own conduct or her own intellect of much importance when you trust the entire formation of her character moral and intellectual to a person whom you let your servants treat with less respect than they do your housekeeper as if the soul of your child were a less charge than jams and groceries and whom you yourself think you confer an honour upon by letting her sometimes sit in the drawing room in the evening  thus then of literature as her help and thus of art  there is one more help which she cannot do withoutone which alone has sometimes done more than all other influences besidesthe help of wild and fair nature  hear this of the education of joan of arc   the education of this poor girl was mean according to the present standard was ineffably grand according to a purer philosophic standard and only not good for our age because for us it would be unattainable   next after her spiritual advantages she owed most to the advantages of her situation  the fountain of domremy was on the brink of a boundless forest and it was haunted to that degree by fairies that the parish priest cure was obliged to read mass there once a year in order to keep them in decent bounds  but the forests of domremythose were the glories of the land for in them abode mysterious powers and ancient secrets that towered into tragic strength  abbeys there were and abbey windowslike moorish temples of the hindoos that exercised even princely power both in touraine and in the german diets  these had their sweet bells that pierced the forests for many a league at matins or vespers and each its own dreamy legend  few enough and scattered enough were these abbeys so as in no degree to disturb the deep solitude of the region yet many enough to spread a network or awning of christian sanctity over what else might have seemed a heathen wilderness 26  now you cannot indeed have here in england woods eighteen miles deep to the centre but you can perhaps keep a fairy or two for your children yet if you wish to keep them  but do you wish it suppose you had each at the back of your houses a garden large enough for your children to play in with just as much lawn as would give them room to runno moreand that you could not change your abode but that if you chose you could double your income or quadruple it by digging a coal shaft in the middle of the lawn and turning the flowerbeds into heaps of coke  would you do it  i hope not  i can tell you you would be wrong if you did though it gave you income sixtyfold instead of fourfold  yet this is what you are doing with all england  the whole country is but a little garden not more than enough for your children to run on the lawns of if you would let them all run there  and this little garden you will turn into furnace ground and fill with heaps of cinders if you can and those children of yours not you will suffer for it  for the fairies will not be all banished there are fairies of the furnace as of the wood and their first gifts seem to be sharp arrows of the mighty but their last gifts are coals of juniper  and yet i cannotthough there is no part of my subject that i feel morepress this upon you for we made so little use of the power of nature while we had it that we shall hardly feel what we have lost just on the other side of the mersey you have your snowdon and your menai straits and that mighty granite rock beyond the moors of anglesea splendid in its heathery crest and foot planted in the deep sea once thought of as sacreda divine promontory looking westward the holy head or headland still not without awe when its red light glares first through storm  these are the hills and these the bays and blue inlets which among the greeks would have been always loved always fateful in influence on the national mind that snowdon is your parnassus but where are its muses  that holyhead mountain is your island of aegina but where is its temple to minerva  shall i read you what the christian minerva had achieved under the shadow of our parnassus up to the year 1848here is a little account of a welsh school from page 261 of the report on wales published by the committee of council on education  this is a school close to a town containing 5000 persons   i then called up a larger class most of whom had recently come to the school  three girls repeatedly declared they had never heard of christ and two that they had never heard of god  two out of six thought christ was on earth now they might have had a worse thought perhaps three knew nothing about the crucifixion  four out of seven did not know the names of the months nor the number of days in a year  they had no notion of addition beyond two and two or three and three their minds were perfect blanks   oh ye women of england from the princess of that wales to the simplest of you do not think your own children can be brought into their true fold of rest while these are scattered on the hills as sheep having no shepherd  and do not think your daughters can be trained to the truth of their own human beauty while the pleasant places which god made at once for their schoolroom and their playground lie desolate and defiled  you cannot baptize them rightly in those inchdeep fonts of yours unless you baptize them also in the sweet waters which the great lawgiver strikes forth for ever from the rocks of your native landwaters which a pagan would have worshipped in their purity and you worship only with pollution  you cannot lead your children faithfully to those narrow axehewn church altars of yours while the dark azure altars in heaventhe mountains that sustain your island thronemountains on which a pagan would have seen the powers of heaven rest in every wreathed cloudremain for you without inscription altars built not to but by an unknown god  iii  thus far then of the nature thus far of the teaching of woman and thus of her household office and queenliness  we now come to our last our widest questionwhat is her queenly office with respect to the state  generally we are under an impression that a mans duties are public and a womans private  but this is not altogether so  a man has a personal work or duty relating to his own home and a public work or duty which is the expansion of the other relating to the state  so a woman has a personal work or duty relating to her own home and a public work or duty which is also the expansion of that  now the mans work for his own home is as has been said to secure its maintenance progress and defence the womans to secure its order comfort and loveliness  expand both these functions  the mans duty as a member of a commonwealth is to assist in the maintenance in the advance in the defence of the state  the womans duty as a member of the commonwealth is to assist in the ordering in the comforting and in the beautiful adornment of the state  what the man is at his own gate defending it if need be against insult and spoil that also not in a less but in a more devoted measure he is to be at the gate of his country leaving his home if need be even to the spoiler to do his more incumbent work there  and in like manner what the woman is to be within her gates as the centre of order the balm of distress and the mirror of beauty that she is also to be without her gates where order is more difficult distress more imminent loveliness more rare  and as within the human heart there is always set an instinct for all its real dutiesan instinct which you cannot quench but only warp and corrupt if you withdraw it from its true purpose as there is the intense instinct of love which rightly disciplined maintains all the sanctities of life and misdirected undermines them and must do either the one or the otherso there is in the human heart an inextinguishable instinct the love of power which rightly directed maintains all the majesty of law and life and misdirected wrecks them  deep rooted in the innermost life of the heart of man and of the heart of woman god set it there and god keeps it therevainly as falsely you blame or rebuke the desire of powerfor heavens sake and for mans sake desire it all you can  but what power that is all the question  power to destroy the lions limb and the dragons breath  not so  power to heal to redeem to guide and to guard  power of the sceptre and shield the power of the royal hand that heals in touchingthat binds the fiend and looses the captive the throne that is founded on the rock of justice and descended from only by steps of mercy  will you not covet such power as this and seek such throne as this and be no more housewives but queens  it is now long since the women of england arrogated universally a title which once belonged to nobility only and having once been in the habit of accepting the simple title of gentlewoman as correspondent to that of gentleman insisted on the privilege of assuming the title of lady 27 which properly corresponds only to the title of lord  i do not blame them for this but only for their narrow motive in this  i would have them desire and claim the title of lady provided they claim not merely the title but the office and duty signified by it  lady means breadgiver or loafgiver and lord means maintainer of laws and both titles have reference not to the law which is maintained in the house nor to the bread which is given to the household but to law maintained for the multitude and to bread broken among the multitude  so that a lord has legal claim only to his title in so far as he is the maintainer of the justice of the lord of lords and a lady has legal claim to her title only so far as she communicates that help to the poor representatives of her master which women once ministering to him of their substance were permitted to extend to that master himself and when she is known as he himself once was in breaking of bread  and this beneficent and legal dominion this power of the dominus or houselord and of the domina or houselady is great and venerable not in the number of those through whom it has lineally descended but in the number of those whom it grasps within its sway it is always regarded with reverent worship wherever its dynasty is founded on its duty and its ambition correlative with its beneficence  your fancy is pleased with the thought of being noble ladies with a train of vassals  be it so you cannot be too noble and your train cannot be too great but see to it that your train is of vassals whom you serve and feed not merely of slaves who serve and feed you and that the multitude which obeys you is of those whom you have comforted not oppressedwhom you have redeemed not led into captivity  and this which is true of the lower or household dominion is equally true of the queenly dominion that highest dignity is open to you if you will also accept that highest duty  rex et regina roi et reinerightdoers they differ but from the lady and lord in that their power is supreme over the mind as over the person that they not only feed and clothe but direct and teach  and whether consciously or not you must be in many a heart enthroned there is no putting by that crown queens you must always be queens to your lovers queens to your husbands and your sons queens of higher mystery to the world beyond which bows itself and will for ever bow before the myrtle crown and the stainless sceptre of womanhood  but alas you are too often idle and careless queens grasping at majesty in the least things while you abdicate it in the greatest and leaving misrule and violence to work their will among men in defiance of the power which holding straight in gift from the prince of all peace the wicked among you betray and the good forget  prince of peace  note that name  when kings rule in that name and nobles and the judges of the earth they also in their narrow place and mortal measure receive the power of it  there are no other rulers than they other rule than theirs is but misrule they who govern verily dei gratia are all princes yes or princesses of peace  there is not a war in the world no nor an injustice but you women are answerable for it not in that you have provoked but in that you have not hindered  men by their nature are prone to fight they will fight for any cause or for none  it is for you to choose their cause for them and to forbid them when there is no cause  there is no suffering no injustice no misery in the earth but the guilt of it lies with you  men can bear the sight of it but you should not be able to bear it  men may tread it down without sympathy in their own struggle but men are feeble in sympathy and contracted in hope it is you only who can feel the depths of pain and conceive the way of its healing  instead of trying to do this you turn away from it you shut yourselves within your park walls and garden gates and you are content to know that there is beyond them a whole world in wildernessa world of secrets which you dare not penetrate and of suffering which you dare not conceive  i tell you that this is to me quite the most amazing among the phenomena of humanity  i am surprised at no depths to which when once warped from its honour that humanity can be degraded  i do not wonder at the misers death with his hands as they relax dropping gold  i do not wonder at the sensualists life with the shroud wrapped about his feet  i do not wonder at the singlehanded murder of a single victim done by the assassin in the darkness of the railway or reed shadow of the marsh  i do not even wonder at the myriadhanded murder of multitudes done boastfully in the daylight by the frenzy of nations and the immeasurable unimaginable guilt heaped up from hell to heaven of their priests and kings  but this is wonderful to meoh how wonderfulto see the tender and delicate woman among you with her child at her breast and a power if she would wield it over it and over its father purer than the air of heaven and stronger than the seas of earthnay a magnitude of blessing which her husband would not part with for all that earth itself though it were made of one entire and perfect chrysolite to see her abdicate this majesty to play at precedence with her nextdoor neighbour  this is wonderfuloh wonderfulto see her with every innocent feeling fresh within her go out in the morning into her garden to play with the fringes of its guarded flowers and lift their heads when they are drooping with her happy smile upon her face and no cloud upon her brow because there is a little wall around her place of peace  and yet she knows in her heart if she would only look for its knowledge that outside of that little rosecovered wall the wild grass to the horizon is torn up by the agony of men and beat level by the drift of their lifeblood  have you ever considered what a deep under meaning there lies or at least may be read if we choose in our custom of strewing flowers before those whom we think most happy  do you suppose it is merely to deceive them into the hope that happiness is always to fall thus in showers at their feetthat wherever they pass they will tread on herbs of sweet scent and that the rough ground will be made smooth for them by depths of roses  so surely as they believe that they will have instead to walk on bitter herbs and thorns and the only softness to their feet will be of snow  but it is not thus intended they should believe there is a better meaning in that old custom  the path of a good woman is indeed strewn with flowers but they rise behind her steps not before them  her feet have touched the meadows and left the daisies rosy  you think that only a lovers fancyfalse and vain  how if it could be true  you think this also perhaps only a poets fancy    even the light harebell raised its head elastic from her airy tread   but it is little to say of a woman that she only does not destroy where she passes  she should revive the harebells should bloom not stoop as she passes  you think i am rushing into wild hyperbole  pardon me not a whiti mean what i say in calm english spoken in resolute truth  you have heard it saidand i believe there is more than fancy even in that saying but let it pass for a fanciful onethat flowers only flourish rightly in the garden of some one who loves them  i know you would like that to be true you would think it a pleasant magic if you could flush your flowers into brighter bloom by a kind look upon them  nay more if your look had the power not only to cheer but to guardif you could bid the black blight turn away and the knotted caterpillar spareif you could bid the dew fall upon them in the drought and say to the south wind in frostcome thou south and breathe upon my garden that the spices of it may flow out  this you would think a great thing  and do you think it not a greater thing that all this and how much more than this you can do for fairer flowers than theseflowers that could bless you for having blessed them and will love you for having loved them flowers that have thoughts like yours and lives like yours and which once saved you save for ever  is this only a little power  far among the moorlands and the rocksfar in the darkness of the terrible streetsthese feeble florets are lying with all their fresh leaves torn and their stems broken  will you never go down to them nor set them in order in their little fragrant beds nor fence them in their trembling from the fierce wind  shall morning follow morning for you but not for them and the dawn rise to watch far away those frantic dances of death 28 but no dawn rise to breathe upon these living banks of wild violet and woodbine and rose nor call to you through your casementcall not giving you the name of the english poets lady but the name of dantes great matilda who on the edge of happy lethe stood wreathing flowers with flowers saying   come into the garden maud for the black bat night has flown and the woodbine spices are wafted abroad and the musk of the roses blown   will you not go down among themamong those sweet living things whose new courage sprung from the earth with the deep colour of heaven upon it is starting up in strength of goodly spire and whose purity washed from the dust is opening bud by bud into the flower of promiseand still they turn to you and for you the larkspur listensi hear i hear  and the lily whispersi wait  did you notice that i missed two lines when i read you that first stanza and think that i had forgotten them  hear them now   come into the garden maud for the black bat night has flown come into the garden maud i am here at the gate alone   who is it think you who stands at the gate of this sweeter garden alone waiting for you  did you ever hear not of a maud but a madeleine who went down to her garden in the dawn and found one waiting at the gate whom she supposed to be the gardener  have you not sought him oftensought him in vain all through the night sought him in vain at the gate of that old garden where the fiery sword is set  he is never there but at the gate of this garden he is waiting alwayswaiting to take your handready to go down to see the fruits of the valley to see whether the vine has flourished and the pomegranate budded  there you shall see with him the little tendrils of the vines that his hand is guidingthere you shall see the pomegranate springing where his hand cast the sanguine seedmore  you shall see the troops of the angel keepers that with their wings wave away the hungry birds from the path sides where he has sown and call to each other between the vineyard rows take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vines for our vines have tender grapes  ohyou queensyou queens among the hills and happy greenwood of this land of yours shall the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests and in your cities shall the stones cry out against you that they are the only pillows where the son of man can lay his head    preface to the later editions    being now fiftyone years old and little likely to change my mind hereafter on any important subject of thought unless through weakness of age i wish to publish a connected series of such parts of my works as now seem to me right and likely to be of permanent use  in doing so i shall omit much but not attempt to mend what i think worth reprinting  a young man necessarily writes otherwise than an old one and it would be worse than wasted time to try to recast the juvenile language  nor is it to be thought that i am ashamed even of what i cancel for great part of my earlier work was rapidly written for temporary purposes and is now unnecessary though true even to truism  what i wrote about religion was on the contrary painstaking and i think forcible as compared with most religious writing especially in its frankness and fearlessness  but it was wholly mistaken  for i had been educated in the doctrines of a narrow sect and had read history as obliquely as sectarians necessarily must  mingled among these either unnecessary or erroneous statements i find indeed some that might be still of value but these in my earlier books disfigured by affected language partly through the desire to be thought a fine writer and partly as in the second volume of modern painters in the notion of returning as far as i could to what i thought the better style of old english literature especially to that of my then favourite in prose richard hooker  for these reasonsthough as respects either art policy or morality as distinct from religion i not only still hold but would even wish strongly to reaffirm the substance of what i said in my earliest booksi shall reprint scarcely anything in this series out of the first and second volumes of modern painters and shall omit much of the seven lamps and stones of venice but all my books written within the last fifteen years will be republished without change as new editions of them are called for with here and there perhaps an additional note and having their text divided for convenient reference into paragraphs consecutive through each volume  i shall also throw together the shorter fragments that bear on each other and fill in with such unprinted lectures or studies as seem to me worth preserving so as to keep the volumes on an average composed of about a hundred leaves each  the first book of which a new edition is required chances to be sesame and lilies from which i now detach the whole preface about the alps for use elsewhere and to i which i add a lecture given in ireland on a subject closely connected with that of the book itself  i am glad that it should be the first of the complete series for many reasons though in now looking over these two lectures i am painfully struck by the waste of good work in them they cost me much thought and much strong emotion but it was foolish to suppose that i could rouse my audiences in a little while to any sympathy with the temper into which i had brought myself by years of thinking over subjects full of pain while if i missed my purpose at the time it was little to be hoped i could attain it afterwards since phrases written for oral delivery become ineffective when quietly read  yet i should only take away what good is in them if i tried to translate them into the language of books nor indeed could i at all have done so at the time of their delivery my thoughts then habitually and impatiently putting themselves into forms fit only for emphatic speech and thus i am startled in my review of them to find that though there is much forgive me the impertinence which seems to me accurately and energetically said there is scarcely anything put in a form to be generally convincing or even easily intelligible  and i can well imagine a reader laying down the book without being at all moved by it still less guided to any definite course of action  i think however if i now say briefly and clearly what i meant my hearers to understand and what i wanted and still would fain have them to do there may afterwards be found some better service in the passionately written text  the first lecture says or tries to say that life being very short and the quiet hours of it few we ought to waste none of them in reading valueless books and that valuable books should in a civilized country be within the reach of every one printed in excellent form for a just price but not in any vile vulgar or by reason of smallness of type physically injurious form at a vile price  for we none of us need many books and those which we need ought to be clearly printed on the best paper and strongly bound and though we are indeed now a wretched and povertystruck nation and hardly able to keep soul and body together still as no person in decent circumstances would put on his table confessedly bad wine or bad meat without being ashamed so he need not have on his shelves illprinted or loosely and wretchedlystitched books for though few can be rich yet every man who honestly exerts himself may i think still provide for himself and his family good shoes good gloves strong harness for his cart or carriage horses and stout leather binding for his books  and i would urge upon every young man as the beginning of his due and wise provision for his household to obtain as soon as he can by the severest economy a restricted serviceable and steadilyhowever slowly increasing series of books for use through life making his little library of all the furniture in his room the most studied and decorative piece every volume having its assigned place like a little statue in its niche and one of the earliest and strictest lessons to the children of the house being how to turn the pages of their own literary possessions lightly and deliberately with no chance of tearing or dogs ears  that is my notion of the founding of kings treasuries and the first lecture is intended to show somewhat the use and preciousness of their treasures  but the two following ones have wider scope being written in the hope of awakening the youth of england so far as my poor words might have any power with them to take some thought of the purposes of the life into which they are entering and the nature of the world they have to conquer  these two lectures are fragmentary and illarranged but not i think diffuse or much compressible  the entire gist and conclusion of them however is in the last six paragraphs of the third lecture which i would beg the reader to look over not once nor twice rather than any other part of the book for they contain the best expression i have yet been able to put in words of what so far as is within my power i mean henceforward both to do myself and to plead with all over whom i have any influence to do also according to their means  the letters begun on the first day of this year to the workmen of england having the object of originating if possible this movement among them in true alliance with whatever trustworthy element of help they can find in the higher classes  after these paragraphs let me ask you to read by the fiery light of recent events the fable at p 170 1 and then paragraphs 129131 2 and observe my statement respecting the famine at orissa is not rhetorical but certified by official documents as within the truth  five hundred thousand persons at least died by starvation in our british dominions wholly in consequence of carelessness and want of forethought  keep that well in your memory and note it as the best possible illustration of modern political economy in true practice and of the relations it has accomplished between supply and demand  then begin the second lecture and all will read clear enough i think to the end only since that second lecture was written questions have arisen respecting the education and claims of women which have greatly troubled simple minds and excited restless ones  i am sometimes asked my thoughts on this matter and i suppose that some girl readers of the second lecture may at the end of it desire to be told summarily what i would have them do and desire in the present state of things  this then is what i would say to any girl who had confidence enough in me to believe what i told her or to do what i asked her  first be quite sure of one thing that however much you may know and whatever advantages you may possess and however good you may be you have not been singled out by the god who made you from all the other girls in the world to be especially informed respecting his own nature and character  you have not been born in a luminous point upon the surface of the globe where a perfect theology might be expounded to you from your youth up and where everything you were taught would be true and everything that was enforced upon you right  of all the insolent all the foolish persuasions that by any chance could enter and hold your empty little heart this is the proudest and foolishestthat you have been so much the darling of the heavens and favourite of the fates as to be born in the very nick of time and in the punctual place when and where pure divine truth had been sifted from the errors of the nations and that your papa had been providentially disposed to buy a house in the convenient neighbourhood of the steeple under which that immaculate and final verity would be beautifully proclaimed  do not think it child it is not so  this on the contrary is the fact unpleasant you may think it pleasant it seems to methat you with all your pretty dresses and dainty looks and kindly thoughts and saintly aspirations are not one whit more thought of or loved by the great maker and master than any poor little red black or blue savage running wild in the pestilent woods or naked on the hot sands of the earth  and that of the two you probably know less about god than she does the only difference being that she thinks little of him that is right and you much that is wrong  that then is the first thing to make sure ofthat you are not yet perfectly well informed on the most abstruse of all possible subjects and that if you care to behave with modesty or propriety you had better be silent about it  the second thing which you may make sure of is that however good you may be you have faults that however dull you may be you can find out what some of them are and that however slight they may be you had better make somenot too painful but patienteffort to get quit of them  and so far as you have confidence in me at all trust me for this that how many soever you may find or fancy your faults to be there are only two that are of real consequence idleness and cruelty  perhaps you may be proud  well we can get much good out of pride if only it be not religious  perhaps you may be vain it is highly probable and very pleasant for the people who like to praise you  perhaps you are a little envious  that is really very shocking but thenso is everybody else  perhaps also you are a little malicious which i am truly concerned to hear but should probably only the more if i knew you enjoy your conversation  but whatever else you may be you must not be useless and you must not be cruel  if there is any one point which in six thousand years of thinking about right and wrong wise and good men have agreed upon or successively by experience discovered it is that god dislikes idle and cruel people more than any others that his first order is work while you have light and his second be merciful while you have mercy  work while you have light especially while you have the light of morning  there are few things more wonderful to me than that old people never tell young ones how precious their youth is  they sometimes sentimentally regret their own earlier days sometimes prudently forget them often foolishly rebuke the young often more foolishly indulge often most foolishly thwart and restrain but scarcely ever warn or watch them  remember then that i at least have warned you that the happiness of your life and its power and its part and rank in earth or in heaven depend on the way you pass your days now  they are not to be sad days  far from that the first duty of young people is to be delighted and delightful but they are to be in the deepest sense solemn days  there is no solemnity so deep to a rightlythinking creature as that of dawn but not only in that beautiful sense but in all their character and method they are to be solemn days  take your latin dictionary and look out solennis and fix the sense of the word well in your mind and remember that every day of your early life is ordaining irrevocably for good or evil the custom and practice of your soul ordaining either sacred customs of dear and lovely recurrence or trenching deeper and deeper the furrows for seed of sorrow  now therefore see that no day passes in which you do not make yourself a somewhat better creature  and in order to do that find out first what you are now  do not think vaguely about it take pen and paper and write down as accurate a description of yourself as you can with the date to it  if you dare not do so find out why you dare not and try to get strength of heart enough to look yourself fairly in the face in mind as well as body  i do not doubt but that the mind is a less pleasant thing to look at than the face and for that very reason it needs more looking at so always have two mirrors on your toilet table and see that with proper care you dress body and mind before them daily  after the dressing is once over for the day think no more about it  as your hair will blow about your ears so your temper and thoughts will get ruffled with the days work and may need sometimes twice dressing but i dont want you to carry about a mental pocketcomb only to be smooth braided always in the morning  write down then frankly what you are or at least what you think yourself not dwelling upon those inevitable faults which i have just told you are of little consequence and which the action of a right life will shake or smooth away but that you may determine to the best of your intelligence what you are good for and can be made into  you will find that the mere resolve not to be useless and the honest desire to help other people will in the quickest and delicatest ways improve yourself  thus from the beginning consider all your accomplishments as means of assistance to others read attentively in this volume paragraphs 74 75 19 and 79 3 and you will understand what i mean with respect to languages and music  in music especially you will soon find what personal benefit there is in being serviceable  it is probable that however limited your powers you have voice and ear enough to sustain a note of moderate compass in a concerted piecethat then is the first thing to make sure you can do  get your voice disciplined and clear and think only of accuracy never of effect or expression if you have any soul worth expressing it will show itself in your singing but most likely there are very few feelings in you at present needing any particular expression and the one thing you have to do is to make a clearvoiced little instrument of yourself which other people can entirely depend upon for the note wanted so in drawing as soon as you can set down the right shape of anything and thereby explain its character to another person or make the look of it clear and interesting to a child you will begin to enjoy the art vividly for its own sake and all your habits of mind and powers of memory will gain precision  but if you only try to make showy drawings for praise or pretty ones for amusement your drawing will have little of real interest for you and no educational power whatever  then besides this more delicate work resolve to do every day some that is useful in the vulgar sense  learn first thoroughly the economy of the kitchen the good and bad qualities of every common article of food and the simplest and best modes of their preparation  when you have time go and help in the cooking of poorer families and show them how to make as much of everything as possible and how to make little nice coaxing and tempting them into tidy and pretty ways and pleading for wellfolded table cloths however coarse and for a flower or two out of the garden to strew on them  if you manage to get a clean tablecloth bright plates on it and a good dish in the middle of your own cooking you may ask leave to say a short grace and let your religious ministries be confined to that much for the present  again let a certain part of your day as little as you choose but not to be broken in upon be set apart for making strong and pretty dresses for the poor  learn the sound qualities of all useful stuffs and make everything of the best you can get whatever its price  i have many reasons for desiring you to do thistoo many to be told just nowtrust me and be sure you get everything as good as can be  and if in the villainous state of modern trade you cannot get it good at any price buy its raw material and set some of the poor women about you to spin and weave till you have got stuff that can be trusted  and then every day make some little piece of useful clothing sewn with your own fingers as strongly as it can be stitched and embroider it or otherwise beautify it moderately with fine needlework such as a girl may be proud of having done  and accumulate these things by you until you hear of some honest persons in need of clothing which may often too sorrowfully be and even though you should be deceived and give them to the dishonest and hear of their being at once taken to the pawnbrokers never mind that for the pawnbroker must sell them to some one who has need of them  that is no business of yours what concerns you is only that when you see a halfnaked child you should have good and fresh clothes to give it if its parents will let it be taught to wear them  if they will not consider how they came to be of such a mind which it will be wholesome for you beyond most subjects of inquiry to ascertain  and after you have gone on doing this a little while you will begin to understand the meaning of at least one chapter of your bible proverbs xxxi without need of any laboured comment sermon or meditation  in these then and of course in all minor ways besides that you can discover in your own household you must be to the best of your strength usefully employed during the greater part of the day so that you may be able at the end of it to say as proudly as any peasant that you have not eaten the bread of idleness  then secondly i said you are not to be cruel  perhaps you think there is no chance of your being so and indeed i hope it is not likely that you should be deliberately unkind to any creature but unless you are deliberately kind to every creature you will often be cruel to many  cruel partly through want of imagination a far rarer and weaker faculty in women than men and yet more at the present day through the subtle encouragement of your selfishness by the religious doctrine that all which we now suppose to be evil will be brought to a good end doctrine practically issuing not in less earnest efforts that the immediate unpleasantness may be averted from ourselves but in our remaining satisfied in the contemplation of its ultimate objects when it is inflicted on others  it is not likely that the more accurate methods of recent mental education will now long permit young people to grow up in the persuasion that in any danger or distress they may expect to be themselves saved by the providence of god while those around them are lost by his improvidence  but they may be yet long restrained from rightly kind action and long accustomed to endure both their own pain occasionally and the pain of others always with an unwise patience by misconception of the eternal and incurable nature of real evil  observe therefore carefully in this matter there are degrees of pain as degrees of faultfulness which are altogether conquerable and which seem to be merely forms of wholesome trial or discipline  your fingers tingle when you go out on a frosty morning and are all the warmer afterwards your limbs are weary with wholesome work and lie down in the pleasanter rest you are tried for a little while by having to wait for some promised good and it is all the sweeter when it comes  but you cannot carry the trial past a certain point  let the cold fasten on your hand in an extreme degree and your fingers will moulder from their sockets fatigue yourself but once to utter exhaustion and to the end of life you shall not recover the former vigour of your frame  let heartsickness pass beyond a certain bitter point and the heart loses its life for ever  now the very definition of evil is in this irremediableness  it means sorrow or sin which ends in death and assuredly as far as we know or can conceive there are many conditions both of pain and sin which cannot but so end  of course we are ignorant and blind creatures and we cannot know what seeds of good may be in present suffering or present crime but with what we cannot know we are not concerned  it is conceivable that murderers and liars may in some distant world be exalted into a higher humanity than they could have reached without homicide or falsehood but the contingency is not one by which our actions should be guided  there is indeed a better hope that the beggar who lies at our gates in misery may within gates of pearl be comforted but the master whose words are our only authority for thinking so never himself inflicted disease as a blessing nor sent away the hungry unfed or the wounded unhealed  believe me then the only right principle of action here is to consider good and evil as defined by our natural sense of both and to strive to promote the one and to conquer the other with as hearty endeavour as if there were indeed no other world than this above all get quit of the absurd idea that heaven will interfere to correct great errors while allowing its laws to take their course in punishing small ones  if you prepare a dish of food carelessly you do not expect providence to make it palatable neither if through years of folly you misguide your own life need you expect divine interference to bring round everything at last for the best i tell you positively the world is not so constituted  the consequences of great mistakes are just as sure as those of small ones and the happiness of your whole life and of all the lives over which you have power depend as literally on your own common sense and discretion as the excellence and order of the feast of a day  think carefully and bravely over these things and you will find them true  having found them so think also carefully over your own position in life  i assume that you belong to the middle or upper classes and that you would shrink from descending into a lower sphere  you may fancy you would not  nay if you are very good stronghearted and romantic perhaps you really would not but it is not wrong that you should  you have then i suppose good food pretty rooms to live in pretty dresses to wear power of obtaining every rational and wholesome pleasure you are moreover probably gentle and grateful and in the habit of every day thanking god for these things  but why do you thank him  is it because in these matters as well as in your religious knowledge you think he has made a favourite of you  is the essential meaning of your thanksgiving lord i thank thee that i am not as other girls are not in that i fast twice in the week while they feast but in that i feast seven times a week while they fast and are you quite sure this is a pleasing form of thanksgiving to your heavenly father suppose you saw one of your own true earthly sisters lucy or emily cast out of your mortal fathers house starving helpless heartbroken and that every morning when you went into your fathers room you said to him how good you are father to give me what you dont give lucy are you sure that whatever anger your parent might have just cause for against your sister he would be pleased by that thanksgiving or flattered by that praise  nay are you even sure that you are so much the favouritesuppose that all this while he loves poor lucy just as well as you and is only trying you through her pain and perhaps not angry with her in anywise but deeply angry with you and all the more for your thanksgivings  would it not be well that you should think and earnestly too over this standing of yours and all the more if you wish to believe that text which clergymen so much dislike preaching on how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god  you do not believe it now or you would be less complacent in your state and you cannot believe it at all until you know that the kingdom of god meansnot meat and drink but justice peace and joy in the holy ghost nor until you know also that such joy is not by any means necessarily in going to church or in singing hymns but may be joy in a dance or joy in a jest or joy in anything you have deserved to possess or that you are willing to give but joy in nothing that separates you as by any strange favour from your fellowcreatures that exalts you through their degradationexempts you from their toilor indulges you in time of their distress  think then and some day i believe you will feel alsono morbid passion of pity such as would turn you into a black sister of charity but the steady fire of perpetual kindness which will make you a bright one  i speak in no disparagement of them i know well how good the sisters of charity are and how much we owe to them but all these professional pieties except so far as distinction or association may be necessary for effectiveness of work are in their spirit wrong and in practice merely plaster the sores of disease that ought never to have been permitted to exist encouraging at the same time the herd of less excellent women in frivolity by leading them to think that they must either be good up to the black standard or cannot be good for anything  wear a costume by all means if you like but let it be a cheerful and becoming one and be in your heart a sister of charity always without either veiled or voluble declaration of it  as i pause before ending my prefacethinking of one or two more points that are difficult to write ofi find a letter in the times from a french lady which says all i want so beautifully that i will print it just as it stands   sirit is often said that one example is worth many sermons shall i be judged presumptuous if i point out one which seems to me so striking just now that however painful i cannot help dwelling upon it  it is the share the sad and large share that french society and its recent habits of luxury of expenses of dress of indulgence in every kind of extravagant dissipation has to lay to its own door in its actual crisis of ruin misery and humiliation  if our menageres can be cited as an example to english housewives so alas can other classes of our society be set up as an examplenot to be followed  bitter must be the feelings of many a french woman whose days of luxury and expensive habits are at an end and whose bills of bygone splendour lie with a heavy weight on her conscience if not on her purse  with us the evil has spread high and low  everywhere have the examples given by the highest ladies in the land been followed but too successfully  every year did dress become more extravagant entertainments more costly expenses of every kind more considerable  lower and lower became the tone of society its good breeding its delicacy  more and more were monde and demimonde associated in newspaper accounts of fashionable doings in scandalous gossip on racecourses in premieres representations in imitation of each others costumes mobiliers and slang  living beyond ones means became habitualalmost necessaryfor every one to keep up with if not to go beyond every one else  what the result of all this has been we now see in the wreck of our prosperity in the downfall of all that seemed brightest and highest  deeply and fearfully impressed by what my own country has incurred and is suffering i cannot help feeling sorrowful when i see in england signs of our besetting sins appearing also  paint and chignons slang and vaudevilles knowing anonymas by name and reading doubtfully moral novels are in themselves small offences although not many years ago they would have appeared very heinous ones yet they are quick and tempting conveyances on a very dangerous highroad  i would that all englishwomen knew how they are looked up to from abroadwhat a high opinion what honour and reverence we foreigners have for their principles their truthfulness the fresh and pure innocence of their daughters the healthy youthfulness of their lovely children  may i illustrate this by a short example which happened very near me  during the days of the emeutes of 1848 all the houses in paris were being searched for firearms by the mob  the one i was living in contained none as the master of the house repeatedly assured the furious and incredulous republicans  they were going to lay violent hands on him when his wife an english lady hearing the loud discussion came bravely forward and assured them that no arms were concealed  vous etes anglaise nous vous croyons les anglaises disent toujours la verite was the immediate answer and the rioters quietly left  now sir shall i be accused of unjustified criticism if loving and admiring your country as these lines will prove certain new features strike me as painful discrepancies in english life  far be it from me to preach the contempt of all that can make life lovable and wholesomely pleasant  i love nothing better than to see a woman nice neat elegant looking her best in the prettiest dress that her taste and purse can afford or your bright fresh young girls fearlessly and perfectly sitting their horses or adorning their houses as pretty sic it is not quite grammar but it is better than if it were as care trouble and refinement can make them  it is the degree beyond that which to us has proved so fatal and that i would our example could warn you from as a small repayment for your hospitality and friendliness to us in our days of trouble  may englishwomen accept this in a kindly spirit as a newyears wish from  a french lady  dec 29   that then is the substance of what i would fain say convincingly if it might be to my girl friends at all events with certainty in my own mind that i was thus far a safe guide to them  for other and older readers it is needful i should write a few words more respecting what opportunity i have had to judge or right i have to speak of such things for indeed too much of what i have said about women has been said in faith only  a wise and lovely english lady told me when sesame and lilies first appeared that she was sure the sesame would be useful but that in the lilies i had been writing of what i knew nothing about  which was in a measure too true and also that it is more partial than my writings are usually  for as ellesmere spoke his speech on the intervention not indeed otherwise than he felt but yet altogether for the sake of gretchen so i wrote the lilies to please one girl and were it not for what i remember of her and of few besides should now perhaps recast some of the sentences in the lilies in a very different tone  for as years have gone by it has chanced to me untowardly in some respects fortunately in others because it enables me to read history more clearly to see the utmost evil that is in women while i have had but to believe the utmost good  the best women are indeed necessarily the most difficult to know they are recognized chiefly in the happiness of their husbands and the nobleness of their children they are only to be divined not discerned by the stranger and sometimes seem almost helpless except in their homes yet without the help of one of them 4 to whom this book is dedicated the day would probably have come before now when i should have written and thought no more  on the other hand the fashion of the time renders whatever is forward coarse or senseless in feminine nature too palpable to all men the weak picturesqueness of my earlier writings brought me acquainted with much of their emptiest enthusiasm and the chances of later life gave me opportunities of watching women in states of degradation and vindictiveness which opened to me the gloomiest secrets of greek and syrian tragedy  i have seen them betray their household charities to lust their pledged love to devotion i have seen mothers dutiful to their children as medea and children dutiful to their parents as the daughter of herodias  but my trust is still unmoved in the preciousness of the natures that are so fatal in their error and i leave the words of the lilies unchanged believing yet that no man ever lived a right life who had not been chastened by a womans love strengthened by her courage and guided by her discretion  what i might myself have been so helped i rarely indulge in the idleness of thinking but what i am since i take on me the function of a teacher it is well that the reader should know as far as i can tell him  not an unjust person not an unkind one not a false one a lover of order labour and peace  that it seems to me is enough to give me right to say all i care to say on ethical subjects more i could only tell definitely through details of autobiography such as none but prosperous and in the simple sense of the word faultless lives could justifyand mine has been neither  yet if any one skilled in reading the torn manuscripts of the human soul cares for more intimate knowledge of me he may have it by knowing with what persons in past history i have most sympathy  i will name three  in all that is strongest and deepest in methat fits me for my work and gives light or shadow to my being i have sympathy with guido guinicelli  in my constant natural temper and thoughts of things and of people with marmontel  in my enforced and accidental temper and thoughts of things and of people with dean swift  any one who can understand the natures of those three men can understand mine and having said so much i am content to leave both life and work to be remembered or forgotten as their uses may deserve  denmark hill  1st january 1871    lecture iiithe mystery of life and its arts    lecture delivered in the theatre of the royal college of science dublin 1868   when i accepted the privilege of addressing you today i was not aware of a restriction with respect to the topics of discussion which may be brought before this society 29a restriction which though entirely wise and right under the circumstances contemplated in its introduction would necessarily have disabled me thinking as i think from preparing any lecture for you on the subject of art in a form which might be permanently useful  pardon me therefore in so far as i must transgress such limitation for indeed my infringement will be of the letternot of the spiritof your commands  in whatever i may say touching the religion which has been the foundation of art or the policy which has contributed to its power if i offend one i shall offend all for i shall take no note of any separations in creeds or antagonisms in parties neither do i fear that ultimately i shall offend any by provingor at least stating as capable of positive proofthe connection of all that is best in the crafts and arts of man with the simplicity of his faith and the sincerity of his patriotism  but i speak to you under another disadvantage by which i am checked in frankness of utterance not here only but everywhere  namely that i am never fully aware how far my audiences are disposed to give me credit for real knowledge of my subject or how far they grant me attention only because i have been sometimes thought an ingenious or pleasant essayist upon it  for i have had what in many respects i boldly call the misfortune to set my words sometimes prettily together not without a foolish vanity in the poor knack that i had of doing so  until i was heavily punished for this pride by finding that many people thought of the words only and cared nothing for their meaning  happily therefore the power of using such pleasant languageif indeed it ever were mineis passing away from me and whatever i am now able to say at all i find myself forced to say with great plainness  for my thoughts have changed also as my words have and whereas in earlier life what little influence i obtained was due perhaps chiefly to the enthusiasm with which i was able to dwell on the beauty of the physical clouds and of their colours in the sky so all the influence i now desire to retain must be due to the earnestness with which i am endeavouring to trace the form and beauty of another kind of cloud than those the bright cloud of which it is writtenwhat is your life  it is even as a vapour that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away  i suppose few people reach the middle or latter period of their age without having at some moment of change or disappointment felt the truth of those bitter words and been startled by the fading of the sunshine from the cloud of their life into the sudden agony of the knowledge that the fabric of it was as fragile as a dream and the endurance of it as transient as the dew  but it is not always that even at such times of melancholy surprise we can enter into any true perception that this human life shares in the nature of it not only the evanescence but the mystery of the cloud that its avenues are wreathed in darkness and its forms and courses no less fantastic than spectral and obscure so that not only in the vanity which we cannot grasp but in the shadow which we cannot pierce it is true of this cloudy life of ours that man walketh in a vain shadow and disquieteth himself in vain  and least of all whatever may have been the eagerness of our passions or the height of our pride are we able to understand in its depth the third and most solemn character in which our life is like those clouds of heaven that to it belongs not only their transcience not only their mystery but also their power that in the cloud of the human soul there is a fire stronger than the lightning and a grace more precious than the rain and that though of the good and evil it shall one day be said alike that the place that knew them knows them no more there is an infinite separation between those whose brief presence had there been a blessing like the mist of eden that went up from the earth to water the garden and those whose place knew them only as a drifting and changeful shade of whom the heavenly sentence is that they are wells without water clouds that are carried with a tempest to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever  to those among us however who have lived long enough to form some just estimate of the rate of the changes which are hour by hour in accelerating catastrophe manifesting themselves in the laws the arts and the creeds of men it seems to me that now at least if never at any former time the thoughts of the true nature of our life and of its powers and responsibilities should present themselves with absolute sadness and sternness  and although i know that this feeling is much deepened in my own mind by disappointment which by chance has attended the greater number of my cherished purposes i do not for that reason distrust the feeling itself though i am on my guard against an exaggerated degree of it  nay i rather believe that in periods of new effort and violent change disappointment is a wholesome medicine and that in the secret of it as in the twilight so beloved by titian we may see the colours of things with deeper truth than in the most dazzling sunshine  and because these truths about the works of men which i want to bring today before you are most of them sad ones though at the same time helpful and because also i believe that your kind irish hearts will answer more gladly to the truthful expression of a personal feeling than to the exposition of an abstract principle i will permit myself so much unreserved speaking of my own causes of regret as may enable you to make just allowance for what according to your sympathies you will call either the bitterness or the insight of a mind which has surrendered its best hopes and been foiled in its favourite aims  i spent the ten strongest years of my life from twenty to thirty in endeavouring to show the excellence of the work of the man whom i believed and rightly believed to be the greatest painter of the schools of england since reynolds  i had then perfect faith in the power of every great truth of beauty to prevail ultimately and take its right place in usefulness and honour and i strove to bring the painters work into this due place while the painter was yet alive but he knew better than i the uselessness of talking about what people could not see for themselves  he always discouraged me scornfully even when he thanked meand he died before even the superficial effect of my work was visible  i went on however thinking i could at least be of use to the public if not to him in proving his power  my books got talked about a little  the prices of modern pictures generally rose and i was beginning to take some pleasure in a sense of gradual victory when fortunately or unfortunately an opportunity of perfect trial undeceived me at once and for ever  the trustees of the national gallery commissioned me to arrange the turner drawings there and permitted me to prepare three hundred examples of his studies from nature for exhibition at kensington  at kensington they were and are placed for exhibition but they are not exhibited for the room in which they hang is always empty  wellthis showed me at once that those ten years of my life had been in their chief purpose lost  for that i did not so much care i had at least learned my own business thoroughly and should be able as i fondly supposed after such a lesson now to use my knowledge with better effect  but what i did care for was theto me frightfuldiscovery that the most splendid genius in the arts might be permitted by providence to labour and perish uselessly that in the very fineness of it there might be something rendering it invisible to ordinary eyes but that with this strange excellence faults might be mingled which would be as deadly as its virtues were vain that the glory of it was perishable as well as invisible and the gift and grace of it might be to us as snow in summer and as rain in harvest  that was the first mystery of life to me  but while my best energy was given to the study of painting i had put collateral effort more prudent if less enthusiastic into that of architecture and in this i could not complain of meeting with no sympathy  among several personal reasons which caused me to desire that i might give this my closing lecture on the subject of art here in ireland one of the chief was that in reading it i should stand near the beautiful buildingthe engineers school of your collegewhich was the first realization i had the joy to see of the principles i had until then been endeavouring to teach but which alas is now to me no more than the richly canopied monument of one of the most earnest souls that ever gave itself to the arts and one of my truest and most loving friends benjamin woodward  nor was it here in ireland only that i received the help of irish sympathy and genius  when to another friend sir thomas deane with mr woodward was entrusted the building of the museum at oxford the best details of the work were executed by sculptors who had been born and trained here and the first window of the facade of the building in which was inaugurated the study of natural science in england in true fellowship with literature was carved from my design by an irish sculptor  you may perhaps think that no man ought to speak of disappointment to whom even in one branch of labour so much success was granted had mr woodward now been beside me i had not so spoken but his gentle and passionate spirit was cut off from the fulfilment of its purposes and the work we did together is now become vain  it may not be so in future but the architecture we endeavoured to introduce is inconsistent alike with the reckless luxury the deforming mechanism and the squalid misery of modern cities among the formative fashions of the day aided especially in england by ecclesiastical sentiment it indeed obtained notoriety and sometimes behind an engine furnace or a railroad bank you may detect the pathetic discord of its momentary grace and with toil decipher its floral carvings choked with soot  i felt answerable to the schools i loved only for their injury  i perceived that this new portion of my strength had also been spent in vain and from amidst streets of iron and palaces of crystal shrank back at last to the carving of the mountain and colour of the flower  and still i could tell of failure and failure repeated as years went on but i have trespassed enough on your patience to show you in part the causes of my discouragement  now let me more deliberately tell you its results  you know there is a tendency in the minds of many men when they are heavily disappointed in the main purposes of their life to feel and perhaps in warning perhaps in mockery to declare that life itself is a vanity because it has disappointed them they think its nature is of disappointment always or at best of pleasure that can be grasped by imagination only that the cloud of it has no strength nor fire within but is a painted cloud only to be delighted in yet despised  you know how beautifully pope has expressed this particular phase of thought   meanwhile opinion gilds with varying rays these painted clouds that beautify our days each want of happiness by hope supplied and each vacuity of sense by pride hope builds as fast as knowledge can destroy in follys cup still laughs the bubble joy one pleasure past another still we gain and not a vanity is given in vain   but the effect of failure upon my own mind has been just the reverse of this  the more that my life disappointed me the more solemn and wonderful it became to me  it seemed contrarily to popes saying that the vanity of it was indeed given in vain but that there was something behind the veil of it which was not vanity  it became to me not a painted cloud but a terrible and impenetrable one  not a mirage which vanished as i drew near but a pillar of darkness to which i was forbidden to draw near  for i saw that both my own failure and such success in petty things as in its poor triumph seemed to me worse than failure came from the want of sufficiently earnest effort to understand the whole law and meaning of existence and to bring it to noble and due end as on the other hand i saw more and more clearly that all enduring success in the arts or in any other occupation had come from the ruling of lower purposes not by a conviction of their nothingness but by a solemn faith in the advancing power of human nature or in the promise however dimly apprehended that the mortal part of it would one day be swallowed up in immortality and that indeed the arts themselves never had reached any vital strength or honour but in the effort to proclaim this immortality and in the service either of great and just religion or of some unselfish patriotism and law of such national life as must be the foundation of religion  nothing that i have ever said is more true or necessarynothing has been more misunderstood or misappliedthan my strong assertion that the arts can never be right themselves unless their motive is right  it is misunderstood this way  weak painters who have never learned their business and cannot lay a true line continually come to me crying outlook at this picture of mine it must be good i had such a lovely motive  i have put my whole heart into it and taken years to think over its treatment  well the only answer for these people isif one had the cruelty to make itsir you cannot think over anything in any number of yearsyou havent the head to do it and though you had fine motives strong enough to make you burn yourself in a slow fire if only first you could paint a picture you cant paint one nor half an inch of one you havent the hand to do it  but far more decisively we have to say to the men who do know their business or may know it if they choosesir you have this gift and a mighty one see that you serve your nation faithfully with it it is a greater trust than ships and armies  you might cast them away if you were their captain with less treason to your people than in casting your own glorious power away and serving the devil with it instead of men  ships and armies you may replace if they are lost but a great intellect once abused is a curse to the earth for ever  this then i meant by saying that the arts must have noble motive this also i said respecting them that they never had prospered nor could prosper but when they had such true purpose and were devoted to the proclamation of divine truth or law  and yet i saw also that they had always failed in this proclamationthat poetry and sculpture and painting though only great when they strove to teach us something about the gods never had taught us anything trustworthy about the gods but had always betrayed their trust in the crisis of it and with their powers at the full reach became ministers to pride and to lust  and i felt also with increasing amazement the unconquerable apathy in ourselves and hearers no less than in these the teachers and that while the wisdom and rightness of every act and art of life could only be consistent with a right understanding of the ends of life we were all plunged as in a languid dreamour hearts fat and our eyes heavy and our ears closed lest the inspiration of hand or voice should reach uslest we should see with our eyes and understand with our hearts and be healed  this intense apathy in all of us is the first great mystery of life it stands in the way of every perception every virtue  there is no making ourselves feel enough astonishment at it  that the occupations or pastimes of life should have no motive is understandable butthat life itself should have no motivethat we neither care to find out what it may lead to nor to guard against its being for ever taken away from ushere is a mystery indeed for just suppose i were able to call at this moment to any one in this audience by name and to tell him positively that i knew a large estate had been lately left to him on some curious conditions but that though i knew it was large i did not know how large nor even where it waswhether in the east indies or the west or in england or at the antipodes  i only knew it was a vast estate and that there was a chance of his losing it altogether if he did not soon find out on what terms it had been left to him  suppose i were able to say this positively to any single man in this audience and he knew that i did not speak without warrant do you think that he would rest content with that vague knowledge if it were anywise possible to obtain more  would he not give every energy to find some trace of the facts and never rest till he had ascertained where this place was and what it was like  and suppose he were a young man and all he could discover by his best endeavour was that the estate was never to be his at all unless he persevered during certain years of probation in an orderly and industrious life but that according to the rightness of his conduct the portion of the estate assigned to him would be greater or less so that it literally depended on his behaviour from day to day whether he got ten thousand a year or thirty thousand a year or nothing whatever would you not think it strange if the youth never troubled himself to satisfy the conditions in any way nor even to know what was required of him but lived exactly as he chose and never inquired whether his chances of the estate were increasing or passing away well you know that this is actually and literally so with the greater number of the educated persons now living in christian countries  nearly every man and woman in any company such as this outwardly professes to believeand a large number unquestionably think they believemuch more than this not only that a quite unlimited estate is in prospect for them if they please the holder of it but that the infinite contrary of such a possessionan estate of perpetual miseryis in store for them if they displease this great landholder this great heavenholder  and yet there is not one in a thousand of these human souls that cares to think for ten minutes of the day where this estate is or how beautiful it is or what kind of life they are to lead in it or what kind of life they must lead to obtain it  you fancy that you care to know this  so little do you care that probably at this moment many of you are displeased with me for talking of the matter  you came to hear about the art of this world not about the life of the next and you are provoked with me for talking of what you can hear any sunday in church  but do not be afraid  i will tell you something before you go about pictures and carvings and pottery and what else you would like better to hear of than the other world  nay perhaps you say we want you to talk of pictures and pottery because we are sure that you know something of them and you know nothing of the other world  well i dont  that is quite true  but the very strangeness and mystery of which i urge you to take notice is in thisthat i do notnor you either  can you answer a single bold question unflinchingly about that other worldare you sure there is a heaven  sure there is a hell  sure that men are dropping before your faces through the pavements of these streets into eternal fire or sure that they are not  sure that at your own death you are going to be delivered from all sorrow to be endowed with all virtue to be gifted with all felicity and raised into perpetual companionship with a king compared to whom the kings of the earth are as grasshoppers and the nations as the dust of his feet  are you sure of this or if not sure do any of us so much as care to make it sure and if not how can anything that we do be righthow can anything we think be wise what honour can there be in the arts that amuse us or what profit in the possessions that please  is not this a mystery of life  but farther you may perhaps think it a beneficent ordinance for the generality of men that they do not with earnestness or anxiety dwell on such questions of the future because the business of the day could not be done if this kind of thought were taken by all of us for the morrow  be it so  but at least we might anticipate that the greatest and wisest of us who were evidently the appointed teachers of the rest would set themselves apart to seek out whatever could be surely known of the future destinies of their race and to teach this in no rhetorical or ambiguous manner but in the plainest and most severely earnest words  now the highest representatives of men who have thus endeavoured during the christian era to search out these deep things and relate them are dante and milton  there are none who for earnestness of thought for mastery of word can be classed with these  i am not at present mind you speaking of persons set apart in any priestly or pastoral office to deliver creeds to us or doctrines but of men who try to discover and set forth as far as by human intellect is possible the facts of the other world divines may perhaps teach us how to arrive there but only these two poets have in any powerful manner striven to discover or in any definite words professed to tell what we shall see and become there or how those upper and nether worlds are and have been inhabited  and what have they told us  miltons account of the most important event in his whole system of the universe the fall of the angels is evidently unbelievable to himself and the more so that it is wholly founded on and in a great part spoiled and degraded from hesiods account of the decisive war of the younger gods with the titans  the rest of his poem is a picturesque drama in which every artifice of invention is visibly and consciously employed not a single fact being for an instant conceived as tenable by any living faith  dantes conception is far more intense and by himself for the time not to be escaped from it is indeed a vision but a vision only and that one of the wildest that ever entranced a soula dream in which every grotesque type or phantasy of heathen tradition is renewed and adorned and the destinies of the christian church under their most sacred symbols become literally subordinate to the praise and are only to be understood by the aid of one dear florentine maiden  i tell you truly that as i strive more with this strange lethargy and trance in myself and awake to the meaning and power of life it seems daily more amazing to me that men such as these should dare to play with the most precious truths or the most deadly untruths by which the whole human race listening to them could be informed or deceivedall the world their audiences for ever with pleased ear and passionate heartand yet to this submissive infinitude of souls and evermore succeeding and succeeding multitude hungry for bread of life they do but play upon sweetly modulated pipes with pompous nomenclature adorn the councils of hell touch a troubadours guitar to the courses of the suns and fill the openings of eternity before which prophets have veiled their faces and which angels desire to look into with idle puppets of their scholastic imagination and melancholy lights of frantic faith in their lost mortal love  is not this a mystery of life  but more  we have to remember that these two great teachers were both of them warped in their temper and thwarted in their search for truth  they were men of intellectual war unable through darkness of controversy or stress of personal grief to discern where their own ambition modified their utterances of the moral law or their own agony mingled with their anger at its violation  but greater men than these have beeninnocentheartedtoo great for contest  men like homer and shakespeare of so unrecognised personality that it disappears in future ages and becomes ghostly like the tradition of a lost heathen god  men therefore to whose unoffended uncondemning sight the whole of human nature reveals itself in a pathetic weakness with which they will not strive or in mournful and transitory strength which they dare not praise and all pagan and christian civilization thus becomes subject to them  it does not matter how little or how much any of us have read either of homer or shakespeare everything round us in substance or in thought has been moulded by them  all greek gentlemen were educated under homer  all roman gentlemen by greek literature  all italian and french and english gentlemen by roman literature and by its principles  of the scope of shakespeare i will say only that the intellectual measure of every man since born in the domains of creative thought may be assigned to him according to the degree in which he has been taught by shakespeare  well what do these two men centres of mortal intelligence deliver to us of conviction respecting what it most behoves that intelligence to grasp  what is their hopetheir crown of rejoicing what manner of exhortation have they for us or of rebuke what lies next their own hearts and dictates their undying words  have they any peace to promise to our unrestany redemption to our misery  take homer first and think if there is any sadder image of human fate than the great homeric story  the main features in the character of achilles are its intense desire of justice and its tenderness of affection  and in that bitter song of the iliad this man though aided continually by the wisest of the gods and burning with the desire of justice in his heart becomes yet through ill governed passion the most unjust of men  and full of the deepest tenderness in his heart becomes yet through illgoverned passion the most cruel of men  intense alike in love and in friendship he loses first his mistress and then his friend for the sake of the one he surrenders to death the armies of his own land for the sake of the other he surrenders all  will a man lay down his life for his friend  yeaeven for his dead friend this achilles though goddessborn and goddesstaught gives up his kingdom his country and his lifecasts alike the innocent and guilty with himself into one gulf of slaughter and dies at last by the hand of the basest of his adversaries  is not this a mystery of life  but what then is the message to us of our own poet and searcher of hearts after fifteen hundred years of christian faith have been numbered over the graves of men  are his words more cheerful than the heathensis his hope more nearhis trust more surehis reading of fate more happy  ah no  he differs from the heathen poet chiefly in thisthat he recognizes for deliverance no gods nigh at hand and that by petty chanceby momentary follyby broken messageby fools tyrannyor traitors snare the strongest and most righteous are brought to their ruin and perish without word of hope  he indeed as part of his rendering of character ascribes the power and modesty of habitual devotion to the gentle and the just  the deathbed of katharine is bright with visions of angels and the great soldierking standing by his few dead acknowledges the presence of the hand that can save alike by many or by few  but observe that from those who with deepest spirit meditate and with deepest passion mourn there are no such words as these nor in their hearts are any such consolations  instead of the perpetual sense of the helpful presence of the deity which through all heathen tradition is the source of heroic strength in battle in exile and in the valley of the shadow of death we find only in the great christian poet the consciousness of a moral law through which the gods are just and of our pleasant vices make instruments to scourge us and of the resolved arbitration of the destinies that conclude into precision of doom what we feebly and blindly began and force us when our indiscretion serves us and our deepest plots do pall to the confession that theres a divinity that shapes our ends rough hew them how we will  is not this a mystery of life  be it so then  about this human life that is to be or that is the wise religious men tell us nothing that we can trust and the wise contemplative men nothing that can give us peace  but there is yet a third class to whom we may turnthe wise practical men we have sat at the feet of the poets who sang of heaven and they have told us their dreams  we have listened to the poets who sang of earth and they have chanted to us dirges and words of despair but there is one class of men more men not capable of vision nor sensitive to sorrow but firm of purposepractised in business learned in all that can be by handling known  men whose hearts and hopes are wholly in this present world from whom therefore we may surely learn at least how at present conveniently to live in it  what will they say to us or show us by example  these kings these councillorsthese statesmen and builders of kingdomsthese capitalists and men of business who weigh the earth and the dust of it in a balance  they know the world surely and what is the mystery of life to us is none to them  they can surely show us how to live while we live and to gather out of the present world what is best  i think i can best tell you their answer by telling you a dream i had once  for though i am no poet i have dreams sometimes i dreamed i was at a childs mayday party in which every means of entertainment had been provided for them by a wise and kind host it was in a stately house with beautiful gardens attached to it and the children had been set free in the rooms and gardens with no care whatever but how to pass their afternoon rejoicingly  they did not indeed know much about what was to happen next day and some of them i thought were a little frightened because there was a chance of their being sent to a new school where there were examinations but they kept the thoughts of that out of their heads as well as they could and resolved to enjoy themselves  the house i said was in a beautiful garden and in the garden were all kinds of flowers sweet grassy banks for rest and smooth lawns for play and pleasant streams and woods and rocky places for climbing  and the children were happy for a little while but presently they separated themselves into parties and then each party declared it would have a piece of the garden for its own and that none of the others should have anything to do with that piece  next they quarrelled violently which pieces they would have and at last the boys took up the thing as boys should do practically and fought in the flowerbeds till there was hardly a flower left standing then they trampled down each others bits of the garden out of spite and the girls cried till they could cry no more and so they all lay down at last breathless in the ruin and waited for the time when they were to be taken home in the evening 30  meanwhile the children in the house had been making themselves happy also in their manner  for them there had been provided every kind of indoor pleasure  there was music for them to dance to and the library was open with all manner of amusing books and there was a museum full of the most curious shells and animals and birds and there was a workshop with lathes and carpenters tools for the ingenious boys and there were pretty fantastic dresses for the girls to dress in and there were microscopes and kaleidoscopes and whatever toys a child could fancy and a table in the diningroom loaded with everything nice to eat  but in the midst of all this it struck two or three of the more practical children that they would like some of the brassheaded nails that studded the chairs and so they set to work to pull them out  presently the others who were reading or looking at shells took a fancy to do the like and in a little while all the children nearly were spraining their fingers in pulling out brassheaded nails  with all that they could pull out they were not satisfied and then everybody wanted some of somebody elses and at last the really practical and sensible ones declared that nothing was of any real consequence that afternoon except to get plenty of brassheaded nails and that the books and the cakes and the microscopes were of no use at all in themselves but only if they could be exchanged for nailheads  and at last they began to fight for nailheads as the others fought for the bits of garden only here and there a despised one shrank away into a corner and tried to get a little quiet with a book in the midst of the noise but all the practical ones thought of nothing else but counting nailheads all the afternooneven though they knew they would not be allowed to carry so much as one brass knob away with them  but noit waswho has most nails  i have a hundred and you have fifty or i have a thousand and you have two  i must have as many as you before i leave the house or i cannot possibly go home in peace  at last they made so much noise that i awoke and thought to myself what a false dream that is of children  the child is the father of the man and wiser  children never do such foolish things  only men do  but there is yet one last class of persons to be interrogated  the wise religious men we have asked in vain the wise contemplative men in vain the wise worldly men in vain  but there is another group yet  in the midst of this vanity of empty religionof tragic contemplationof wrathful and wretched ambition and dispute for dust there is yet one great group of persons by whom all these disputers livethe persons who have determined or have had it by a beneficent providence determined for them that they will do something useful that whatever may be prepared for them hereafter or happen to them here they will at least deserve the food that god gives them by winning it honourably  and that however fallen from the purity or far from the peace of eden they will carry out the duty of human dominion though they have lost its felicity and dress and keep the wilderness though they no more can dress or keep the garden  thesehewers of wood and drawers of waterthese bent under burdens or torn of scourgesthese that dig and weavethat plant and build workers in wood and in marble and in ironby whom all food clothing habitation furniture and means of delight are produced for themselves and for all men beside men whose deeds are good though their words may be few men whose lives are serviceable be they never so short and worthy of honour be they never so humblefrom these surely at least we may receive some clear message of teaching and pierce for an instant into the mystery of life and of its arts  yes from these at last we do receive a lesson  but i grieve to say or ratherfor that is the deeper truth of the matteri rejoice to saythis message of theirs can only be received by joining themnot by thinking about them  you sent for me to talk to you of art and i have obeyed you in coming  but the main thing i have to tell you isthat art must not be talked about  the fact that there is talk about it at all signifies that it is ill done or cannot be done  no true painter ever speaks or ever has spoken much of his art  the greatest speak nothing  even reynolds is no exception for he wrote of all that he could not himself do and was utterly silent respecting all that he himself did  the moment a man can really do his work he becomes speechless about it  all words become idle to himall theories  does a bird need to theorize about building its nest or boast of it when built  all good work is essentially done that waywithout hesitation without difficulty without boasting and in the doers of the best there is an inner and involuntary power which approximates literally to the instinct of an animalnay i am certain that in the most perfect human artists reason does not supersede instinct but is added to an instinct as much more divine than that of the lower animals as the human body is more beautiful than theirs that a great singer sings not with less instinct than the nightingale but with moreonly more various applicable and governable that a great architect does not build with less instinct than the beaver or the bee but with morewith an innate cunning of proportion that embraces all beauty and a divine ingenuity of skill that improvises all construction  but be that as it maybe the instinct less or more than that of inferior animalslike or unlike theirs still the human art is dependent on that first and then upon an amount of practice of scienceand of imagination disciplined by thought which the true possessor of it knows to be incommunicable and the true critic of it inexplicable except through long process of laborious years  that journey of lifes conquest in which hills over hills and alps on alps arose and sankdo you think you can make another trace it painlessly by talking  why you cannot even carry us up an alp by talking  you can guide us up it step by step no otherwiseeven so best silently  you girls who have been among the hills know how the bad guide chatters and gesticulates and it is put your foot here and mind how you balance yourself there but the good guide walks on quietly without a word only with his eyes on you when need is and his arm like an iron bar if need be  in that slow way also art can be taughtif you have faith in your guide and will let his arm be to you as an iron bar when need is but in what teacher of art have you such faith  certainly not in me for as i told you at first i know well enough it is only because you think i can talk not because you think i know my business that you let me speak to you at all  if i were to tell you anything that seemed to you strange you would not believe it and yet it would only be in telling you strange things that i could be of use to you  i could be of great use to youinfinite use with brief saying if you would believe it but you would not just because the thing that would be of real use would displease you you are all wild for instance with admiration of gustave dore well suppose i were to tell you in the strongest terms i could use that gustave dores art was badbad not in weaknessnot in failurebut bad with dreadful powerthe power of the furies and the harpies mingled enraging and polluting that so long as you looked at it no perception of pure or beautiful art was possible for you  suppose i were to tell you that  what would be the use would you look at gustave dore less  rather more i fancy  on the other hand i could soon put you into good humour with me if i chose  i know well enough what you like and how to praise it to your better liking  i could talk to you about moonlight and twilight and spring flowers and autumn leaves and the madonnas of raphaelhow motherly and the sibyls of michael angelohow majestic and the saints of angelicohow pious and the cherubs of correggiohow delicious  old as i am i could play you a tune on the harp yet that you would dance to  but neither you nor i should be a bit the better or wiser or if we were our increased wisdom could be of no practical effect  for indeed the arts as regards teachableness differ from the sciences also in this that their power is founded not merely on facts which can be communicated but on dispositions which require to be created  art is neither to be achieved by effort of thinking nor explained by accuracy of speaking  it is the instinctive and necessary result of power which can only be developed through the mind of successive generations and which finally burst into life under social conditions as slow of growth as the faculties they regulate  whole aeras of mighty history are summed and the passions of dead myriads are concentrated in the existence of a noble art and if that noble art were among us we should feel it and rejoice not caring in the least to hear lectures on it and since it is not among us be assured we have to go back to the root of it or at least to the place where the stock of it is yet alive and the branches began to die  and now may i have your pardon for pointing out partly with reference to matters which are at this time of greater moment than the artsthat if we undertook such recession to the vital germ of national arts that have decayed we should find a more singular arrest of their power in ireland than in any other european country for in the eighth century ireland possessed a school of art in her manuscripts and sculpture which in many of its qualities apparently in all essential qualities of decorative inventionwas quite without rival seeming as if it might have advanced to the highest triumphs in architecture and in painting  but there was one fatal flaw in its nature by which it was stayed and stayed with a conspicuousness of pause to which there is no parallel  so that long ago in tracing the progress of european schools from infancy to strength i chose for the students of kensington in a lecture since published two characteristic examples of early art of equal skill but in the one case skill which was progressivein the other skill which was at pause  in the one case it was work receptive of correctionhungry for correction and in the other work which inherently rejected correction  i chose for them a corrigible eve and an incorrigible angel and i grieve to say that the incorrigible angel was also an irish angel 31  and the fatal difference lay wholly in this  in both pieces of art there was an equal falling short of the needs of fact but the lombardic eve knew she was in the wrong and the irish angel thought himself all right  the eager lombardic sculptor though firmly insisting on his childish idea yet showed in the irregular broken touches of the features and the imperfect struggle for softer lines in the form a perception of beauty and law that he could not render there was the strain of effort under conscious imperfection in every line  but the irish missalpainter had drawn his angel with no sense of failure in happy complacency and put red dots into the palm of each hand and rounded the eyes into perfect circles and i regret to say left the mouth out altogether with perfect satisfaction to himself  may i without offence ask you to consider whether this mode of arrest in ancient irish art may not be indicative of points of character which even yet in some measure arrest your national power  i have seen much of irish character and have watched it closely for i have also much loved it  and i think the form of failure to which it is most liable is thisthat being generous hearted and wholly intending always to do right it does not attend to the external laws of right but thinks it must necessarily do right because it means to do so and therefore does wrong without finding it out and then when the consequences of its wrong come upon it or upon others connected with it it cannot conceive that the wrong is in anywise of its causing or of its doing but flies into wrath and a strange agony of desire for justice as feeling itself wholly innocent which leads it farther astray until there is nothing that it is not capable of doing with a good conscience  but mind i do not mean to say that in past or present relations between ireland and england you have been wrong and we right  far from that i believe that in all great questions of principle and in all details of administration of law you have been usually right and we wrong sometimes in misunderstanding you sometimes in resolute iniquity to you  nevertheless in all disputes between states though the stronger is nearly always mainly in the wrong the weaker is often so in a minor degree and i think we sometimes admit the possibility of our being in error and you never do  and now returning to the broader question what these arts and labours of life have to teach us of its mystery this is the first of their lessonsthat the more beautiful the art the more it is essentially the work of people who feel themselves wrongwho are striving for the fulfilment of a law and the grasp of a loveliness which they have not yet attained which they feel even farther and farther from attaining the more they strive for it  and yet in still deeper sense it is the work of people who know also that they are right  the very sense of inevitable error from their purpose marks the perfectness of that purpose and the continued sense of failure arises from the continued opening of the eyes more clearly to all the sacredest laws of truth  this is one lesson  the second is a very plain and greatly precious one  namelythat whenever the arts and labours of life are fulfilled in this spirit of striving against misrule and doing whatever we have to do honourably and perfectly they invariably bring happiness as much as seems possible to the nature of man  in all other paths by which that happiness is pursued there is disappointment or destruction  for ambition and for passion there is no restno fruition the fairest pleasures of youth perish in a darkness greater than their past light  and the loftiest and purest love too often does but inflame the cloud of life with endless fire of pain  but ascending from lowest to highest through every scale of human industry that industry worthily followed gives peace ask the labourer in the field at the forge or in the mine ask the patient delicatefingered artisan or the strongarmed fiery hearted worker in bronze and in marble and with the colours of light and none of these who are true workmen will ever tell you that they have found the law of heaven an unkind onethat in the sweat of their face they should eat bread till they return to the ground nor that they ever found it an unrewarded obedience if indeed it was rendered faithfully to the commandwhatsoever thy hand findeth to dodo it with thy might  these are the two great and constant lessons which our labourers teach us of the mystery of life  but there is another and a sadder one which they cannot teach us which we must read on their tombstones  do it with thy might  there have been myriads upon myriads of human creatures who have obeyed this lawwho have put every breath and nerve of their being into its toilwho have devoted every hour and exhausted every facultywho have bequeathed their unaccomplished thoughts at deathwho being dead have yet spoken by majesty of memory and strength of example  and at last what has all this might of humanity accomplished in six thousand years of labour and sorrow  what has it done  take the three chief occupations and arts of men one by one and count their achievements  begin with the firstthe lord of them all agriculture  six thousand years have passed since we were set to till the ground from which we were taken  how much of it is tilled  how much of that which is wisely or well  in the very centre and chief garden of europewhere the two forms of parent christianity have had their fortresseswhere the noble catholics of the forest cantons and the noble protestants of the vaudois valleys have maintained for dateless ages their faiths and libertiesthere the unchecked alpine rivers yet run wild in devastation and the marshes which a few hundred men could redeem with a years labour still blast their helpless inhabitants into fevered idiotism  that is so in the centre of europe  while on the near coast of africa once the garden of the hesperides an arab woman but a few sunsets since ate her child for famine  and with all the treasures of the east at our feet we in our own dominion could not find a few grains of rice for a people that asked of us no more but stood by and saw five hundred thousand of them perish of hunger  then after agriculture the art of kings take the next head of human artsweaving the art of queens honoured of all noble heathen women in the person of their virgin goddesshonoured of all hebrew women by the word of their wisest kingshe layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff she stretcheth out her hand to the poor  she is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household are clothed with scarlet  she maketh herself covering of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple  she maketh fine linen and selleth it and delivereth girdles to the merchant  what have we done in all these thousands of years with this bright art of greek maid and christian matron six thousand years of weaving and have we learned to weave  might not every naked wall have been purple with tapestry and every feeble breast fenced with sweet colours from the cold  what have we done  our fingers are too few it seems to twist together some poor covering for our bodies  we set our streams to work for us and choke the air with fire to turn our spinningwheelsandare we yet clothed  are not the streets of the capitals of europe foul with sale of cast clouts and rotten rags  is not the beauty of your sweet children left in wretchedness of disgrace while with better honour nature clothes the brood of the bird in its nest and the suckling of the wolf in her den  and does not every winters snow robe what you have not robed and shroud what you have not shrouded and every winters wind bear up to heaven its wasted souls to witness against you hereafter by the voice of their christi was naked and ye clothed me not  lastlytake the art of buildingthe strongestproudestmost orderlymost enduring of the arts of man that of which the produce is in the surest manner accumulative and need not perish or be replaced but if once well done will stand more strongly than the unbalanced rocksmore prevalently than the crumbling hills  the art which is associated with all civic pride and sacred principle with which men record their powersatisfy their enthusiasmmake sure their defencedefine and make dear their habitation  and in six thousand years of building what have we done  of the greater part of all that skill and strength no vestige is left but fallen stones that encumber the fields and impede the streams  but from this waste of disorder and of time and of rage what is left to us  constructive and progressive creatures that we are with ruling brains and forming hands capable of fellowship and thirsting for fame can we not contend in comfort with the insects of the forest or in achievement with the worm of the sea  the white surf rages in vain against the ramparts built by poor atoms of scarcely nascent life but only ridges of formless ruin mark the places where once dwelt our noblest multitudes  the ant and the moth have cells for each of their young but our little ones lie in festering heaps in homes that consume them like graves and night by night from the corners of our streets rises up the cry of the homelessi was a stranger and ye took me not in  must it be always thus  is our life for ever to be without profit without possession  shall the strength of its generations be as barren as death or cast away their labour as the wild figtree casts her untimely figs  is it all a dream thenthe desire of the eyes and the pride of lifeor if it be might we not live in nobler dream than this  the poets and prophets the wise men and the scribes though they have told us nothing about a life to come have told us much about the life that is now  they have hadthey alsotheir dreams and we have laughed at them  they have dreamed of mercy and of justice they have dreamed of peace and goodwill they have dreamed of labour undisappointed and of rest undisturbed they have dreamed of fulness in harvest and overflowing in store they have dreamed of wisdom in council and of providence in law of gladness of parents and strength of children and glory of grey hairs  and at these visions of theirs we have mocked and held them for idle and vain unreal and unaccomplishable  what have we accomplished with our realities  is this what has come of our worldly wisdom tried against their folly this our mightiest possible against their impotent ideal or have we only wandered among the spectra of a baser felicity and chased phantoms of the tombs instead of visions of the almighty and walked after the imaginations of our evil hearts instead of after the counsels of eternity until our livesnot in the likeness of the cloud of heaven but of the smoke of hellhave become as a vapour that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away  does it vanish then  are you sure of thatsure that the nothingness of the grave will be a rest from this troubled nothingness and that the coiling shadow which disquiets itself in vain cannot change into the smoke of the torment that ascends for ever  will any answer that they are sure of it and that there is no fear nor hope nor desire nor labour whither they go  be it so  will you not then make as sure of the life that now is as you are of the death that is to come  your hearts are wholly in this worldwill you not give them to it wisely as well as perfectly  and see first of all that you have hearts and sound hearts too to give  because you have no heaven to look for is that any reason that you should remain ignorant of this wonderful and infinite earth which is firmly and instantly given you in possession  although your days are numbered and the following darkness sure is it necessary that you should share the degradation of the brute because you are condemned to its mortality or live the life of the moth and of the worm because you are to companion them in the dust  not so we may have but a few thousands of days to spend perhaps hundreds onlyperhaps tens nay the longest of our time and best looked back on will be but as a moment as the twinkling of an eye still we are men not insects we are living spirits not passing clouds  he maketh the winds his messengers the momentary fire his minister and shall we do less than these let us do the work of men while we bear the form of them and as we snatch our narrow portion of time out of eternity snatch also our narrow inheritance of passion out of immortalityeven though our lives be as a vapour that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away  but there are some of you who believe not thiswho think this cloud of life has no such closethat it is to float revealed and illumined upon the floor of heaven in the day when he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him  some day you believe within these five or ten or twenty years for every one of us the judgment will be set and the books opened  if that be true far more than that must be true  is there but one day of judgment why for us every day is a day of judgmentevery day is a dies irae and writes its irrevocable verdict in the flame of its west think you that judgment waits till the doors of the grave are opened  it waits at the doors of your housesit waits at the corners of your streets we are in the midst of judgmentthe insects that we crush are our judgesthe moments we fret away are our judgesthe elements that feed us judge as they ministerand the pleasures that deceive us judge as they indulge  let us for our lives do the work of men while we bear the form of them if indeed those lives are not as a vapour and do not vanish away  the work of menand what is that  well we may any of us know very quickly on the condition of being wholly ready to do it  but many of us are for the most part thinking not of what we are to do but of what we are to get and the best of us are sunk into the sin of ananias and it is a mortal onewe want to keep back part of the price and we continually talk of taking up our cross as if the only harm in a cross was the weight of itas if it was only a thing to be carried instead of to becrucified upon  they that are his have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts  does that mean think you that in time of national distress of religious trial of crisis for every interest and hope of humanitynone of us will cease jesting none cease idling none put themselves to any wholesome work none take so much as a tag of lace off their footmens coats to save the world  or does it rather mean that they are ready to leave houses lands and kindredsyes and life if need be  lifesome of us are ready enough to throw that away joyless as we have made it  but station in lifehow many of us are ready to quit that  is it not always the great objection where there is question of finding something useful to dowe cannot leave our stations in life  those of us who really cannotthat is to say who can only maintain themselves by continuing in some business or salaried office have already something to do and all that they have to see to is that they do it honestly and with all their might  but with most people who use that apology remaining in the station of life to which providence has called them means keeping all the carriages and all the footmen and large houses they can possibly pay for and once for all i say that if ever providence did put them into stations of that sortwhich is not at all a matter of certaintyprovidence is just now very distinctly calling them out again  levis station in life was the receipt of custom and peters the shore of galilee and pauls the antechambers of the high priestwhich station in life each had to leave with brief notice  and whatever our station in life may be at this crisis those of us who mean to fulfil our duty ought first to live on as little as we can and secondly to do all the wholesome work for it we can and to spend all we can spare in doing all the sure good we can  and sure good is first in feeding people then in dressing people then in lodging people and lastly in rightly pleasing people with arts or sciences or any other subject of thought  i say first in feeding and once for all do not let yourselves be deceived by any of the common talk of indiscriminate charity  the order to us is not to feed the deserving hungry nor the industrious hungry nor the amiable and wellintentioned hungry but simply to feed the hungry  it is quite true infallibly true that if any man will not work neither should he eatthink of that and every time you sit down to your dinner ladies and gentlemen say solemnly before you ask a blessing how much work have i done today for my dinner  but the proper way to enforce that order on those below you as well as on yourselves is not to leave vagabonds and honest people to starve together but very distinctly to discern and seize your vagabond and shut your vagabond up out of honest peoples way and very sternly then see that until he has worked he does not eat  but the first thing is to be sure you have the food to give and therefore to enforce the organization of vast activities in agriculture and in commerce for the production of the wholesomest food and proper storing and distribution of it so that no famine shall any more be possible among civilized beings  there is plenty of work in this business alone and at once for any number of people who like to engage in it  secondly dressing peoplethat is to say urging every one within reach of your influence to be always neat and clean and giving them means of being so  in so far as they absolutely refuse you must give up the effort with respect to them only taking care that no children within your sphere of influence shall any more be brought up with such habits and that every person who is willing to dress with propriety shall have encouragement to do so  and the first absolutely necessary step towards this is the gradual adoption of a consistent dress for different ranks of persons so that their rank shall be known by their dress and the restriction of the changes of fashion within certain limits  all which appears for the present quite impossible but it is only so far even difficult as it is difficult to conquer our vanity frivolity and desire to appear what we are not  and it is not nor ever shall be creed of mine that these mean and shallow vices are unconquerable by christian women  and then thirdly lodging people which you may think should have been put first but i put it third because we must feed and clothe people where we find them and lodge them afterwards  and providing lodgment for them means a great deal of vigorous legislature and cutting down of vested interests that stand in the way and after that or before that so far as we can get it thorough sanitary and remedial action in the houses that we have and then the building of more strongly beautifully and in groups of limited extent kept in proportion to their streams and walled round so that there may be no festering and wretched suburb anywhere but clean and busy street within and the open country without with a belt of beautiful garden and orchard round the walls so that from any part of the city perfectly fresh air and grass and sight of far horizon might be reachable in a few minutes walk  this the final aim but in immediate action every minor and possible good to be instantly done when and as we can roofs mended that have holes in them fences patched that have gaps in themwalls buttressed that totterand floors propped that shake cleanliness and order enforced with our own hands and eyes till we are breathless every day  and all the fine arts will healthily follow  i myself have washed a flight of stone stairs all down with bucket and broom in a savoy inn where they hadnt washed their stairs since they first went up them and i never made a better sketch than that afternoon  these then are the three first needs of civilized life and the law for every christian man and woman is that they shall be in direct service towards one of these three needs as far as is consistent with their own special occupation and if they have no special business then wholly in one of these services  and out of such exertion in plain duty all other good will come for in this direct contention with material evil you will find out the real nature of all evil you will discern by the various kinds of resistance what is really the fault and main antagonism to good also you will find the most unexpected helps and profound lessons given and truths will come thus down to us which the speculation of all our lives would never have raised us up to  you will find nearly every educational problem solved as soon as you truly want to do something everybody will become of use in their own fittest way and will learn what is best for them to know in that use competitive examination will then and not till then be wholesome because it will be daily and calm and in practice and on these familiar arts and minute but certain and serviceable knowledges will be surely edified and sustained the greater arts and splendid theoretical sciences  but much more than this  on such holy and simple practice will be founded indeed at last an infallible religion  the greatest of all the mysteries of life and the most terrible is the corruption of even the sincerest religion which is not daily founded on rational effective humble and helpful action  helpful action observe for there is just one law which obeyed keeps all religions pureforgotten makes them all false  whenever in any religious faith dark or bright we allow our minds to dwell upon the points in which we differ from other people we are wrong and in the devils power  that is the essence of the pharisees thanksgivinglord i thank thee that i am not as other men are at every moment of our lives we should be trying to find out not in what we differ from other people but in what we agree with them and the moment we find we can agree as to anything that should be done kind or good and who but fools couldnt then do it push at it together  you cant quarrel in a sidebyside push but the moment that even the best men stop pushing and begin talking they mistake their pugnacity for piety and its all over  i will not speak of the crimes which in past times have been committed in the name of christ nor of the follies which are at this hour held to be consistent with obedience to him but i will speak of the morbid corruption and waste of vital power in religious sentiment by which the pure strength of that which should be the guiding soul of every nation the splendour of its youthful manhood and spotless light of its maidenhood is averted or cast away  you may see continually girls who have never been taught to do a single useful thing thoroughly who cannot sew who cannot cook who cannot cast an account nor prepare a medicine whose whole life has been passed either in play or in pride you will find girls like these when they are earnesthearted cast all their innate passion of religious spirit which was meant by god to support them through the irksomeness of daily toil into grievous and vain meditation over the meaning of the great book of which no syllable was ever yet to be understood but through a deed all the instinctive wisdom and mercy of their womanhood made vain and the glory of their pure consciences warped into fruitless agony concerning questions which the laws of common serviceable life would have either solved for them in an instant or kept out of their way  give such a girl any true work that will make her active in the dawn and weary at night with the consciousness that her fellowcreatures have indeed been the better for her day and the powerless sorrow of her enthusiasm will transform itself into a majesty of radiant and beneficent peace  so with our youths  we once taught them to make latin verses and called them educated now we teach them to leap and to row to hit a ball with a bat and call them educated  can they plough can they sow can they plant at the right time or build with a steady hand is it the effort of their lives to be chaste knightly faithful holy in thought lovely in word and deed  indeed it is with some nay with many and the strength of england is in them and the hope but we have to turn their courage from the toil of war to the toil of mercy and their intellect from dispute of words to discernment of things and their knighthood from the errantry of adventure to the state and fidelity of a kingly power  and then indeed shall abide for them and for us an incorruptible felicity and an infallible religion shall abide for us faith no more to be assailed by temptation no more to be defended by wrath and by fearshall abide with us hope no more to be quenched by the years that overwhelm or made ashamed by the shadows that betray shall abide for us and with us the greatest of these the abiding will the abiding name of our father  for the greatest of these is charity    footnotes  1  the paragraph that begins i think i can best tell you their answer  2  the paragraph that begins does a bird  3  the paragraphs beginning  79i believe then with

note at end of lecture  i have put it in large type because the course of matters since it was written has made it perhaps better worth attention  12  respecting the increase of rent by the deaths of the poor for evidence of which see the preface to the medical officers report to the privy council just published there are suggestions in its preface which will make some stir among us i fancy respecting which let me note these points following  there are two theories on the subject of land now abroad and in contention both false  the first is that by heavenly law there have always existed and must continue to exist a certain number of hereditarily sacred persons to whom the earth air and water of the world belong as personal property of which earth air and water these persons may at their pleasure permit or forbid the rest of the human race to eat to breathe or to drink  this theory is not for many years longer tenable  the adverse theory is that a division of the land of the world among the mob of the world would immediately elevate the said mob into sacred personages that houses would then build themselves and corn grow of itself and that everybody would be able to live without doing any work for his living  this theory would also be found highly untenable in practice  it will however require some rough experiments and rougher catastrophes before the generality of persons will be convinced that no law concerning anythingleast of all concerning land for either holding or dividing it or renting it high or renting it lowwould be of the smallest ultimate use to the people so long as the general contest for life and for the means of life remains one of mere brutal competition  that contest in an unprincipled nation will take one deadly form or another whatever laws you make against it  for instance it would be an entirely wholesome law for england if it could be carried that maximum limits should be assigned to incomes according to classes and that every noblemans income should be paid to him as a fixed salary or pension by the nation and not squeezed by him in variable sums at discretion out of the tenants of his land  but if you could get such a law passed tomorrow and if which would be farther necessary you could fix the value of the assigned incomes by making a given weight of pure bread for a given sum a twelvemonth would not pass before another currency would have been tacitly established and the power of accumulated wealth would have reasserted itself in some other article or some other imaginary sign  there is only one cure for public distressand that is public education directed to make men thoughtful merciful and just  there are indeed many laws conceivable which would gradually better and strengthen the national temper but for the most part they are such as the national temper must be much bettered before it would bear  a nation in its youth may be helped by laws as a weak child by backboards but when it is old it cannot that way strengthen its crooked spine  and besides the problem of land at its worst is a bye one distribute the earth as you will the principal question remains inexorablewho is to dig it  which of us in brief word is to do the hard and dirty work for the rest and for what pay  who is to do the pleasant and clean work and for what pay  who is do no work and for what pay  and there are curious moral and religious questions connected with these  how far is it lawful to suck a portion of the soul out of a great many persons in order to put the abstracted psychical quantities together and make one very beautiful or ideal soul  if we had to deal with mere blood instead of spirit and the thing might literally be doneas it has been done with infants before nowso that it were possible by taking a certain quantity of blood from the arms of a given number of the mob and putting it all into one person to make a more azureblooded gentleman of him the thing would of course be managed but secretly i should conceive  but now because it is brain and soul that we abstract not visible blood it can be done quite openly and we live we gentlemen on delicatest prey after the manner of weasels that is to say we keep a certain number of clowns digging and ditching and generally stupefied in order that we being fed gratis may have all the thinking and feeling to ourselves  yet there is a great deal to be said for this  a highlybred and trained english french austrian or italian gentleman much more a lady is a great productiona better production than most statues being beautifully coloured as well as shaped and plus all the brains a glorious thing to look at a wonderful thing to talk to and you cannot have it any more than a pyramid or a church but by sacrifice of much contributed life  and it is perhaps better to build a beautiful human creature than a beautiful dome or steepleand more delightful to look up reverently to a creature far above us than to a wall only the beautiful human creature will have some duties to do in returnduties of living belfry and rampartof which presently  13  since this was written the answer has become definitelyno we having surrendered the field of arctic discovery to the continental nations as being ourselves too poor to pay for ships  14  i state this fact without professor owens permission  which of course he could not with propriety have granted had i asked it but i consider it so important that the public should be aware of the fact that i do what seems to me right though rude  15  that was our real idea of

beautiful places of the worldswitzerland italy south germany and so onare indeed the truest cathedrals places to be reverent in and to worship in and that we only care to drive through them  and to

see the preface  19  this abbreviation of the penalty of useless labour is curiously coincident in verbal form with a certain passage which some of us may remember  it may perhaps be well to preserve beside this paragraph another cutting out of my storedrawer from the morning post of about a parallel date friday march 10th 1865 the salons of mme c who did the honours with clever imitative grace and elegance were crowded with princes dukes marquises and countsin fact with the same male company as one meets at the parties of the princess metternich and madame drouyn de lhuys  some english peers and members of parliament were present and appeared to enjoy the animated and dazzlingly improper scene  on the second floor the supper tables were loaded with every delicacy of the season  that

how it happens that a poor old woman will be ashamed to take a shilling a week from the countrybut no one is ashamed to take a pension of a thousand a year  21  i am heartily glad to see such a paper as the pall mall gazette established for the power of the press in the hands of highly educated men in independent position and of honest purpose may indeed become all that it has been hitherto vainly vaunted to be  its editor will therefore i doubt not pardon me in that by very reason of my respect for the journal i do not let pass unnoticed an article in its third number page 5 which was wrong in every word of it with the intense wrongness which only an honest man can achieve who has taken a false turn of thought in the outset and is following it regardless of consequences  it contained at the end this notable passage  the bread of affliction and the water of afflictionaye and the bedsteads and blankets of affliction are the very utmost that the law ought to give to outcasts merely as outcasts  i merely put beside this expression of the gentlemanly mind of england in 1865 a part of the message which isaiah was ordered to lift up his voice like a trumpet in declaring to the gentlemen of his day  ye fast for strife and to smite with the fist of wickedness  is not this the fast that i have chosen to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out margin afflicted to thy house  the falsehood on which the writer had mentally founded himself as previously stated by him was this  to confound the functions of the dispensers of the poorrates with those of the dispensers of a charitable institution is a great and pernicious error  this sentence is so accurately and exquisitely wrong that its substance must be thus reversed in our minds before we can deal with any existing problem of national distress  to understand that the dispensers of the poorrates are the almoners of the nation and should distribute its alms with a gentleness and freedom of hand as much greater and franker than that possible to individual charity as the collective national wisdom and power may be supposed greater than those of any single person is the foundation of all law respecting pauperism  since this was written the pall mall gazette has become a mere party paperlike the rest but it writes well and does more good than mischief on the whole  22  greek text which cannot be reproduced  23  i ought in order to make this assertion fully understood to have noted the various weaknesses which lower the ideal of other great characters of men in the waverley novelsthe selfishness and narrowness of thought in redgauntlet the weak religious enthusiasm in edward glendinning and the like and i ought to have noticed that there are several quite

michelets history of france  de quinceys works  vol iii p 217  27  i wish there were a true order of chivalry instituted for our english youth of certain ranks in which both boy and girl should receive at a given age their knighthood and ladyhood by true title attainable only by certain probation and trial both of character and accomplishment and to be forfeited on conviction by their peers of any dishonourable act  such an institution would be entirely and with all noble results possible in a nation which loved honour  that it would not be possible among us is not to the discredit of the scheme  28  see note 19  29  that no reference should be made to religious questions  30  i have sometimes been asked what this means  i intended it to set forth the wisdom of men in war contending for kingdoms and what follows to set forth their wisdom in peace contending for wealth  31  see the two pathsparagraph beginning you know i said of that great and pure
