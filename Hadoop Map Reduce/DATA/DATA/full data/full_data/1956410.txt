1956410	the works  of  lord byron     a new revised and enlarged edition with illustrations     letters and journals vol ii      edited by rowland e prothero ma formerly fellow of all souls college oxford      preface   the second volume of mr murrays edition of byrons letters and journals carries the autobiographical record of the poets life from august 1811 to april 1814 between these dates were published childe harold cantos i ii the waltz the giaour the bride of abydos the ode to napoleon buonaparte at the beginning of this period byron had suddenly become the idol of society towards its close his personal popularity almost as rapidly declined before a storm of political vituperation  three great collections of byrons letters as was noted in the preface 1 to the previous volume are in existence the first is contained in moores life 1830 the second was published in america in fitzgreene hallecks edition of byrons works 1847 of the third edited by mr we henley only the first volume has yet appeared a comparison between the letters contained in these three collections and in that of mr murray down to december 1813 shows the following results moore prints 152 letters halleck 192 mr henley 231 mr murrays edition adds 236 letters to moore 196 to halleck and to mr henley 157 it should also be noticed that the material added to moores life in the second and third collections consists almost entirely of letters which were already in print and had been for the most part seen and rejected by the biographer the material added in mr murrays edition on the contrary consists mainly of letters which have never before been published and were inaccessible to moore when he wrote his life of byron  these necessary comparisons suggest some further remarks it would have been easy not only to indicate what letters or portions of letters are new but also to state the sources whence they are derived but in the circumstances such a course at all events for the present is so impolitic as to be impossible on the other hand anxiety has been expressed as to the authority for the text which is adopted in these volumes to satisfy this anxiety so far as circumstances allow the following details are given  the material contained in these two volumes consists partly of letters now for the first time printed partly of letters already published by moore dallas and leigh hunt or in such books as galts life of lord byron and the memoirs of francis hodgson speaking generally it may be said that the text of the new matter with the few exceptions noted below has been prepared from the original letters and that it has proved impossible to authenticate the text of most of the old material by any such process  the point may be treated in greater detail out of the 388 letters contained in these two volumes 220 have been printed from the original letters in these 220 are included practically the whole of the new material among the letters thus collated with the originals are those to mrs byron with four exceptions all those to the hon augusta byron to the hanson family to james wedderburn webster and to john murray twelve of those to francis hodgson those to the younger rushton william gifford john cam hobhouse lady caroline lamb mrs parker bernard barton and others the two letters to charles gordon 30 33 the three to captain leacroft 62 63 64 and the one to ensign long vol ii p 19 note are printed from copies only  the old material stands in a different position efforts have been made to discover the original letters and sometimes with success but it still remains true that speaking generally the printed text of the letters published by moore dallas leigh hunt and others has not been collated with the originals the fact is important moore who it is believed destroyed not only his own letters from byron but also many of those entrusted to him for the preparation of the life allowed himself unusual liberties as an editor the examples of this licence given in mr claydens rogers and his contemporaries throw suspicion on his text even where no apparent motive exists for his suppressions but as byrons letters became more bitter in tone and his criticisms of his contemporaries more outspoken moore felt himself more justified in omitting passages which referred to persons who were still living in 1830 from 1816 onwards it will be found that he has transferred passages from one letter to another or printed two letters as one and vice vers√¢ or made such large omissions as to shorten letters in some instances by a third or even a half no collation with the originals has ever been attempted and the garbled text which moore printed is the only text at present available for an edition of the most important of byrons letters but the originals of the majority of the letters published in the life from 1816 to 1824 are in the possession or control of mr murray and in his edition they will be for the first time printed as they were written if any passages are omitted the omissions will be indicated  besides the new letters contained in this volume passages have been restored from byrons manuscript notes detached thoughts 1821 to these have been added sir walter scotts comments collated with the originals and in several instances now for the first time published  appendix vii contains a collection of the attacks made upon him in the tory press for february and march 1814 which led him for the moment to resolve on abandoning his literary work  in conclusion i wish to repeat my acknowledgment of the invaluable aid of the national dictionary of biography both in the facts which it supplies and the sources of information which it suggests  re prothero  september 1898    footnote 1 also available from project gutenberg

hitherto prevented my addressing you on the subject of this letter my friend mr dallas 3 has placed in your hands a manuscript poem written by me in greece which he tells me you do not object to publishing but he also informed me in london that you wished to send the ms to mr gifford 4 now though no one would feel more gratified by the chance of obtaining his observations on a work than myself there is in such a proceeding a kind of petition for praise that neither my prideor whatever you please to call itwill admit  mr g is not only the first satirist of the day but editor of one of the principal reviews as such he is the last man whose censure however eager to avoid it i would deprecate by clandestine means you will therefore retain the manuscript in your own care or if it must needs be shown send it to another though not very patient of censure i would fain obtain fairly any little praise my rhymes might deserve at all events not by extortion and the humble solicitations of a bandiedabout ms i am sure a little consideration will convince you it would be wrong  if you determine on publication i have some smaller poems never published a few notes and a short dissertation on the literature of the modern greeks written at athens which will come in at the end of the volumeand if the present poem should succeed it is my intention at some subsequent period to publish some selections from my first workmy satireanother nearly the same length and a few other things with the ms now in your hands in two volumesbut of these hereafter you will apprize me of your determination

which my innocent note from london had thrown it i should feel happy to be informed how you have determined on the disposal of this accursed coach 2 which has driven us out of our good humour and good manners to a complete standstill from which i begin to apprehend that i am to lose altogether your valuable correspondence your angry letter arrived at a moment to which i shall not allude further as my happiness is best consulted in forgetting it 3  you have perhaps heard also of the death of poor matthews whom you recollect to have met at newstead he was one whom his friends will find it difficult to replace nor will cambridge ever see his equal  i trust you are on the point of adding to your relatives instead of losing them and of friends a man of fortune will always have a plentiful stockat his table  i dare say now you are gay and connubial and popular so that in the next parliament we shall be having you a county member but beware your tutor for i am sure he germanized that sanguinary letter you must not write such another to your constituents for myself as the mildest of men i shall say no more about it  seriously mio caro w if you can spare a moment from matrimony i shall be glad to hear that you have recovered from the pucker into which this vis one would think it had been a sulky has thrown you you know i wish you well and if i have not inflicted my society upon you according to your own invitation it is only because i am not a social animal and should feel sadly at a loss amongst countesses and maids of honour particularly being just come from a far country where ladies are neither carved for or fought for or danced after or mixed at all publicly with the menfolks so that you must make allowances for my natural diffidence and two years travel  but god and yourself willing i shall certes pay my promised visit as i shall be in town if parliament meets in october  in the mean time let me hear from you without a privy council and believe me in sober sadness  yours very sincerely  byron    footnote 1 james wedderburn webster 17891840 grandson of sir a wedderburn bart whose third son david assumed the additional name of webster was the author of waterloo and other poems 1816 and a genealogical account of the wedderburn family privately printed 1819 he was with byron possibly at cambridge certainly at athens in 1810 he married in 1810 lady frances caroline annesley daughter of arthur first earl of mountnorris and eighth viscount valencia he was knighted in 1822 byron in 1813 lent him ¬£1000 lady frances died in 1837 and her husband in 1840  moore memoirs journals etc vol iii p 112 mentions dining with webster at paris in 1820    he told me writes moore that one day travelling from newstead   to town with lord byron in his visavis the latter kept his pistols   beside him and continued silent for hours with the most ferocious   expression possible on his countenance      for gods sake my dear b said wat last what are you     thinking of are you about to commit murder or what other dreadful     thing are you meditating    to which byron answered that he always had a sort of presentiment that   his own life would be attacked some time or other and that this was   the reason of his always going armed as it was also the subject of   his thoughts at that moment  moore also adds ibid p 292    w w owes lord byron he says ¬£1000 and does not seem to have the   slightest intention of paying him  lady frances was the lady to whom byron seriously devoted himself in 18134 subsequently she was practically separated from her husband and byron in 1823 endeavoured to reconcile them moore memoirs journals etc vol ii p 249 writes    to the devizes ball in the evening lady frances w there introduced   to her and had much conversation chiefly about our friend lord b   several of those beautiful things published if i remember right   with the bride were addressed to her she must have been very   pretty when she had more of the freshness of youth though she is   still but five or six and twenty but she looks faded already 1819  in the court of common pleas february 16 1816 the libel action of webster v baldwin was heard the plaintiff obtained ¬£2000 in damages for a libel charging lady frances and the duke of wellington with adultery    footnote 2 on his return to london in july 1811 byron ordered a visavis to be built by goodall this he exchanged for a carriage belonging to webster who within a few weeks resold the visavis to byron the two following letters from byron to webster explain the transaction    reddishs hotel 29th july 1811    my dear websteras this eternal visavis seems to sit heavy   on your soul i beg leave to apprize you that i have arranged with   goodall you are to give me the promised wheels and the lining with   the box at brighton and i am to pay the stipulated sum    i am obliged to you for your favourable opinion and trust that the   happiness you talk so much of will be stationary and not take those   freaks to which the felicity of common mortals is subject i do very   sincerely wish you well and am so convinced of the justice of your   matrimonial arguments that i shall follow your example as soon as i   can get a sufficient price for my coronet in the mean time i should   be happy to drill for my new situation under your auspices but   business inexorable business keeps me here your letters are   forwarded if i can serve you in any way command me i will endeavour   to fulfil your requests as awkwardly as another i shall pay you a   visit perhaps in the autumn believe me dear w    yours unintelligibly    b      reddishs hotel july 31st 1811    my dear w wi always understood that the lining was to   accompany the carriage if not the carriage may   accompany the lining for i will have neither the one nor the   other in short to prevent squabbling this is my determination so   decideif you leave it to my feelings as you say they are   very strongly in favour of the said lining two hundred guineas for a   carriage with ancient lining rags and rubbish you must write   another pamphlet my dear w before but pray do not waste your time   and eloquence in expostulation because it will do neither of us any   good but decidecontent or not content the best thing you   can do for the tutor you speak of will be to send him in your vis   with the lining to the university of g√∂ttingen how can you   suppose now that my own bear is dead that i have any situation for a   german genius of this kind till i get another or some children i am   infinitely obliged by your invitations but i cant pay so high for a   secondhand chaise to make my friends a visit the coronet will not   grace the pretty vis till your tattered lining ceases to   disgrace it pray favour me with an answer as we must finish   the affair one way or another immediatelybefore next week    believe me yours truly    byron     byron says webster in a note was more

as it stands it strikes me that the eulogy on matthews   is a little at the expense of wingfield and others whom you   have commemorated i should think it quite enough to say that   his powers and

should go on very well and i need not tell you that i long to see you i really do not perceive any thing so formidable in a journey hither of two days but all this comes of matrimony you have a nurse and all the etceteras of a family well i must marry to repair the ravages of myself and prodigal ancestry but if i am ever so unfortunate as to be presented with an heir instead of a rattle he shall be provided with a gag  i shall perhaps be able to accept ds invitation to cambridge but i fear my stay in lancashire will be prolonged i proceed there in the 2d week in septr to arrange my coal

had better advice than this neighbourhood   affords she is thank heaven much better and i hope in a fair way   to be quite herself again mr davies flattered me by saying she was   exactly the sort of child you would delight in i am determined not   to say another word in her praise for fear you should accuse me of   partiality and expect too much the youngest little augusta is   just 6 months old and has no particular merit at present but a very   sweet placid temper    oh that i could immediately set out to newstead and shew them to   you i cant tell you half the happiness it would give me to see it   and you but my dearest b it is a long journey and serious   undertaking all things considered mr davies writes me word you   promise to make him a visit bye and bye pray do you can then so   easily come here i have set my heart upon it consider how very long   it is since ive seen you    i have indeed much to tell you but it is more easily said than   written probably you have heard of many changes in our situation   since you left england in a pecuniary point of view it is   materially altered for the worse perhaps in other respects better   col leigh has been in dorsetshire and

go   but i prefer writing in a hurry to not writing at all you cant think   how much i feel for your griefs and losses or how much and constantly   i have thought of you lately i began a letter to you in town but   destroyed it from the fear of appearing troublesome there are times   i know when one cannot write with any degree of comfort or   satisfaction i intend to do so again shortly so i hope yon wont   think me a bore    remember me most kindly to old joe i rejoice to hear of his health   and prosperity your letter some parts of it at least made me laugh   i am so very glad to hear you have sufficiently overcome your   prejudices against the fair sex to have determined upon marrying   but i shall be most anxious that my future belle soeur should have   more attractions than merely

long separation i shall fill up this sheet before i go to bed i have heard something of a quarrel between your spouse and the prince i dont wish to pry into family secrets or to hear anything more of the matter but i cant help regretting on your account that so long an intimacy should be dissolved at the very moment when your husband might have derived some advantage from his r hs friendship however at all events and in all situations you have a brother in me and a home here  i am led into this train of thinking by a part of your letter which hints at pecuniary losses i know how delicate one ought to be on such subjects but you are probably the only being on earth now interested in my welfare certainly the only relative and i should be very ungrateful if i did not feel the obligation you must excuse my being a little cynical knowing how my temper was tried in my nonage the manner in which i was brought up must necessarily have broken a meek spirit or rendered a fiery one ungovernable the effect it has had on mine i need not state  however buffeting with the world has brought me a little to reason and two years travel in distant and barbarous countries has accustomed me to bear privations and consequently to laugh at many things which would have made me angry before but i am wanderingin short i only want to assure you that i love you and that you must not think i am indifferent because i dont shew my affection in the usual way  pray cant you contrive to pay me a visit between this and xmas or shall i carry you down with me from cambridge supposing it practicable for me to come you will do what you please without our interfering with each other the premises are so delightfully extensive that two people might live together without ever seeing hearing or meetingbut i cant feel the comfort of this till i marry in short it would be the most amiable matrimonial mansion and that is another great inducement to my planmy wife and i shall be so happyone in each wing if this description wont make you come i cant tell what will you must please yourself good night i have to walk half a mile to my bed chamber yours ever byron

are not the worse for that my friend hodgson 1 is not much honoured by the comparison to the pursuits of l which is notoriously as far as the poetry goes the worst written of its kind the world has been long but of one opinion viz that its sole merit lies in the notes which are indisputably excellent  had hodgsons alterative been placed with the baviad the compliment had been higher to both for surely the baviad is as much superior to hs poem as i do firmly believe hs poem to be to the pursuits of literature  your correspondent talks for talkings sake when he says lady j grey is neither epic dramatic or legendary who ever said it was epic or dramatic he might as well say his letter was neither epic or dramatic the poem makes no pretensions to either character legendary it certainly is but what has that to do with its merits all stories of that kind founded on facts are in a certain degree legendary but they may be well or ill written without the smallest alteration in that respect when mr hare prattles about the economy etc he sinks sadlyall such expressions are the mere cant of a schoolboy hovering round the skirts of criticism  hodgsons tale is one of the best efforts of his muse and mr hs approbation must be of more consequence before any body will reduce it to a scale or be much affected by the place he assigns to the productions of a man like hodgson  but i have said more than i intended and only beg you never to allow yourself to be imposed upon by such common place as the 6th form letter you sent me judge for yourself  i know the mr bankes 2  you mention though not to that extreme you seem to think but i am flattered by his boasting on such a subject as you say for i never thought him likely to boast of any thing which was not his own i am not melancholishpray what folk dare to say any such thing i must contradict them by being merry at their expence  i shall invade you in the course of the winter out of envy as lucifer looked at adam and eve  pray be as happy as you can and write to me that i may catch the infection  yours ever byron    footnote 1 webster had sent byron a letter from naylor hare in which the latter criticized hodgsons poems lady jane

you a vastly dutiful letter since my answer to your second epistle and i now write you a third for which you have to thank silence and solitude mr hanson 2 comes hither on the 14th and i am going to rochdale on business but that need not prevent you from coming here you will find joe and the house and the cellar and all therein very much at your service  as to lady b when i discover one rich enough to suit me and foolish enough to have me i will give her leave to make me miserable if she can money is the magnet as to women one is as well as another the older the better we have then a chance of getting her to heaven so your spouse does not like brats better than myself now those who beget them have no right to find fault but i may rail with great propriety  my satirei am glad it made you laugh for somebody told me in greece that you was angry and i was sorry as you were perhaps the only person whom i did not want to make angry  but how you will make me laugh i dont know for it is a vastly serious subject to me i assure you therefore take care or i shall hitch you into the next edition to make up our family party nothing so fretful so despicable as a scribbler see what i am and what a parcel of scoundrels i have brought about my ears and what language i have been obliged to treat them with to deal with them in their own wayall this comes of authorship but now i am in for it and shall be at war with grubstreet till i find some better amusement  you will write to me your intentions and may almost depend on my being at cambridge in october you say you mean to be etc in the autumn i should be glad to know what you call this present season it would be winter in every other country which i have seen if we meet in october we will travel in my vis and can have a cage for the children and a cart for the nurse or perhaps we can forward them by the canal do let us know all about it your bright thought is a little clouded like the moon in this preposterous climate

letters so   much as writing them for you would in that case pronounce me a great   torment but as i prepared you in my last for its being followed very   soon by another i hope you will have reconciled your mind to the   impending toil i really wrote in such a hurry that i did not say half   i wished but i did not like to delay telling you how happy you made   me by writing i have been dwelling constantly upon the idea of going   to newstead ever since i had your wish to see me there at last a   bright thought struck me    we intend i believe to go to yorkshire in the autumn now if i   could contrive to pay you a visit en passant it would be   delightful and give me the greatest pleasure but i fear you would be   obliged to make up your mind to receive my brats too as for my   husband he prefers the outside of the mail to the inside of a   postchaise particularly when partly occupied by nurse and children   so that we always travel independent of each other    so much for this my dear b i can only say i should much like to   see you at newstead the former i hope i shall at all events as you   must not be shabby but come to cambridge as you promised are you   staying at newstead now for any time i saw george byron in town for   one day and he promised to call or write again but has not done   either so i begin to think he has gone back to lisbon i think it is   impossible not to like him he is so goodnatured and natural we   talked much of you he told me you were grown very thin as you dont   complain i hope you are not the worse for being so and i remember   you used to wish it dont you think it a great shame that george b   is not promoted i wish there was any possibility of assisting him   about it but all i know who could do any good with you present   ministers i dont for many reasons like to ask perhaps there may be   a change bye and bye    fred howard is married to miss lambton i saw them in town in their   way to castle howard i hope he will be happy with all my heart his   kindness and friendship to us last year when col leigh was placed   in one of the most perplexing situations that i think anybody could be   in is never to be forgotten i think he used to be a greater   favourite with you than some others of his family mrs fh is very   pretty very young not quite 17 and appears gentle and pleasing   which is all one can expect to discover from a very slight   acquaintance    now my dearest byron pray let me hear from you i shall be daily   expecting to hear of a lady byron since you have confided to me   your determination of marrying in which i really hope you are   serious being convinced such an event would contribute greatly to   your happiness provided her ladyship was the sort of person that   would suit you and you wont be angry with me for saying that it is   not every one who would therefore dont be too precipitate you   will wish me hanged i fear for boring you so unmercifully so god   bless

dear hodgsoni will have nothing to do with your immortality 1 we are miserable enough in this life without the absurdity of speculating upon another if men are to live why die at all and if they die why disturb the sweet and sound sleep that knows no waking    post mortem nihil est ipsaque mors nihil  qu√¶ris quo jaceas post   obitum loco quo non nata jacent 2  as to revealed religion christ came to save men but a good pagan will go to heaven and a bad nazarene to hell argal i argue like the gravedigger why are not all men christians or why are any if mankind may be saved who never heard or dreamt at timbuctoo otaheite terra incognita etc of galilee and its prophet christianity is of no avail if they cannot be saved without why are not all orthodox it is a little hard to send a man preaching to judaea and leave the rest of the worldnegers and what notdark as their complexions without a ray of light for so many years to lead them on high and who will believe that god will damn men for not knowing what they were never taught i hope i am sincere i was so at least on a bed of sickness in a fardistant country when i had neither friend nor comforter nor hope to sustain me i looked to death as a relief from pain without a wish for an afterlife but a confidence that the god who punishes in this existence had left that last asylum for the weary    greek hon ho the√≤s

mussulmans shall shame you in all goodwill towards men prayer to god and duty to their neighbours and is there a talapoin 4 or a bonze who is not superior to a foxhunting curate but i will say no more on this endless theme let me live well if possible and die without pain the rest is with god who assuredly had he come or sent would have made himself manifest to nations and intelligible to all  i

is shown by the following letter to ensign long see letters vol i p 73 note 2  footnote 2 of letter 31 which reached the editor too late for insertion in its proper place    southwell ap 16th 1807    your epistle my dear standard bearer augurs not much in favour of   your new life particularly the latter part where you say your   happiest days are over i most sincerely hope not the past has   certainly in some parts been pleasant but i trust will be equalled   if not exceeded by the future you hope it is not so with me    to be plain with regard to myself nature stampt me in the die of   indifference i consider myself as destined never to be happy   although in some instances fortunate i am an isolated being on the   earth without a tie to attach me to life except a few   schoolfellows and a score of females let me but hear my fame on   the winds and the song of the bards in my norman house i ask no more   and dont expect so much of religion i know nothing at least in its   favour we have fools in all sects and impostors in most why   should i believe mysteries no one understands because written by men   who chose to mistake madness for inspiration and style themselves   evangelicals however enough on this subject your piety will be   aghast and i wish for no proselytes this much i will venture to   affirm that all the virtues and pious deeds performed on earth can   never entitle a man to everlasting happiness in a future state nor on   the other hand can such a scene as a seat of eternal punishment exist   it is incompatible with the benign attributes of a deity to suppose   so    i am surrounded here by parsons and methodists but as you will   see not infected with the mania i have lived a deist what i shall   die i know not however come what may ridens moriar    nothing detains me here but the publication which will not be   complete till june about 20 of the present pieces will be cut out   and a number of new things added amongst them a complete episode of   nisus and euryalus from virgil some odes from anacreon and several   original odes the whole will cover 170 pages my last production has   been a poem in imitation of ossian which i shall not publish having   enough without it many of the present poems are enlarged and altered   in short you will behold an old friend with a new face were i to   publish all i have written in rhyme i should fill a decent quarto   however half is quite enough at present you shall have all when we   meet    i grow thin daily since the commencement of my system i have lost 23   lbs in my weight ie 1 st and 9 lbs when i began i weighed 14   st 6 lbs and on tuesday i found myself reduced to 12 st 11 lb   what sayest thou ned do you not envy  i shall still proceed till i   arrive at 12 st and then stop at least if i am not too fat but   shall always live temperately and take much exercise    if there is a possibility we shall meet in june i shall be in town   before i proceed to granta and if the mountain will not come to   mahomet mahomet will go to the mountain i dont mean by comparing   you to the mountain to insinuate anything on the subject of your   size

ready cut to his wishes    adieu dear mont blanc or rather mont rouge dont for heavens   sake turn volcanic at least roll the lava of your indignation in any   other channel and not consume yours ever    byron    write immediately   byron lived to modify these opinions as is shown by the following passages from his detached thoughts     if i were to live over again i do not know what i would change in my   life unless it were fornot to have lived at all all history and   experience and the rest teaches us that the good and evil are pretty   equally balanced in this existence and that what is most to be   desired is an easy passage out of it what can it give us but years   and those have little of good but their ending    of the immortality of the soul it appears to me that there can be   little doubt if we attend for a moment to the action of mind it is   in perpetual activity i used to doubt of it but reflection has   taught me better it acts also so very independent of bodyin dreams   for instanceincoherently and madly i grant you but still it is   mind and much more mind than when we are awake now that this should   not act separately as well as jointly who can pronounce the   stoics epictetus and marcus aurelius call the present state a soul   which drags a carcassa heavy chain to be sure but all chains   being material may be shaken off how far our future life will be   individual or rather how far it will at all resemble our   present existence is another question but that the mind is eternal   seems as probable as that the body is not so of course i here venture   upon the question without recurring to revelation which however is   at least as rational a solution of it as any other a material   resurrection seems strange and even absurd except for purposes of   punishment and all punishment which is to revenge rather than   correct must be morally wrong and when the world is at an end   what moral or warning purpose can eternal tortures answer human   passions have probably disfigured the divine doctrines herebut the   whole thing is inscrutable    it is useless to tell me not to reason but to believe you   might as well tell a man not to wake but sleep and then to bully   with torments and all that i cannot help thinking that the menace   of hell makes as many devils as the severe penal codes of inhuman   humanity make villains    man is born passionate of body but with an innate though secret   tendency to the love of good in his mainspring of mind but god help   us all it is at present a sad jar of atoms   footnote 2 the lines are quoted

my dear siri am at present anxious as cawthorn seems to wish it to have a small edition of the hints from horace 1 published immediately but the latin the most difficult poem in the language renders it necessary to be very particular not only in correcting the proofs with horace open but in adapting the parallel passages of the imitation in such places to the original as may enable the reader not to lose sight of the allusion i dont know whether i ought to ask you to do this but i am too far off to do it for myself and if you condescend to my schoolboy erudition you will oblige me by setting this thing going though you will smile at the importance i attach to it  believe me ever yours  byron    footnote 1 hints from horace written during byrons second stay at athens march 1114 1811 and subsequently added to had been placed in the hands of cawthorn the publisher of english bards and scotch reviewers for publication byron afterwards changed his mind and the poem remained unpublished till after his death  the following letter from cawthorn shows that considerable progress had been made with the printing of the poem and that byron also contemplated another edition of english bards and scotch reviewers the advice of his friends led him to abandon both plans but his letter to cawthorn printed below is evidence that in september he was still at work on hints from horace    24 cockspur street aug 22d 1811    my lordmr green the amanuensis has finished the latin of the   horace and i shall be happy to do with it as your lordship may   direct either to forward it to newstead or keep it in town would it   not be better to print a small edition seperate sic and   afterwards print the two satires together this i leave to your   lordships consideration four sheets of the travels are already   printed and one of the plates albanian solain is executed i sent   it capt hobhouse yesterday to cork to see if it meets his   approbation the work is printed in quarto for which i may be in some   measure indebted to your lordship as i urged it so strongly i shall   be extremely sorry if capt h is not pleased with it but i think he   will your lordships goodness will excuse me for saying how much the   very sudden and melancholy events that have lately transpiredi   regretcapt hobhouse has written me since the decease of mr   mathews i am told capt h is very much affected at it i have   received some drawings of costumes from him which i am to deliver to   your lordship is it likely we shall see your lordship in town soon    i have the honour to be your lordships    most respectful and greatly obliged servt    james cawthorn    if a small edition is printed of horace for the first words   erased that and i think in all probability the e bards will want   reprinting about march next when both could be done together do not   think me too sanguine  a few days later byron writes to cawthom as follows    newstead abbey september 4th 1811    more notes for the hints you mistake me much by thinking me   inattentive to this publication if i had a friend willing and able to   correct the press it should be out with my good will immediately   pray attend to annexing additional notes in their proper places and   let them be added immediately    yours etc    byron                                               179to john murray 1  newstead abbey notts sept 5 1811  sirthe time seems to be past when as dr johnson said a man was certain to hear the truth from his bookseller for you have paid me so many compliments that if i was not the veriest scribbler on earth i should feel affronted as i accept your compliments it is but fair i should give equal or greater credit to your objections the more so as i believe them to be well founded with regard to the political and metaphysical parts i am afraid i can alter nothing but i have high authority for my errors in that point for even the √Üneid was a political poem and written for a political purpose and as to my unlucky opinions on subjects of more importance i am too sincere in them for recantation on spanish affairs i have said what i saw and every day confirms me in that notion of the result formed on the spot and i rather think honest john bull is beginning to come round again to that sobriety which massenas retreat 2 had begun to reel from its centrethe usual consequence of unusual success so you perceive i cannot alter the sentiments but if there are any alterations in the structure of the versification you would wish to be made i will tag rhymes and turn stanzas as much as you please as for the orthodox let us hope they will buy on purpose to abuseyou will forgive the one if they will do the other you are aware that any thing from my pen must expect no quarter on many accounts and as the present publication is of a nature very different from the former we must not be sanguine  you have given me no answer to my questiontell me fairly did you show the ms to some of your corps 3  i sent an introductory stanza to mr dallas that it might be forwarded to you the poem else will open too abruptly the stanzas had better be numbered in roman characters there is a disquisition on the literature of the modern greeks and some smaller poems to come in at the close these are now at newstead but will be sent in time if mr d has lost the stanza and note annexed to it write and i will send it myselfyou tell me to add two cantos but i am about to visit my collieries in lancashire on the 15th instant which is so unpoetical an employment that i need say no more  i am sir your most obedient etc etc  byron    footnote 1 the following is murrays letter to which byron replies    london sept 4 1811 wednesday    my lordan absence of some days passed in the country has   prevented me from writing earlier in answer to your obliging letter i   have now however the pleasure of sending under a separate cover the   first proof sheet of your lordships poem which is so good as to be   entitled to all your care to render perfect besides its general   merit there are parts which i am tempted to believe far excel   anything that your lordship has hitherto published and it were   therefore grievous indeed if you do not condescend to bestow upon it   all the improvement of which your lordships mind is so capable every   correction already made is valuable and this circumstance renders me   more confident in soliciting for it your further attention    there are some expressions too concerning spain and portugal   which however just and particularly so at the time they were   conceived yet as they do not harmonize with the general feeling   would so greatly interfere with the popularity which the poem is in   other respects so certainly calculated to excite that in compassion   to your publisher who does not presume to reason upon the subject   otherwise than as a mere matter of business i hope your lordships   goodness will induce you to obviate them and with them perhaps   some religious feelings which may deprive me of some customers amongst   the orthodox    could i flatter myself that these suggestions were not obtrusive i   would hazard another in an earnest solicitation that your lordship   would add the two promised cantos and complete the poem it were   cruel indeed not to perfect a work which contains so much that is   excellent your fame my lord demands it you are raising a monument   that will outlive your present feelings and it should therefore be so   constructed as to excite no other associations than those of respect   and admiration for your lordships character and genius    i trust that you will pardon the warmth of this address when i assure   your lordship that it arises in the greatest degree in a sincere   regard for your lasting reputation with however some view to that   portion of it which must attend the publisher of so beautiful a poem   as your lordship is capable of rendering    the romaunt of childe harold    i have the honour to be my lord    your lordships    obedient and faithful servant    john murray   footnote 2 on the night of march 5 1811 massena retreated from his camp at santarem whence he had watched wellington at torres vedras and on april 4 he crossed the coa into spain   footnote 3 murray had shown the ms to gifford for advice as to its publication byron seems to have resented this on the ground that it might look like an attempt to propitiate the quarterly review                                               180to r c dallas   newstead abbey september 7 1811   as gifford has been ever my magnus apollo any approbation such as you mention would of course be more welcome than all bocaras vaunted gold than all the gems of samarcand 1 but i am sorry the ms was shown to him in such a manner and had written to murray to say as much before i was aware that it was too late  your objection to the expression central line i can only meet by saying that before childe harold left england it was his full intention to traverse persia and return by india which he could not have done without passing the equinoctial  the other errors you mention i must correct in the progress through the press i feel honoured by the wish of such men that the poem should be continued but to do that i must return to greece and asia i must have a warm sun a blue sky i cannot describe scenes so dear to me by a seacoal fire i had projected an additional canto when i was in the troad and constantinople and if i saw them again it would go on but under existing circumstances and sensations i have neither harp heart nor voice to proceed i feel that you are all right as to the metaphysical part but i also feel that i am sincere and that if i am only to write ad captandum vulgus i might as well edit a magazine at once or spin canzonettas for vauxhall 2  my work must make its way as well as it can i know i have every thing against me angry poets and prejudices but if the poem is a poem it will surmount these obstacles and if not it deserves its fate your friends ode 3 i have readit is no great compliment to pronounce it far superior to smythes on the same subject or to the merits of the new chancellor it is evidently the production of a man of taste and a poet though i should not be willing to say it was fully equal to what might be expected from the author of horae ionicae 4 i thank you for it and that is more than i would do for any other ode of the present day  i am very sensible of your good wishes and indeed i have need of them my whole life has been at variance with propriety not to say decency my circumstances are become involved my friends are dead or estranged and my existence a dreary void in matthews i have lost my guide philosopher and friend in wingfield a friend only but one whom i could have wished to have preceded in his long journey  matthews was indeed an extraordinary man it has not entered into the heart of a stranger to conceive such a man there was the stamp of immortality in all he said or didand now what is he when we see such men pass away and be no moremen who seem created to display what the creator could make his creatures gathered into corruption before the maturity of minds that might have been the pride of posterity what are we to conclude for my own part i am bewildered to me he was much to hobhouse every thing my poor hobhouse doted on matthews for me i did not love quite so much as i honoured him i was indeed so sensible of his infinite superiority that though i did not envy i stood in awe of it he hobhouse davies and myself formed a coterie of our own at cambridge and elsewhere davies is a wit and man of the world and feels as much as such a character can do but not as hobhouse has been affected davies who is not a scribbler has always beaten us all in the war of words and by his colloquial powers at once delighted and kept us in order hobhouse and myself always had the worst of it with the other two and even matthews yielded to the dashing vivacity of scrope davies but i am talking to you of men or boys as if you cared about such beings  i expect mine agent down on the 14th to proceed to lancashire where i hear from all quarters that i have a very valuable property in coals etc i then intend to accept an invitation to cambridge in october and shall perhaps run up to town i have four invitationsto wales dorset cambridge and chester but i must be a man of business i am quite alone as these long letters sadly testify i perceive by referring to your letter that the ode is from the author make my thanks acceptable to him his muse is worthy a nobler theme you will write as usual i hope i wish you good evening and am

any advantage from them and god knows if i ever shall mr h my agent is a good man and able but the most dilatory in the world i expect him down on the 14th to accompany me to rochdale where something will be decided as to selling or working the collieries i am lord of the manor a most extensive one and they want to enclose which cannot be done without me but i go there in the worst humour possible and am afraid i shall do or say something not very conciliatory in short all my affairs are going on as badly as possible and i have no hopes or plans to better them as i long ago pledged myself never to sell newstead which i mean to hold in defiance of the devil and man  i am quite alone and never see strangers without being sick but i am nevertheless on good terms with my neighbours for i neither ride or shoot or move over my garden walls but i fence and box and swim and run a good deal to keep me in exercise and get me to sleep poor murray is ill again and one of my greek servants is ill too and my valet has got a pestilent cough so that we are in a peck of troubles my family surgeon sent an emetic this morning for one of them i did not very well know which but i swore somebody should take it so after a deal of discussion the greek swallowed it with tears in his eyes and by the blessing of it and the virgin whom he invoked to assist it and him i suppose hell be well tomorrow if not

all for i shall be off somewhere or other very soon out of this land of paper credit or rather no credit at all for every body seems on the high road to bankruptcy and if i quit it again i shall not be back in a hurry  however i shall endeavour to see you somewhere and make my bow with decorum before i return to the ottomans i believe i shall turn mussulman in the end  you ask after my health i

have done the basis of your religion is injustice the son of god the pure the immaculate the innocent is sacrificed for the guilty this proves his heroism but no more does away mans guilt than a schoolboys volunteering to be flogged for another would exculpate the dunce from negligence or preserve him from the rod you degrade the creator in the first place by making him a begetter of children and in the next you convert him into a tyrant over an immaculate and injured being who is sent into existence to suffer death for the benefit of some millions of scoundrels who after all seem as likely to be damned as ever as to miracles i agree with hume that it is more probable men should lie or be deceived than that things out of the course of nature should so happen mahomet wrought miracles brothers 3 the prophet had proselytes and so would breslaw 4 the conjuror had he lived in the time of tiberius  besides i trust that god is not a jew but the god of all mankind and as you allow that a virtuous gentile may be saved you do away the necessity of being a jew or a christian  i do not believe in any revealed religion because no religion is revealed and if it pleases the church to damn me for not allowing a nonentity i throw myself on the mercy of the great first cause least understood who must do what is most proper though i conceive he never made anything to be tortured in another life whatever it may in this i will neither read pro nor con god would have made his will known without books considering how very few could read them when jesus of nazareth lived had it been his pleasure to ratify any peculiar mode of worship as to your immortality if people are to live why die and our carcases which are to rise again are they worth raising i hope if mine is

returns to france a complete jacques r√¥tdebif he then visits holland the low countries constantinople italy spain portugal and england a second time he finds that the charm has vanished and that the

justification of instinctive dislikes monbron like byron ridicules the travellers passion for collecting broken statues and antiques                                               189to r c dallas   newstead abbey sept 17 1811   i can easily excuse your not writing as you have i hope something better to do and you must pardon my frequent invasions on your attention because i have at this moment nothing to interpose between you and my epistles  i cannot settle to any thing and my days pass with the exception of bodily exercise to some extent with uniform indolence and idle insipidity i have been expecting and still expect my agent when i shall have enough to occupy my reflections in business of no very pleasant aspect before my journey to rochdale you shall have due notice where to address mei believe at the postoffice of that township from murray i received a second proof of the same pages which i requested him to show you that any thing which may have escaped my observation may be detected before the printer lays the cornerstone of an errata column  i am now not quite alone having an old acquaintance and schoolfellow 1 with me so old indeed that we have nothing new to say on any subject and yawn at each other in a sort of quiet inquietude i hear nothing from cawthorn or captain hobhouse and their quartolord have mercy on mankind we come on like cerberus with our triple publications 2 as for myself by myself i must be satisfied with a comparison to janus  i am not at all pleased with murray for showing the ms and i am certain gifford must see it in the same light that i do his praise is nothing to the purpose what could he say he could not spit in the face of one who had praised him in every possible way i must own that i wish to have the impression removed from his mind that i had any concern in such a paltry transaction the more i think the more it disquiets me so i will say no more about it it is bad enough to be a scribbler without having recourse to such shifts to extort praise or deprecate censure it is anticipating it is begging kneeling adulatingthe devil the devil the devil and all without my wish and contrary to my express desire i wish murray had been tied to paynes neck when he jumped into the paddington canal 3 and so tell himthat is the proper receptacle for publishers you have thought of settling in the country why not

wandered by the vaunted rill   and so on so i have got rid of dr lowth and drunk to boot and very glad i am to say so i have also sullenised the line as heretofore and in short have been quite conformable  pray write you shall hear when i remove to lancashire i have brought you and my friend juvenal hodgson upon my back on the score of revelation you are fervent but he is quite glowing and if he take half the pains to save his own soul which he volunteers to redeem mine great will be his reward hereafter i honour and thank you both but am convinced by neither now for notes besides those i have sent i shall send the observations on the edinburgh reviewers remarks on the modern greek an albanian song in the albanian not greek language specimens of modern greek from their new testament a comedy of goldonis translated one scene a prospectus of a friends book and perhaps a song or two all in romaic besides their pater noster so there will be enough if not too much with what i have

perilous quantity of modern greek in my notes as specimens of the tongue therefore lisboa may keep its place you are right about the hints they must not precede the romaunt but cawthorn will be savage if they dont however keep them back and him in good humour if we can but do not let him publish  i have adopted i believe most of your suggestions but lisboa will be an exception to prove the rule i

i am as comfortable in my creed as others inasmuch as it is better to sleep than to be awake  i have heard nothing of murray i hope he is ashamed of himself he sent me a vastly complimentary epistle

rhymes and mend them as long as he liked  i will write from rochdale when i arrive if my affairs allow me but i shall be so busy and savage all the time with the whole set that my letters will perhaps be as pettish as myself if so lay the blame on coal and coalheavers very probably i may proceed to town by way of newstead on my return from lancs i mean to be at cambridge in november so that at all

of horrors 2 till i have become callous nor have i a tear left for an event which five years ago would have bowed down my head to the earth it seems as though i were to experience in my youth the

i know nothing ofat the time of your meeting with mr jeffrey i had recently entered college and remember to have heard and read a number of squibs on the occasion and from the recollection of these i derived all my knowledge on the subject without the slightest idea of giving the lie to an address which i never beheld when i put my name to the production which has occasioned this correspondence i became responsible to all whom it might concernto explain where it requires explanation and where insufficiently or too sufficiently explicit at all events to satisfy my situation leaves me no choice it rests with the injured and the angry to obtain reparation in their own way  with regard to the passage in question you were certainly not the person towards whom i felt personally hostile on the

servant  byron    footnote 1 thomas moore 17791852 by his literary and social gifts had made his name several years before 1811 when he first became personally acquainted with byron his precocity was as remarkable as his versatility the son of a dublin grocer for whom his political interest secured the post of barrackmaster he went like sheridan to samuel whytes school and was afterwards at trinity college dublin before he was fifteen he had written verses including lines to whyte himself a poet the publication of which in the anthologia hibernica october 1793 february march and june 1794 gained him a local reputation coming to london in 1799 he read law at the middle temple his odes translated from anacreon 1800 dedicated to the prince of wales opened to him the houses of the whig aristocracy and his powers as a singer an actor a talker and later as a satirist made him a favourite in society in 1801 appeared his poems by the late thomas little amatory verses which byron read and imitated in some of the silliest of his youthful lines  the review of moores odes epistles and other poems 1806 which appeared in the edinburgh review for july 1806 provoked moore to challenge jeffrey their duel with leadless pistols led not only to moores friendship with jeffrey but indirectly as is seen from the following letters to moores acquaintance with byron moore himself contributed to the edinburgh between the years 1814 and 1834 essays on multifarious subjects from poetry to german rationalism from the fathers to french official life in 1807 the first of the irish melodies was published they continued to appear at irregular intervals till 1834 when 122 had been printed a master of the art of versification moore sings with graceful fancy in a tone of mingled mirth and melancholy his love of his country of the wine of other countries and the women of all countries but except in his patriotism he shows little depth of feeling the melodies are the work of a brilliantly clever man endowed with an exquisite musical ear and a temperament that is rather susceptible than intense with them may be classed his national airs 1815 and sacred song 1816  moore had already found one field in which he excelled it was not long before he discovered another his serious satires corruption 1808 intolerance 1808 and the sceptic 1809 failed his nature was neither deep enough nor strong enough for success in such themes in the ephemeral strife of party politics he found his real province nothing can be better of their kind than the metrical lampoons collected in intercepted letters or the twopenny postbag by thomas brown the younger 1813 in his hands the bow and arrows of cupid become formidable weapons of party warfare nor do their ornaments impede the movements of the archer the shaft is gaily winged and brightly polished the barb sharp and dipped in venom and the missile hums music as it flies to its mark moores satire is the satire of the clubs at its best but it is scarcely the satire of literature the twopenny postbag was the parent of many similar productions beginning with the fudge family in paris 1818 and ending with fables for the holy alliance 1823 which he dedicated to byron  as a serious poet and the author of lalla rookh 1817 the loves of the angels 1823 and alciphron 1839 moore was perhaps overrated by his contemporaries in spite of their brightness of fancy metrical skill and brilliant cleverness they lack the greater elements of the highest poetry  moores prose work begins apart from his contributions to periodical literature with the memoirs of captain rock 1824 the epicurean 1827 the travels of an irish gentleman in search of a religion 1834 the history of ireland 1846 and a succession of biographiesthe life of sheridan 1825 of byron 1830 and lord edward fitzgerald 1831complete the list in the midst of his biographical work moore was advised by lord lansdowne to write nine lives at once and print them together under the title of the cat  in 1811 moore married miss elizabeth dyke born 1793 an actress who fascinated him at the kilkenny private theatricals in 1809 to the outer world mrs moores bird as she called him was a sprightly little songster who lived in a whirl of dinners suppers concerts and theatricals these as well as his private anxieties and misfortunes are recorded in the eight volumes of his memoirs journals and correspondence which were edited by lord john russell in 1853 moore was an excellent son a good husband an affectionate father and to byron a loyal friend neither envious nor subservient clare hobhouse and moore were lady blessingtons conversations 2nd edition 1850 pp 393 394 the only persons whose friendship byron never disclaimed he spoke of moore ibid pp 322 323 as a delightful companion gay without being boisterous witty without effort comic without coarseness and sentimental without being lachrymose he reminds one of the fairy who whenever she spoke let diamonds fall from her lips my t√™te√†t√™te suppers with moore are among the most agreeable impressions i retain of the hours passed in london  in july 1806 in consequence of the article in the edinburgh review on his recent volume of poems moore sent through his friend hume a challenge to jeffrey who was seconded by francis horner and a meeting was arranged moore who had only once in his life discharged a firearm of any kind and then nearly blew his thumb off borrowed a case of pistols from william spencer and bought in bond street enough powder and bullets for a score of duels the parties met at chalk farm the seconds loaded the pistols placed the men at their posts and were about to give the signal to fire when the police officers rushing upon them from behind a hedge knocked jeffreys weapon from his hand disarmed moore and conveyed the whole party to bow street they were released on bail but on moore returning to claim the borrowed pistols the officer refused to give them up because only moores pistol was loaded with ball horner however gave evidence that he had seen both pistols loaded and there but for the reports circulated in the newspapers the affair would have ended but the joke was too good to be allowed to drop and in spite of moores published letter he was for months a target for the wits memoirs journals and correspondence vol i pp 199208  in english bards etc lines 466 467 and his note byron made merry over littles leadless pistol with the result that when the second edition o¬£ the satire was published with his name attached moore sent him the following letter  dublin january 1 1810  my lordhaving just seen the name of lord byron prefixed to a work entitled english bards and scotch reviewers in which as it appears to me the lie is given to a public statement of mine respecting an affair with mr jeffrey some years since i beg you will have the goodness to inform me whether i may consider your lordship as the author of this publication  i shall not i fear be able to return to london for a week or two but in the mean time i trust your lordship will not deny me the satisfaction of knowing whether you avow the insult contained in the passages alluded to  it is needless to suggest to your lordship the propriety of keeping our correspondence secret  i have the honour to be  your lordships very humble servant  thomas moore  22 molesworth street  owing to byrons absence abroad the letter never reached him it was in fact kept back by hodgson on his return to england moore who in the interval had married sent him a second letter restating the nature of the insult he had received in english bards  it is now useless i continued life p 143 to speak of the steps with which it was my intention to follow up that letter the time which has elapsed since then though it has done away neither the injury nor the feeling of it has in many respects materially altered my situation and the only object which i have now in writing to your lordship is to preserve some consistency with that former letter and to prove to you that the injured feeling still exists however circumstances may compel me to be deaf to its dictates at present when i say injured feeling let me assure your lordship that there is not a single vindictive sentiment in my mind towards you i mean but to express that uneasiness under what i consider to be a charge of falsehood which must haunt a man of any feeling to his grave unless the insult be retracted or atoned for and which if i did not feel i should indeed deserve far worse than your lordships satire could inflict upon me in conclusion i added that so far from being influenced by any angry or resentful feeling towards him it would give me sincere pleasure if by any satisfactory explanation he would enable me to seek the honour of being henceforward ranked among his acquaintance  byrons letter of october 27 1811 was written in reply to this second letter from moore   footnote 2 for samuel rogers see p 67 note 1                                               203to r c dallas   8 st jamess street 29th october 1811   dear siri arrived in town last night and shall be very glad to see you when convenient  yours very truly  byron    204to thomas moore 1   8 st jamess street october 29 1811  sirsoon after my return to england my friend mr hodgson apprised me that a letter for me was in his possession but a domestic event hurrying me from london immediately after the letter which may most probably be your own is still unopened in his keeping if on examination of the address the similarity of the handwriting should lead to such a conclusion it shall be opened in your presence for the satisfaction of all parties mr h is at present out of townon friday i shall see him and request him to forward it to my address  with regard to the latter part of both your letters until the principal point was discussed between us i felt myself at a loss in what manner to reply was i to anticipate friendship from one who conceived me to have charged him with falsehood were not advances under such circumstances to be misconstruednot perhaps by the person to whom they were addressed but by others in my case such a step was impracticable if you who conceived yourself to be the offended person are satisfied that you had no cause for offence it will not be difficult to convince me of it my situation as i have before stated leaves me no choice i should have felt proud of your acquaintance had it commenced under other circumstances but it must rest with you to determine how far it may proceed after so auspicious a beginning  i have the honour to be etc    footnote 1 moore had replied accepting byrons explanation and adding    as your lordship does not show any wish to proceed beyond the rigid   formulary of explanation it is not for me to make any further   advances we irishmen in businesses of this kind seldom know any   medium between decided hostility and decided friendship but as any   approaches towards the latter alternative must now depend entirely on   your lordship i have only to repeat that i am satisfied with your   letter and that i have the honour to be etc etc                                               205to thomas moore 1   8 st jamess street october 30 1811  siryou must excuse my troubling you once more upon this very unpleasant subject it would be a satisfaction to me and i should think to yourself that the unopened letter in mr hodgsons possession supposing it to prove your own should be returned in statu quo to the writer particularly as you expressed yourself not quite easy under the manner in which i had dwelt on its miscarriage  a few words more and i shall not trouble you further i felt and still feel very much flattered by those parts of your correspondence which held out the prospect of our becoming acquainted if i did not meet them in the first instance as perhaps i ought let the situation i was placed in be my defence you have now declared yourself satisfied and on that point we are no longer at issue if therefore you still retain any wish to do me the honour you hinted at i shall be most happy to meet you when where and how you please and i presume you will not attribute my saying thus much to any unworthy motive  i have the honour to remain etc    footnote 1    piqued says moore life 144 at the manner in which my efforts   towards a more friendly understanding were received  he had briefly expressed his satisfaction at byrons explanation and added that the correspondence might close                                               206to r c dallas   8 st jamess street october 31 1811  dear siri have already taken up so much of your time that there needs no excuse on your part but a great many on mine for the present interruption i have altered the passages according to your wish with this note i send a few stanzas on a subject which has lately occupied much of my thoughts they refer to the death of one to whose name you are a stranger and consequently cannot be interested i mean them to complete the present volume they relate to the same person whom i have mentioned in canto 2nd and at the conclusion of the poem  i by no means intend to identify myself with harold but to deny all connection with him if in parts i may be thought to have drawn from myself believe me it is but in parts and i shall not own even to that as to the monastic dome etc 1 i thought those circumstances would suit him as well as any other and i could describe what i had seen better than i could invent i would not be such a fellow as i have made my hero for all the world  yours ever  b    footnote 1 childe harold canto ii stanza xlviii                                               207to thomas moore   8 st jamess street november 1 1811  siras i should be very sorry to interrupt your sundays engagement if monday or any other day of the ensuing week would be equally convenient to yourself and friend i will then have the honour of accepting his invitation 1  of the professions of esteem with which mr rogers 2 has honoured me i cannot but feel proud though undeserving i should be wanting to myself if insensible to the praise of such a man and should my approaching interview with him and his friend lead to any degree of intimacy with both or either i shall regard our past correspondence as one of the happiest events of my life i have the honour to be  your very sincere and obedient servant  byron    footnote 1 rogers has left an account of this dinner    neither moore nor myself had ever seen byron when it was settled that   he should dine at my house to meet moore nor was he known by sight to   campbell who happening to call upon me that morning consented to   join the party i thought it best that i alone should  be in the   drawingroom when byron entered it and moore and campbell accordingly   withdrew soon after his arrival they returned and i introduced them   to him severally naming them as adam named the beasts when we sat   down to dinner i asked byron if he would take soup no he never   took soup would he take some fish no he never took fish   presently i asked if he would eat some mutton no he never ate   mutton i then asked if he would take a glass of wine no he never   tasted wine it was now necessary to inquire what he did eat and   drink and the answer was nothing but hard biscuits and sodawater   unfortunately neither hard biscuits nor sodawater were at hand and   he dined upon potatoes bruised down on his plate and drenched with   vinegar my guests stayed very late discussing the merits of walter   scott and joanna baillie some days after meeting hobhouse i said to   him how long will lord byron persevere in his present diet he   replied just as long as you continue to notice it i did not then   know what i now know to be a fact that byron after leaving my   house had gone to a club in st jamess street and eaten a hearty   meatsupper  tabletalk of samuel rogers pp 231 232 moores life p 145 first impressions of byron were    the nobleness of his air his beauty the gentleness of his voice and   manners andwhat was naturally not the least attractionhis marked   kindness to myself being in mourning for his mother the colour as   well of his dress as of his glossy curling and picturesque hair   gave more effect to the pure spiritual paleness of his features in   the expression of which when he spoke there was a perpetual play of   lively thought though melancholy was their habitual character when in   repose   footnote 2 samuel rogers 17631855 the third son of a london banker was born at stoke newington shortly after his fathers death in 1793 he withdrew from any active part in the management of the bank and devoted himself for the rest of his long life to literature art and society in 1803 he moved from chambers in the temple to a house in st jamess place overlooking the green park here he lived till his death in december 1855 and here he gathered round him at his celebrated breakfasts the most distinguished men and women of his time an excellent account of the town mouse entertaining the country mouse is given by dean stanley life vol i p 298 who met wordsworth at breakfast with rogers in 1841 and describes    the town mouse a sleek wellfed sly white mouse and the   country mouse with its rough weatherworn face and grey hairs the   town mouse displaying its delicate little rolls and pyramids of   glistening strawberries the country mouse exulting in its hollow   tree its crust of bread and liberty and rallying its brother on his   late hours and frequent dinners  one of his earliest recollections was the sight of a rebels head  upon a pole at temple bar he had talked with a thames boatman who remembered pope had seen garrick in the suspicious husband had heard sir joshua reynolds deliver his last lecture as president of the royal academy had seen john wesley lying in state in the city road had gone to call on dr johnson but when his hand was on the knocker found his courage fled he lived to be offered the laureateship in 1850 on the death of wordsworth and to decline it in favour of tennyson    time was wrote mathias pursuits of literature note p 360 ed   1808 when bankers were as stupid as their guineas could make them   they were neither orators nor painters nor poets but now  mr   rogers dreams on parnassus and if i am rightly informed there is a   great demand among his brethren for the pleasures of memory  rogers began to write poetry at an early age and continued to write it all his life his ode to superstition was published in 1786 the pleasures of memory in 1792 the epistle to a friend in 1798 columbus in 1812 jacqueline in 1813 human life in 1819 italy in 182234 his later years were occupied in revising correcting or amplifying his published poems and in preparing the notes to italy which are admirable studies in compactness and precision of language a disciple of pope an imitator of goldsmith rogers was rather a skilful adapter than an original poet his chief talent was his taste if he could not originate he could appreciate the fastidious care which he lavished on his work has preserved it in his commonplacebook he has entered the number of years which he spent in composing and revising his poems his pleasures of memory occupied seven years columbus fourteen and italy fifteen an excellent judge of art he employed flaxman stothard and turner at a time when their powers were little appreciated by his fellowcountrymen of his taste byron speaks enthusiastically in his journal see p 331 but the following passage hitherto unpublished from his detached thoughts ravenna 1821 gives his later opinion of the man    when sheridan was on his deathbed rogers aided him with purse and   person this was particularly kind of rogers who always spoke ill of   sheridan to me at least but indeed he does that of everybody to   anybody rogers is the reverse of the line      the best good man with the worst natured muse    being      the worst good man with the best natured muse    his muse being all sentiment and sago and sugar while he himself is a   venomous talker i say worst good man because he is perhaps a   good man at least he does good now and then as well he may   to purchase himself a shillings worth of salvation for his slanders   they are so little toosmall talkand old womanny and he is   malignant tooand enviousandhe be damned  in a manuscript note to these passages sir walter scott writes    i never heard rogers say a single word against byron which is rather   odd too byron wrote a bitter and undeserved satire on rogers this   conduct must have been motived by something or other  speaking of rogers and sheridan he says    he certainly took pennyworths out of his friends character i sat   three hours for my picture to sir thomas lawrence during which the   whole conversation was filled up by rogers with stories of sheridan   for the least of which if true he deserved the gallows one   respected his committing a rape on his sisterinlaw on the day of her   husbands funeral others were worse  in politics rogers was a whig in religion a presbyterian but he meddled little with either in private life he was as kindly in action as he was caustic in speech a sensitive man himself he studied to be satirical to others when ward condemned columbus in the quarterly review rogers repaid his critic in the stinging epigram    ward has no heart they say but i deny it   he has a heart and gets his speeches by it  byron warmly admired rogerss poetry to him he dedicated the giaour in    admiration for his genius respect for his character and gratitude   for his friendship  the quarterly review in an article on the corsair and lara mentions    the highly refined but somewhat insipid pastoral tale of   jacqueline  byron on reading the review said to lady byron    the mans a fool jacqueline is as superior to lara as rogers is   to me  tabletalk of samuel rogers p 154 note    the pleasures of memory he said lady blessingtons   conversations p 153 is a very beautiful poem harmonious   finished and chaste it contains not a single meretricious ornament   if rogers has not fixed himself in the higher fields of parnassus he   has at least cultivated a very pretty flowergarden at its base   but he goes on to speak of the poem p 354 as a hortus siccus of   pretty flowers and an illustration of the difference between   inspiration and versification  if rogers ever saw byrons question and answer 1818 he was generous enough to forget the satire in italy he paid a noble tribute to the genius of the dead poet    he is now at rest   and praise and blame fall on his ear alike   now dull in death yes byron thou art gone   gone like a star that through the firmament   shot and was lost in its eccentric course   dazzling perplexing yet thy heart methinks   was generous noblenoble in its scorn   of all things low or little nothing there   sordid or servile if imagined wrongs   pursued thee urging thee sometimes to do   things long regretted oft as many know   none more than i thy gratitude would build   on slight foundations and if in thy life   not happy in thy death thou surely wert   thy wish accomplished dying in the land   where thy young mind had caught ethereal fire   dying in greece and in a cause so glorious     they in thy trainah little did they think   as round we went that they so soon should sit   mourning beside thee while a nation mourned   changing her festal for her funeral song   that they so soon should hear the minutegun   as morning gleamed on what remained of thee   roll oer the sea the mountains numbering   thy years of joy and sorrow                                 thou art gone   and he who would assail thee in thy grave   oh let him pause for who among us all   tried as thou werteven from thy earliest years   when wandering yet unspoilt a highland boy   tried as thou wert and with thy soul of flame   pleasure while yet the down was on thy cheek   uplifting pressing and to lips like thine   her charmed cupah who

embody the chief mythologies of the world in spite of byrons adverse opinion it contains magnificent passages and disputes with roderick the last of the goths 1814 the claim to be the finest of his longer poems southeys literary activity was immense he had already produced joan of arc 1796 thalaba 1801 madoc 1805 and many other works in prose and verse at this time he was personally unknown to byron who had ridiculed his annual strains they met for the first time at holland house in september 1813 see byrons letter to moore september 27 1813 and journal p 331 the animosity between the two men belongs to a later date and in its origin was partly political partly personal southey in early life had been a republican and a unitarian if not a deist he collaborated with coleridge in the fall

and atheism he became a champion of monarchical principles and of religious orthodoxy and attacked the views which he had once held and expressed in wat tyler written in 1794 and piratically published in 1817 with the bitterness of a reactionary he had also as byron believed circulated if not invented a report that byron and shelley had formed a league of incest at geneva in 181617 with two girls mary godwin mrs shelley and jane clairmont byron not only denied the charge but retorted upon him in his observations upon an article in blackwoods magazine march 15 1820 as the author of wat tyler and poet laureate the man who wrote treason and serves the king the expantisocrat who advocated all things including women in common southeys vision of judgment an apotheosis of george iii published in 1821 gave byron a second provocation and a second opportunity by speaking in the preface of his satanic spirit of pride and audacious impiety byron again replied in prose and southey january 5 1820 in a letter to the london courier invited him to attack him in rhyme in byrons vision of judgment he found his invitation accepted and himself pilloried in that tremendous satire southey overvalued

of poetry the lectures were given under the auspices of the london philosophical society in the scots corporation hall crane court fleet street single tickets for the whole course were two guineas or three guineas with the privilege of introducing a lady j payne collier took shorthand notes of the lectures and published a portion of his material the rest being lost lectures on shakespear from

notes on shakspere and other english poets  collier in his notes of coleridges conversation november i 1811 gives the substance in all probability of the attack on campbell alluded to in the next letter coleridge said that neither southey scott nor campbell would by their poetry survive much beyond the day when they lived and wrote their works seemed to him not to have the seeds of vitality the real germs of long life the two first were entertaining as tellers of stories in verse but the last in his pleasures of hope obviously  had no fixed design but when a thought of course not a very original one came into his head he put it down in couplets and afterwards strung the disjecta membra not poet√¶ together some of the best things in it were borrowed for instance the line    and

the second time 18069 from 1809 at which date his political and diplomatic career closed he devoted himself to literature he had already published philosophical sketches on the principles of society and government 1793 a review of the governments of sparta and athens 1795 the satires of persius translated 1798 byblis a tragedy in verse 1802 academical questions 1805 in 1810 he published herculanensia and in the following year printed for private circulation his oedipus judaicus a bold attempt to explain many parts of the old testament as astronomical allegories in 1817 appeared the first part of his odin a poem in blank verse in 182429 his origines or remarks on the origin of several empires states and cities was published sir william who died at rome in 1828 lived much of his later life abroad  drummond as a member of the alfred club is described in the sexagenarian vol ii chap xxiv where beloe speaking of the edipus judaicus says that    he appeared to have employed his leisure in searching for objections   and arguments as they related to scripture which had been so often   refuted that they were considered by the learned and wise as almost   exploded  he refers to byblis as evidence of his perverted and fantastical taste in poetry praises his spirited translation of persius commends the sound sense and very extensive reading of his philosophical sketches and scoffs at the metaphysical labyrinth of his academical questions    when you go to naples said byron to lady blessington   conversations pp 238 239 you must make acquaintance with sir   william drummond for he is certainly one of the most erudite men and   admirable philosophers now living he has all the wit of voltaire   with a profundity that seldom appertains to wit and writes so   forcibly and with such elegance and purity of style that his works   possess a peculiar charm have you read his academical questions if   not get them directly and i think you will agree with me that the   preface to that work alone would prove sir william drummond an   admirable writer he concludes it by the following sentence which i   think one of the best in our language      prejudice may be trusted to guard the outworks for a short space     of time while reason slumbers in the citadel but if the latter     sink into a lethargy the former will quickly erect a standard for     herself philosophy wisdom and liberty support each other he who     will not reason is a bigot he who cannot is a fool and he who     dares not is a slave    is not the passage admirable how few could have written it and yet   how few read drummonds works they are too good to be popular his   odin is really a fine poem and has some passages that are   beautiful but it is so little read that it may be said to have   dropped stillborn from the pressa mortifying proof of the bad taste   of the age his translation of persius is not only very literal but   preserves much of the spirit of the original he has escaped all   the defects of translators and his persius resembles the original as   nearly in feeling and sentiment as two languages so dissimilar in   idiom will admit   footnote 6 henry

though always   amusing this na√Øvet√© of his is the more piquant from his being   really a goodnatured man who unconsciously thinks aloud interest   ward on a subject and i know no one who can talk

editor 182030  campbell also apparently read his lectures aloud at private houses miss berry journal vol ii p 502 mentions a dinnerparty on june 26 1812 at the princess of waless where she heard him read his first discourse delivered at the institution again ibid vol iii p 6 she dined with madame de stael march 9 1814    nobody but campbell the poet rocca and her own daughter after   dinner campbell read to us a discourse of his upon english poetry   and upon some of the great poets there are always signs of a poet and   critic of genius in all he does often encumbered by too ornate a   style  campbells best work was done between 1798 and 1810 within that period were published the pleasures of hope 1799 gertrude of wyoming 1809 and such other shorter poems as hohenlinden ye mariners of england the battle of the baltic and oconnors child his ritter bann a reminiscence of his sojourn abroad 18001 was not published till later both it and the last man were published in the new monthly magazine during the period of his editorship an excellent judge of verse he collected specimens of the british poets 1819 to which he added a valuable essay on poetry and short biographies his theodoric 1824 pilgrim of glencoe 1842 and lives of mrs siddons petrarch and shakespeare added nothing to his reputation  the judgment of contemporary poets in the main agreed with coleridges estimate of campbells work    there are some of campbells lyrics said rogers tabletalk   etc pp 254 255 which will never die his pleasures of hope is   no great favourite with me the feeling throughout his gertrude is   very beautiful wordsworth also thought the pleasures of hope   strangely overrated its fine words and sounding lines please the   generality of readers who never stop to ask themselves the meaning of   a passage byron who calls campbell a warmhearted and honest man   thought that his lochiel and mariners are spiritstirring   productions his gertrude of wyoming is beautiful and some of the   episodes in his pleasures of hope pleased me so much that i know   them by heart  lady blessingtons conversations with lord byron p 353  george ticknor who met campbell in 1815 life vol i p 63 says    he is a short small man and has one of the roundest and most lively   faces i have seen amongst this grave people his manners seemed as   open as his countenance and his conversation as spirited as his   poetry he could have kept me amused till morning  shortly afterwards ticknor went to see him at sydenham ibid p 65    campbell had the same good spirits and love of merriment as when i   met him beforethe same desire to amuse everybody about him but   still i could see as i partly saw then that he labours under the   burden of an extraordinary reputation too easily acquired and feels   too constantly that it is necessary for him to make an exertion to   satisfy expectation the consequence is that though he is always   amusing he is not always quite natural  sir walter scott made a similar remark about the numbing effect of campbells reputation upon his literary work his deference to critics ruined his individuality it was scotts admiration for hohenlinden which induced campbell to publish the poem the two men travelling in a stagecoach alone beguiled the way by repeating poetry at last scott asked campbell for something of his own he replied that there was one thing he had never printed full of drums and trumpets and blunderbusses and thunder and that he did not know if there was any good in it he then repeated hohenlinden when he had finished scott broke out with   but do you know thats devilish fine why its the finest thing   you ever wrote and it must be printed   footnote 6 see p 31 note 1 footnote 1 of letter 181   footnote 7 douglas james william kinnaird 17881830 fifth son of the seventh baron kinnaird was educated at eton gottingen and trinity college cambridge he was an intimate friend of hobhouse with whom he travelled on the continent 181314 and was in political sympathy he represented bishops castle from july 1819 to march 1820 but losing his seat at the general election did not again attempt to enter parliament he was famous for his mob dinners to which moore probably refers when he writes to byron in an undated letter of the deipnosophist kinnaird he was a partner in the bank of ransom and morland a member of the committee for managing drury lane theatre author of the acting version of the merchant of bruges or beggars bush acted at drury lane december 14 1815 and a member of the radical rota club  kinnaird was byrons trusty and trustworthy trustee and banker and crown and sheet anchor it was at his suggestion that byron wrote the hebrew melodies and the monody on the death of sheridan talking of kinnaird to lady blessington conversations p 215 byron said    my friend dug is a proof that a good heart cannot compensate for an   irritable temper whenever he is named people dwell on the last and   pass over the first and yet he really has an excellent heart and a   sound head of which i in common with many others of his friends   have had various proofs he is clever too and well informed and i   do think would have made a figure in the world were it not for his   temper which gives a dictatorial tone to his manner that is   offensive to the amour propre of those with whom he mixes   footnote 8 the alfred club 180855 established at 23 albemarle street was the savile of the day beloe in his sexagenarian vol ii chaps xxxxv describes among the members of the symposium as he calls it sir james mackintosh george ellis william gifford john reeves sir w drummond and himself byron in his detached thoughts says    i was a member of the alfred it was pleasant a little too sober and   literary and bored with sotheby and sir francis divernois but one   met peel and ward and valentia and many other pleasant or known   people and it was upon the whole a decent resource in a rainy day   in a dearth of parties or parliament or in an empty season  it was says mr wheatley london past and present known as the halfread  in a manuscript note now for the first time printed as written on the above passage from byrons detached thoughts sir walter scott writes    the alfred like all other clubs was much haunted with boars a   tusky monster which delights to range where men most do congregate a   boar or bore is always remarkable for something respectable such as   wealth character high birth acknowledged talent or in short for   something that forbids people to turn him out by the shoulders or in   other words to cut him dead much of this respectability is supplied   by the mere circumstance of belonging to a certain society of   clubists within whose districts the bore obtains freewarren and may   wallow or grunt at pleasure old stagers in the club know and avoid   the fated corner and armchair which he haunts but he often rushes   from his lair on the inexperienced

most delectably i have hopes of his joining us at newstead i am sure you would like him more and more as he developesat least i do  how miller and bland go on i dont know cawthorne talks of being in treaty for a novel of madame darblays and if he obtains it at 1500 guineas wishes me to see the ms this i should read with pleasure not that i should ever dare to venture a criticism on her whose writings dr johnson once revised but for the pleasure of the thing if my worthy publisher wanted a sound opinion i should send the ms to rogers and moore as men most alive to true taste i have had

      217to william harness  8 st jamess street dec 15 1811  i wrote you an answer to your last which on reflection pleases me as little as it probably has pleased yourself i will not wait for your rejoinder but proceed to tell you that i had just then been greeted with an epistle of  s full of his petty grievances and this at the moment when from circumstances it is not necessary to enter upon i was bearing up against recollections to which his imaginary sufferings are as a scratch to a cancer these things combined put me out of humour with him and all mankind the latter part of my life has been a perpetual struggle against affections which embittered the earliest portion and though i flatter myself i have in a great measure conquered them yet there are moments and this was one when i am as foolish as formerly i never said so much before nor had i said this now if i did not suspect myself of having been rather savage in my letter and wish to inform you this much of the cause you know i am not one of your dolorous gentlemen so now let us laugh again  yesterday i went with moore to sydenham to visit campbell 1 he was not visible so we jogged homeward merrily enough tomorrow i dine with rogers and am to hear coleridge who is a kind of rage at present last night i saw kemble in coriolanus 2he was glorious and exerted himself wonderfully by good luck i got an excellent place in the best part of the house which was more than overflowing clare 3 and delawarr 4 who were there on the same speculation were less fortunate i saw them by accidentwe were not together i wished for you to gratify your love of shakspeare and of fine acting to its fullest extent last week i saw an exhibition of a different kind in a mr coates 5 at the haymarket who performed lothario in a damned and damnable manner  i told you the fate of bland and hodgson in my last so much for these sentimentalists who console themselves in their stews for the lossthe never to be recovered lossthe despair of the refined attachment of a couple of drabs you censure my life harnesswhen i compare myself with these men my elders and my betters i really begin to conceive myself a monument of prudencea walking statuewithout feeling or failing and yet the world in general hath given me a proud preeminence over them in profligacy yet i like the men and god knows ought not to condemn their aberrations but i own i feel provoked when they dignify all this by the name of loveromantic attachments for things marketable for a dollar  dec 16thi have just received your letteri feel your kindness very deeply the foregoing part of my letter written yesterday will i hope account for the tone of the former though it cannot excuse it i do like to hear from youmore than like next to seeing you i have no greater satisfaction but you have other duties and greater pleasures and i should regret to take a moment from either h   was to call today but i have not seen him the circumstances you mention at the close of your letter is another proof in favour of my opinion of mankind such you will always find themselfish and distrustful i except none the cause of this is the state of society in the world every one is to stir for himselfit is useless perhaps selfish to expect any thing from his neighbour but i do not think we are born of this disposition for you find friendship as a schoolboy and love enough before twenty  i went to see   he keeps me in town where i dont wish to be at present he is a good man but totally without conduct and now my dearest william i must wish you good morrow and remain ever most sincerely and affectionately yours etc    footnote 1 campbell lived at sydenham from 1804 to 1820 moore life p 148 adds the following note    on this occasion another of the noble poets

who was shutting the door   of the visavis have you put in the pistols and was answered in   the affirmative it was difficultmore especially taking into   account the circumstances under which we had just become acquainted   to keep from smiling at this singular noonday precaution   footnote 2 on december 14 1811 at covent garden kemble acted coriolanus with mrs siddons as volumnia it was kembles

the smallest controul or indeed by any one whatever while i have the power to protect her i am truly sorry to have any subject of complaint against you i have too good an opinion of you to think i shall have occasion to repeat it after the care i have taken of you and my favourable intentions in your behalf i see no occasion for any communication whatever between you and the women and wish you to occupy yourself in preparing for the situation in which you will be placed if a common sense of decency cannot prevent you from conducting yourself towards them with rudeness i should at least hope that your own interest and regard for a master who has never treated you with unkindness will have some weight  yours etc byron  psi wish you to attend to your arithmetic to occupy yourself in surveying measuring and making yourself acquainted with every particular relative to the land of newstead and you will write to me one letter every week that i may know how you go on    footnote 1 the two following letters and a suppressed passage in the letter to moore of january 29 1812 refer to a quarrel among his dependents in which rushton the little page of childe harold see letters vol i pp

proof that the girl had forgotten me and herself too   heigho b  the letters show writes moore life p 152    how gravely and coolly the young lord could arbitrate on such an   occasion and with what considerate leaning towards the servant whose   fidelity he had proved in preference to any new liking or fancy by   which it might be suspected he was actuated toward the other  in a ms book written by mrs heath of newstead n√©e rebekah beardall it is stated that the elder rushton had as his farmservant fletcher afterwards byrons valet byron watched fletcher and young robert rushton ploughing took a fancy to both and engaged them as his servants rushton accompanied byron to geneva but afterwards entered the service of james wedderburn webster see p 2 note 1 in 1827 he married a woman of the name of bagnall and with her help kept a school at arnold near nottingham subsequently he took a farm on the newstead estate named hazelford and shortly afterwards died leaving a widow and three children                                               219to robert rushton   8 st jamess street january 25 1812  your refusal to carry the letter was not a subject of remonstrance it was not a part of your business but the language you used to the girl was as she stated it highly improper  you say that you also have something to complain of then state it to me immediately it would be very unfair and very contrary to my disposition not to hear both sides of the question  if any thing has passed between you before or since my last visit to newstead do not be afraid to mention it i am sure you would not deceive me though she would whatever it is you shall be forgiven i have not been without some suspicions on the subject and am certain that at your time of life the blame could not attach to you you will not consult  any one as to your answer but write to me immediately i shall be more ready to hear what you have to advance as i do not remember ever to have heard a word from you before against any human being which convinces me you would not maliciously assert an untruth there is not any one who can do the least injury to you while you conduct yourself properly i shall expect your answer immediately yours etc  byron                                               220to thomas moore   january 29 1812   my dear moorei wish very much i could have seen you i am in a state of ludicrous tribulation  why do you say that i dislike your poesy 1 i have expressed no such opinion either in print or elsewhere in scribbling myself it was necessary for me to find fault and i fixed upon the trite charge of immorality because i could discover no other and was so perfectly qualified in the innocence of my heart to pluck that mote from my neighbours eye  i feel very very much obliged by your approbation but at this moment praise even your praise passes by me like the idle wind i meant and mean to send you a copy the moment of publication but now i can think of nothing but damned deceitfuldelightful woman as mr liston says in the knight of snowdon 2 believe me my dear moore  ever yours most affectionately byron    footnote 1 of moores early poems byron was an admirer the influence of little and anacreon is strongly marked throughout hours of idleness for the trite charge of immorality see english bards etc lines 283294 and letters vol i p 113 byrons opinion of

hodgsoni am rather unwell with a vile cold caught in the house of lords last night lord sligo and myself being tired paired off being of opposite sides so that nothing was gained or lost by our votes i did not speak but i might as well for nothing could have been inferior to the duke of devonshire marquis of downshire and the earl of fitzwilliam the catholic question comes on this month and

sirwith my best acknowledgments to lord holland 1 i have to offer my perfect concurrence in the propriety of the question previously to be put to ministers if their answer is in the negative i shall with his lordships approbation give notice of a motion for a committee of inquiry i would also gladly avail myself of his most able advice and any information or documents with which he might be pleased to intrust me to bear me out in the statement of facts it may be necessary to submit to the house  from all that fell under my own observation during my christmas visit to newstead i feel convinced that if conciliatory measures are not very soon adopted the most unhappy consequences may be apprehended 2  nightly outrage and daily depredation are already at their height and not only the masters of frames who are obnoxious on account of their occupation but persons in no degree connected with the malecontents or their oppressors are liable to insult and pillage  i am very much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken on my account and beg you to believe me  ever your obliged and sincere etc    footnote 1 for lord holland see letters vol i p 184 note 1 footnote 3 of letter 94 he was recorder of nottingham hence his special interest in the proposed legislation against framebreaking   footnote 2 owing to the state of trade numbers of stockingweavers had lost work the discontent thus produced was increased by the introduction of a wide frame for the manufacture of gaiters and stockings which it was supposed would further diminish the demand for manual labour in november 1811 organized bands of men began to break into houses and destroy machinery for several days no serious effort was made to check the riots which extended to a considerable distance round nottingham but on november 14 the soldiers were called out between that date and december 9 900 cavalry and 1000 infantry were sent to nottingham and on january 8 1812 these forces were increased by two additional regiments the rioters assumed the name of luddites and their leader was known as general lud the name is said to have originated in 1779 in a leicestershire village where a halfwitted lad named ned lud broke a stockingframe in a fit of passion hence the common saying when machinery was broken that ned lud did it a bill was introduced in the house of commons february 14 increasing the severity of punishments for framebreaking on the second reading february 17 sir samuel romilly strongly opposed the measure which passed its third reading february 20 without a division the bill as introduced into the upper house by lord liverpool  1 rendered the offence of framebreaking punishable by death and 2 compelled persons in whose houses the frames were broken to give information to the magistrates  on the second reading of the bill february 27 1812 byron spoke against it in his first speech in the house of lords see appendix ii i the bill passed its third reading on march 5 and became law as 52 geo iii c 16 byron did not confine his opposition to a speech in the house of lords he also addressed an ode to the framers of the frame bill which appeared in the morning chronicle

the writer of these lines who would perhaps be unable to recognize yourself from the difference which must naturally have taken place in your stature and appearance since he saw you last i have been rambling through portugal spain greece etc etc for some years and have found so many changes on my return that it would be very unfair not to expect that you should have had your share of alteration and improvement with the rest i write to request a favour of you a little boy of eleven years the son of mr  my particular friend is about to become an etonian and i should esteem any act of protection or kindness to him as an obligation to myself let me beg of you then to take some little notice of him at first till he is able to shift for himself  i was happy to hear a very favourable account of you from a schoolfellow a few weeks ago and should be glad to learn that your family are as well as i wish them to be i presume you are in the upper schoolas an etonian you will look down upon a harrow man but i never even in my boyish days disputed your superiority which i once experienced in a cricket match where i had the honour of making one of eleven who were beaten to their hearts content by your college in one innings 2  believe me to be with great truth etc etc  b    footnote 1    breakfasted with mr cowell writes moore in his diary june 11   1828 having made his acquaintance for the purpose of gaining   information about lord byron knew byron for the first time when he   himself was a little boy from being in the habit of playing with bs   dogs byron wrote to him to school to bid him mind his prosody gave   me two or three of his letters to him saw a good deal of b at   hastings mentioned the anecdote about the inkbottle striking one of   the lead muses these muses had been brought from holland and there   were i think only eight of them arrived safe fletcher had brought   b a large jar of ink and not thinking it was full b had thrust   his pen down to the very bottom his anger at finding it come out all   besmeared with ink made him chuck the jar out of the window when it   knocked down one of the muses in the garden and deluged her with ink   in 1813 when b was at salt hill he had cowell over from eton and   pouched him no less than ten pounds cowell has ever since kept one   of the notes told me a curious anecdote of byrons mentioning to him   as if it had made a great impression on him their seeing shelley as   they thought walking into a little wood at lerici when it was   discovered afterwards that shelley was at that time in quite another   direction this said byron in a sort of awestruck voice was   about ten days before his death cowells imitation of his look and   manner very striking thinks that in byrons speech to fletcher

stone had got into my heart instead of my kidneys it would have been all the better however i have quite recovered that also and only wonder at my folly in excepting my own strumpets from the general

the fairest islands and retrace at intervals the most interesting portions of the east in the mean time i am adjusting my concerns which will when arranged leave me with wealth sufficient even for home but enough for a principality in turkey at present they are involved but i hope by taking some necessary but unpleasant steps to clear every thing hobhouse is expected daily in london we shall be very glad to see him and perhaps you will come up and drink deep ere he depart if not mahomet must go to the mountain 1but cambridge will bring sad recollections to him and worse to me though for very

lord byron p 74  when i knew galt years ago said byron to lady blessington i was not in a frame of mind to form an impartial opinion of him his mildness and equanimity struck me even then but to say the truth his manner had not deference enough for my then aristocratical taste and finding i could not awe him into a respect sufficiently profound for my sublime self either as a peer or an author i felt a little grudge towards him that has now completely worn off etc etc  ibid p 249   footnote 2 george edward griffiths circ 17691829 son of ralph griffiths who founded owned and published the

lived at linden house turnham green francis hodgson wrote for the monthly review and march 2 1814 he writes to byron    i have already read a review of safie in the british critic and   will undertake it in the monthly if griffiths with whom i am in   very bad odour from my late shameful idleness will allow me oh that   you would write a good smart critique of something to get both   yourself and me in high repute at turnham green  in byrons detached thoughts occurs the following passage    i have been a reviewer in the monthly review i wrote some articles   which were inserted this was in the latter part of 1811 in 1807 in   a magazine called monthly literary recreations i reviewed   wordsworths trash of that time    excepting these i cannot accuse myself of anonymous criticism that   i recollect though i have been offered more than one review in our   principal journals  in the bodleian library is a copy of the monthly review in which griffiths has entered the initials of the authors of each article two articles from the review attributed to byron on this authority are given in appendix i                                               226to lord holland   8 st jamess street february 25 1812   my lordwith my best thanks i have the honour to return the notts letter to your lordship i have read it with attention but do not think i shall venture to avail myself of its contents as my view of the question differs in some measure from mr coldhams i hope i do not wrong him but his objections to the bill appear to me to be founded on certain apprehensions that he and his coadjutors might be mistaken for the original advisers to quote him of the measure for my own part i consider the manufacturers as a much injured body of men sacrificed to the views of certain individuals who have enriched themselves by those practices which have deprived the frameworkers of employment for instanceby the adoption of a certain kind of frame one man performs the work of sevensix are thus thrown out of business but it is to be observed that the work thus done is far inferior in quality hardly marketable at home and hurried over with a view to exportation surely my lord however we may rejoice in any improvement in the arts which may be beneficial to mankind we must not allow mankind to be sacrificed to improvements in mechanism the maintenance and welldoing of the industrious poor is an object of greater consequence to the community than the enrichment of a few monopolists by any improvement in the implements of trade which deprives the workman of his bread and renders the labourer unworthy of his hire  my own motive for opposing the bill is founded on its palpable injustice and its certain inefficacy i have seen the state of these miserable men and it is a disgrace to a civilized country their excesses may be condemned but cannot be subject of wonder the effect of the present bill would be to drive them into actual rebellion the few words i shall venture to offer on thursday will be founded upon these opinions formed from my own observations on the spot by previous inquiry i am convinced these men would have been restored to employment and the county to tranquillity it is perhaps not yet too late and is surely worth the trial it can never be too late to employ force in such circumstances i believe your lordship does not coincide with me entirely on this subject and most cheerfully and sincerely shall i submit to your superior judgment and experience and take some other line of argument against the bill or be silent altogether should you deem it more advisable condemning as every one must condemn the conduct of these wretches i believe in the existence of grievances which call rather for pity than punishment i have the honour to be with great respect my lord your lordships  most obedient and obliged servant  byron  psi am a little apprehensive that your lordship will think me too lenient towards these men and half a framebreaker myself                                               227to francis hodgson   8 st jamess street march 5 1812   my dear hodgsonwe are not answerable for reports of speeches in the papers they are always given incorrectly and on this occasion more so than usual from the debate in the commons on the same night the morning post should have said eighteen years however you will find the speech as spoken in the parliamentary register when it comes out lords holland and grenville particularly the latter paid me some high compliments in the course of their speeches as you may have seen in the papers and lords eldon and harrowby answered me i have had many marvellous eulogies 1 repeated to me since in person and by proxy from divers persons ministerialyea ministerialas well as oppositionists of them i shall only mention sir f burdett he says it is the best speech by a lord since the lord knows when probably from a fellowfeeling in the sentiments lord h tells me i shall beat them all if i persevere and lord g remarked that the construction of some of my periods are very like burkes and so much for vanity i spoke very violent sentences with a sort of modest impudence abused every thing and every body and put the lord chancellor very much out of humour and if i may believe what i hear have not lost any character by the experiment as to my delivery loud and fluent enough perhaps a little theatrical i could not recognize myself or any one else in the newspapers 2  i hire myself unto griffiths and my poesy 3 comes out on saturday hobhouse is here i shall tell him

quotes a passage from byrons detached thoughts    sheridans liking for me whether he was not mystifying me i do not   know but lady caroline lamb and others told me that he said the same   both before and after he knew me was founded upon english bards and   scotch reviewers he told me that he did not care about poetry or   about mineat least any but that poem of mine but he was sure   from that and other symptoms i should make an orator if i would   but take to speaking and grow a parliament man he never ceased   harping upon this to me to the last and i remember my old tutor dr   drury had the same notion when i was a boy but it never was my   turn of inclination to try i spoke once or twice as all young peers   do as a kind of introduction into public life but dissipation   shyness haughty and reserved opinions together with the short time i   lived in england after my majority only about five years in all   prevented me from resuming the experiment as far as it went it was   not discouraging particularly my first speech i spoke three or   four times in all but just after it my poem of childe harold was   published and nobody ever thought about my prose afterwards nor   indeed did i it became to me a secondary and neglected object though   i sometimes wonder to myself if i should have succeeded   footnote 2 byron writing to john hanson february 28 1812 says    dear

to enter into the discussion of its merits or demerits  lord b must leave the discussion of the reparation for the real or supposed injury to colonel gs friend and mr moore the friend of lord bbegging them to recollect that while they consider colonel gs honour lord b must also maintain his own if the business can be settled amicably lord b will do as much as can and ought to be done by a man of honour towards conciliationif not he must satisfy colonel g in the manner most conducive to his further wishes    footnote 1 byron in english bards etc lines 638667 had alluded to colonel greville manager of the argyle institution    or hail at once the patron and the pile   of vice and folly greville and argyle etc  in a note he had also referred to billy ways loss of several thousand pounds in the rooms on his return from abroad colonel greville demanded satisfaction through his friend gould francis leckie byron referred leckie to moore and sent moore the above paper for his guidance the affair was amicably settled  in his detached thoughts occurs the following passage    i have been called in as mediator or second at least twenty times   in violent quarrels and have always contrived to settle the business   without compromising the honour of the parties or leading them to   mortal consequences and this too sometimes in very difficult and   delicate circumstances and having to deal with very hot and haughty   spiritsirishmen gamesters guardsmen captains and cornets of   horse and the like this was of course in my youth when i lived in   hotheaded company i have had to carry challenges from gentlemen to   noblemen from captains to captains from lawyers to counsellors and   once from a clergyman to an officer in the life guards but i found   the latter by far the most difficult      to compose     the bloody duel without blows    the business being about a woman i must add too that i never saw a   woman behave so ill like a coldblooded heartless bas she   wasbut very handsome for all that a certain susan cwas she   called i never saw her but once and that was to induce her but to   say two words which in no degree compromised herself and which   would have had the effect of saving a priest or a lieutenant of   cavalry she would not say them and neither nepean nor myself the   son of sir evan nepean and a friend to one of the parties could   prevail upon her to say them though both of us used to deal in some   sort with womankind at last i managed to quiet the combatants without   her talisman and i believe to her great disappointment she was the   damnedest bthat i ever saw and i have seen a great many though   my clergyman was sure to lose either his life or his living he was as   warlike as the bishop of beauvais and would hardly be pacified but   then he was in love and that is a martial passion  one challenge from a gentleman to a nobleman was that of scrope davies to lord foley in 1813 but byron succeeded in arranging the matter that from a lawyer to a counsellor was in 1815 from john hanson to serjeant best afterwards lord wynford and arose out of the marriage of miss hanson to lord portsmouth this quarrel was also settled by byron the case of the clergyman was that of the rev robert bland whose mistress during his absence in holland left him for an officer in the guards see letters vol i p 197 end of note footnote 1 of

try his hand as he said at a wafer wedderburn webster was present   when the poet intensely delighted with his own skill boasted to joe   manton that he considered himself the best shot in london no my   lord replied manton not the best but your shooting today was   respectable whereupon byron waxed wroth and left the shop in a   violent passion                                               230to william bankes   my dear bankesmy eagerness to come to an explanation has i trust convinced you that whatever my unlucky manner might inadvertently be the change was as unintentional as if intended it would have been ungrateful i really was not aware that while we were together i had evinced such caprices that we were not so much in each others company as i could have wished i well know but i think so acute an observer as yourself must have perceived enough to explain this without supposing any slight to one in whose society i have pride and pleasure recollect that i do not allude here to extended or extending acquaintances but to circumstances you will understand i think on a little reflection  and now my dear bankes do not distress me by supposing that i can think of you or you of me otherwise than i trust we have long thought you told me not long ago that my temper was improved and i should be sorry that opinion should be revoked believe me your friendship is of more account to me than all those absurd vanities in which i fear you conceive me to take too much interest i have never disputed your superiority or doubted seriously your good will and no one shall ever make

given by henry hope in cavendish square lady jersey was walking with rogers in the gallery when they met the prince who    stopped for a moment and then drawing himself up marched past her   with a

is all the better want of success will curb the tendency every word you utter every line you write proves you to be either sincere or a fool now as i know you are not the one i must believe you the other  i never knew a woman with greater or more pleasing talents general as in a woman they should be something of everything and too much of nothing but these are unfortunately coupled with a total want of common conduct 1 for instance the note to your pagedo you suppose i delivered it or did you mean that i should i did not of course  then your heart my poor caro what a little volcano that pours lava through your veins and yet i cannot wish it a bit colder to make a marble slab of as you sometimes see to understand my foolish metaphor brought in vases tables etc from vesuvius when hardened after an eruption to drop my detestable tropes and figures you know i have always thought you the cleverest most agreeable absurd amiable perplexing dangerous fascinating little being that lives now or ought to have lived 2000 years ago i wont talk to you of beauty i am no judge but our beauties cease to be so when near you and therefore you have either some or something better and now caro this nonsense is the first and last compliment if it be such i ever paid you you have often reproached me as wanting in that respect but others will make up the deficiency  come to lord greys at

send in to see lord byron do not tell him beforehand   but when he comes with flowers shew him in i shall not come myself   unless just before he goes away so do not think it is me besides   you will see this is quite a child only i wish him to see my lord if   you can contrive it which if you tell me what hour is most   convenient will be very easy i go out of town tomorrow for a day or   two and

last night and my hope is that it was only one of your profane jests i should be very sorry that any part of my behaviour should give you cause to suppose that i think higher of myself or otherwise of you than i have always done i can assure you that i am as much the humblest of your servants as at trin coll and if i have not been at home when you favoured me with a call the loss was more mine than yours in the bustle of buzzing parties there is there can be no rational conversation but when i can enjoy it there is nobodys i can prefer to your own  believe me ever faithfully and most

in her journal miss berry mentions two occasions on which she met byron the first was thursday april 2 1812 at lord glenbervies    i had a quarter of an hours conversation which i own gave me a   great desire to know him better and he seemed willing that i should   do so  the second occasion was may 7 1812    at the end of the evening i had half an hours conversation with lord   byron principally on the subject of the scotch review with which he   is very much pleased he is a singular man and pleasant to me but i   very much fear that his head begins to be turned by all the adoration   of the world especially the women  journal and correspondence of miss berry vol ii pp 496 497                                               235to lady caroline lamb   may 1st 1812   my dear lady carolinei have read over the few poems of miss milbank 1 with attention they display fancy feeling and a little practice would very soon induce facility of expression though i have an abhorrence of blank verse i like the lines on dermody 2 so much that i wish they were in rhyme the lines in the cave at seaham have a turn of thought which i cannot sufficiently commend and here i am at least candid as my own opinions differ upon such subjects the first stanza is very good indeed and the others with a few slight alterations might be rendered equally excellent the last are smooth and pretty but these are all has she no others she certainly is a very extraordinary girl who would imagine so much strength and variety of thought under that placid countenance it is not necessary for miss m to be an authoress indeed i do not think publishing at all creditable either to men or women and though you will not believe me very often feel ashamed of it myself but i have no hesitation in saying that she has talents which were it proper or requisite to indulge would have led to distinction  a friend of mine fifty years old and an author but not rogers has just been here as there is no name to the mss i shewed them to him and he was much more enthusiastic in his praises than i have been he thinks them beautiful i shall content myself with observing that they are better much better than anything of miss ms protegee sic blacket you will say as much of this to miss m as you think proper i say all this very sincerely i have no desire to be better acquainted with miss milbank she is too good for a fallen spirit to know and i should like her more if she were less perfect believe me yours ever most truly  b    footnote 1 this letter refers to the future lady byron the miss monmouth of glenarvon see vol iii p 100 who was first brought to byrons notice by lady caroline lamb anna isabella often shortened into annabella milbanke born may 17 1792 died may 16 1860 was the only child of sir ralph milbanke bart and the hon judith noel daughter of lord wentworth her childhood was passed at halnaby or at seaham where her father had    a pretty villa on the cliff in 1808 seaham was the most primitive   hamlet ever met witha dozen or so of cottages no trade no   manufacture no business doing that we could see the owners were   mostly servants of sir ralph milbankes  memoirs of a highland lady p 71 it was here that blacket the poet see letters vol i p 314 note 2 p 6 note 5 of the present volume and english bards etc line 770 and byrons note died befriended by miss milbanke  byron medwins conversations with lord byron pp 44 45 thus describes the personal appearance of his future wife    there was something piquant and what we term pretty in miss milbanke   her features were small and feminine though not regular she had the   fairest skin imaginable her figure was perfect for her height and   there was a simplicity a retired modesty about her which was very   characteristic and formed a happy contrast to the cold artificial   formality and studied stiffness which is called fashion  the roundness of her face suggested to byron the pet name of pippin  highprincipled guided by a strong sense of duty imbued with deep religious feeling miss milbanke lived to impress f w robertson as the noblest woman he ever knew diary of crabb robinson 1852 vol iii p 405 she was also a clever wellread girl fond of mathematics a student of theology and of greek a writer of meritorious verse which however byron only allowed to be good by accident medwin p 60 among her mothers friends were mrs siddons joanna baillie and maria edgeworth the latter writing may 1813 to miss ruxton says lady milbanke is very agreeable and has a charming wellinformed daughter with all her personal charms virtues and mental gifts she shows in many of her letters a precision formality and selfcomplacency which suggest the female pedant byron says of her that she was governed by what she called fixed rules and principles squared mathematically medwin p 60 at one time he used to speak of her as his princess of parallelograms and at a later period he called her his mathematical medea  before miss milbanke met byron she had a lover in augustus foster son of lady elizabeth foster afterwards duchess of devonshire the duchess writing to her son february 29 1812 says that mrs george lamb  would sound miss milbanke as to her feelings    caro means to see la bella annabelle before she writes to you    i shall almost hate her if she is blind to the merits of one who   would make her so happy  the two duchesses p 358 apparently mr fosters love was not returned    she persists in saying writes the duchess may 4 1812 ibid p   362 that she never suspected your attachment to her but she is so   odd a girl that though she has for some time rather liked another   she has decidedly refused them because she thinks she ought to marry   a person with a good fortune and this is partly i believe from   generosity to her parents and partly owning that fortune is an object   to herself for happiness in short she is good amiable and   sensible but cold prudent and reflecting

generousminded yet   afraid of poverty there is no making her out i hope you dont make   yourself unhappy about her she is really an icicle  miss milbankes unaffected simplicity attracted byron even her coldness was a charm when he came to know her he probably found her not only agreeable but the best woman he had ever met lady melbourne who knew him most intimately and was also miss milbankes aunt may well have thought that if her niece once gained control over byron her influence would be the making of his character she encouraged the match by every means in her power it is unnecessary to suppose that she did so to save lady caroline lamb that danger was over at some time before the autumn of 1812 byron proposed to miss milbanke and was refused he still however continued to correspond with her and his journal shows that his affection for her was steadily growing during the years 181314 in september 1814 he proposed a second time and was accepted  byron professed to believe medwin p 59 that miss milbanke was not in love with him    i was the fashion when she first came out i had the character of   being a great rake and was a great dandyboth of which young ladies   like she married me from vanity and the hope of reforming and fixing   me  byron was not the man to unbosom himself to medwin on such a subject moore asked the same questionwhether lady byron really loved byronof lady holland who    seemed to think she must he was such a loveable person i remember   him said she sitting there with that light upon him looking so   beautiful  journals etc vol ii p 324

about three oclock in the morning not   finding the house that was to receive them open mr madocks undertook   to rouse the inmates while lord byron and mr bailey sauntered arm   in arm up the street during this interval rather a painful scene   occurred seeing an unfortunate woman lying on the steps of a door   lord byron with some expression of compassion offered her a few   shillings but

answer to the concluding part of your letter is that mr murray will republish your volume if you still retain your inclination for the experiment which i trust will be successful some weeks ago my friend mr rogers showed me some of the stanzas in ms and i then expressed my opinion of their merit which a further perusal of the printed volume has given me no reason to revoke i mention this as it may not be disagreeable to you to learn that i entertained a very favourable opinion of your powers before i was aware that such sentiments were reciprocal  waiving your obliging expressions as to my own productions for which i thank you very sincerely and assure you that i think not lightly of the praise of one whose approbation is valuable will you allow me to talk to you candidly not critically on the subject of yours you will not suspect me of a wish to discourage since i pointed out to the publisher the propriety of complying with your wishes i think more highly of your poetical talents than it would perhaps gratify you to hear expressed for i believe from what i observe of your mind that you are above flattery to come to the point you deserve success but we know before addison wrote his cato that desert does not always command it but suppose it attained    you know what ills the authors life assail   toil envy want the patron and the jail 2  do not renounce writing but never trust entirely to authorship if you have a possession retain it it will be like priors fellowship 3 a last and sure resource compare mr rogers with other authors of the day assuredly he is amongst the first of living poets but is it to that he owes his station in society and his intimacy in the best circles no it is to his prudence and respectability the world a bad one i own courts him because he has no occasion to court it he is a poet nor is he less so because he was something more i am not sorry to hear that you are not tempted by the vicinity of capel loft esqre 4 though if he had done for you what he has done for the bloomfields i should never have laughed at his rage for patronising but a truly constituted mind will ever be independent that you may be so is my sincere wish and if others think as well of your poetry as i do you will have no cause to complain of your readers  believe me etc    footnote 1 bernard barton 17841849 the friend of charles lamb and the quaker poet to

welli hope that neither politics nor gout have assailed your lordship since i last saw you and that you also are as well as could be expected  the other night at a ball i was presented by order to our

apprehension of a similar blunder i have now great hope in the event of mr pyes 3 decease of warbling truth at court like mr mallet 4 of indifferent memoryconsider one hundred marks a year besides the wine and the disgrace but then remorse would make me drown myself in my own butt before the years end or the finishing of my first dithyrambicso that after all i shall not meditate our laureates death

several lucrative offices and dying in 1794 left ¬£65000 in the hands of trustees for division among his three children the youngest of these was george bryan brummell 17881840 the celebrated beau  george brummell went from eton to oriel college oxford where his undergraduate career is traced in trebeck a character in listers granby 1826 from oxford brummell entered the tenth hussars a favourite regiment of the prince of wales wellbuilt and wellmannered possessed of admirable tact witty and original in conversation inexhaustible in good temper and good stories a master of impudence and banter the new cornet made himself so agreeable to the prince that at the latters marriage brummell attended him both at st jamess and to windsor as a kind of chevalier dhonneur in 1798 brummell left the army with the rank of captain a year later he came of age and settled at 4 chesterfield street mayfair  on his intimacy with the prince regent brummell founded the extraordinary position which he achieved in society fashion was in those days a power and he was its dictatorthe oracle both for men and women of taste manners and dress his ascendency rested in some degree on solid foundations he was not a mere fop but conspicuous for the quiet neatness of his dressfor a certain exquisite propriety as byron described it to leigh huntand at a time when the opposite was common for the scrupulous cleanliness of his person and his linen an excellent dancer clever at vers de soci√©t√© an agreeable singer a talented artist a judge of china buhl and other objects of virt√π a collector of snuffboxes a connoisseur in canes he had gifts which might have raised him above the bond street flaneur or the idler at watiers club wellread in a desultory fashion he wrote verses which were not without merit in their class the following are the first and last stanzas of the butterflys funeral a poem which was suggested by mrs dorsets peacock at home and roscoes butterflys ball    oh ye who so lately were blythsome and gay   at the butterflys banquet carousing away   your feasts and your revels of pleasure are fled   for the soul of the banquet the butterflys dead

sing  in the days of his prosperity 17991816 brummell knew everybody to whose acquaintance he condescended his album in which he collected 226 pieces of poetry many by himself others by celebrities of the day is a curious proof of his popularity it contains contributions from such persons as the duchess of devonshire erskine lord john townshend sheridan general fitzpatrick william lamb afterwards lord melbourne and his brother george and byron lady hester stanhope memoirs vol i pp 280283 knew him well she describes him riding in bond street with his bridle between his forefinger and thumb as if he held a pinch of snuff gives many instances of his audacious effrontery and yet concludes that the man was no fool and that she should like to see him again  the story that brummell told the prince regent to ring the bell was denied by him a more probable version of the story is given in jesses life of beau brummell vol i p 255    that one evening when brummell and lord moira were engaged in   earnest conversation at carlton house the prince requested the former   to ring the bell and that he replied without reflection your royal   highness is close to it upon which the prince rang the bell and   ordered his friends carriage but that lord moiras intervention   caused the unintentional liberty to be overlooked  the rupture between them is attributed by jesse to mrs fitzherberts influence whatever the cause the prince cut his former friend a short time afterwards brummell walking with lord alvanley met the prince leaning on the arm of lord moira as the prince who stopped to speak to lord alvanley was moving on brummell said to his companion alvanley whos your fat friend in the twopenny postbag moore makes the regent say in the parody of a celebrated letter    neither

friendship with the duchess lasted till her death  he was ruined by gambling at watiers club of which he was perpetual president this club which was in piccadilly at the corner of bolton street was

william spencer belonged to watiersthe only men of letters admitted within its precincts from 1814 to 1816 brummell lost heavily he could obtain no further supplies and was completely ruined in his distress he wrote to scrope davies in may 1816    my dear scropelend me two hundred pounds the banks are shut and   all my money is in the three per cents it shall be repaid tomorrow   morning

of childe harold    trumpington wednesday morning    dear lord byronfrom the eagerness which i felt to make known my   opinions of your poem before others had expressed any upon the   subject i waited upon you to deliver my hasty although hearty   commendation if it be worthy your acceptance take it once more in a   more deliberate form upon my arrival in town i found that mathias   entirely coincided with me surely said i to him lord byron at   this time of life cannot have experienced such keen anguish as those   exquisite allusions to what older men may have felt seem to   denote this was his answer i fear he hashe could not else   have written such a poem this morning i read the second canto with   all the attention it so highly merits in the peace and stillness of   my study and i am ready to confess i was never so much affected by   any poem passionately fond of poetry as i have been from my earliest   youth    the eighth stanza yet if as holiest men etc has never been   surpassed in the twentythird the sentiment is at variance with   dryden      strange cozenage none would live past years again    and it is perhaps an instance wherein for the first time i found   not within my own breast an echo to your thought for i would not be   once more a boy but the generality of men will agree with you and   wish to tread lifes path again    in the twelfth stanza of the same canto you might really add a very   curious note to these lines      her sons too weak the sacred shrine to guard     yet felt some portion of their mothers pains    by stating this fact when the

worth while to notice the evil works of my nonage as the thing is suppressed voluntarily and your explanation is too kind not to give me pain the satire was written when i was very young and very angry and fully bent on displaying my wrath and my wit and now i am haunted by the ghosts of my wholesale assertions i cannot sufficiently thank you for your praise and now waving myself let me talk to you of the prince regent he ordered me to be presented to him at a ball and after some sayings peculiarly pleasing from royal lips as to my own attempts he talked to me of you and your immortalities he preferred you to every bard past and present and asked which of your works pleased me most it was a difficult question i answered i thought the lay he said his own opinion was nearly similar in speaking of the others i told him that i thought you more particularly the poet of princes as they never appeared more fascinating than in marmion and the lady of the lake he was pleased to coincide and to dwell on the description of your jameses as no less royal than poetical he spoke alternately of homer and yourself and seemed well acquainted with both so that with the exception of the turks 2 and your humble servant you were in very good company i defy murray to have exaggerated his royal highnesss opinion of your powers nor can i pretend to enumerate all he said on the subject but it may give you pleasure to hear that it was conveyed in language which would only suffer by my attempting to transcribe it and with a tone and taste which gave me a very high idea of his abilities and accomplishments which i had hitherto considered as confined to manners certainly superior to those of any living gentleman 3  this interview was accidental i never went to the levee for having seen the courts of mussulman and catholic sovereigns my curiosity was sufficiently allayed and my politics being as perverse as my rhymes i had in fact no business there to be thus praised by your sovereign must be gratifying to you and if that gratification is not alloyed by the communication being made through me the bearer of it will consider himself very fortunately and sincerely  your obliged and obedient servant  byron  psexcuse this scrawl scratched in a great hurry and just after a journey    footnote 1 the correspondence which begins with this letter laid the foundation of a

clever poem it did not raise his opinion of byrons character murray hoping to heal the breach between them wrote to scott june 27 1812 memoir of john murray vol i p 213 giving byrons account of the conversation with the prince regent    but the princes great delight says murray was walter scott   whose name and writings he dwelt upon and recurred to incessantly he   preferred him far beyond any other poet of the time repeated several   passages with fervour and criticized them faithfully lord byron   called upon me merely to let off the raptures of the prince   respecting you thinking as he said that if i were likely to have   occasion to write to you it might not be ungrateful for you to hear   of his praises  scotts answer july 2 enclosed the following letter from himself to byron    edinburgh july 3d 1812    my lordi am uncertain if i ought to profit by the apology which is   afforded me by a very obliging communication from our acquaintance   john murray of fleet street to give your lordship the present   trouble but my intrusion concerns a large debt of gratitude due to   your lordship and a much less important one of explanation which i   think i owe to myself as i dislike standing low in the opinion of any   person whose talents rank so highly in my own as your lordships most   deservedly do    the first count as our technical language expresses it relates to   the high pleasure i have received from the pilgrimage of childe   harold and from its precursors the former with all its classical   associations some of which are lost on so poor a scholar as i am   possesses the additional charm of vivid and animated description   mingled with original sentiment but besides this debt which i owe   your lordship in common with the rest of the reading public i have to   acknowledge my particular thanks for your having distinguished by   praise in the work which your lordship rather dedicated in general to   satire some of my own literary attempts and this leads me to put   your lordship right in the circumstances respecting the sale of   marmion which had reached you in a distorted and misrepresented   form and which perhaps i have some reason to complain were given   to the public without more particular inquiry the poem my lord was   not written upon contract for a sum of moneythough it is too true   that it was sold and published in a very unfinished state which i   have since regretted to enable me to extricate myself from some   engagements which fell suddenly upon me by the unexpected misfortunes   of a very near relation so that to quote statute and precedent i   really come under the case cited by juvenal though not quite in the   extremity of the classic author      esurit intactam paridi nisi vendit agaven    and so much for a mistake into which your lordship might easily fall   especially as i generally find it the easiest way of stopping   sentimental compliments on the beauty etc of certain poetry and   the delights which the author must have taken in the composition by   assigning the readiest reason that will cut the discourse short upon   a subject where one must appear either conceited or affectedly rude   and cynical    as for my attachment to literature i sacrificed for the pleasure of   pursuing it very fair chances of opulence and professional honours at   a time of life when i fully knew their value and i am not ashamed to   say that in deriving advantages in compensation from the partial   favour of the public i have added some comforts and elegancies to a   bare independence i am sure your lordships good sense will easily   put this unimportant egotism to the right account forthough i do   not know the motive would make me enter into controversy with a fair   or an unfair literary critici may be well excused for a wish   to clear my personal character from any tinge of mercenary or sordid   feeling in the eyes of a contemporary of genius your lordship will   likewise permit me to add that you would have escaped the trouble of   this explanation had i not understood that the satire alluded to had   been suppressed not to be reprinted for in removing a prejudice on   your lordships own mind i had no intention of making any appeal by   or through you to the public since my own habits of life have   rendered my defence as to avarice or rapacity rather too easy    leaving this foolish matter where it lies i have to request your   lordships acceptance of my best thanks for the flattering   communication which you took the trouble to make mr murray on my   behalf and which could not fail to give me the gratification which i   am sure you intended i dare say our worthy bibliopolist overcoloured   his report of your lordships conversation with the prince regent but   i owe my thanks to him nevertheless for the excuse he has given me   for intruding these pages on your lordship wishing you health   spirit and perseverance to continue your pilgrimage through the   interesting countries which you have still to pass with childe   harold i have the honour to be my lord    your lordships obedient servant    walter scott    pswill your lordship permit me a verbal criticism on childe   harold were it only to show i have read his pilgrimage with   attention nuestra dama de la pena means i suspect not our lady of   crime or punishment but our lady of the cliff

give rise to do you think now i am cold and stern and artful will even others think so will your mother everthat mother to whom we must indeed sacrifice much more much more on my part than she shall

to this my dearest caroline were it not for your mother and the kindness of your connections is there anything on earth or heaven that would have made me so happy as to have made you mine long ago and not less now than then but more than ever at this time you know i would with pleasure give up all here and all beyond the grave for you and in refraining from this must my motives be misunderstood i

advice about her daughterinlaw and he was growing attached to miss milbanke and when rejected by her at first to lady oxford and later to lady frances wedderburn webster when lady bessborough endeavoured to persuade her daughter to leave london for ireland lady caroline is said to have forced herself into byrons room and implored him to fly with her byron refused conducted her back to melbourne house wrote her the letter printed above and as she herself admits kept the secret in december 1812 lady caroline burned byron in effigy with his book ring and chain at brocket hall the lines which she wrote for the ceremony are preserved in mrs leighs handwriting and given in appendix iii 2  from ireland lady caroline continued the siege threatening to follow him into herefordshire demanding interviews and writing about him to lady oxford at length byron sent her the letter probably in november 1812 which she professes to publish in glenarvon vol iii chap ix the words are acknowledged by byron to have formed part at least of the real document which is here quoted as printed in the novel    mortanville priory november the 9th    lady avondalei am no longer your lover and since you oblige me to   confess it by this truly unfeminine persecution  learn that i am   attached to another whose name it would of course be dishonourable   to mention i shall ever remember with gratitude the many instances i   have received of the predilection you have shown in my favour i shall   ever continue your friend if your ladyship will permit me so to style   myself and as a first proof of my regard i offer you this advice   correct your vanity which is ridiculous exert your absurd caprices   upon others and leave me in peace    your most obedient servant    glenarvon  the first effect of this letter and her unrequited passion was as she told lady morgan to deprive her temporarily of reason and it may be added that when she was a child her grandmother was so alarmed by her eccentricities as to consult a doctor on the state of her mind the second effect was to render her temper so ungovernable that william lamb decided on a separation all preliminaries were arranged the solicitor arrived with the documents but the old charm reasserted itself and she was found seated by her husband feeding him with tiny scraps of transparent bread and butter torrens memoirs of lord melbourne vol i p 112 the separation did not take place till 1825  throughout 181214 lady caroline continued to write to byron at first asking for interviews two of her last letters to

you all i do know i am not surprised at your being struck   with a few detached passages but before you have read one volume i   think you will doubt at which end of the book you began there is no   connection between any two ideas in the book and it seems to me to   have been written as the sages of laputa composed their works   glenarvon is lord byron lady augusta the late duchess of   devonshire lady mandevillei think it is lady mandeville but the   lady who dictated glearvons farewell letter to calanthais lady   oxford this letter she really dictated to lord byron to send to lady   caroline lamb and is now very much offended that she has treated the   matter so lightly as to introduce it into her book the best character   in it is the princess of madagascar lady holland with all her   reviewers about her the young duke of devonshire is in the book but   i forget under what name i need not say that the heroine is lady   carolines own self  in july 1824 she was out riding when she accidentally met byrons funeral on its way to newstead i am sure she wrote to murray july 13 1824 i am very sorry i ever said one unkind word against him her mind never recovered the shock

1830 comparatively a failure in the popularity of byron he finds the chief cause of the small success which his poem obtained    to have kept his ground at the crisis when rokeby appeared he   writes its author ought to have put forth his utmost strength and   to have possessed all his original advantages for a mighty and   unexpected rival was advancing on the stagea rival not in poetical   powers only but in that art of attracting popularity in which the   present writer had hitherto preceded better men than himself the   reader will easily see that byron is here meant who after a little   velitation of no great promise now appeared as a serious candidate   in the first two cantos of childe harold  on this rivalry byron wrote the passage in his diary for november 17 1813 a further cause for the cold reception of rokeby was its inferiority both to the lay and to marmion in letter vii of the twopenny postbag moore writes thus of rokeby    should you feel any touch of

superior performances 2  i am still sufficiently interested to wish to know the successful candidate and amongst so many i have no doubt some will be excellent particularly in an age when writing verse is the easiest of all attainments  i cannot answer your intelligence with the like comfort unless as you are deeply theatrical you may wish to hear of mr betty 3 whose acting is i fear utterly inadequate to the london engagement into which the managers of covent garden have lately entered his figure is fat his features flat his voice unmanageable his action ungraceful and as diggory 4  says i defy him to extort that damned muffin face of his into madness i was very sorry to see him in the character of the elephant on the slack rope for when i last saw him i was in raptures with his performance but then i was sixteenan age to which all london condescended to subside after all much better judges have admired and may again but i venture to prognosticate a prophecy see the courier that he will not succeed  so poor dear rogers has stuck fast on the brow of the mighty helvellyn 5i hope not for ever my best respects to lady hher departure with that of my other friends was a sad

excellent verses from whom i know not but evidently the composition of some one in the habit of writing and of writing well i do not know if he be the author of the bioscope which accompanied them but whoever he is if you can discover him thank him from me most heartily the other letters were from ladies who are welcome to convert me when they please and if i can discover them and they be young as they say they are i could convince them perhaps of my devotion i had also a letter from mr walpole on matters of this world which i have answered  so you are luciens publisher 2 i am promised an interview with him and think i shall ask you for a letter of introduction as the gods have made him poetical from whom could it come with a better grace than from his publisher and mine is it not

comprehensible pronoun  by the by one of my corrections in the fair copy sent yesterday has dived into the bathos some sixty fathom    when garrick died and brinsley ceased to write  ceasing to live is a much more serious concern and ought not to be first therefore i will let the old couplet stand with its half rhymes sought and wrote 1  second thoughts in every thing are best but in rhyme third and fourth dont come amiss i am very anxious on this business and i do hope that the very trouble i occasion you will plead its own excuse and that it will tend to show my endeavour to make the most of the time allotted i wish i had known it months ago for in that case i had not left one line standing on another i always scrawl in this way and smooth as much as i can but never sufficiently and latterly i can weave a nineline stanza faster than a couplet for which measure i have not the cunning when i began childe harold i had never tried spensers measure and now i cannot scribble in any other  after all my dear lord if you can get a decent address elsewhere dont hesitate to put this aside 2  why did you not trust your own muse i am very sure she would have been triumphant and saved the committee their troubletis a joyful one to me but i fear i shall not satisfy even myself after the account you sent me tis no compliment to say you would have beaten your candidates but i mean that in that case there would have been no occasion for their being beaten at all  there are but two decent prologues in our tonguepopes to cato 3johnsons to drurylane 4  these with the epilogue to the distrest mother 5 and i think one of goldsmiths 6 and a prologue of old colmans to beaumont and fletchers philaster 7 are the best things of the kind we have  psi am diluted to the throat with

rogers october 22 1812   claydens rogers and his contemporaries vol i p 115 of   having induced lord byron to write on so ungrateful a theme   ungrateful in all senses as the opening of a theatre he was so   goodhumoured took so much pains corrected so goodhumouredly and   produced as i thought and think a prologue so superior to the common   run of that sort of trumpery that it is quite vexatious to see him   attacked for it some part of it is a little too much laboured and   the whole too long but surely it is good and poetical you cannot   imagine how i grew to like lord byron in my critical intercourse with   him and how much i am convinced that your friendship and judgment   have contributed to improve both his understanding and his   happiness   footnote 3 pope wrote the prologue to addisons cato when it was acted at drury lane april 13 1713   footnote 4 johnson wrote the prologue when garrick opened drury lane september 15 1747 with the merchant of venice it is says

omissions and this new couplet    as glared each rising flash 1 and ghastly shone   the skies with lightnings awful as their own  as to remarks i can only say i will alter and acquiesce in any thing

speaks of him at the outset of his career as a staunch foxite and much remarked in society comparing him with his brotherinlaw grey he says    mr whitbread was a more steady character his appearance was heavy   he was fond of agriculture and was very plain and simple in his   tastes both were reckoned good debaters in the house but grey was   the most eloquent  an independent whig and an advocate for peace with france whitbread supported fox against pitt throughout the napoleonic war strongly opposed its renewal after the return of the emperor from elba and interested himself in such measures as moderate parliamentary reform the amendment of the poor law national education and retrenchment of public expenditure on april 8 1805 he moved the resolutions which ended in the impeachment of lord melville and took the lead in the inquiries which were made march 1809 into the conduct of the duke of york he was a plain businesslike speaker and a man of such unimpeachable integrity that mr afterwards lord plunket in a speech on the roman catholic claims february 28 1821 called him the incorruptible sentinel of the constitution  when he moved the articles of impeachment against lord melville canning scribbled the following impromptu parody of his speech anecdotal history of the british parliament p 222    im like archimedes for science and skill   im like a young prince going

whatever to the committee but out of nearly one hundred this is confidential none have been deemed worth acceptance and in consequence of their subsequent application to me i have written a prologue which has been received and will be spoken the ms is now in the hands of lord holland  i write this merely to say that however it is received by the audience you will publish it in the next edition of childe harold and i only beg you at present to keep my name secret till you hear further from me and as soon as possible i wish you to have a correct copy to do with as you think proper  i am yours very truly byron  psi should wish a few copies printed off before that the newspaper copies may be correct after the delivery                                               254to lord holland

public who ought to know better and you recollect johnsons was against similar buffooneries of richsbut certes i am not johnson 2  instead of effects say laboursdegenerate will do will it mr betty is no longer a babe therefore the line cannot be personal will this do    till ebbd the lava of the burningthat molten wave 3  with glowing dome in case you prefer burning added to this wave metaphorical the word fiery pillar was suggested by the pillar of fire in the book of exodus which went before the israelites through the red sea i once thought of saying like israels pillar and making it a simile but i did not knowthe great temptation was leaving the epithet fiery for the supplementary wave i want to work up that passage as it is the only new ground us prologuizers can go upon    this is the place where if a poet   shined in description he might show it  if i part with the possibility of a future conflagration we lessen the compliment to shakspeare however we will een mend it thus    yes it shall bethe magic of that name   that scorns the scythe of time the torch of flame   on the same spot etc etc  therethe deuce is in it if that is not an improvement to whitbreads content recollect it is the name and not the magic that has a noble contempt for those same weapons if it were the magic my metaphor would be somewhat of the maddestso the name is the antecedent but my dear lord your patience is not quite so immortaltherefore with many and sincere thanks i am  yours ever most affectionately  psi foresee there will be charges of partiality in the papers but you know i sent in no address and glad both you and i must be that i did not for in that case their plea had been plausible i doubt the pit will be testy but conscious innocence a novel and pleasing sensation makes me bold

produced the beggars opera which after being refused at drury lane made gay rich and rich gay great faustus probably alludes to the war between the two theatres and the rival productions of harlequin dr faustus at drury lane in 1723 and of the necromancer or the history of dr faustus at lincolns inn fields in december of the same year on december 7 1732 rich opened the new theatre at covent garden

the stage it had been unpardonable to pass over the horses and miss mudie 1 etc as betty is no longer a boy how can this be applied to him he is now to be judged as a man if he acts still like a boy the public will but be more ashamed of their blunder i have you see now taken it for granted that these things are reformed i confess i wish that part of the address to stand but if w is inexorable een let it go i have also newcast the lines and softened the hint of future combustion and sent them off this morning will you have the goodness to add or insert the approved alterations as they arrive they come like shadows so depart 2 occupy me and i fear disturb you  do not let mr w put his address into ellistons hands till you have settled on these alterations e will think it too longmuch depends on the speaking i fear it will not bear much curtailing without chasms in the sense  it is certainly too long in the reading but if elliston exerts himself such a favourite with the public will not be thought tedious i should think it so if he were not to speak it  yours ever etc  pson looking again i doubt my idea of having obviated ws objection to the other house allusion is non sequiturbut i wish to plead for this part because the thing really is not to be passed over many afterpieces of the lyceum by the same company have already attacked this augean stableand johnson in his prologue against lunn the harlequin manager richhuntmahomet etc is surely a fair precedent 3    footnote 1 for the horses see p 156 note 1 miss mudie another phenomenon with whom the covent garden

admirably envy malice hatred   or uncharitableness found no place in her feelings she had all of   philosophy save its moroseness and all of nature save its defects   and general faiblesse or if some portion of faiblesse attached   to her it only served to render her more forbearing to the errors of   others i have often thought that with a little more youth lady m   might have turned my head at

continued   without interruption for eight months the autumn of a beauty like   hers is preferable to the spring in others she told me she was never   in love till she was thirty and i thought myself so with her when she   was forty i never felt a stronger passion which she returned with   equal ardour she had been sacrificed almost before she was a   woman to one whose mind and body were equally contemptible in the   scale of creation and on whom she bestowed a numerous family to   which the law gave him the right to be called father strange as it   may seem she gained as all women do an influence over me so strong   that i had great difficulty in breaking with her even when i knew she   had been inconstant to me and once was on the point of going abroad   with her and narrowly escaped this folly  to be near the oxfords at eywood in herefordshire byron took kinsham court a dowerhouse of the family where bishop harley died in 1788 at one time as is evident from his

the end the couplet you were pleased to like the whole address is seventythree lines still perhaps too long and if shortened you will save time but i fear a little of what i meant for sense also  with myriads of thanks i am ever etc  my sixteenth edition of respects to lady hhow she must laugh at all this  i wish murray my publisher to print off some copies as soon as your lordship returns to townit will ensure correctness in the papers afterwards    footnote 1 macbeth act v sc 5   footnote 2 sheridans monody on garrick   footnote 3 the committee of selection consisted says the satirist november 1 1812 p 395    of one peer and two commoners one poet and two prosers one lord and   two brewers and the only points in which they coincided were in being   all three parliament men all three politicians all three in   opposition to the government of the country their names as we   understand were vassal holland samuel whitbread and harvey   christian combe                                               259to lord holland   far be from him that hour which asks in vain tears such as flow for garrick in his strain  or  far be that hour that vainly asks in turn such verse for him as crownd hiswept oer garricks urn   september 30 1812  will you choose between these added to the lines on sheridan 1  i think they will wind up the panegyric and agree with the train of thought preceding them  now one word as to the committeehow could they resolve on a rough copy of an address never sent in unless you had been good enough to retain in memory or on paper the thing they have been good enough to adopt by the by the circumstances of the case should make the committee less avidus glori√¶ for all praise of them would look plaguy suspicious if necessary to be stated at all the simple facts bear them out they surely had a right to act as they pleased my sole object is one which i trust my whole conduct has shown viz that i did nothing insidioussent in no address whateverbut when applied to did my best for them and myself but above all that there was no undue partiality which will be what the rejected will endeavour to make out fortunatelymost fortunatelyi sent in no lines on the occasion for i am sure that had they in that case been preferred it would have been asserted that i was known and owed the preference to private friendship this is what we shall probably have to encounter but if once spoken and approved we shant be much embarrassed by their brilliant conjectures and as to criticism an old author like an old bull grows cooler or ought at every baiting  the only thing would be to avoid a party on the night of deliveryafterwards the more the better and the whole transaction inevitably tends to a good deal of discussion murray tells me there are myriads of ironical addresses 2 readysome in imitation of what is called my style if they are as good as the probationary odes 3 or hawkinss pipe of tobacco 4 it will not be bad fun for the imitated  ever etc    footnote 1 these added lines as may be seen by reference to the printed address were not retained   footnote 2 probably the reference is to rejected addresses or the new theatrum poetarum 1812 by james 17751839 and horace 17791849 smith cui bono the parody on byron is the joint composition of james and horace the manuscript was offered to murray for ¬£20 but declined by him it was afterwards published by john miller of bow street covent garden who also published horace in london   footnote 3 probationary odes which generally forms with political eclogues the third portion of the rolliad is really distinct from that work it is the result of an imaginary contest for the laureateship each candidate was to deliver a probationary birthday ode and among the candidates are dr pretyman archbishop markham thomas and joseph warton sir cecil wray sir joseph mawbey henry dundas lord thurlow and other tories of the day the plan of the work is said to have been suggested by joseph richardson 17551803 who wrote odes iv sir richard hill and xix lord mountmorres   footnote 4 in praise of a pipe of tobacco 1736 written by isaac hawkins browne 17051760 was an ode in imitation of swift pope thomson and other contemporary poets browne represented wenlock in the whig interest in the parliaments of 1744 and 1747 johnson spoke of him boswell johnson april 5 1775 as one of the first wits of this country who got into parliament and never opened his mouth                                               260to lord holland   october 2 1812   a copy of this still altered is sent by the post but this will arrive first it must be humbleryet aspiring does away the modesty and after all truth is truth besides there is a puff direct altered to please your plaguy renters  i shall be at tetbury by 12 or 1but send this for you to ponder over there are several little things marked thus  altered for your perusal i have dismounted the cavalry and i hope arranged to your general satisfaction  ever etc  at tetbury by nooni hope after it is sent there will be no more elisions it is not now so long73 linestwo less than allotted i will alter all committee objections but i hope you wont permit elliston to have any voice whateverexcept in speaking it                                               261to john murray   cheltenham oct 12 1812   dear siri have a very strong objection to the engraving of the portrait 1 and request that it may on no account be prefixed but let all the proofs be burnt and the plate broken i will be at the expense which has been incurred it is but fair that i should since i cannot permit the publication i beg as a particular favour that you will lose no time in having this done for which i have reasons that i will state when i see you forgive all the trouble i have occasioned you  i have received no account of the reception of the address 2 but see it is vituperated in the papers which does not much embarrass an old author i leave it to your own judgment to add it or not to your next edition when required pray comply strictly with my wishes as to the engraving and believe me etc  yours very truly  byron  psfavour me with an answer as i shall not be easy until i hear that the proofs etc are destroyed i hear that the satirist has reviewed childe harold 3 in what manner i need not ask but i wish to know if the old personalities are revived i have a better reason for asking this than any that merely concerns myself but in publications of that kind others particularly female names are sometimes introduced    footnote 1 a miniature by sanders besides this miniature sanders had also painted a fulllength of byron from which the portrait prefixed to the quarto edition of moores life is engraved in reference to the latter picture byron says in a note to rogers    if you think the picture you saw at murrays worth your acceptance   it is yours and you may put a glove or mask on it if you like   moore

that year to w jerdan it reviewed childe harold in october 1812 pp 344358 and again in december of the same year pp 542550 in the first of the two notices the satirist quotes the judgment of our predecessors that unless byron improved wonderfully he could never be a poet and continues thus    it is with unaffected satisfaction we find that he has improved   wonderfully and that he is a poet indeed when we consider the   comparatively short interval which has elapsed and contrast the   character of his recent with that of his early work we confess   ourselves astonished at the intellectual progress which lord byron has   made and are happy to hold him up as another example of the   extraordinary effects of study and cultivation even on minds   apparently of the most unpromising description  the reviewer severely condemns the morbid bitterness of the poets thought and feeling but yet affirms that the poems    abound with beautiful imagery clothed in a diction free forcible   and various childe harold although avowedly a fragment contains   many fragments which would do honour to any poet of any period in   any country                                               262to lord holland   cheltenham oct 14 1812   my dear lordi perceive that the papers yea even perrys 1 are somewhat ruffled at the injudicious preference of the committee my friend perry has indeed et tu bruted me rather scurvily for which i will send him for the morning chronicle the next epigram i scribble as a token of my full forgiveness  do the committee mean to enter into no explanation of their proceedings you must see there is a leaning towards a charge of partiality you will at least acquit me of any great anxiety to push myself before so many elder and better anonymous to whom the twenty guineas which i take to be about two thousand pounds bank currency and the honour would have been equally welcome honour i see hath skill in paragraphwriting  i wish to know how it went off at the second reading and whether any one has had the grace to give it a glance of approbation i have seen no paper but perrys and two sunday ones perry is severe and the others silent if however you and your committee are not now dissatisfied with your own judgments i shall not much embarrass myself about the brilliant remarks of the journals my own opinion upon it is what it always was perhaps pretty near that of the public  believe me my dear lord etc etc  psmy best respects to lady h whose smiles will be very consolatory even at this distance     footnote 1 james perry 17561821 purchased in 1789 the morning chronicle originally established by woodfall in 1769 in perrys hands the paper became the leading organ of the whigs he was the first editor to introduce a succession of parliamentary reporters he gathered round him a remarkable staff of contributors including ricardo sir james mackintosh porson who married his sister charles lamb sheridan coleridge hazlitt lord campbell moore campbell byron and burns the morning chronicle october 12 1812 says    mr elliston then came forward and delivered the following prize   address we cannot boast of the eloquence of the delivery it was   neither gracefully nor correctly recited the merits of the production   itself we submit to the criticism of our readers we cannot suppose   that it was selected as the most poetical composition of all the   scores that were submitted to the committee but perhaps by its   tenor by its allusions to the fire to garrick to siddons and to   sheridan it was thought most applicable to the occasion   notwithstanding its being in parts unmusical and in general tame  again october 14 in a notice of rejected addresses the morning chronicle returns to the subject    a wag has already published a small volume of addresses rejected   in which with admirable wit all the poets of the day are assembled   contesting for the prize address at drury lane and certainly he has   assigned to the pen of lord b a superior poem to that which has   gained the prize  the address was also severely handled in a critique on the address written by lord byron which was spoken at the opening of the new theatre royal drury lane october 10 1812 by lordlondon no date the author is astonished at the glaring faults and general insipidity of the address and after a detailed criticism concludes that public indignation will sympathize with the rejected poets and pursue the rival patrons and the rival bard  rogers writing to moore october 22 1812 memoirs etc of thomas moore vol viii p 123 says    poor byron what i hear and read of his prologue makes me very angry   of such value is public favour so a man is to be tried by a copy of   verses thrown off perhaps at hazard and invit√¢ minerv√¢

deardon was the lessee of the rochdale coalpits    when mr france was here writes mrs byron to hanson july 13 1811   k√∂lbings englische studien vol xxv p i53 he told me there   had been an injunction procured to prevent deardin from working the   coal pits that was in dispute between lord byron and him but since   france was here there has been a man from lancashire who says they   are worked by deardin the same as ever i also heard that the person   you sent down to take an account of the coals was bribed by deardin   and did not give an account of half of what was got   footnote 2 for mrs

following statement in his own handwriting with regard to the annuities was apparently prepared for some legal proceedings and is dated january 16 1812    lord byron to the best of his knowledge and recollection in dec   1805january 1806 applied to king in consequence of an   advertisement in the papers who acquainted lord byron that his   minority prevented all money transactions without the security of   competent persons through mr k he became acquainted with mr   dellevelly another of the tribe of israel and subsequently with a   mr howard of golden square    after many delays during which lord b had interviews with howard   once he thinks in golden square but more frequently in piccadilly   mrs massingberd agreed to become security jointly with her   daughter lord b knows howards person perfectly well has not seen   him subsequent to the transaction but recollects howards mentioning   to him that he lord b was acting imprudently stating that he made   it a rule to advise young men against such proceedings lord b   recollects on the day on which the money was paid that he remained   in the next room till the papers were signed mrs massingberd   having stated that the parties wished him to be kept out of sight   during the business and wished to avoid even mentioning his name   mrs massingberd deducted the interest for two years and a half and   ¬£100 for howards papers  two other annuities were effected in both of which mrs massingberd figured as a security and in one the manager of dorants hotel it was the interest on these minority loans which crippled byron two

the first lines are busbys entire inserted in several of the papers correctlyand copied correctly my hand is difficultparticularly the morning chronicle tell mr perry i forgive him all he has said and may say against my address but he will allow me to deal with the doctoraudi alteram partemand not betray me i cannot think what has befallen mr perry for of yore we were very good friendsbut no matter only get this inserted  i have a poem on waltzing for you of which i make you a present but it must be anonymous it is in the old style of english bards and scotch reviewers  ever yours  byron  pswith the next edition of childe harold you may print the first fifty or a hundred opening lines of the curse of minerva 2 down to the couplet beginning    mortal twas thus she spake etc  of course the moment the satire begins there you will stop and the opening is the best part    footnote 1 the parenthetical address by dr plagiary is a parody by byron of dr busbys address the original of which will be found in the genuine rejected addresses as well as parodied in rejected addresses architectural atoms on october 14 young busby forced his way on to the stage of drury lane attempted to recite his fathers address and was taken into custody on the next night dr busby speaking from one of the boxes obtained a hearing for his son who could not however make his voice heard in the theatre then another rejected author tried to recite his composition but was hooted down order was restored by raymond reminding the audience that the chamberlains licence was necessary for all stage speeches to the failure of the younger busby himself a competitor and the author of an unalogue of fiftysix lines to make himself heard byron alludes in the stage direction to the parenthetical addressto be spoken in an inarticulate voice by master p the parenthetical address appeared in the morning chronicle for october 23 1812 in the same issue was printed a long statement by dr busby in which after paying a compliment to byrons poetical genius he insisted that the committee of drury lane had broken faith by not choosing one of the addresses sent in by competitors see references to dr busby in

and will thank you to tell me the amount for the engraving i think the rejected addresses by far the best thing of the kind since the rolliad and wish you had published them tell the author i forgive him were be twenty times our satirist and think his imitations not at all inferior to the famous ones of hawkins browne he must be a man of very lively wit and much less scurrilous than wits often are altogether i very much admire the performance and wish it all success the satirist has taken a new tone as you will see we have now i think finished with c hs critics i have in hand a satire on waltzing which you must publish anonymously it is not long not quite 200 lines but will make a very small boarded pamphlet in a few days you shall have it  ever yours  byron  psthe editor of the satirist almost ought to be thanked for his revocation it is done handsomely after five years warfare                                               267to john hanson   octr 22d 1812   dear siri

you are not returned to london before  i wish to take a small house for the winter any where not remote from st jamess will you arrange this for meand think of young rushton whom i promised to provide for and must begin to think of it he might be a subtythe collector or a bailiff to our agent at rochdale or many other things he has had a fair education and was well disposed at all events he must no longer remain in idleness  let the mule be sold and the dogs  pray let me hear from you when convenient and  believe me ever yours truly  byron  my best remembrances to all  i shall draw for fifty

but have a care of glutting the public who have by this time had enough of c h waltz shall be prepared it is rather above 200 lines with an introductory letter to the publisher i think of publishing with c h the opening lines of the curse of minerva as far as the first speech of pallasbecause some of the readers like that part better than any i have ever written and as it contains nothing to affect the subject of the subsequent portion it will find a place as a descriptive fragment  the plate is broken between ourselves it was unlike the picture and besides upon the whole the frontispiece of an authors visage is but a paltry exhibition at all events this would have been no recommendation to the book i am sure sanders would not have survived the engraving by the by the picture may remain with you or him which you please till my return the one of two remaining copies is at your service till i can give you a better the other must be burned peremptorily again do not forget that i have an account with you and that this is included i give you too much trouble to allow you to incur expense also  you best know how far this address riot will affect the future sale of c h i like the volume of rejected a better and better the other parody which perry has received is mine also i believe it is dr busbys speech versified you are removing to albemarle street i find and i rejoice that

same address till i arrive in town to claim them which will probably be in a few days i have in charge a curious and very long ms poem written by lord brooke the friend of sir philip sidney which i wish to submit to the inspection of mr gifford with the following queriesfirst whether it has ever been published and secondly if not whether it is worth publication it is from lord oxfords library and must have escaped or been overlooked amongst the mss of the harleian miscellany the writing is lord brookes except a different hand towards the close it is very long and in the sixline stanza it is not for me to hazard an opinion upon its merits but i would take the liberty if not too troublesome to submit it to mr giffords judgment which from his excellent edition of massinger i should conceive to be as decisive on the writings of that age as on those of our own  now for a less agreeable and important topichow came mr macsomebody 1 without consulting you or me to prefix the address to his volume of dejected addresses is not this somewhat larcenous i think the ceremony of leave might have been asked though i have no objection to the thing itself and leave the hundred and eleven to tire themselves with base comparisons i should think the ingenuous public tolerably sick of the subject and except the parodies i have not interfered nor shall indeed i did not know that dr busby had published his apologetical letter and postscript 2 or i should have recalled them but i confess i looked upon his conduct in a different light before its appearance i see some mountebank has taken alderman birchs name 3 to vituperate the doctor he had much better have pilfered his pastry which i should imagine the more valuable ingredientat least for a puffpray secure me a copy of woodfalls new

endeavours to be of use to you and indeed most of my principal friends are returned leake from joannina canning and adair from the city of the faithful and at smyrna no letter is necessary as the consuls are always willing to do every thing for personages of respectability i have sent you three one to gibraltar which though of no great necessity will perhaps put you on a more intimate footing with a very pleasant family there you will very soon find out that a man of any consequence has very little occasion for any letters but to ministers and bankers and of them we have already plenty i will be sworn  it is by no means improbable that i shall go in the spring and if you will fix any place of rendezvous about august i will write or join youwhen in albania i wish you would inquire after dervise tahiri and vascillie or bazil and make my respects to the viziers both there and in the morea if you mention my name to suleyman of thebes i think it will not hurt you if i had my dragoman or wrote turkish i could have given you letters of real service but to the english they are hardly requisite and the greeks themselves can be of little advantage liston 1 you know already and i do not as he was not then minister mind you visit ephesus and the troad and let me hear from you when you please i believe g forresti is now at yanina but if not whoever is there will be too happy

         274to john murray   eywood presteign january 8 1813   dear siryou have been imposed upon by a letter forged in my name to obtain the picture left in your possession this i know by the confession of the culprit 1 and as she is a woman and of rank with whom i have unfortunately been too much connected you will for the present say very little about it but if you have the letter retain itwrite to me the particulars you will also be more cautious in future and not allow anything of mine to pass from your hands without my seal as well as signature  i have not been in town nor have written to you since i left it so i presume the forgery was a skilful performancei shall endeavour to get back the picture by fair means if possible  yours ever  byron  pskeep the letter if you have it i did not receive your parcel and it is now too late to send it on as i shall be in town on the 17th the delinquent is one of the first families in this kingdom but as dogberry says this is flat burglary 2  favour me with an answer i hear i am scolded in the quarterly but you and it are already forgiven i suppose that made you bashful about sending it    footnote 1 the culprit was lady

1813   my dear hodgsoni will join you in any bond for the money you require be it that or a larger sum with regard to security as newstead is in a sort of abeyance between sale and purchase and my lancashire property very unsettled i do not know how far i can give more than personal security but what i can i will at any rate you can try and as the sum is not very considerable the chances are favourable i hear nothing of my own concerns but expect a letter daily let me hear from you where you are and will be this month i am a great admirer of the r a rejected addresses though i have had so great a share in the cause of their publication and i like the c h childe harold imitation one of the best 1 lady oxford has heard me talk much of you as a relative of the cokes etc and desires me to say she would be happy to have the pleasure of your acquaintance you must come and see me at kinsham i am sure you would like all here if you knew them  the agnus is furious you can have no idea of the horrible and absurd things she has said and done 2 since really from the best motives i withdrew my homage great pleasure is certes my object but why brief mr wild 3 i cannot answer for the future but the past is pretty secure and in it i can number the last two months as worthy of the gods in lucretius i cannot review in the monthly in fact i can just now do nothing at least with a pen and i really think the days of authorship are over with me altogether i hear and rejoice in elands and merivales intentions 4  murray has grown great and has got him new premises in the fashionable part of the town 5  we live here so shut out of the monde that i have nothing of general import to communicate and fill this up with a happy new year and drink to you and drury  ever yours dear h b  i have no intention of continuing childe harold there are a few additions in the body of the book of description which will merely add to the number of pages in the next edition i have taken kinsham court the business of last summer i broke off 6 and now the amusement of the gentle fair is writing letters literally threatening my life and much in the style of miss mathews in amelia or lucy in the beggars opera such is the reward of restoring a woman to her family who are treating her with the greatest kindness and with whom i am on good terms i am still in palatia circes and being no ulysses cannot tell into what animal i may be converted as you are aware of the turn of both parties your conjectures will be very correct i daresay and seriously i am very much attached she has had her share of the denunciations of the brilliant phryne and regards them as much as i do i hope you will visit me at k which will not be ready before spring and i am very sure you would like my neighbours if you knew them if you come down now to kington 7 pray come and see me    footnote 1    byron often talks of the authors of the rejected addresses and   always in terms of unqualified praise he says that the imitations   unlike all other imitations are full of genius parodies he said   always give a bad impression of the original but in the rejected   addresses the reverse was the fact and he quoted the second and   third stanzas in imitation of himself as admirable and just what he   could have wished to write on a similar subject  lady blessingtons conversations p 134   footnote 2    the

pleasure of mr smiths acquaintance as i could communicate the curious anecdote you read in mr ts letter if he would like it he can have the substance for his second edition if not i shall add it to our next though i think we already have enough of lord elgin  what i have read of this work seems admirably done my praise however is not much worth the authors having but you may thank him in my name for his the idea is newwe have excellent imitations of the satires etc by pope but i remember but one imitative ode in his works and none any where else i can hardly suppose that they have lost any fame by the fate of the farce 3 but even should this be the case the present publication will again place them on their pinnacle  yours truly  b    footnote 1 horace in london consisting of imitations

fletchers last letter i wish to know whether you intend taking a share in a farm with your brother or prefer to wait for some other situation in lancashirethe first will be the best because at your time of life it is highly improper to remain idle if this marriage which is spoken of for you is at all advantageous i can have no objection but i should suppose after being in my service from your infancy you will at least let me know the name of your intended and her expectations if at all respectable nothing can be better for your settlement in life and a proper provision will be made for you at all events let me hear something on the subject for as i have some intention of leaving england in the summer i wish to make my arrangements with regard to yourself before that period as you and mr murray have not received any money for some time if you will draw on me for fifty pounds payable at messrs hoares bankers fleet street and tell mr joseph murray to draw for the same sum on his own account both will be paid by me  etc etc  b                                               279to john hanson   fy 27th 1813   dear siri have called several times and you may suppose am very anxious to hear something from or of mr claughton  it is my determination on account of a malady to which i am subject and for other weighty reasons to go abroad again almost immediately to this you will object but as my intention cannot be altered i have only to request that you will assist me as far as in your power to make the necessary arrangements  i have every confidence in you and will leave the fullest powers to act in my absence if this man still hesitates i must sell my part of rochdale for what it will bring even at a loss and fight him out about newstead without this i have no funds to go on with and i do not wish to incur further debts if possible  pray favour me with a short reply to this and say when i can see you excuse me to mrs h for my nonappearance last night i was detained in the h of l till too late to dress for her party compliments to all  ever yours  bn                                               280to john hanson   march 1st 1813   dear siri am sorry that i could not call today but will tomorrow your objections i anticipated and can only repeat that i cannot act otherwise so pray hasten some arrangementfor with or without i must go  a person told me yesterday there was one who would give within 10000 of cs price and take the title as it was c is a fool or is shuffling  think of what i said about rochdale for i will sell it for what i can get and will not stay three months longer in this country i again repeat i will leave all with full powers to you i commend your objection which is a proof of an honourable mindwhich however i did not need to convince me of your character if you have any news send a few lines  ever yours  bn                                               281tocorbet   mh 5th 1813   dear sirlady falkland has returned by mr hanson the only two letters i ever wrote her both some time ago and neither containing the least allusion which could make any person suppose that i had any intention further than regards the children of her husband my servant returned the packet and letter of yesterday at the moment of receiving them by her letter to mr h it should seem they have not been redelivered i am sorry for this but it is not my fault and they ought never to have been sent after her ladyships mistakes so often repeated you will not blame me for declining all further interference in her affairs and i rely much upon your word in contradicting her foolish assertions and most absurd imaginations she now says that i need not leave the country on her account how the devil she knew that i was about to leave it i cannot guess but however for the first time she has dreamed right but her being the cause is still more ludicrous than the rest first she would have it that i returned here for love of a woman i never saw and now that i am going for the same whom i have never seen and certainly never wished nor wish to see the maddest consistency i ever heard of i trust that she has regained her senses as she tells mr h she will not scribble any more which will also save you from the troublesome correspondence of  your obliged and obedient servant  byron                                               282to john hanson   march 6th 1813   dear siri must be ready in april at whatever riskat whatever loss you will therefore advertize rochdale if you decline this i will sell it for what it will bring even though but a few thousand pounds  with regard to claughton i shall only say that if he knew the ruinthe misery he occasions by his delay he would be sorry for his conduct and i only hope that he and i may not meet or i shall say something he will not like to hear i have called often i shall call today at three or between three and four again and again i can only beg of you to forward my plans for here no power on earth shall make me remain six weeks longer  ever yours  b                                              283to charles hanson   mh 24th 1813   my dear charlesthis is very evasive and dissatisfactory what is to be done i cannot tell but your father had better see his letter and this of mine a long litigation neither suits my inclination nor circumstances it were better to take back the estate and raise it to what it will bear which must be at least double to dismantle the house and sell the materials and sell rochdale something i must determine on and that quickly i want to go abroad immediately it is utterly impossible for me to remain here every thing i have done to extricate myself has been useless your father said sell i have sold and see what has become of it if i go to law with this fellow after five years litigation at the present depreciation of money the price will not be worth the property besides how much of it will be spent in the contest and how am i to live in the interim every day land rises and money falls i shall tell mr cn he is a scoundrel and have done with him and i only hope he will have spirit enough to resent the appellation and defend his own rascally conduct in the interim of his delay in his journey i shall leave town on sunday i shall set out for herefordshire from whence when wanted i will return  pray tell your father to get the money on rochdale or i must sell it directly i must be ready by the last week in may and am consequently pressed for time  i go first to cagliari in sardinia and on to the levant  believe me dear charles  yours truly  b                                               284to samuel rogers 1   march 25 1813   i enclose you a draft for the usurious interest due to lord boringdons prot√©g√©i also could wish you would state thus much for me to his lordship though the transaction speaks plainly in itself for the borrowers folly and the lenders usury it never was my intention to quash the demand as i legally might nor to withhold payment of principal or perhaps even unlawful interest you know what my situation has been and what it is i have parted with an estate which has been in my family for nearly three hundred years and was never disgraced by being in possession of a lawyer a churchman or a woman during that period to liquidate this and similar demands and the payment of the purchase is still withheld and may be perhaps for years if therefore i am under the necessity of making those persons wait for their money which considering the terms they can afford to suffer it is my misfortune  when i arrived at majority in 18091 offered my own security on legal interest and it was refused now i will not accede to this this man i may have seen but i have no recollection of the names of any parties but the agents and the securities the moment i can it is assuredly my intention to pay my debts this persons case may be a hard one but under all circumstances what is mine i could not foresee that the purchaser of my estate was to demur in paying for it  i am glad it happens to be in my power so far to accommodate my israelite and only wish i could do as much for the rest of the twelve tribes  ever yours dear r  bn    footnote 1 the following was rogerss reply    friday morning    my dearest byroni have just received your note but i will not   execute your commission and moreover i will tell lord boringdon   that i refused to do it i know your situation and i should never   sleep again if by any interference of mine for by so harsh a word i   must call it you should be led by your generosity your pride or any   other noble motive to do more than you are called upon to do    i mentioned the thing to lord holland last night and he entirely   agreed with me that you are not called upon to do it the principal   and the legal interest are all that these extortioners are entitled   to and you must forgive me but i will not do as you require i   shall keep the draft till i see you    yours ever and ever    saml rogers                                               285to the hon augusta leigh   4 bennet street st jamess march 26th 1813   my dearest augustai did not answer your letter because i could not answer as i wished but expected that every week would bring me some tidings that might enable me to reply better than by apologies but claughton has not will not and i think cannot pay his money and though luckily it was stipulated that he should never have possession till the whole was paid the estate is still on my hands and your brother consequently not less embarrassed than ever this is the truth and is all the excuse i can offer for inability but not unwillingness to serve you  i am going abroad again in june but should wish to see you before my departure you have perhaps heard that i have been fooling away my time with different regnantes but what better can be expected from me i have but one relative and her i never see i have no connections to domesticate with and for marriage i have neither the talent nor the inclination i cannot fortunehunt nor afford to marry without a fortune my parliamentary schemes are not much to my tastei spoke twice last session 1 and was told it was well enough but i hate the thing altogether and have no intention to strut another hour on that stage i am thus wasting the best part of life daily repenting and never amending  on sunday i set off for a fortnight for eywood near presteign in herefordshirewith the oxfords i see you put on a demure look at the name which is very becoming and matronly in you but you wont be sorry to hear that i am quite out of a more serious scrape with another singular personage which threatened me last year and trouble enough i had to steer clear of it i assure you i hope all my nieces are well and increasing in growth and number but i wish you were not always buried in that bleak common near newmarket  i am very well in health but not happy nor even comfortable but i will not bore you with complaints i am a fool and deserve all the ills i have met or may meet with but nevertheless very sensibly dearest augusta  your most affectionate brother byron    footnote 1 what is generally supposed to have been byrons second speech see appendix ii 2 was made april 21 1813 on lord donoughmores motion for a committee on roman catholic claims  the following impressions of his short parliamentary career are recorded by byron himself    i have never heard any one who fulfilled my ideal of an orator   grattan would have been near it but for his harlequin delivery pitt   i never heard fox but once and then he struck me as a debater which   to me seems as different from an orator as an improvisatore or a   versifier from a poet grey is great but it is not oratory canning   is sometimes very like one windham i did not admire though all the   world did it seemed sad sophistry whitbread was the demosthenes of   bad taste and vulgar vehemence but strong and english holland is   impressive from sense and sincerity lord lansdowne good but still a   debater only grenville i like vastly if he would prune his speeches   down to an hours delivery burdett is sweet and silvery as belial   himself and i think the greatest favourite in pandemonium at least i   always heard the country gentlemen and the ministerial devilry praise   his speeches up stairs and run down from bellamys when he was upon   his legs i heard bob milnes make his second speech it made no   impression i like wardstudied but keen and sometimes eloquent   peel my school and form fellow we sat within two of each other   strange to say i have never heard though i often wished to do so   but from what i remember of him at harrow he is or should be   among the best of them now i do not admire mr wilberforces   speaking it is nothing but a flow of wordswords words alone    i doubt greatly if the english have any eloquence properly so   called and am inclined to think that the irish had a great deal   and that the french will have and have had in mirabeau lord   chatham and burke are the nearest approaches to orators in england i   dont know what erskine may have been at the bar but in the house   i wish him at the bar once more lauderdale is shrill and scotch and   acute of brougham i shall say nothing as i have a personal feeling   of dislike to the man    but amongst all these good bad and indifferent i never heard the   speech which was not too long for the auditors and not very   intelligible except here and there the whole thing is a grand   deception and as tedious and tiresome as maybe to those who must be   often present i heard sheridan only once and that briefly but i   liked his voice his manner and his wit and he is the only one of   them i ever wished to hear at greater length    the impression of parliament upon me was that its members are not   formidable as speakers but very much so as an audience because   in so numerous a body there may be little eloquence after all there   were but two thorough orators in all antiquity and i suspect still   fewer in modern times but there must be a leaven of thought and   good sense sufficient to make them know what is right though they   cant express it nobly    horne tooke and roscoe both are said to have declared that they left   parliament with a higher opinion of its aggregate integrity and   abilities than that with which they entered it the general amount of   both in most parliaments is probably about the same as also the   number of speakers and their talent i except orators of course   because they are things of ages and not of septennial or triennial   reunions neither house ever struck me with more awe or respect than   the same number of turks in a divan or of methodists in a barn would   have done whatever diffidence or nervousness i felt and i felt both   in a great degree arose from the number rather than the quality of   the assemblage and the thought rather of the public without than   the persons withinknowing as all know that cicero himself and   probably the messiah could never have altered the vote of a single   lord of the bedchamber or bishop i thought our house dull but the   other animating enough upon great days    i have heard that when grattan made his first speech in the english   commons it was for some minutes doubtful whether to laugh at or cheer   him the d√©b√ªt of his predecessor flood had been a complete   failure under nearly similar circumstances but when the ministerial   part of our senators had watched pitt their thermometer for the cue   and saw him nod repeatedly his stately nod of approbation they took   the hint from their huntsman and broke out into the most rapturous   cheers grattans speech indeed deserved them it was a   chefdoeuvre i did not hear that speech of his being then at   harrow but heard most of his others on the same questionalso that   on the war of 1815 i differed from his opinions on the latter   question but coincided in the general admiration of his eloquence    when i met old courtenay the orator at rogerss the poets in   181112 i was much taken with the portly remains of his fine figure   and the still acute quickness of his conversation it was he who   silenced flood in the english house by a crushing reply to a hasty   d√©b√ªt of the rival of grattan in ireland i asked courtenay for i   like to trace motives if he had not some personal provocation for   the acrimony of his answer seemed to me as i read it to involve it   courtenay said he had that when in ireland being an irishman at   the bar of the irish house of commons flood had made a personal and   unfair attack upon himself who not being a member of that house   could not defend himself and that some years afterwards the   opportunity of retort offering in the english parliament he could not   resist it he certainly repaid flood with interest for flood never   made any figure and only a speech or two afterwards in the english   house of commons i must except however his speech on reform in   1790 which fox called the best he ever heard upon that subject

selling rochdale i shall never make any thing of it as it is  i beg you will provide as before my last voyage the fullest powers to act in my absence and bring my cursed concerns into some kind of order you must at least allow that i have acted according to your advice about newstead and i shall take no step without your being previously consulted  i hope i shall find you and mrs h etc well in

17841859 who was educated at christs hospital and began his literary life with a collection of poems written between the ages of twelve and sixteen and published in 1801 as juvenilia in 1808 he and his brother john started a weekly newspaper called the examiner which advocated liberal principles with remarkable independence on february 24 1811 hunt published an article in defence of peter finnerty convicted for a libel on castlereagh and exhorting public writers to be bold in the cause of individual liberty the same number contained an article on the savagery of military floggings for which he was prosecuted defended by brougham and acquitted his acquittal drew from shelley a letter of congratulation addressed to hunt as one of the most fearless enlighteners of the public mind dowdens life of shelley vol i p 113  in march 1812 the morning post printed a poem speaking of the prince regent as the m√¶cenas of the age the exciter of desire the glory of the people an adonis of loveliness etc the examiner for march 12 1812 thus translated this adulation into the language of truth    what person unacquainted with the true state of the case would   imagine in reading these astounding eulogies that this glory of the   people was the subject of millions of shrugs and reproaches that   this exciter of desire bravo messieurs of the post this   adonis in loveliness was a corpulent man of fiftyin short this   delightful blissful wise pleasureable honourable virtuous   true and immortal prince was a violator of his word a libertine   over head and ears in disgrace a despiser of domestic ties the   companion of gamblers and demireps a man who has just closed half a   century without one single claim on the gratitude of his country or   the respect of posterity  crabb robinson who met leigh hunt four days later at charles lambs says diary vol i p 376    leigh hunt is an enthusiast very well intentioned and i believe   prepared for the worst he said pleasantly enough no one can accuse   me of not writing a libel everything is a libel as the law is now   declared and our security lies only in their shame  for this libel john and leigh hunt were convicted in the court of kings bench on december 9 1812 in the following february they were sentenced to two years imprisonment and a fine of ¬£500 apiece john was imprisoned in coldbathfields leigh in the surrey county gaol they were released on february 2 or 3 1815  shelley on reading the sentence proposed a subscription for    the brave and enlightened man to whom the public owes a debt as   the champion of their liberties and virtues  dowden life of shelley vol i p 325 keats wrote a sonnet to hunt on the day he left his prison beginning    what though for showing truth to flatterd state   kind hunt was shut in prison  a political alliance was thus cemented which for the time was disastrous to the literary prospects of shelley and keats to hunt shelley dedicated the cenci and keats his first volume of poems 1817 he is the gentlest of the wise in shelleys adonais and in a suppressed stanza of the same poem the poet speaks of hunts sweet and earnest looks soft smiles and dark and nightlike eyes the words inscribed on shelleys tombcor cordiumwere hunts choice in his various papers hunt zealously championed his friends in the examiner for september to october 1819 he defended shelleys personal character in the same paper for june to july 1817 he praised keatss first volume of poems he reviewed lamia in the indicator for august 29 1820 and la belle dame sans merci in that for may 10 1820 in his foliage 1818 are three sonnets addressed to keats  shelley believed in hunt to the end it was mainly through him that hunt came to pisa in june 1822 to join with byron in the liberal but he doubted whether the alliance between the wren and the eagle could continue life of shelley vol ii p 519 keats on the other hand lost his faith in hunt in a letter to haydon may 1817 speaking of hunt he says    there is no greater sin after the seven deadly than to flatter   oneself into an idea of being a great poet  again march 1818 he writes    it is a great pity that people should by associating themselves with   the finest things spoil them hunt has damned hampstead and masks   and sonnets and italian tales  he writes still more severely december 1818january 1819    if i were to follow my own inclinations i should never meet any one   of that set again not even hunt who is certainly a pleasant fellow   in the main when you are with him but in reality he is vain   egotistical and disgusting in matters of taste and morals hunt does   one harm by making fine things petty and beautiful things hateful   through him i am indifferent to mozart i care not for white   bustsand many a glorious thing when associated with him becomes a   nothing  haydon considered that hunt was the great unhinger of keatss best dispositions works of keats ed hb forman vol iv p 359 and severn attributes keatss temporary mawkishness to hunts society ibid p 376  nathaniel hawthorne our old home p 229 ed 1884 says of hunt and means it as high praise that    there was not an english trait in him from head to footmorally   intellectually or physically beef ale or stout brandy or   portwine entered not at all into his composition  he was in fact a man of weak fibre who allowed himself to sponge upon his friends such as talfourd haydon and shelley though dickens denied all the year round dec 24 1859 that harold skimpole was intended for hunt the picture was recognized as a portrait on the other hand hunt was a man of kindly and genial disposition    he loves everything says crabb robinson diary vol ii p 192   he catches the sunny side of everything and excepting that he has a   few polemical antipathies finds everything beautiful  in his essays the best of which appeared in the indicator 181921 he communicates some of his own sense of enjoyment to those of his readers who are content to take him as he is his circle is limited but in it his observation is minute and suggestive the vale of health is to him in a degree proportioned to their respective powers what the temple was to lamb his style is neat pretty and would be affected if it were not the man himself as a literary journalist a dramatic critic and an essayist he has a place in literature his poetry is less successful his affectations innate vulgarity and habit of pawing his subjects repel even those who are attracted by its sweetness yet his story of rimini 1816 which he dedicated to byron was admired in its day byron though he condemned its affected style thought the poem a devilish good one moore held the same opinion and jeffrey writing to him may 28 1816 memoirs etc of thomas moon vol ii p 100 says    i certainly shall not be illnatured to rimini it is very sweet   and very lively in many places and is altogether piquant as being by   far the best imitation of chaucer and some of his italian   contemporaries that modern times have produced  no two men could be more unlike than byron and hunt or have less in common yet with a singular capacity for selfdelusion hunt told his wife that the texture of byrons mind resembled his to a thread correspondence of l hunt vol i p 88 the friendship began in political sympathy but two years later see byrons letter to moore june 1 1818 it had on one side at least cooled in june 1822 hunt came to pisa to launch the liberal with the aid of shelley and byron the liberal verse and prose from the south started in 1822 lived through four numbers and died in july 1823 during that time byron expressed to lady blessington conversations p 77    a very good opinion of the talents and principle of mr hunt though   as he said our tastes are so opposite that we are totally unsuited   to each other  in short we are more formed to be friends at a   distance than near  for the best part of two years hunt was byrons guest he repaid his hospitality by publishing his lord byron and some of his contemporaries 1828 though lady blessington said the book gave in the main a fair account of byron crabb robinsons diary vol iii p 13 its publication was a breach of honour as such it was justly attacked by moore in the living dog and the dead lion    next week will be published as lives are the rage   the whole reminiscences wondrous

i will send and receive your letter you never told me of the forthcoming critique on columbus 1 which is not too fair and i do not think justice quite done to the pleasures which surely entitles the author to a higher rank than that assigned to him in the quarterly but i must not cavil at the decisions of the invisible infallibles and the article is very well written the general horror of fragments 2 makes me tremulous for the giaour but you would publish iti presume by this time to your repentance but as i consented whatever be its fate i wont now quarrel with you even though i detect it in my pastry but i shall not open a pye without apprehension for some weeks  the books which may be marked go i will carry out do you know clarkes naufragia 3 i am told that he asserts the first

himself attribute the first volume of robinson crusoe to lord oxford the following is the passage to which byron refers naufragia vol i pp 12 13 but before i conclude this section i wish to make the admirers of this nautical romance mindful of a report which prevailed many years ago that defoe after all was not the real author of robinson crusoe this assertion is noticed in an article in the seventh volume of the edinburgh magazine vol vii p 269 dr towers in his life of defoe in the biographia is inclined to pay no attention to it but was that writer aware of the following letter which also appeared in the gentlemans magazine for 1788 vol lviii part i p 208 at least no notice is taken of it in his life of defoe    dublin february 25    mr urbanin the course of a late conversation with a nobleman of   the first consequence and information in this kingdom he assured me   that mr benjamin holloway of middleton stony assured him some time   ago that he knew for fact that the celebrated romance of robinson   crusoe was really written by the earl of oxford when confined in the   tower of london that his lordship gave the manuscript to daniel   defoe who frequently visited him during his confinement and that   defoe having afterwards added the second volume published the whole   as his own production this anecdote i would not venture to send to   your valuable magazine if i did not think my information good and   imagine it might be acceptable to your numerous readers   notwithstanding the work has heretofore been generally attributed to   the latter w w  it is impossible for me to enter on a discussion of this literary subject though i thought the circumstance ought to be more generally known and yet i must observe that i always discerned a very striking falling off between the composition of the first and second volumes of this romancethey seem to bear evident marks of having been the work of different writers  a volume of memoranda in the handwriting of warton the laureate preserved in the british museum contains the following    mem jul 10 1774 in the year 1759 i was told by the rev mr   benjamin holloway rector of middleton stony in oxfordshire then   about 70 years old and in the early part of his life domestic   chaplain to lord sunderland that he had often heard lord sunderland   say that lord oxford while a prisoner in the tower of london wrote   the first volume of the history of robinson crusoe merely as an   amusement under confinement and gave it to daniel de foe who   frequently visited lord oxford in the tower and was one of his   pamphlet writers that de foe by lord oxfords permission printed it   as his own and encouraged by its extraordinary success added   himself the second volume the inferiority of which is generally   acknowledged mr holloway also told me from lord sunderland that   lord oxford dictated some parts of the manuscript to de foe mr   holloway was a grave conscientious clergyman not vain of telling   anecdotes very learned particularly a good orientalist author of   some theological tracts bred at eton school and a master of arts at   st johns college cambridge he lived many years with great respect   in lord sunderlands family and was like to the late duke of   marlborough he died as i remember about the year 1761                                                302to john

knew the veneration with which i have ever regarded you long before i had the most distant prospect of becoming your acquaintance literary or personal my embarrassment would not surprise you  any suggestion of yours even were it conveyed in the less tender shape of the text of the baviad or a monk mason note in massinger 1 would have been obeyed i should have endeavoured to improve myself by your censure judge then if i shall be less willing to profit by your kindness it is not for me to bandy compliments with my elders and my betters i receive your approbation with gratitude and will not return my brass for your gold by expressing more fully those sentiments of admiration which however sincere would i know be unwelcome  to your advice on religious topics i shall equally attend perhaps the best way will be by avoiding them altogether the already published objectionable passages have been much commented upon but certainly have been rather strongly interpreted i am no bigot to infidelity and did not expect that because i doubted the immortality of man i should be charged with denying the existence of a god it was the comparative insignificance of ourselves and our world

perceval on condition that castlereagh should lead the house of commons he refused the offer elected mp for liverpool in 1812 he had in july 1813 disbanded his followers and in 1814 left england he supported lord liverpool in carrying the repressive measures known as the six acts 181720 and on the death of lord londonderry in 1822 entered the government as secretary for foreign affairs it is to the private speech to his followers in july 1813 that byron refers  the morning chronicle for july 29 1813 has the following paragraph    mr canning it seems has to use a french phrase reformed his   political corps he assembled them at the close of the session and   with many expressions of regret for the failure of certain   negociations which might have been favourable to them as a body   relieved them from their oaths of allegiance and recommended them to   pursue in future their objects separately the right honourable   gentleman perhaps finds it more convenient for himself to act   unencumbered and both he and one or two others may find their   interest in disbanding the squad but some of them are turned off   without a character  the courier for july 29 quoting the first part of the statement adds    we believe  that mr canning is not indisposed to join the present   cabinet and may wish one or two of his particular friends to come in   with him   footnote 7    i have led

his clary wines pottledeep 2 this is nearly my ultimate or penultimate letter for i am quite equipped and only wait a passage perhaps i may wait a few weeks for sligo but not if i can help it    footnote 1 in his detached thoughts byron has noted the following impressions of sheridan    in society i have met sheridan frequently he was superb he had a   sort of liking for me and never attacked me at least to my face as   he did every body elsehigh names and wits and orators some of   them poets also i have seen him cut up whitbread quiz madame de   sta√´l annihilate colman and do little less by some others whose   names as friends i set not down of good fame and ability poor   fellow he got drunk very thoroughly and very soon it occasionally   fell to my lot to pilot him homeno sinecure for he was so tipsy   that i was obliged to put on his cocked hat for him to be sure it   tumbled off again and i was not myself so sober as to be able to pick   it up again    the last time i met him was i think at sir gilbert elliots where   he was as quick as everno it was not the last time the last time   was at douglas kinnairds i have met him in all places and   partiesat whitehall with the melbournes at the marquis of   tavistocks at robinss the auctioneers at sir humphry davys at   sam rogerssin short in most kinds of company and always found   him very convivial and delightful    i have seen sheridan weep two or three times it may be that he was   maudlin but this only renders it more impressive for who would see      from marlboroughs eyes the tears of dotage flow     and swift expire a driveller and a show    once i saw him cry at robinss the auctioneers after a splendid   dinner full of great names and high spirits i had the honour of   sitting next to sheridan the occasion of his tears was some   observation or other upon the subject of the sturdiness of the whigs   in resisting office and keeping to their principles sheridan turned   round sir it is easy for my lord g or earl g or marquis b or   lord h with thousands upon thousands a year some of it either   presently derived or inherited in sinecure or acquisitions from   the public money to boast of their patriotism and keep aloof from   temptation but they do not know from what temptation those have kept   aloof who had equal pride at least equal talents and not unequal   passions and nevertheless knew not in the course of their lives what   it was to have a shilling of their own and in saying this he wept    there was something odd about sheridan one day at dinner he was   slightly praising that pert pretender and impostor lyttelton the   parliamentary puppy still alive i believe i took the liberty of   differing from him he turned round upon me and said is that your   real opinion i confirmed it then said he fortified by this   concurrence i beg leave to say that it in fact is my opinion   also and that he is a person whom i do absolutely and utterly   despise abhor and detest he then launched out into a description   of his despicable qualities at some length and with his usual wit   and evidently in earnest for he hated lyttelton his former   compliment had been drawn out by some preceding one just as its   reverse was by my hinting that it was unmerited    i have more than once heard him say that he never had a shilling of   his own to be sure he contrived to extract a good many of other   peoples    in 1815 i had occasion to visit my lawyer in chancery lane he was   with sheridan after mutual greetings etc sheridan retired first   before recurring to my own business i could not help inquiring that   of sheridan oh replied the attorney the usual thing to stave   off an action from his winemerchant my clientwell said i   and what do you mean to donothing at all for the present said   he would you have us proceed against old sherry what would be the   use of it and here he began laughing and going over sheridans good   gifts of conversation    now from personal experience i can vouch that my attorney is by no   means the tenderest of men or particularly accessible to any kind of   impression out of the statute or record and yet sheridan in half an   hour had found the way to soften and seduce him in such a manner   that i almost think he would have thrown his client an honest man   with all the laws and some justice on his side out of the window   had he come in at the moment    such was sheridan he could soften an attorney there has been   nothing like it since the days of orpheus    one day i saw him take up his own monody on garrick he lighted   upon the dedication to the dowager lady spencer on seeing it he flew   into a rage and exclaimed that it must be a forgery that he had   never dedicated any thing of his to such a damned canting bitch   etc etcand so went on for half an hour abusing his own   dedication or at least the object of it if all writers were equally   sincere it would be ludicrous    he told me that on the night of the grand success of his school for   scandal he was knocked down and put into the watchhouse for making a   row in the street and being found intoxicated by the watchmen   latterly when found drunk one night in the kennel and asked his name   by the watchmen he answered wilberforce    when dying he was requested to undergo an operation he replied   that he had already submitted to two which were enough for one mans   lifetime being asked what they were he answered having his hair   cut and sitting for his picture    i have met george colman occasionally and thought him extremely   pleasant and convivial sheridans humour or rather wit was always   saturnine and sometimes savage he never laughed at least that i   saw and i watched him but colman did if i had to choose and   could not have both at a time i should say let me begin the evening   with sheridan and finish it with colman sheridan for dinner colman   for supper sheridan for claret or port but colman for every thing   from the madeira and champagne at dinner the claret with a layer of   port between the glasses up to the punch of the night and down to   the grog or gin and water of daybreakall these i have threaded   with both the same sheridan was a grenadier company of life guards   but colman a whole regimentof light infantry to be sure but   still a regiment   footnote 2

it was   said that early after her marriage lady walso took a similar   liberty with her person for a similar cause and was therefore   considered to have learned from experience the most efficacious remedy   for the complaint it was also whispered that the ladys husband had   most to grieve that the attempt had not fully succeeded lady c l   is still living    the poet has told us how ladies wish

cried the jealous fair and casting a   languishing look at lord b who heaven knows is more like pan than   apollo she whipt up as pretty a little dessertknife as a lady could   desire to commit

full of spirit character and originality and producing an effect at once powerful and pathetic but the reviewer considers that energy of character and intensity of emotion presented in combination with worthlessness and guilt are most powerful corrupters and perverters of our moral nature and he deplores byrons exclusive devotion to gloomy and revolting subjects   footnote 4 francis jeffrey

singular fluency etc etc  by the side of this description may be set that given of jeffrey by francis horner life of jeffrey 2nd edition vol i p 212    his manner is not at first pleasing what is worse it is of that   cast which almost irresistibly impresses upon strangers the idea of   levity and superficial talents yet there is not any man whose real   character is so much the reverse  the secret of his success both as editor and critic is that he made the review the expression of the whig character both in its excellences and its limitations a man of clear discriminating mind of cool and placid judgment he refused to accept the existing state of things was persuaded that it might be safely improved saw the practical steps required and had the courage of his convictions he was suspicious of large principles somewhat callous to enthusiasm or sentiment intolerant of whatever was incapable of precise expression his intellectual strength lay not in the possession of one great gift but in the simultaneous exercise of several welladjusted talents his literary taste was correct but it consisted rather in recognizing compliance with accepted rules of proved utility than  in the readiness to appreciate novelties of thought and treatment hence his criticism though useful for his time has not endured beyond his day it may be doubted whether more could be expected from a man who was eminently successful in addressing a jury he might not know his subject but he knew his readers bagehots literary studies vol i p 30  byron believing him to have been the author of the famous article on hours of idleness attacked him bitterly in english bards and scotch reviewers lines 460528 he afterwards recognized his error don juan canto x stanza xvi expresses his mature opinion of a

there was a timei have heard of your tricks when you was campaigning at the king of bohemy 1  i am much mistaken if some fine london spring about the year 1815 that time does not come again after all we must end in marriage and i can conceive nothing more delightful than such a state in the country reading the county newspaper etc and kissing ones wifes maid seriously i would incorporate with any woman of decent demeanour tomorrowthat is i would a month ago but at present  why dont you parody that odedo you think 2 i should be tetchy or have you done it and wont tell meyou are quite right about giamschid and i have reduced it to a dissyllable within this half hour 3  i am glad to hear you talk of richardson 4 because it tells me what you wontthat you are going to beat lucien at least tell me how far you have proceeded do you think me less interested about your works or less sincere than our friend ruggiero i am notand never was in that thing of mine the english bards at the time when i was angry with all the world i never disparaged your parts although i did not know you personallyand have always regretted that you dont give us an entire work and not sprinkle yourself in detached piecesbeautiful i allow and quite alone in our language but still giving us a right to expect a shah nameh 5 is that the name as well as gazelles stick to the eastthe oracle sta√´l told me it was the only poetical policy the north south and west have all been exhausted but from the east we have nothing but southeys unsaleablesand these he has contrived to spoil by adopting only their most outrageous fictions his personages dont interest us and yours will you will have no competitor and if you had you ought to be glad of it the little i have done in that way is merely a voice in the wilderness for you and if it has had any success that also will prove that the public are orientalising and pave the path for you  i have been thinking of a story grafted on the amours of a peri and a mortalsomething like only more philanthropical than cazottes diable amoureux 6  it would require a good deal of poesy and tenderness is not my forte for that and other reasons i have given up the idea and merely suggest it to you because in intervals of your greater work i think it a subject you might make much of 7  if you want any more books there is castellans moeurs des ottomans the best

giaour he had used this word as a   trisyllablebright as the gem of giamschidbut on my remarking to   him upon the authority of richardsons persian dictionary that this   was incorrect he altered it to bright as the ruby of giamschid on   seeing this however i wrote to him that as the comparison of his   heroines eye to a ruby might unluckily call up the idea of its   being bloodshot he had better change the line to bright as the jewel   of giamschid which he accordingly did in the following edition   moore  in the sh√°h n√°meh giamschid is the fourth sovereign of the ancient persians and ruled seven hundred years his jewel was a green chrysolite the reflection of which gives to the sky its bluegreen colour byron probably changed to ruby on the authority of vathek p 58 ed 1856

byron with this circumstance in my answer to the   above letter i added all i ask of your friendship isnot that you   will abstain from peris on my account for that is too much to ask of   human or at least authors naturebut that whenever you mean to   pay your addresses to any of these a√´rial ladies you will at once   tell me so frankly and instantly and let me at least have my   choice whether i

touching the hem of her petticoat your affectation of a dislike to encounter me is so flattering that i begin to think myself a very fine fellow but you are laughing at mestap my vitals tam thou art a very impudent person 3 and if you are not laughing at me you deserve to be laughed at seriously what on earth can you or have you to dread from any poetical flesh breathing it really puts me out of humour to hear you talk thus  the giaour i have added to a good deal but still in foolish fragments it contains about 1200 lines or rather morenow printing you will allow me to send you a copy you delight me much by telling me that i am in your good graces and more particularly as to temper for unluckily i have the reputation of a very bad one but they say the devil is amusing when pleased and i must have been more venomous than the old serpent to have hissed or stung in your company it may be and would appear to a third person an incredible thing but i know you will believe me when i say that i am as anxious for your success as one human being can be for anothersas much as if i had never scribbled a line surely the field of fame is wide enough for all and if it were not i would not willingly rob my neighbour of a rood of it now you have a pretty property of some thousand acres there and when you have passed your present inclosure bill your income will be doubled theres a

requested me to tell you all that i heard at   athens about the affair of that girl who was so near being put an end   to while you were there you have asked me to remember every   circumstance in the remotest degree relating to it which i heard in   compliance with your wishes i write to you all i heard and i cannot   imagine it to be very far from the fact as the circumstances happened   only a day or two before i arrived at athens and consequently was a   matter of common conversation at the time    the new governor unaccustomed to have the same intercourse with the   christians as his predecessor had of course the barbarous turkish   ideas with regard to women in consequence and in compliance with the   strict letter of the mohammedan law he ordered this girl to be sewed   up in a sack and thrown into the seaas is indeed quite customary   at constantinople as you were returning from bathing in the pir√¶us   you met the procession going down to execute the sentence of the   waywode on this unhappy girl report continues to say that on finding   out what the object of their journey was and who was the miserable   sufferer you immediately interfered and on some delay in obeying   your orders you were obliged to inform the leader of the escort that   force should make him comply that on further hesitation you drew a   pistol and told him that if he did not immediately obey your orders   and come back with you to the agas house you would shoot him dead   on this the man turned about and went with you to the governors   house here you succeeded partly by personal threats and partly by   bribery and entreaty in procuring her pardon on condition of her   leaving athens i was told that you then conveyed her in safety to the   convent and despatched her off at night to thebes where she found a   safe asylum such is the story i heard as nearly as i can recollect   it at present should you wish to ask me any further questions about   it i shall be very ready and willing to answer them    i remain my dear byron    yours very sincerely    sligo                                               326to james wedderburn webster   september 2nd 1813   my dear

send him at your leisure having anatomised him into such annotations as you want i do not believe that he has ever undergone that process before which is the best reason for not sparing him now  rogers has returned to town but not yet recovered of the quarterly what fellows these reviewers are these bugs do fear us all 1  they made you fight and me the milkiest of men a satirist and will end

as a vulgar line in his book  what say you to buonaparte remember i back him against the field barring catalepsy and the elements nay i almost wish him success against all countries but thiswere it only to choke the morning post and his undutiful fatherinlaw with that rebellious bastard of scandinavian adoption bernadotte rogers wants me to go with him on a crusade to the lakes and to besiege you on our way this last is a great temptation but i fear it will not be in my power unless you would go on with one of us somewhereno matter where it is too late for matlock but we might hit upon some scheme high life or lowthe last would be much the best for amusement i am so sick of the other that i quite sigh for a cidercellar 3 or a cruise in a smugglers sloop  you cannot wish more than i do that the fates were a little more accommodating to our parallel lines which prolong ad infinitum without coming a jot nearer i almost wish i were married toowhich is saying much all my friends seniors and juniors are in for it and ask me to be godfatherthe only species of parentage which i believe will ever come to my share in a lawful way and in an unlawful one by the blessing of lucina we can never be certainthough the parish may i suppose i shall hear from you tomorrow if not this goes as it is but i leave room for a ps in case any thing requires an answer  ever etc  no letternimporte rogers thinks the quarterly will be at me this time if so it shall be a war of exterminationno quarter from the youngest devil down to the oldest woman of that review all shall perish by one fatal

availing yourself of his spoils by this coach i send you a copy of that awful pamphlet the giaour which has never procured me half so high a compliment as your modest alarm you will if inclined in an evening perceive that i have added much in quantitya circumstance which may truly diminish your modesty upon the subject  you stand certainly in great need of a lift with mackintosh my dear moore you strangely underrate yourself i should conceive it an affectation in any other but i think i know you well enough to believe that you dont know your own value however tis a fault that generally mends and in your case it really ought i have heard him speak of you as highly as your wife could wish and enough to give all your friends the jaundice  yesterday i had a letter from ali pacha brought by dr

short so he did after a fine saying about our correspondence and lookedi wish i could revenge myself by attacking you or by telling you that i have had to defend youan agreeable way which ones friends have of recommending themselves by sayingay ay i gave it mr suchaone for what he said about your being a plagiary and a rake and so on but do you know that you are one of the very few whom i never have the satisfaction of hearing abused but the reverseand do you suppose i will forgive that  i have been in the country and ran away from the doncaster races it is oddi was a visitor in the same house 2 which came to my sire as a residence with lady carmarthen with whom he adulterated before his majorityby the by remember she was not my mammaand they thrust me into an old room with a nauseous picture over the chimney which i should suppose my papa regarded with due respect and which inheriting the family taste i looked upon with great satisfaction i stayed a week with the family and behaved very wellthough the lady of the house is young and religious and pretty and the master is my particular friend i felt no wish for any thing but a poodle dog which they kindly gave me now for a

anticipation last night and this is but a postscript to my reply my yesterdays contained some advice which i now see you dont want and hope you never will  so petersham 1 has not joined you i pity the poor women no one can properly repair such a deficiency but rather than such a chasm should be left utterly unfathomable i even i the most awkward of attendants and deplorable of danglers would have been of your forlorn hope on this expedition nothing but business and the notion of my being utterly superfluous in so numerous a party would have induced me to resign so soon my quiet apartments never interrupted but by the sound or the more harmonious barking of nettle and clashing of billiard balls  on sunday i shall leave town and mean to join you immediately i have not yet had my sisters answer to lady francess very kind invitation but expect it tomorrow pray assure lady frances that i never can forget the obligation conferred upon me in this respect and i trust that even lady catherine 2 will in this instance not question my stability  i yesterday wrote you rather a long tirade about la comptesse but you seem in no immediate peril i will therefore burn it yet i dont know why i should as you may relapse it shall een go  i have been passing my time with rogers and sir james mackintosh and once at holland house i met southey he is a person of very epic appearance and has a fine headas far as the outside goes and wants nothing but taste to make the inside equally attractive  ever my dear w yours  biron  psi read your letter thus the countess is miserable instead of which it is inexorable a very different thing the best way is to let her alone she must be a diablesse by what you told me you have probably not bid high enough now you are not perhaps of my opinion but i would not give the tithe of a birmingham farthing for a woman who could or would be purchased nor indeed for any woman quoad mere woman that is to say unless i loved her for something more than her sex if she loves a little pique is not amiss nor even if she dont the next thing to a womans love in a mans favour is her hatreda seeming paradox but true get them once out of indifference and circumstance and their passions will do wonders for a dasher which i suppose you are though i seldom had the impudence or patience to follow them up    footnote 1 lord petersham was one of the chief

dont call and wanted you also to dine with him on wednesday last yesterday we had curran therewho is beyond all conception and mackintosh and the wits are to be seen at h h constantly so that i think you would like their society i will be a judge between you and the attorneo so butler may mention me to lucien if he still adheres to his opinion pray let rogers be one he has the best taste extant blands nuptials delight me if i had the least hand in bringing them about it will be a subject of selfish satisfaction to me these three weeks desire druryif he loves meto kick dwyer thrice for frightening my horses with his flamecoloured whiskers last july let the kicks be hard etc                                               339to thomas moore   october 2 1813   you have not answered some six letters of mine this therefore is my penultimate i will write to you once more but after thati swear by all the saintsi am silent and supercilious i have met curran 1 at holland househe beats every bodyhis imagination is beyond human and his humour it is difficult to define what is wit perfect then he has fifty faces and twice as many voices when he mimicsi never met his equal now were i a woman and eke a virgin that is the man i should make my scamander 2  he is quite fascinating remember i have met him but once and you who have known him long may probably deduct from my panegyric i almost fear to meet him again lest the impression should be lowered he talked a great deal about youa theme never tiresome to me nor any body else that i know what a variety of expression he conjures into that naturally not very fine countenance of his he absolutely changes it entirely i have donefor i cant describe him and you know him on sunday i return to aston where i shall not be far from you perhaps i shall hear from you in the mean time good night  saturday mornyour letter has cancelled all my anxieties i did not suspect you in earnest modest again because i dont do a very shabby thing it seems i dont fear your competition if it were reduced to an alternative of preference i should dread you as much as satan does michael but is there not room enough in our respective regions go onit will soon be my turn to forgive today i dine with mackintosh and mrs staleas john bull may be pleased to denominate corinnewhom i saw last night at covent garden yawning over the humour of falstaff  the reputation of gloom if ones friends are not included in the reputants is of great service as it saves one from a legion of impertinents in the shape of commonplace acquaintance but thou knowst i can be a right merry and conceited fellow and rarely larmoyant murray shall reinstate your line forthwith 3  i believe the blunder in the motto was mineand yet i have in general a memory for you and am sure it was rightly printed at first  i do blush very often if i may believe ladies h and mbut luckily at present no one sees me adieu    footnote 1 rogers tabletalk etc p 161 regretted that so little of currans brilliant talk has been preserved john philpot curran 17501817 after accepting the mastership of the rolls in ireland 1806 spent much of his time in england he retired from the bench where he never shone in 1814  in byrons detached thoughts 1821 occurs the following passage    i was much struck with the simplicity of grattans manners in private   life they were odd but they were natural curran used to take him   off bowing to the very ground and thanking god that he had no   peculiarities of gesture or appearance in a way irresistibly   ludicrous rogers used to call him a sentimental harlequin but   rogers backbites everybody and curran who used to quiz his great   friend godwin to his very face would hardly respect a fair mark of   mimicry in another to be sure curran was admirable to hear his   description of the examination of an irish witness was next to hearing   his own speeches the latter i never heard but i have the former  elsewhere ibid he returns to the subject    curran currans the man who struck me mostsuch imagination there   never was anything like it that ever i saw or heard of his   published lifehis published speechesgive you no idea of the man   none at all he was a machine of imagination as some one said that   piron was an epigrammatic machine i did not see a great deal of   curranonly in 1813 but i met him at home for he used to call on   me and in society at mackintoshs holland house etc etc and he   was wonderful even to me who had seen many remarkable men of the   time  the following notes on this passage are in the handwriting of walter scott    when mathews first began to imitate curran in dublinin society i   meancurran sent for him and said the moment he entered the room   mr mathews you are a firstrate artist and since you are to do my   picture pray allow me to give you a sitting everyone knows how   admirably mathews succeeded in furnishing at last the portraiture   begun under these circumstances no one was more aware of the truth   than curran himself in his latter and feeble days he was riding in   hyde park one morning bowed down over the saddle and bitterly   dejected in his air mathews happened to observe and saluted him   curran stopped his horse for a moment squeezed charles by the hand   and said in that deep whisper which the comedian so exquisitely   mimics dont speak to me my dear mathews you are the only curran   now    did you know curran asked byron of lady blessington   conversations p 176 he was the most wonderful person i ever   saw in him was combined an imagination the most brilliant and   profound with a flexibility and wit that would have justified the   observation applied to that his heart was in his head  moore journal etc vol i p 40 quotes a couplet by mrs battier upon curran which commemorates in a small compass two of his most striking peculiarities namely his very unprepossessing personal appearance and his great success notwithstanding in pursuits of gallantry    for though his monkey face might fail to woo her   yet ah his monkey tricks would quite undo her   footnote 2 in the spurious letters of √Üschines letter x is a passage which explains the allusion    it is the custom of maidens on the eve of their marriage to wash in   the waters of the scamander and then to utter this almost sacred   formula      take o scamander my virginity

             340to john murray   stilton oct 3 1813   dear siri have just recollected an alteration you may make in the proof to be sent to astonamong the lines on hassans serai not far from the beginning is this    unmeet for solitude to share  now to share implies more than one and solitude is a single gentlewoman it must be thus    for many a gilded chambers there   which solitude might well forbear  and so onmy address is aston hall rotherham will you adopt this correction and pray accept a cheese from me for your trouble ever yours b  psi leave this to your discretion if any body thinks the old line a good one or the cheese a bad one dont accept either but in that case the word share is repeated soon after in the line    to share the masters bread and salt  and must be altered to    to break the masters bread and salt  this is not so well thoughconfound it if the old line stands let the other run thus    nor there will weary traveller halt   to bless the sacred bread and salt  noteto partake of foodto break bread and taste salt with your hostensures the safety of the guest even though an enemy his person from that moment becomes sacred  there is another additional note sent yesterdayon the priest in the confessional                                               341to john hanson   nottingham octr 10th 1813   dear siri am disposed to advance a loan of ¬£1000 to

know nothing further and the demands on myself i know also but w is a very old friend of mine and a man of property and as i can command the money he shall have it i do not at all wish to inconvenience you and i also know that when we balance accounts it will be much in your favour but if you could replace the sum at hoares from my advance of two thousand eight hundred in july it would be a favour or still better if c makes further payments which will render it unnecessary dont let the first part of the last sentence embarrass you at all the last part about claughton i would wish you to attend to i have written this dayabout his opening the cellar  pray send the bond and judgement to aston as directed  ever dear sir  b  psmany many thanks for your kind invitation but it was too late i was in this county before it arrived my best remembrances to mrs h and all the family                                               342to the hon augusta leigh   sunday october 10th 1813

particularly in the last pagei know twas false she could not die it was and ought to beknew pray observe this and similar mistakes  i have received and read the british review 1  i really think the writer in most parts very right the only mortifying thing is the accusation of imitation  crabbes passage i never saw and scott i no further meant to follow than in his lyric measure which is grays miltons and any ones who likes it the giaour is certainly a bad character but not dangerous and i think his fate and his feelings will meet with few proselytes i shall be very glad to hear from or of you when you please but dont put yourself out of your way on my account  yours ever  b    footnote 1 the british review no ix criticized the giaour severely pp 132145 lord byron it says has had the bad taste to imitate mr walter scott p 135 further on p 139 it charges him with borrowing a simile from crabbes resentment the passage to which the reviewer alludes will be found in lines 1116 of that poem    those are like waxapply them to the fire   melting they take th impressions you desire   easy to mould and fashion as you please   and again moulded with an equal ease   like smelted iron

  november 12 1813   my dear siri hope you will consider when i venture on any request that it is the reverse of a certain dedication and is addressed not to the editor of the quarterly review but to mr gifford you will understand this and on that point i need trouble you no farther  you have been good enough to look at a thing of mine in msa turkish story and i should feel gratified if you would do it the same favour in its probationary state of printing it was written i cannot say for amusement nor obliged by hunger and request of friends 1 but in a state of mind from circumstances which occasionally occur to us youth that rendered it necessary for me to apply my mind to something any thing but reality and under this not very brilliant inspiration it was composed being done and having at least diverted me from myself i thought you would not perhaps be offended if mr murray forwarded it to you he has done so and to apologise for his doing so a second time is the object of my present letter  i beg you will not send me any answer i assure you very sincerely i know your time to be occupied and it is enough more than enough if you read you are not to be bored with the fatigue of answers  a word to mr murray will be sufficient and send it either to the flames or        a hundred hawkers load   on wings of wind to fly or fall abroad  it deserves no better than the first as the work of a week and scribbled stans pede in uno 2 by the by the only foot i have to stand on and i promise never to trouble you again under forty cantos and a voyage between each believe me ever  your

friends of mine mr rogers and mr sharpe have advised me not to risk at present any single publication separately for various reasons as they have not seen the one in question they can have no bias for or against the merits if it has any or the faults of the present subject of our conversation you say all the last of the giaour 1 are goneat least out of your hands now if you think of publishing any new edition with the last additions which have not yet been before the reader i mean distinct from the twovolume publication we can add the bride of abydos which will thus steal quietly into the world 2 if liked we can then throw off some copies for the purchasers of former giaours and if not i can omit it in any future publication what think you i really am no judge of those things and with all my natural partiality for ones own productions i would rather follow any ones judgment than my own  pspray let me have the proofs i sent all tonight i have some alterations that i have thought of that i wish to make speedily i hope the proof will be on separate pages and not all huddled together on a milelong balladsinging sheet as those of the giaour sometimes are for then i cant read them distinctly    footnote 1 in accepted addresses or premium poetarum pp 5052 1813 address xvii is from lord bn to j my bookseller the address itself runs as follows    a turkish tale i shall unfold   a

the fair   are now more cautious than they were   perhaps the christians not so bold   so enterprising as of old   no matter what the cause may be   it is a subject fit for me    take my disjointed fragments then   the offspring of a willing pen   and give them to the public pray   on or before the month of may   yes my disjointed fragments take   but do not ask how much theyll make   perhaps not fifty pageswell   i in a little space can tell   th adventures of an infidel   of quantity i never boast   for qualitys approved of most    it is a handsome sum to touch   induces authors to write much   but in this much alas my friend   how little is there to commend   so mr my i disdain   to sacrifice my muse for gain   i wish it to be understood   the little which i write is good    i do not like the quarto size   th octavo therefore i advise   then do not mr my fail   to publish this my turkish tale   for tho the volume may be thin   a thousand readers it will win   and when my pages they explore   theyll gladly read them oer and oer   and all the ladies i engage   with tears will moisten every page   footnote 2 john murray writes in an undated letter to byron    mr canning returned the poem today with very warm expressions of   delight i told him your delicacy as to separate publication of which   he said you should remove every apprehension

can send the request contained in this at the same time with the revise after i have seen the said revise                                               350to john murray   nov 13 1813   certainly do you suppose that no one but the galileans are acquainted with adam and eve and cain 1 and noahsurely i might have had solomon and abraham and david and even moses or the other when you know that zuleika is the persian poetical name for potiphars wife on whom and joseph there is a long poem in the persian this will not surprise you if you want authority look at jones dherbelot vathek or the notes to the arabian nights and if you think it necessary model this into a note  alter in the inscription the most affectionate respect to with every sentiment of regard and respect    footnote 1    some doubt had been expressed by murray as to the propriety of his   putting the name of cain into the mouth of a mussulman  moore                                               351to john murray   nov

or rather pointed this revise which must be the one to print from he has also made some suggestions with most of which i have complied as he has always for these ten years been a very sincere and by no means at times flattering critic of mine he likes it you will think flatteringly in this instance better than the giaour but doubts and so do i its being so popular but contrary to some others advises a separate publication on this we can easily decide i confess i like the double form better hodgson says it is better versified than any of the others which is odd if true as it has cost me less time though more hours at a time than any attempt i ever made  yours ever b  psdo attend to the punctuation i cant for i dont know a commaat least where to place one  that tory of a printer has omitted two lines of the opening and perhaps more which were in the ms will you pray give him a hint of accuracy i have reinserted the 2 but they were in the manuscript i can swear                                               353to john murray   november 17 1813   my dear sirthat you and i may distinctly understand each other on a subject which like the dreadful reckoning when men smile no more 1 makes conversation not very pleasant i think it as well to write a few lines on the topicbefore i left town for yorkshire you said that you were ready and willing to give five hundred guineas for the copyright of the giaour and my answer wasfrom which i do not mean to recedethat we would discuss the point at christmas the new story may or may not succeed the probability under present circumstances seems to be that it may at least pay its expencesbut even that remains to be proved and till it is proved one way or the other we will say nothing about it thus then be it i will postpone all arrangement about it and the giaour also till easter 1814 and you shall then according to your own notions of fairness make your own offer for the two at the same time i do not rate the last in my own estimation at half the giaour and according to your own notions of its worth and its success within the time mentioned be the addition or deduction to or from whatever sum may be your proposal for the first which has already had its success 2  my account with you since my last payment which i believe cleared it off within five pounds i presume has not much increasedbut whatever it is have the goodness to send it to methat i may at least meet you on even terms  the pictures of phillips i consider as mine all three and the one not the arnaut of the two best is much at your service if you will accept it as a present from yours very truly biron  psthe expence of engraving from the miniature send me in my account as it was destroyed by my desire and have the goodness to burn that detestable print from it immediately    footnote 1 the what dye callt by john gay act ii sc 9      so comes a reckoning when the banquets oer      the dreadful reckoning and men smile no more

edition i beg leave to offer you the sum of one   thousand guineas and i shall be happy if you perceive that my   estimation of your talents in my character of a man of business is not   much under my admiration of them as a man                                               354to john murray   november 20 1813   more work for the row i am doing my best to beat the giaourno difficult task for any

errata page place it at the beginning mr perry is a little premature in his compliments 1 these may do harm by exciting expectation and i think we ought to be above itthough i see the next paragraph is on the journal 2 which makes me suspect you as the author of both  would it not have been as well to have said in 2 cantos in the advertisement they will else think of fragments a species of composition very well for once like one ruin in a view but one would not build a town of them the bride such as it is is my first entire composition of any length except the satire and be damned to it for the giaour is but a string of passages and childe harold is and i rather think always will be unconcluded i return mr hays note with thanks to him and you  there have been some epigrams on mr ward one i see today 3  the first i did not see but heard yesterday the second seems very bad and mr perry has placed it over your puff i only hope that mr w does not believe that i had any connection with either the regent is the only person on whom i ever expectorated an epigram or ever should and even if i were disposed that way i like and value mr w too well to allow my politics to contract into spleen or to admire any thing intended to annoy him or his you need not take the trouble to answer this as i shall see you in the course of the afternoon  yours very truly b  psi have said this much about the epigrams because i live so much in the opposite camp and from my post as an engineer might be suspected as the flinger of these hand grenadoes but with a worthy foe i am all for open war and not this bushfighting and have not had nor will have any thing to do with it i do not know the author    footnote 1 in the morning chronicle november 29 1813 appeared the following paragraph    lord

dear sirfor the sake of correctness particularly in an errata page the alteration of the couplet i have just sent half an hour ago must take place in spite of delay or cancel let me see the proof early tomorrow i found out murmur to be a neuter verb and have been obliged to alter the line so as to make it a substantive thus    the deepest murmur of this life shall be   no sigh for safety but a prayer for thee  dont send the copies to the country till this is all right  yours b                                               364to thomas moore   november 30 1813   since i last wrote to you much has occurred good bad and indifferentnot to make me forget you but to prevent me from reminding you of one who nevertheless has often thought of you and to whom your thoughts in many a measure have frequently been a consolation we were once very near neighbours this autumn and a good and bad neighbourhood it has proved to me suffice it to say that your french quotation 1 was confoundedly to the purposethough very unexpectedly pertinent as you may imagine by what i said before and my silence since however richards himself again 2 and except all night and some part of the morning i dont think very much about the matter  all convulsions end with me in rhyme and to solace my midnights i have scribbled another turkish story 3not a fragmentwhich you will receive soon after this it does not trench upon your kingdom in the least and if it did you would soon reduce me to my proper boundaries you will think and justly that i run some risk of losing the little i have gained in fame by this further experiment on public patience but i have really ceased to care on that head i have written this and published it for the sake of the employmentto wring my thoughts from reality and take refuge in imaginings however horrible 4 and as to success those who succeed will console me for a failureexcepting yourself and one or two more whom luckily i love too well to wish one leaf of their laurels a tint yellower this is the work of a week and will be the reading of an hour to you or even lessand so let it go  psward and i talk of going to holland i want to see how a dutch canal looks after the bosphorus pray respond    footnote 1 moore wrote to byron in 1813 an undated letter in which the following passage occurs    i am sorry i must wait till we are veterans before you will open to   me the story of your wandering life wherein you find more hours due   to repentance  than time hath told you yet is it so with you or   are you like me reprobate enough to look back with complacency on   what you have done i suppose repentance must bring up the rear with   us all but at present i should say with old fontenelle si je   recommen√ßais ma carri√®re je ferais tout ce que

to do for you 1  now my dear hn you or drury must have told this for upon my own honour not even to scrope nor to one soul drury knew it before have i said one syllable of the matter so dont be out of humour with me about it but you cant be more so than i am i am however glad of one thing if you ever conceived it to be in the least an obligation this disclosure most fairly and fully releases you from it    to john i owe some obligation     but john unluckily thinks fit   to publish it to all the nation     so john and i are more than quit  and so theres an end of the matter  ward wavers a little about the dutch till matters are more sedative and the french more sedentary  the bride will blush upon you in a day or two there is much at least a little addition i am happy to say that frere and heber and some other good men and true have been kind enough to adopt the same opinion that you did  pray write when you like and believe me  ever yours  byron  psmurray has offered me a thousand guineas for the two giaour and bride and told me de stael that he had paid them to me i should be glad to be able to tell her so too but the truth is he would but i thought the fair way was to decline it till may and at the end of 6 months he can safely say whether he can afford it or notwithout running any risk by speculation if he paid them now and lost by it it would be hard if he gains it will be time enough when he has already funded his profits but he needed not have told la baronne such a devil of an uncalled for piece ofpremature truth perhapsbut nevertheless a lie in the mean time

depressing embarrassments you would as i do bless my dearest friend   and brother byron                                               366to john murray   dec 2 1813   dear sirwhen you can let the couplet enclosed be inserted either in the page or in the errata page i trust it is in time for some of the copies this alteration is in the same partthe page but one before the last correction sent  yours etc  b  psi am afraid from all i hear that people are rather inordinate in their expectations which is very unlucky but cannot now be helped this comes of mr perry and ones wise friends but do not you wind your hopes of success to the same pitch for fear of accidents and i can assure you that my philosophy will stand the test very fairly and i have done every thing to ensure you at all events from positive loss which will be some satisfaction to both                                               367to leigh hunt   4 bennet st dec 2 1813   my dear sirfew things could be more welcome than your note and on saturday morning i will avail myself of your permission to thank you for it in person my time has not been passed since we met either profitably or agreeably a very short period after my last visit an incident occurred with which i fear you are not unacquainted as report in many mouths and more than one paper was busy with the topic that naturally gave me much uneasiness then i nearly incurred a lawsuit on the sale of an estate but that is now arranged nextbut why should i go on with a series of selfish and silly details i merely wish to assure you that it was not the frivolous forgetfulness of a mind occupied by what is called pleasure not in the true sense of epicurus that kept me away but a perception of my then unfitness to share the society of those whom i value and wish not to displease i hate being larmoyant and making a serious face among those who are cheerful  it is my wish that our acquaintance or if you please to accept it friendship may be permanent i have been lucky enough to preserve some friends from a very early period and i hope as i do not at least now select them lightly i shall not lose them capriciously i have a thorough esteem for that independence of spirit 1 which you have maintained with sterling talent and at the expense of some suffering you have not i trust abandoned the poem you were composing when moore and i partook of your hospitality in the summer i hope a time will come when he and i may be able to repay you in kind for the latterfor the rhyme at least in quantity you are in arrear to both  believe me very truly and affectionately yours  byron    footnote 1 the following is leigh hunts answer    my dear lordi need not tell you how much your second letter has   gratified me for i am apt to speak as sincerely as i think you must   suffer me to talk in this way after what you have been kind enough to   say of my independence and it always rejoices me to find that those   whom i wish to regard will take me at my word but i shall grow   egotistical upon the strength of your lordships good opinion i shall   be heartily glad to see you on saturday morning and perhaps shall   prevail upon you to take a luncheon with us at our dinnertime3 the   nature of your letter would have brought upon you a long answer   filled perhaps with an enthusiasm that might have made you smile but   i am keeping your servant in the cold and so among other good   offices you see what he has done for you however i would not make a   light thing of so good a matter as i mean my enthusiasm to be and   intend before i have done that you shall have as sound a regard for   it as i have for the feelings on your lordships part that have   called it forth    yours my dear lord most sincerely and cordially

but certainly uncommonly well writtenand quite uncomfortable at the naughtiness of book and author i rather suspect you wont much like the present to be more moral if it is to share also the usual fate of your virtuous volumes  let me see a proof of the six before incorporation    footnote 1 the christian observer for november 1813 pp 731737 felt compelled to review the giaour because of its extraordinary popularity but it found that some of the passages savoured too much of newgate and bedlam for our expurgated pages it acknowledged one obligation to byron    he never attempts to deceive the world by representing the profligate   as happy and his testimony is of the more value as his situation   in life must have permitted him to see the experiment tried under the   most favourable circumstances he has probably seen more than one   example of young men of high birth talents and expectancies    sink under the burden of unsubdued tempers licentious alliances and   ennervating indulgence he has seen all this nay perhapsbut   we check our pen etc etc                                               369to john murray   dec 3 1813   my dear sirlook out the encyclopedia article

redde through your persian tales 1 and have taken the liberty of making some remarks on the blank pages there are many beautiful passages and an interesting story and i cannot give you a stronger proof that such is my opinion than by the date of the hourtwo oclocktill which it has kept me awake without a yawn  the conclusion is not quite correct in costume there is no mussulman suicide on recordat least for love but this matters not the tale must have been written by some one who has been on the spot and i wish him and he deserves success will you apologise to the author for the liberties i have taken with his ms had i been less awake to and interested in his theme i had been less obtrusive but you know i always take this in good part and i hope he will it is difficult to say what will succeed and still more to pronounce what will not i am at this moment in that uncertainty on your own score and it is no small proof of the authors powers to be able to charm and fix a minds attention on similar subjects and climates in such a predicament that he may have the same effect upon all his readers is very sincerely the wish and hardly the doubt of  yours truly b    footnote 1

painful and pleasing but first to what sits nearest do you know i was actually about to dedicate to younot in a formal inscription as to ones eldersbut through a short prefatory letter in which i boasted myself your intimate and held forth the prospect of your poem when lo the recollection of your strict injunctions of secrecy as to the said poem more than once repeated by word and letter flashed upon me and marred my intents i could have no motive for repressing my own desire of alluding to you and not a day passes that i do not think and talk of you but an idea that you might yourself dislike it you cannot doubt my sincere admiration waving personal friendship for the present which by the by is not less sincere and deep rooted i have you by rote and by heart of which ecce signum when i was at aston on my first visit i have a habit in passing my time a good deal alone ofi wont call it singing for that i never attempt except to myselfbut of uttering to what i think tunes your oh breathe not when the last glimpse and when he who adores thee with others of the same minstrelthey are my matins and vespers i assuredly did not intend them to be overheard but one morning in comes not la donna but il marito with a very grave face saying byron i must request you wont sing any more at least of those songs i stared and said certainly but whyto tell you the truth quoth he they make my wife cry and so melancholy that i wish her to hear no more of them  now my dear m the effect must have been from your words and certainly not my music i merely mention this foolish story to show you how much i am indebted to you for even your pastimes a man may praise and praise but no one recollects but that which pleasesat least in composition though i think no one equal to you in that department or in satireand surely no one was ever so popular in bothi certainly am of opinion that you have not yet done all you can do though more than enough for any one else i want and the world expects a longer work from you and i see in you what i never saw in poet before a strange diffidence of your own powers which i cannot account for and which must be unaccountable when a cossac like me can appal a cuirassier your story i did not could not knowi thought only of a peri i wish you had confided in me not for your sake but mine and to prevent the world from losing a much better poem than my own but which i yet hope this clashing will not even now deprive them of 1  mine is the work of a week written why i have partly told you and partly i cannot tell you by lettersome day i will  go oni shall really be very unhappy if i at all interfere with you the success of mine is yet problematical though the public will probably purchase a certain quantity on the presumption of their own propensity for the giaour and such horrid mysteries the only advantage i have is being on the spot and that merely amounts to saving me the trouble of turning over books which i had better read again if your chamber was furnished in the same way you have no need to go there to describei mean only as to accuracybecause i drew it from recollection  this last thing of mine may have the same fate and i assure you i have great doubts about it but even if not its little day will be over before you are ready and willing come outscrew your courage to the stickingplace 2  except the post

footnote 1    among the stories intended to be introduced into lalla rookh which   i had begun but from various causes never finished there was one   which i had made some progress in at the time of the appearance of   the bride and which on reading that poem i found to contain such   singular coincidences with it not only in locality and costume but   in plot and characters that i immediately gave up my story   altogether and began another on an entirely new subjectthe   fireworshippers to this circumstance which i immediately   communicated to him lord byron alludes in this letter in my hero to   whom i had even given the name of zelim and who was a descendant of   ali outlawed with all his followers by the reigning caliph it was   my intention to shadow out as i did afterwards in another form the   national cause of ireland to quote the words of my letter to lord   byron on the subject i chose this story because one writes best   about what one feels most and i thought the parallel with ireland   would enable me to infuse some vigour into my heros character but to   aim at vigour and strong feeling after you is hopelessthat region   was made for c√¶sar  moore   footnote

galtthere was no offencethere could be none i thought it by no means impossible that we might have hit on something similar particularly as you are a dramatist and was anxious to assure you of the truth viz that i had not wittingly seized upon plot sentiment or incident and i am very glad that i have not in any respect trenched upon your subjects something still more singular is that the first part where you have found a coincidence in some events within your observations on life was drawn from observations of mine also and i meant to have gone on with the story but on second thoughts i thought myself two centuries at least too late for the subject which though admitting of very powerful feeling and description yet is not adapted for this age at least this country though the finest works of the greeks one of schillers and alfieris in modern times besides several of our old and best dramatists have been grounded on incidents of a similar cast i therefore altered it as you perceive and in so doing have weakened the whole by interrupting the train of thought and in composition i do not think second thoughts are the best though second expressions may improve the first ideas  i do not know how other men feel towards those they have met abroad but to me there seems a kind of tie established between all who have met together in a foreign country as if we had met in a state of preexistence and were talking over a life that has ceased but i always look forward to renewing my travels and though you i think are now stationary if i can at all forward your pursuits there as well as here i shall be truly glad in the opportunity  ever yours very sincerely b  psi leave town for a day or two on monday but after that i am always at home and happy to see you till

remarkable coincidence in the story of the bride of abydos with a matter in which i had been interested life of byron p 180 ed 1830 byron imagining himself charged with plagiarism wrote a somewhat angry reply to which gait answered by stating that the coincidence was not one of ideas sentiment or story but of real fact he received the above answer life of byron pp 181 182  on this poem byron seems to have been particularly sensitive he is accused of borrowing the opening lines from mignons song in goethes wilhelm meister    kennst du das land wo die citronen bl√ºhn  cyrus redding

that i felt compelled to make my hero and heroine relatives as you well know that none else could there obtain that degree of intercourse leading to genuine affection i had nearly made them rather too much akin to each other and though the wild passions of the east and some great examples in alfieri ford and schiller to stop short of antiquity might have pleaded in favour of a copyist yet the time and the north not frederic but our climate induced me to alter their consanguinity and confine them to cousinship i also wished to try my hand on a female character in zuleika and have endeavoured as far as the grossness of our masculine ideas will allow to preserve her purity without impairing the ardour of her attachment  as to criticism i have been reviewed about a hundred and fifty timespraised and abused i will not say that i am become indifferent to either eulogy or condemnation but for some years at least i have felt grateful for the former and have never attempted to answer the latter for success equal to the first efforts i had and have no hope the novelty was over and the bride like all other brides must suffer or rejoice for and with her husband by the bye i have used bride turkishly as affianced not married and so far it is an english bull which i trust will be at least a comfort to all hibernians not bigotted to monopoly you are good enough to mention your quotations in your third volume i shall not only be indebted to it for a renewal of the high gratification received from the two first but for preserving my relics embalmed in your own spices and ensuring me readers to whom i could not otherwise have aspired  i called on you as bounden by duty and inclination when last in your neighbourhood but i shall always take my chance you surely would not have me inflict upon you a formal annunciation i am proud of your friendship but not so fond of myself as to break in upon your better avocations i trust that mrs clarke is well i have never had the honour of presentation but i have heard so much of her in many quarters that any notice she is pleased to take of my productions is not less gratifying than my thanks are sincere both to her and you by all accounts i may safely congratulate you on the possession of a bride whose mental and personal accomplishments are more than poetical  p smurray has sent or will send a double copy of the bride and giaour in the last one some lengthy additions pray accept them according to old custom from the author to one of his better brethren your persian or any memorial will be a most agreeable and it is my fault if not an useful present i trust your third will be out before i sail next month can i say or do anything for you in the levant i am now in all the agonies of equipment and full of schemes some impracticable and most of them improbable but i mean to fly freely to the green earths end 2 though not quite so fast as milton¬¥s sprite  p s 2ndi have so many things to sayi want to show you lord sligos letter to me detailing as he heard them on the spot the athenian account of our adventure a personal one which certainly first suggested to me the story of the giaour it was a strange and not a very long story and his report of the reports he arrived just after my departure and i did not know till last summer that he knew anything of the matter is not very far from the truth dont be alarmed there was nothing that led further than to the waters edge but one part as is often the case in life was more singular than any of the giaours adventures i never have and never should have alluded to it on my own authority from respect to the ancient proverb on travellers    footnote 1 dr clark in october 1814 was a candidate for the professorship of anatomy and byron went to cambridge to vote for his friend writing to miss tayler hodgson memoir vol i p 292 adds a postscript    i open my letter to say that when lord byron went to give his vote   just now in the senate house the young men burst out into the most   rapturous applause  the next day he writes again    i should add that as i was going to vote i met him coming away and   presently saw that something had happened by his extreme paleness and   agitation dr clark who was with him told me the cause and i   returned with b to my room there i begged him to sit down and write   a letter and communicate this event which he did not feel up to but   wished i would so down i sate and commenced my acquaintance   with miss milbanke by writing her an account of this most pleasing   event which although nothing at oxford is here very unusual indeed  the following was miss milbankes answer ibid pp 296 297 dated seaham november 25 1814    dear sirit will be easier for you to imagine than for me to   express the pleasure which your very kind letter has given me not   only on account of its gratifying intelligence but also as   introductory to an acquaintance which i have been taught to value and   have

disappointment i should feel highly honoured in mr bs permission to make his acquaintance and there you are in my debt for it is a promise of last summer which i still hope to see performed yesterday

educated at westminster and christ church weimar and paris he soon showed his taste for literature at the age of seventeen he had translated a play from the french and written a farce a comedy called the east indian acted at drury lane april 22 1799 two volumes of a novel two of a romance besides numerous poems life etc of m g lewis vol i p 70 in 1794 he was attached to the british embassy at the hague there stimulated ibid vol i p 123 by reading mrs radcliffes mysteries of udolpho he wrote ambrosio or the monk the book published in 1795 made him famous in fashionable society and decided his career though he sat in parliament for hindon from 1796 to 1802 he took no part in politics but devoted himself to literature  the moral and outline of the monk are taken as lewis says in a letter to his father life etc vol i pp 154158 and as was pointed out in the monthly review for august 1797 from addisons santon barsisa in the guardian no 148 the book was severely criticized on the score of immorality mathias pursuits of literature dialogue iv attacks lewis whom he compares to john cleland whose memoirs of a woman of pleasure came under the notice of the law courts    another cleland see in lewis rise   why sleep the ministers of truth and law  an injunction was in fact moved for against the book but the proceedings dropped  lewis had a remarkable gift of catching the popular taste of the day both in his tales of horror and mystery and in his ballads in the latter he was the precursor of scott many of his songs were sung to music of his own composition his tales of terror 1799 were dedicated to lady charlotte campbell afterwards bury with whom he was in love to his tales of wonder 1801 scott southey and others contributed his most successful plays were the castle spectre drury lane december 14 1797 and timour the tartar covent garden april 29 1811  in 1812 by the death of his father the monk became a rich man and the owner of plantations in the west indies he paid two visits to his property in 181516 and 181718 on the voyage home from the last visit he died of yellow fever and was buried at sea his journal of a west indian proprietor published in 1834 is written in sterling english with much quiet humour and a graphic power of very high order  among his detached thoughts byron has the following notes on lewis    sheridan was one day offered a bet by m g lewis i will bet you   mr sheridan a very large sumi will bet you what you owe me as   manager for my castle spectre    i never make large bets said sheridan but i will lay you a   very small one i will bet you what it is worth    lewis though a kind man hated sheridan and we had some words upon   that score when in switzerland in 1816 lewis afterwards sent me the   following epigram upon sheridan from saint maurice      for worst abuse of finest parts     was misophil begotten     there might indeed be blacker hearts     but none could be more rotten    lewis at oatlands was observed one morning to have his eyes red and   his air sentimental being asked why he replied that when people   said anything kind to him it affected him deeply and just now the   duchess had said something so kind to himhere tears began to flow   again never mind lewis said col armstrong to him never   minddont cry she could not mean it    lewis was a good mana clever man but a borea damned bore one   may say my only revenge or consolation used to be setting him by the   ears with some vivacious person who hated bores especiallyme de   sta√´l or hobhouse for example but i liked lewis he was a jewel of a   man had he been better set i dont mean personally but less   tiresome for he was tedious as well as contradictory to everything   and everybody being shortsighted when we used to ride out together   near the brenta in the twilight in summer he made me go before to   pilot him i am absent at times especially towards evening and the   consequence of this pilotage was some narrow escapes to the monk on   horseback once i led him into a ditch over which i had passed as   usual forgetting to warn my convoy once i led him nearly into the   river instead of on the moveable bridge which incommodes   passengers and twice did we both run against the diligence which   being heavy and slow did communicate less damage than it received in   its leaders who were terrass√©d by the charge thrice did i lose him   in the gray of the gloaming and was obliged to bring to to his   distant signals of distance and distress all the time he went on   talking without intermission for he was a man of many words poor   fellow he died a martyr to his new richesof a second visit to   jamaica      id give the lands of deloraine     dark musgrave were alive again       that is     i would give many a sugar cane     monk lewis were alive again    lewis said to me why do you talk venetian such as i could   talk not very fine to be sure to the venetians and not the usual   italian i answered partly from habit and partly to be understood   if possible it may be so said lewis but it sounds to me like   talking with a brogue to an irishman  in a ms note by sir walter scott on these passages from byrons detached thoughts he says    mat had queerish eyes they projected like those of some insect and   were flattish in their orbit his person was extremely small and   boyish he was indeed the least man i ever saw to be strictly well   and neatly made i remember a picture of him by saunders being handed   round at dalkeith house the artist had ungenerously flung a dark   folding mantle round the form under which was half hid a dagger or   dark lanthorn or some such cutthroat appurtenance with all this the   features were preserved and ennobled it passed from hand to hand into   that of henry duke of buccleuch who hearing the general voice   affirm that it was very like said aloud like mat lewis why that   picture is like a man he looked and lo mat lewiss head was at   his elbow his boyishness went through life with him he was a child   and a spoiled child but a child of high imagination so that he   wasted himself in ghost stories and german nonsense he had the finest   ear for the rhythm of verse i ever heardfiner than byrons    lewis was fonder of great people than he ought to have been either   as a man of talent or a man of fortune he had always dukes and   duchesses in his mouth and was particularly fond of any one who had a   title you would have sworn he had been a parvenu of yesterday yet   he had been all his life in good society    he was one of the kindest and best creatures that ever lived his   father and mother lived separately mr lewis allowed his son a   handsome income but reduced it more than one half when he found that   he gave his mother half of it he restricted himself in all his   expenses and shared the diminished income with his mother as before   he did much good by stealth and was a most generous creature    i had a good picture drawn me i think by thos thomson of fox in   his latter days suffering the fatigue of an attack from lewis the   great statesman was become bulky and lethargic and lay like a fat ox   which for sometime endures the persecution of a buzzing fly rather   than rise to get rid of it and then at last he got up and heavily   plodded his way to the other side of the room  referring to byrons story of lewis near the brenta scott adds    i had a worse adventure with mat lewis i had been his guide from the   cottage i then had at laswade to the chapel of roslin we were to go   up one side of the river and come down the other in the return he was   dead tired and like the israelites he murmured against his guide   for leading him into the wilderness i was then as strong as a poney   and took him on my back dressed as he was in his shooting array of a   close skyblue jacket and the brightest red pantaloons i ever saw   on a human breech he also had a kind of feather in his cap at last i   could not help laughing at the ridiculous figure we must both have   made at which my rider waxed wroth it was an illchosen hour and   place for i could have served him as wallace did fawdenthrown him   down and twisted his head off we returned to the cottage weary   wights and it cost more than one glass of noyau which he liked in a   decent way to get mats temper on its legs again   footnote 5 the bride of

do this   turn    in the debate or rather discussion afterwards in the house of   lords upon that very question i sate immediately behind lord moira   who was extremely annoyed at gs speech upon the subject and while   g was speaking turned round to me repeatedly and asked me whether i   agreed with him it was an awkward question to me who had not heard   both sides moira kept repeating to me it was not so it was so   and so etc i did not know very well what to think but i   sympathized with the acuteness of his feelings upon the subject    lord eldon affects an imitation of two very different   chancellorsthurlow and loughboroughand can indulge in an oath now   and then on one of the debates on the catholic question when we were   either equal or within one i forget which i had been sent for in   great haste from a ball which i quitted i confess somewhat   reluctantly to emancipate five millions of people i came in late   and did not go immediately into the body of the house but stood just   behind the woolsack eldon turned round and catching my eye   immediately said to a peer who had come to him for a few minutes on   the woolsack as is the custom of his friends damn them theyll   have it now by godthe vote that is just come in will give it   them   footnote 11 horace odes iii iii 7                                               wednesday 24   no dreams last night

to gibbon february 5 1793 says as to windham i should think he is become the best at least the most sensible speaker of the whole his love of paradox combined with his political independence and irresolution gained him the name of weathercock windham but he was respected by both sides as an honest politician outside the house it was his ambition to be known as a thorough englishmana patron of

neither thanks to stupor two letters one from the other from lady melbourneboth excellent in their respective styless contained also a very pretty lyric on concealed griefs if not her own yet very like her why did she not say that the stanzas were or were not of her own composition i do not know whether to wish them hers or not i have no great esteem for poetical persons particularly women they have so much of the ideal in practics as well as ethics  i have been thinking lately a good deal of mary duff how very odd that i should have been so utterly devotedly fond of that girl at an age when i could neither feel passion nor know the meaning of the word and the effect my mother used always to rally me about this childish amour and at last many years after when i was sixteen she told me one day oh byron i have had a letter from edinburgh from miss abercromby and your old sweetheart mary duff is married to a mr coe and what was my answer i really cannot explain or account for my feelings at that moment but they nearly threw me into convulsions and alarmed my mother so much that after i grew better she generally avoided the subjectto meand contented herself with telling it to all her acquaintance now what could this be i had never seen her since her mothers faux pas at aberdeen had been the cause of her removal to her grandmothers at banff we were both the merest children i had and have been attached fifty times since that period yet i recollect all we said to each other all our caresses her features my restlessness sleeplessness my tormenting my mothers maid to write for me to her which she at last did to quiet me poor nancy thought i was wild and as i could not write for myself became my secretary i remember too our walks and the happiness of sitting by mary in the childrens apartment at their house not far from the plainstanes at aberdeen while her lesser sister helen played with the doll and we sat gravely making love in our way  how the deuce did all this occur so early where could it originate i certainly had no sexual ideas for years afterwards and yet my misery my love for that girl were so violent that i sometimes doubt if i have ever been really attached since be that as it may hearing of her marriage several years after was like a thunderstrokeit nearly choked meto the horror of my mother and the astonishment and almost incredulity of every body and it is a phenomenon in my existence for i was not eight years old which has puzzled and will puzzle me to the latest hour of it and lately i know not why the recollection not the attachment has recurred as forcibly as ever i wonder if she can have the least remembrance of it or me or remember her pitying sister helen for not having an admirer too how very pretty is the perfect image of her in my memoryher brown dark hair and hazel eyes her very dress i should be quite grieved to see her now the reality however beautiful would destroy or at least confuse the features of the lovely peri which then existed in her and still lives in my imagination at the distance of more than sixteen years i am now twentyfive and odd months  i think my mother told the circumstances on my hearing of her marriage to the parkynses and certainly to the pigot family and probably mentioned it in her answer to miss a who was well acquainted with my childish penchant and had sent the news on purpose for meand thanks to her  next to the beginning the conclusion has often occupied my reflections in the way of investigation that the facts are thus others know as well as i and my memory yet tells me so in more than a whisper but the more i reflect the more i am bewildered to assign any cause for this precocity of affection  lord holland invited me to dinner today but three days dining would destroy me so without eating at all since yesterday i went to my box at covent garden  sawlooking very pretty though quite a different style of beauty from the other two she has the finest eyes in the

been pondering on the miseries of separation thatoh how seldom we see those we love yet we live ages in moments when met the only thing that consoles me during absence is the reflection that no mental or personal estrangement from ennui or disagreement can take place and when people meet hereafter even though many changes may have taken place in the mean time still unless they are tired of each other they are ready to reunite and do not blame each other for the circumstances that severed them                                               saturday 27  i believe or rather am in doubt which is

morning post hath laid to my charge but of which i cannot even guess the author i wonder what they will next inflict upon me they cannot well sink below a melodrama but that is better than a satire at least a personal one with which i stand truly arraigned and in atonement of which i am resolved to bear silently all criticisms abuses and even praises for bad pantomimes never composed by me without even a contradictory aspect i suppose the root of this report is my loan to the manager of my turkish drawings for his dresses to which he was more welcome than to my name i suppose the real author will soon own it as it has succeeded if not job be my model and lethe my beverage  has received the portrait safe and in answer the only remark she makes upon it is indeed it is likeand again indeed it is like with her the likeness covered a multitude of sins for i happen to know that this portrait was not a flatterer but dark and sterneven black as the mood in which my mind was scorching last

of the critique on the stael 3  his grand essay on burke i hear is for the next number but i know nothing of the edinburgh or of any other review but from rumour and i have long ceased indeed i could not in justice complain of any even though i were to rate poetry in general and my rhymes in particular more highly than i really do to withdraw myself from myself oh that cursed selfishness has ever been my sole my entire my sincere motive in scribbling at all and publishing is also the continuance of the same object by the action it affords to the mind which else recoils upon itself if i valued fame i should flatter received opinions which have gathered strength by time and will yet wear longer than any living works to the contrary but for the soul of me i cannot and will not give the lie to my own thoughts and doubts come what may if i am a fool it is at least a doubting one and i envy no one the certainty of his selfapproved wisdom  all are inclined to believe what they covet from a

which byron alludes    greece the mother of freedom and of poetry in the west which had   long employed only the antiquary the artist and the philologist was   at length destined after an interval of many silent and inglorious   ages to awaken the genius of a poet full of enthusiasm for those   perfect forms of heroism and liberty which his imagination had placed   in the recesses of antiquity he gave vent to his impatience of the   imperfections of living men and real institutions in an original   strain of sublime satire which clothes moral anger in imagery of an   almost horrible grandeur and which though it cannot coincide with   the estimate of reason yet could only flow from that worship of   perfection which is the soul of all true poetry  edin rev vol xxii p 37   footnote 3    in

people to lie to make us their friendthat is their concern  is i hear thriving on the repute of a pun which was mine at mackintoshs dinner some time back on ward who was asking how much it would take

in the united states these are the first tidings that have ever sounded like fame to my earsto be redde on the banks of the ohio the greatest pleasure i ever derived of this kind was from an extract in cooke the actors life from his journal 1 stating that in the readingroom at albany near washington he perused english bards and scotch reviewers to be popular in a rising and far country has a kind of posthumous feel very different from the ephemeral √©clat and f√™teing buzzing and partying compliments of the welldressed multitude i can safely say that during my reign in the spring of 1812 i regretted nothing but its duration of six weeks instead of a fortnight and was heartily glad to resign  last night i supped with lewis and as usual though i neither exceeded in solids nor fluids have been half dead ever since my stomach is entirely destroyed by long abstinence and the rest will probably follow let iti only wish the pain over the leap in the dark is the least to be dreaded  the

and soi was not at home  galt calledmemto ask some one to speak to raymond in favour of his play we are old fellowtravellers and with all his eccentricities he has much strong sense experience of the world and is as far as i have seen a goodnatured philosophical fellow i showed him sligos letter on the reports of the turkish girls aventure at athens soon after it happened he and lord holland lewis and moore and rogers and lady melbourne have seen it murray has a copy i thought it had been unknown and wish it were but sligo arrived only some days after and the rumours are the subject of his letter that i shall preserveit is as well lewis and gait were both horrified and l wondered i did not introduce the situation into the giaour he may wonderhe might wonder more at that productions being written at all but to describe the feelings of that situation were impossibleit is icy even to recollect them  the bride of abydos was published on thursday the second of december but how it is liked or disliked i know not whether it succeeds or not is no fault of the public against whom i can have no complaint but i am much more indebted to the tale than i can ever be to the most partial reader as it wrung my thoughts from reality to imaginationfrom selfish regrets to vivid recollectionsand recalled me to a country replete with the brightest and darkest but always most lively colours of my memory sharpe called but was not let in which i regret  saw rogers yesterday i have not kept my appointment at middleton which has not pleased him perhaps and my projected voyage with ward will perhaps please him less but i wish to keep well with both they are instruments that dont do in concert but surely their separate tones are very musical and i wont give up either  it is well if i dont

or herself and i am not except in soliloquy as now much enamoured of either subjectespecially ones works what the devil shall i say about de lallemagne i like it prodigiously but unless i can twist my admiration into some fantastical expression she wont believe me and i know by experience i shall be overwhelmed with fine things about rhyme etc etc the lover mrrocca was there tonight and csaid it

understands german and is consequently a fair judge and secondly he is firstrate and consequently the best of judges i reverence and admire him but i wont give up my opinionwhy should i i read her

footnote 2 in byrons detached thoughts 1821 occurs this passage    in general i do not draw well with literary men not that i dislike   them but i never know what to say to them after i have praised their   last publication there are several exceptions to be sure but then   they have always been men of the world such as scott and moore etc   or visionaries out of it such as shelley etc but your literary   everyday man and i never went well in company especially your   foreigner whom i never could abideexcept giordani andandand   i really cant name any other i do not remember a man amongst them   whom i ever wished to see twice except perhaps mezzophanti who is   a monster of languages the briareus of parts of speech a walking   polyglott and morewho ought to have existed at the time of

scott makes the following note    i suspect lord byron of some selfdeceit as to this matter it   appears that he liked extremely the only firstrate men of letters   into whose society he happened to be thrown in england they happened   to be men of the world it is true but how few men of very great   eminence in literature how few intellectually lord bs peers have   not been men of the world does any one doubt that the topics he had   most pleasure in discussing with scott or moore were literary ones or   had at least some relation to literature    as for the foreign literati pray what literati anything like his   own rank did he encounter abroad i have no doubt he would have been   as much at home with an alfieri a schiller or a goethe or a   voltaire as he was with scott or moore and yet two of these were   very little of men of the world in the sense in which he uses that   phrase    as to everyday men of letters pray who does like their company   would a clever man like a

   a gross blunder of the english public has been talking of burns as if   the character of his poetry ought to be estimated with an eternal   recollection that he was a peasant it would be just as proper to   say that lord byron ought always to be thought of as a peer rank in   life was nothing to either in his true moments then they were both   great poets some silly and sickly affectations connected with the   accidents of birth and breeding may be observed in both when they are   not under the influence of the happier star witness burnss prate   about independence when he was an

days i saw lewis today who is just returned from oatlands where he has been squabbling with mad de stael about himself clarissa harlowe mackintosh and me my homage has never been paid in that quarter or we would have agreed still worse i dont talki cant flatter and wont listen except to a pretty or a foolish woman she bored lewis with praises of himself till he sickenedfound out that clarissa was perfection and mackintosh the first man in england there i agree at least one of the firstbut lewis did not as to clarissa i leave to those who can read it to judge and dispute i could not do the one and am consequently not qualified for the other she told lewis wisely he being my friend that i was affected in the first place and that in the next place i committed the heinous offence of sitting at dinner with my eyes shut or half shut i wonder if i really have this trick i must cure myself of it if true one insensibly acquires awkward habits which should be broken in time if this is one i wish i had been told of it before it would not so much signify if one was always to be checkmated by a plain woman but one may as well see some of ones neighbours as well as the plate upon the table  i should like of all things to have heard the amab√¶an eclogue between her and lewisboth obstinate clever odd garrulous and shrill in fact one could have heard nothing else but they fell out alasand now they will never quarrel again could not one reconcile them for the nonce poor corinneshe will find that some of her fine sayings wont suit our fine ladies and gentlemen  i am getting rather into admiration of lady c annesley the youngest sister of lady f webster a wife would be my salvation i am sure the wives of my acquaintances have hitherto done me little good catherine is beautiful but very young and i think a fool but i have not seen enough to judge besides i hate an esprit in petticoats that she wont love me is very probable nor shall i love her but on my system and the modern system in general that dont signify the business if it came to business would probably be arranged between papa and me she would have her own way i am goodhumoured to women and docile and if i did not fall in love with her which i should try to prevent we should be a very comfortable couple as to conduct that she must look to but if i love i shall be jealousand for that reason i will not be in love though after all i doubt my temper and fear i should not be so patient as becomes the biens√©ance of a married man in my station divorce ruins the poor femme and damages are a paltry compensation i do fear my temper would lead me into some of our oriental tricks of vengeance or at any rate into a summary appeal to the court of twelve paces so ill none ont but een remain single and solitarythough i should like to have somebody now and then to yawn with one  ward and after him has stolen one of my buffooneries about mde de staels metaphysics and the fog and passed it by speech and letter as their

him i hate odds and wish he may beat them as for me by the blessing of indifference i have simplified my politics into an utter detestation of all existing governments and as it is the shortest and most agreeable and summary feeling imaginable the first moment of an universal republic would convert me into an advocate for single and uncontradicted despotism the fact is riches are power and poverty is slavery all over the earth and one sort of establishment is no better nor worse for a people than another i shall adhere to my party because it would not be honourable to act otherwise but as to opinions i dont think politics worth an opinion conduct is another thingif you begin with a party go on with them i have no consistency except in politics and that probably arises from my

exaggeration or diminution kembles hamlet is perfectbut hamlet is not nature richard is a man and kean is richard now to my own concerns  went to waites teeth are all right and white but he says that i grind them in my sleep and chip the edges that same sleep is no friend of mine though i court him sometimes for half the twentyfour    footnote 1 edmund kean 17871833 after acting in provincial theatres appeared at the haymarket in june 1806 as ganem in the mountaineers but again returned to the country his performance of shylock in the merchant of venice at drury lane on january 26 1814 made him famous he appeared in richard iii on february 12 and still further increased his reputation  in the courier february 26 1814 appears this paragraph    mr keans attraction is unprecedented in the annals of   theatricalseven cookes performances are left at an immeasurable   distance his first three nights of richard produced upwards of   ¬£1800 and on repeating that character on thursday night for the   fourthth sic time the receipts were upwards of ¬£700  on march 1 the same paper says    drury lane theatre again overflowed last night at an early hour   such is the continued and increasing attraction of that truly great   actor mr kean  after the retirement of john kemble june 23 1817 he had no rival on the stage especially in such parts as othello lear hamlet sir giles overreach and the two already mentioned his last appearance on the stage was in othello at covent garden march 25 1833    to see kean act said coleridge is like reading shakespeare by   flashes of lightning    garricks nature writes leigh hunt in the tatler july 25 1831   displaced quins formalism and in precisely the same way did kean   displace kemble  everything with kemble was literally a   personationit was a mask and a soundingpipe it was all external   and artificial keans face is full of light and shade his tones   vary his voice trembles his eye glistens sometimes with a withering   scorn sometimes with a tear  it was the realism and nature of kean which so strongly appealed to byron and enabled the actor to the last in spite of his drunken habits poor figure and weak voice to sway his audiences the same qualities at first repelled more timid critics and perhaps justified hazlitts saying that kean was not much relished in the upper circles miss berry for example who saw him in all his principal parts in 1814in richard iii hamlet othello and sir giles overreachremained cold    his richard iii pleased me but i was not enthusiastic his   expression of the passions is natural and strong but i do not like   his declamation his voice naturally not agreeable becomes   monotonous  diary vol iii p 7 of his hamlet she says    to my mind he is without grace and without elevation of mind because   he never seems to rise with the poet in those sublime passages which   abound in hamlet  ibid p 9 miss berrys criticism is supported by good authority lewes on actors and the art of acting pp 6 11 while calling him a consummate master of passionate expression denies his capacity for representing the intellectual side of heroism  kean preferred the coalhole tavern in the strand and the society of the wolf club to lord hollands dinnerparties though he never fell so low as cooke his recklessness irregularities eccentricities and habits of drinking in spite of the large sums of money that passed through his hands made his closing days neither prosperous nor reputable  such effect had the passionate energy of keans acting on byrons mind that once in seeing him play sir giles overreach he was so affected as to be seized with a sort of convulsive fit some years later in italy when the representation of alfieris tragedy of mirra had agitated him in the same violent manner he compared the two instances as the only ones in his life when any thing under reality had been able to move him so powerfully    to such lengths says moore did he at this time carry his   enthusiasm for kean that when miss oneil appeared and by her   matchless representation of feminine tenderness attracted all eyes   and hearts he was not only a little jealous of her reputation as   interfering with that of his favourite but in order to guard himself   against the risk of becoming a convert refused to go to see her act   i endeavoured sometimes to persuade him into witnessing at least one   of her performances but his answer was punning upon shakspeares   word unanealed noi am resolved to continue unoneiled     in his detached thoughts 1821 byron says    of actors cooke was the most natural kemble the most supernatural   kean the medium between the two but mrs siddons was worth them all   put together

for beyond his circle  an invitation to dine at holland house to meet kean he is worth meeting and i hope by getting into good society he will be prevented from falling like cooke he is greater now on the stage and off he should never be less there is a stupid and underrating criticism upon him in one of the newspapers i thought that last night though great he rather underacted more than the first time this may be the effect of these cavils but i hope he has more sense than to mind them he cannot expect to maintain his present eminence or to advance still higher without the envy of his greenroom fellows and the nibbling of their admirers but if he dont beat them all why thenmerit hath no purchase in these costermonger days 1  i wish that i had a talent for the drama i would write a tragedy now but noit is gone hodgson talks of onehe will do it welland i think me moore should try he has wonderful powers and much variety besides he has lived and felt to write so as to bring home

next heir the hon newton fellowes but lord chancellor eldon decided that lord portsmouth was capable of entering into the marriage contract and managing his own affairs the commission was however ultimately granted byron swore an affidavit on the first occasion    denman mentioned lord byrons affidavit about lord portsmouth as a   proof of the influence of hanson over him lord b swearing that lord   p had rather a superior mind than otherwise  memoirs etc of thomas moore vol vi p 47  the following is the note which byron sent hanson to embody in his affidavit    i have been acquainted with mr hanson and his family for many years   he is my solicitor about the beginning of march last he sent to me to   ask my opinion on the subject of lord portsmouth who as i understood   from mr h was paying great attention to his eldest daughter he   stated to me that mr newton fellowes with whom i have no personal   acquaintance was particularly desirous that lord portsmouth should   marry some elderly woman of his mr fellowess selectionthat the   title and family estates might thereby devolve on mr f or his   children but that lord p had expressed a dislike to old women and a   desire to choose for himself i told mr hanson that if miss hansons   affections were not preengaged and lord portsmouth appeared attached   to her there could be in my opinion no objection to the match i   think but cannot be positive that i saw lord portsmouth at mr   hansons two or three times previous to the marriage but i had no   conversation with him upon it    the night before the ceremony i received an invitation from mr   hanson requesting me as a friend of the family to be present at the   marriage which was to take place next morning i went next morning to   bloomsbury square where i found the parties lady portsmouth with   her brother and sister and another gentleman went in the carriage to   st georges church lord portsmouth and myself walked as the   carriage was full and the distance short on my way lord portsmouth   told me that he had been partial to miss hanson from her childhood   and that since she grew up and more particularly subsequent to the   decease of the late lady p this partiality had become attachment   and that he thought her calculated to make him an excellent wife i   was present at the ceremony and gave away the bride lord portsmouths   behaviour seemed to me perfectly calm and rational on the occasion he   seemed particularly attentive to the priest and gave the responses   audibly and very distinctly i remarked this because in ordinary   conversation his lordship has a hesitation in his speech after the   ceremony we returned to mr hansons whence i believe they went   into the countrywhere i did not accompany them since their return i   have occasionally seen lord and lady portsmouth in bloomsbury square   they appeared very happy i have never been very intimate with his   lordship and am therefore unqualified to give a decided opinion of   his general conduct but had i considered him insane i should have   advised mr hanson when he consulted me on the subject not to permit   the marriage his preference of a young woman to an old one and of   his own wishes to those of a younger brother seemed to me neither   irrational nor extraordinary  there is nothing in the note itself or in the draft affidavit to bear out moores report of denmans statement  byron according to the account given by newton hanson is wrong in saying that mrs hanson approved of the marriage on the contrary it was the cause of her death a fortnight later in 1828 the marriage was annulled a jury having decided that lord portsmouth was non compos mentis when he contracted it   footnote 2 francesco morosini 16181694 occupied the morea for venice

parliamentary reform and a vigorous critic of naval administration in february 1814 he had been appointed to the tonnant for the american station and it was while he was on a weeks leave of absence in london before sailing that the stockjobbing hoax occurred  during the days february 826 1814 it seemed possible that napoleon might defeat the allied armies and the funds were sensitive to every rumour at midnight on sunday february 20 a man calling himself du bourg brought news to admiral foley at dover that napoleon had been killed by a party of cossacks hurrying towards london du bourg whose real name was berenger spread the news as he went arrived in london soon after daybreak he went to cochranes house and there changed his uniform when the stock exchange opened at ten on february 21 1814 the funds rose rapidly and among those who sold on the rise was cochrane the next day when the swindle had been discovered the stocks fell  a stock exchange committee sat to investigate the case and their report march 7 threw grave suspicion on cochrane he his uncle cochrane johnstone a mr butt and berenger were indicted for a conspiracy tried before lord ellenborough june 89 and convicted cochrane was sentenced to a years imprisonment and a fine of ¬£1000 on the back of the note for ¬£1000 still kept in the bank of england with which he paid his fine on july 3 1815 he wrote    my health having suffered by long and close confinement and my   oppressors being resolved to deprive me of property or life i submit   to robbery to protect myself from murder in the hope that i shall   live to bring the delinquents to justice  cochrane was also expelled from the house of commons and from the order of the bath there is little doubt that the circumstances were extremely suspicious those who wish to form an opinion as to cochranes guilt or innocence will find the subject of the trial exhaustively treated in mr jb atlays lord cochranes trial before lord ellenborough

he speaks of byron thus    your friend lord b is in my opinion a singularly agreeable   person which is very rarely the case with eminent men his   independent principles give him a great additional charm  but the part which brougham played in the separation both as counsel and in society infuriated byron who wrote of him in his letters with the utmost bitterness see also the passage now for the

natural gaiety irresistible sir joshua reynolds preferred her to all other actresses as a being who ran upon the stage as a playground and laughed from sincere wildness of delight in genteel comedy critics like genest english stage vol viii p 431 and leigh hunt dramatic essays ed 1894 p 82 agree that she failed perhaps as the latter suggests because she was so perpetually employed in broad and romping characters  in private life mrs jordan was chiefly known as the mistress of the duke of clarence to whom she bore ten children she died at st cloud july 3 1816  the play acted at covent garden

poems by w r spencer vol 67 1812 pp 5460  art vii poems by william robert spencer 8vo 10s boards cadell and davies 1811  the author of this wellprinted volume has more than once been introduced to our readers and is known to rank among that class of poetical persons who have never been highly favoured by stern criticism the mob of gentlemen who write with ease has indeed of late years like other mobs become so importunate as to threaten an alarming rivalry to the regular body of writers who are not fortunate enough to be either easy or genteel hence the jaundiced eye with which the real author regards the red morocco binding of the presumptuous litt√©rateur we say the binding for into the book itself he cannot condescend to look at least not beyond the frontispieceinto mr spencers volume however he may dip farther and will find sufficient to give him pleasure or pain in proportion to his own candour it consists chiefly of vers de soci√©t√© calculated to prove very delightful to a large circle of fashionable acquaintance and pleasing to a limited number of vulgar purchasers these last indeed may be rude enough to expect something more for their specie during the present scarcity of change than lines to young poets and poetesses epitaphs upon years poems to my grammatical niece epistle from sister dolly in cascadia to sister tanny in snowdonia etc but we doubt not that a long list of persons of quality wit and honour in town and country who are here addressed will be highly pleased with themselves and with the poet who has shewn them off in a very handsome volume as will doubtless the butterfly at the end of winter provided that he is fortunate enough to survive the present inclemencies we are however by no means convinced that the bellman will relish mr ss usurpation of a christmas carol which looks so very like his own that we advise him immediately to put in his claim and it will be universally allowed  with the exception of these and similar productions the volume contains poems eminently beautiful some which have been already published and others that are well worthy of present publication of leonora with which it opens we made our report many years ago in vol xx ns p 451 but our readers perhaps will not be sorry to see another short extract we presume that they are well acquainted with the story and therefore select one of the central passages    see where fresh bloodgouts mat the green     yon wheel its reeking points advance   there by the moons wan light half seen     grim ghosts of tombless murderers dance   come spectres of the guilty dead     with us your goblin morris ply   come all in festive dance to tread     ere on the bridal couch we lie    forward th obedient phantoms push     their trackless footsteps rustle near   in sound like autumn winds that rush     through withering oak or beechwood sere   with lightnings force the courser flies     earth shakes his thundring hoofs beneath   dust stones and sparks in whirlwind rise     and horse and horseman heave for breath    swift roll the moonlight scenes away     hills chasing hills successive fly   een stars that pave th eternal way     seem shooting to a backward sky   fearst thou my love the moon shines clear     hurrah how swiftly speed the dead   the dead does leonora fear     oh god oh leave oh leave the dead  such a specimen of the terrible will place the merit of the poem in a proper point of view but we do not think that some of the alterations in this copy of leonora are altogether so judicious as mr ss wellknown taste had led us to expect reviving friendship p 5 is perhaps less expressive than relenting as it once stood and the phrase ten thousand furlowed heroes ibid throws a new light on the heroic character it is extremely proper that heroes should have furlows since schoolboys have holidays and lawyers have long vacations but we very much question whether young gentlemen of the scholastic legal or heroic calling would be flattered by any epithet derived from the relaxation of their respectable pursuits we should feel some hesitation in telling an interesting youth of any given battalion from portugal that he was a furlowed hero lest he should prove to us that his furlow had by no means impaired his heroism the old epithet warworn was more adapted to heroism and to poetry and if we mistake not it has very recently been superseded by an epithet which precludes otium cum dignitate from the soldier without imparting either ease or dignity to the verse why is horse and horsemen pant for breath changed to heave for breath unless for the alliteration of the too tempting aspirate heaving is appropriate enough to coals and to sighs but panting belongs to successful lovers and spirited horses and why should mr ss horse and horseman not have panted as heretofore  the next poem in arrangement as well as in merit is the year of sorrow to which we offered a tribute of praise in our 45th vol ns p 288we are sorry to observe that the compliment paid to mr wedgewood by a late traveller see note p 50 viz that an englishman in journeying from calais to ispahan may have his dinner served every day on wedgewoods ware is no longer a matter of fact it has lately been the good or evil fortune of one of our travelling department to pass near to calais and to have journeyed through divers paynim lands to no very remote distance from ispahan and neither in the palace of the pacha nor in the caravanserai of the traveller nor in the hut of the peasant was he so favoured as to masticate his pilaff from that fashionable service such is in this and numerous other instances the altered state of the continent and of europe since the annotation of the late traveller and on the authority of a later we must report that the ware has been all broken since the former passed that way we wish that we could efficiently exhort mr wedgewood to send out a fresh supply on all the turnpike roads by the route of bagdad for the convenience of the latest travellers  passing over the chorus from euripides which might as well have slept in quiet with the rest of the authors schoolexercises we come to the visionary which we gladly extract as a very elegant specimen of the lighter poems    when midnight oer the moonless skies     her pall of transient death has spread   when mortals sleep when spectres rise     and nought is wakeful but the dead    no bloodless shape my way pursues     no sheeted ghost my couch annoys   visions more sad my fancy views     visions of long departed joys    the shade of youthful hope is there     that lingerd long and latest died   ambition all dissolved to air     with phantom honours at her side    what empty shadows glimmer nigh     they once were friendship truth and love   oh die to thought to memry die     since lifeless to my heart ye prove  we cannot forbear adding the beautiful stanzas in pages 166 167    to the lady anne hamilton    too late i staid forgive the crime     unheeded flew the hours   how noiseless falls the foot of time     that only treads on flowrs    what eye with clear account remarks     the ebbing of his glass   when all its sands are dimond sparks     that dazzle as they pass    ah who to sober measurement     times happy swiftness brings   when birds of paradise have lent     their plumage for his wings  the far greater part of the volume however contains pieces which can be little gratifying to the publicsome are pretty and all are besprinkled with gems and roses and birds and diamonds and such like cheap poetical adornments as are always to be obtained at no great expense of thought or of metreit is happy for the author that these bijoux are presented to persons of high degree countesses foreign and domestic maids of honour to louisa landgravine of hesse darmstadt lady blank and lady asterisk besides and and others anonymous who are exactly the kind of people to be best pleased with these sparkling shining fashionable trifles we will solace our readers with three stanzas of the soberest of these odes    addressed to lady susan fincastle now countess of dunmore    what ails you fancy youre become     colder than truth than reason duller   your wings are worn your chirpings dumb     and evry plume has lost its colour    you droop like geese whose cacklings cease     when dire st michael they remember   or like some bird who just has heard     that fins preparing for september    can you refuse your sweetest spell     when i for susans praise invoke you   what sulkier still you pout and swell     as if that lovely name would choke you  we are to suppose that fin preparing for september is the lady with whose lovely name fancy runs some risk of being choked and really if killing partridges formed a part of her ladyships accomplishments both fancy and feeling were in danger of a quinsey indeed the whole of these stanzas are couched in that most exquisite irony in which mr s has more than once succeeded all the songs to persons of quality seem to be written on that purest model the song by a person of quality whose stanzas have not been fabricated in vain this sedulous imitation extends even to the praise of things inanimate    when an eden zephyr hovers     oer a slumbring cherubs lyre   or when sighs of seraph lovers     breathe upon th unfingerd wire  if nambypamby still leads to distinction mr s like ambrose phillips will be preferred for wit    heavn must heara bloom more tender     seems to tint the wreath of may   lovelier beams the noonday splendour     brighter dewdrops gem the spray    is the breath of angels moving     oer each flowrets heightend hue   are their smiles the day improving     have their tears enrichd the dew  here we have angels tears and breath and smiles and eden zephyrs sighs of seraph lovers and lyres of slumbering cherubs dancing away to the pedal harp how strange it is that thomson in his stanzas on the √Üolian lyre see the castle of indolence never dreamed of such things but left all these prettinesses to the last of the cruscanti  one of the best pieces in the volume is an epistle to t moore esq which though disfigured with fiends on sulphur nurst and hells chillest winter poor toms acold and some other vagaries of the same sort forms a pleasant specimen of poetical friendshipwe give the last ten lines    the triflers think your varied powers   made only for lifes gala bowrs   to smooth reflections mentorfrown   or pillow joy on softer down   foolsyon blest orb not only glows   to chase the cloud or paint the rose   these are the pastimes of his might   earths torpid bosom drinks his light   find there his wondrous powrs true measure   death turnd to life and dross to treasure  we have now arrived at mr spencers french and italian poesy the former of which is written sometimes in new and sometimes in old french and occasionally in a kind of tongue neither old nor new we offer a sample of the two former    quest ce que cest que le genie    brillant est cet esprit priv√© de sentiment   mais ce nest quun soleil trop vif et trop constant   tendre est ce sentiment qu aucun esprit nanime   mais ce nest quun jour doux que trop de pluie abime   quand un brillant esprit de ses rares couleurs   orne du sentiment les aimables douleurs   un phenom√™ne en nait le plus beau de la vie   cest alors que les ris en se m√©lant aux pleurs   font ces iris de lame appell√™ le genie    cy gist un povre menestrel   occis par maint ennuict cruel   ne plains pas trop sa destin√©e   nest icy que son corps mortel   son ame est toujours √† gillwell   et nest ce pas l√† lelys√©√©  we think that mr spencers italian rhymes are better finished than his french and indeed the facility of composing in that most poetical of all languages must be obvious but as a composer in italian he and all other englishmen are much inferior to mr mathias it is very perceptible in many of mr ss smaller pieces that he has suffered his english versification to be vitiated with italian concetti and we should have been better pleased with his compositions in a foreign language had they not induced him to corrupt his mothertongue still we would by no means utterly proscribe these excursions into other languages though they remind us occasionally of that aspiring frenchman who placed in his grounds the following inscription in honour of shenstone and the leasowes    see this stone   for william shenstone   who planted groves rural   and wrote verse natural  the above lines were displayed by the worthy proprietor in the pride of his heart to all english travellers as a tribute of respect for the resemblance of his paternal chateau to the leasowes and a striking coincidence between shenstones versification and his ownwe do not mean to insinuate that mr spencers french verses cy gist un povre menestrel with an urn inscribed w r s at the top are precisely a return in kind for the quatrain above quoted but we place it as a beacon to all young gentlemen of poetical propensities on the french parnassus few would proceed better on the gallic pegasus than the anglotroubadour on ours  we now take our leave of mr spencer without being blind to his errors or insensible to his merits as a poet he may be placed rather below mr moore and somewhat above lord strangford and if his volume meet with half their number of purchasers he will have no reason to complain either of our judgment or of his own success                                               articles from the monthly review   2

volume professing in a moderately long titlepage to be illustrative of the untimely and unfortunate fate of many british poets might with great propriety include the author among the number for if his imitations of their different styles resemble the originals the consequent starvation of many british poets is a doom which is calculated to excite pity rather than surprize the book opens with a dedication to the present and a monody on the late duke of devonshire one of the neglected bards we presume on whom the author holds his inquest in which it were difficult to say whether the enlightened understanding of the living or the intellect of the deceased nobleman is more justly appreciated or more elegantly eulogized lest the monody should be mistaken for anything but itself of

none but reviewers ever will peruse them unless perhaps the unfortunate persons of quality whom he may henceforth single out as proper victims of future dedication though his dedications are enough to kill the living his anticipated monodies on the other hand must add considerably to the natural dread of death in such of his patrons as may be liable to common sense or to chronic diseases                                               appendix ii  parliamentary speeches  1 debate on the framework bill in the house of lords february 27 1812  the order of the day for the second reading of this bill being read  lord byron rose and for the first time addressed their lordships as follows  my lordsthe subject now submitted to your lordships for the first time though new to the house is by no means new to the country i believe it had occupied the serious thoughts of all descriptions of persons long before its introduction to the notice of that legislature whose interference alone could be of real service as a person in some degree connected with the suffering county though a stranger not only to this house in general but to almost every individual whose attention i presume to solicit i must claim some portion of your lordships indulgence whilst i offer a few observations on a question in which i confess myself deeply interested  to enter into any detail of the riots would be superfluous the house is already aware that every outrage short of actual bloodshed has been perpetrated and that the proprietors of the frames obnoxious to the rioters and all persons supposed to be connected with them have been liable to insult and violence during the short time i recently passed in nottinghamshire not twelve hours elapsed without some fresh act of violence and on the day i left the county i was informed that forty frames had been broken the preceding evening as usual without resistance and without detection  such was then the state of that county and such i have reason to believe it to be at this moment but whilst these outrages must be admitted to exist to an alarming extent it cannot be denied that they have arisen from circumstances of the most unparalleled distress the perseverance of these miserable men in their proceedings tends to prove that nothing but absolute want could have driven a large and once honest and industrious body of the people into the commission of excesses so hazardous to themselves their families and the community at the time to which i allude the town and county were burdened with large detachments of the military the police was in motion the magistrates assembled yet all the movements civil and military had led tonothing not a single instance had occurred of the apprehension of any real delinquent actually taken in the fact against whom there existed legal evidence sufficient for conviction but the police however useless were by no means idle several notorious delinquents had been detectedmen liable to conviction on the clearest evidence of the capital crime of poverty men who had been nefariously guilty of lawfully begetting several children whom thanks to the times they were unable to maintain considerable injury has been done to the proprietors of the improved frames these machines were to them an advantage inasmuch as they superseded the necessity of employing a number of workmen who were left in consequence to starve by the adoption of one species of frame in particular one man performed the work of many and the superfluous labourers were thrown out of employment yet it is to be observed that the work thus executed was inferior in quality not marketable at home and merely hurried over with a view to exportation it was called in the cant of the trade by the name of spiderwork the rejected workmen in the blindness of their ignorance instead of rejoicing at these improvements in arts so beneficial to mankind conceived themselves to be sacrificed to improvements in mechanism in the foolishness of their hearts they imagined that the maintenance and welldoing of the industrious poor were objects of greater consequence than the enrichment of a few individuals by any improvement in the implements of trade which threw the workmen out of employment and rendered the labourer unworthy of his hire and it must be confessed that although the adoption of the enlarged machinery in that state of our commerce which the country once boasted might have been beneficial to the master without being detrimental to the servant yet in the present situation of our manufactures rotting in warehouses without a prospect of exportation with the demand for work and workmen equally diminished frames of this description tend materially to aggravate the distress and discontent of the disappointed sufferers but the real cause of these distresses and consequent disturbances lies deeper when we are told that these men are leagued together not only for the destruction of their own comfort but of their very means of subsistence can we forget that it is the bitter policy the destructive warfare of the last eighteen years which has destroyed their comfort your comfort all mens comfort that policy which originating with great statesmen now no more has survived the dead to become a curse on the living unto the third and fourth generation these men never destroyed their looms till they were become useless worse than useless till they were become actual impediments to their exertions in obtaining their daily bread can you then wonder that in times like these when bankruptcy convicted fraud and imputed felony are found in a station not far beneath that of your lordships the lowest though once most useful portion of the people should forget their duty in their distresses and become only less guilty than one of their representatives but while the exalted offender can find means to baffle the law new capital punishments must be devised new snares of death must be spread for the wretched mechanic who is famished into guilt these men were willing to dig but the spade was in other hands they were not ashamed to beg but there was none to relieve them their own means of subsistence were cut off all other employments preoccupied and their excesses however to be deplored and condemned can hardly be subject of surprise  it has been stated that the persons in the temporary possession of frames connive at their destruction if this be proved upon inquiry it were necessary that such material accessories to the crime should be principals in the punishment but i did hope that any measure proposed by his majestys government for your lordships decision would have had conciliation for its basis or if that were hopeless that some previous inquiry some deliberation would have been deemed requisite not that we should have been called at once without examination and without cause to pass sentences by wholesale and sign deathwarrants blindfold but admitting that these men had no cause of complaint that the grievances of them and their employers were alike groundless that they deserved the worstwhat inefficiency what imbecility has been evinced in the method chosen to reduce them why were the military called out to be made a mockery of if they were to be called out at all as far as the difference of seasons would permit they have merely parodied the summer campaign of major sturgeon and indeed the whole proceedings civil and military seemed on the model of those of the mayor and corporation of garrattsuch marchings and countermarchings from nottingham to bullwell from bullwell to banford from banford to mansfield and when at length the detachments arrived at their destination in all the pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war they came just in time to witness the mischief which had been done and ascertain the escape of the perpetrators to collect the spolia opima in the fragments of broken frames and return to their quarters amidst the derision of old women and the hootings of children now though in a free country it were to be wished that our military should never be too formidable at least to ourselves i cannot see the policy of placing them in situations where they can only be made ridiculous as the sword is the worst argument that can be used so should it be the last in this instance it has been the first but providentially as yet only in the scabbard the present measure will indeed pluck it from the sheath yet had proper meetings been held in the earlier stages of these riots had the grievances of these men and their masters for they also had their grievances been fairly weighed and justly examined i do think that means might have been devised to restore these workmen to their avocations and tranquillity to the county at present the county suffers from the double infliction of an idle military and a starving population in what state of apathy have we been plunged so long that now for the first time the house has been officially apprised of these disturbances all this has been transacting within 130 miles of london and yet we good easy men have deemed full sure our greatness was aripening and have sat down to enjoy our foreign triumphs in the midst of domestic calamity but all the cities you have taken all the armies which have retreated before your leaders are but paltry subjects of selfcongratulation if your land divides against itself and your dragoons and your executioners must be let loose against your fellowcitizensyou call these men a mob desperate dangerous and ignorant and seem to think that the only way to quiet the bellua multorum capitum is to lop off a few of its superfluous heads but even a mob may be better reduced to reason by a mixture of conciliation and firmness than by additional irritation and redoubled penalties are we aware of our obligations to a mob it is the mob that labour in your fields and serve in your housesthat man your navy and recruit your armythat have enabled you to defy all the world and can also defy you when neglect and calamity have driven them to despair you may call the people a mob but do not forget that a mob too often speaks the sentiments of the people and here i must remark with what alacrity you are accustomed to fly to the succour of your distressed allies leaving the distressed of your own country to the care of providence orthe parish when the portuguese suffered under the retreat of the french every arm was stretched out every hand was opened from the rich mans largess to the widows mite all was bestowed to enable them to rebuild their villages and replenish their granaries and at this moment when thousands of misguided but most unfortunate fellowcountrymen are struggling with the extremes of hardships and hunger as your charity began abroad it should end at home a much less sum a tithe of the bounty bestowed on portugal even if those men which i cannot admit without inquiry could not have been restored to their employments would have rendered unnecessary the tender mercies of the bayonet and the gibbet but doubtless our friends have too many foreign claims to admit a prospect of domestic relief though never did such objects demand it i have traversed the seat of war in the peninsula i have been in some of the most oppressed provinces of turkey but never under the most despotic of infidel governments did i behold such squalid wretchedness as i have seen since my return in the very heart of a christian country and what are your remedies after months of inaction and months of action worse than inactivity at length comes forth the grand specific the neverfailing nostrum of all state physicians from the days of draco to the present time after feeling the pulse and shaking the head over the patient prescribing the usual course of warm water and bleedingthe warm water of your mawkish police and the lancets of your militarythese convulsions must terminate in death the sure consummation of the prescriptions of all political sangrados setting aside the palpable injustice and the certain inefficiency of the bill are there not capital punishments sufficient in your statutes is there not blood enough upon your penal code that more must be poured forth to ascend to heaven and testify against you how will you carry the bill into effect can you commit a whole county to their own prisons will you erect a gibbet in every field and hang up men like scarecrows or will you proceed as you must to bring this measure into effect by decimation place the county under martial law depopulate and lay waste all around you and restore sherwood forest as an acceptable gift to the crown in its former condition of a royal chase and an asylum for outlaws are these the remedies for a starving and desperate populace will the famished wretch who has braved your bayonets be appalled by your gibbets when death is a relief and the only relief it appears that you will afford him will he be dragooned into tranquillity will that which could not be effected by your grenadiers be accomplished by your executioners if you proceed by the forms of law where is your evidence  those who have refused to impeach their accomplices when transportation only was the punishment will hardly be tempted to witness against them when death is the penalty with all due deference to the noble lords opposite i think a little investigation some previous inquiry would induce even them to change their purpose that most favourite state measure so marvellously efficacious in many and recent instances temporising would not be without its advantages in this when a proposal is made to emancipate or relieve you hesitate you deliberate for years you temporise and tamper with the minds of men but a deathbill must be passed offhand without a thought of the consequences sure i am from what i have heard and from what i have seen that to pass the bill under all the existing circumstances without inquiry without deliberation would only be to add injustice to irritation and barbarity to neglect the framers of such a bill must be content to inherit the honours of that athenian lawgiver whose edicts were said to be written not in ink but in blood but suppose it passed suppose one of these men as i have seen themmeagre with famine sullen with despair careless of a life which your lordships are perhaps about to value at something less than the price of a stockingframe suppose this man surrounded by the children for whom he is unable to procure bread at the hazard of his existence about to be torn for ever from a family which he lately supported in peaceful industry and which it is not his fault that he can no longer so supportsuppose this manand there are ten thousand such from whom you may select your victimsdragged into court to be tried for this new offence by this new law still there are two things wanting to convict and condemn him and these are in my opiniontwelve butchers for a jury and a jeffreys for a judge                                               2 debate on the earl of donoughmores motion for a committee on the roman catholic claims april 21 1812  byrons notes for a portion of his speech are in the possession of mr murray  lord byron rose and said  my lordsthe question before the house has been so frequently fully and ably discussed and never perhaps more ably than on this night that it would be difficult to adduce new arguments for or against it but with each discussion difficulties have been removed objections have been canvassed and refuted and some of the former opponents of catholic emancipation have at length conceded to the expediency of relieving the petitioners in conceding thus much however a new objection is started it is not the time say they or it is an improper time or there is time enough yet in some degree i concur with those who say it is not the time exactly that time is past better had it been for the country that the catholics possessed at this moment their proportion of our privileges that their nobles held their due weight in our councils than that we should be assembled to discuss their claims it had indeed been better    non tempore tali   cogere concilium cum muros obsidet hostis  the enemy is without and distress within it is too late to cavil on doctrinal points when we must unite in defence of things more important than the mere ceremonies of religion it is indeed singular that we are called together to deliberate not on the god we adore for in that we are agreed not about the king we obey for to him we are loyal but how far a difference in the ceremonials of worship how far believing not too little but too much the worst that can be imputed to the catholics how far too much devotion to their god may incapacitate our fellowsubjects from effectually serving their king  much has been said within and without doors of church and state and although those venerable words have been too often prostituted to the most despicable of party purposes we cannot hear them too often all i presume are the advocates of church and statethe church of christ and the state of great britain but not a state of exclusion and despotism not an intolerant church not a church militant which renders itself liable to the very objection urged against the romish communion and in a greater degree for the catholic merely withholds its spiritual benediction and even that is doubtful but our church or rather our churchmen not only refuse to the catholic their spiritual grace but all temporal blessings whatsoever it was an observation of the great lord peterborough made within these walls or within the walls where the lords then assembled that he was for a parliamentary king and a parliamentary constitution but not a parliamentary god and a parliamentary religion the interval of a century has not weakened the force of the remark it is indeed time that we should leave off these petty cavils on frivolous points these lilliputian sophistries whether our eggs are best broken at the broad or narrow end  the opponents of the catholics may be divided into two classes those who assert that the catholics have too much already and those who allege that the lower orders at least have nothing more to require we are told by the former that the catholics never will be contented by the latter that they are already too happy the last paradox is sufficiently refuted by the present as by all past petitions it might as well be said that the negroes did not desire to be emancipated but this is an unfortunate comparison for you have already delivered them out of the house of bondage without any petition on their part but many from their taskmasters to a contrary effect and for myself when i consider this i pity the catholic peasantry for not having the good fortune to be born black but the catholics are contented or at least ought to be as we are told i shall therefore proceed to touch on a few of those circumstances which so marvellously contribute to their exceeding contentment they are not allowed the free exercise of their religion in the regular army the catholic soldier cannot absent himself from the service of the protestant clergyman and unless he is quartered in ireland or in spain where can he find eligible opportunities of attending his own the permission of catholic chaplains to the irish militia regiments was conceded as a special favour and not till after years of remonstrance although an act passed in 1793 established it as a right but are the catholics properly protected in ireland can the church purchase a rood of land whereon to erect a chapel no all the places of worship are built on leases of trust or sufferance from the laity easily broken and often betrayed the moment any irregular wish any casual caprice of the benevolent landlord meets with opposition the doors are barred against the congregation this has happened continually but in no instance more glaringly than at the town of newton barry in the county of wexford the catholics enjoying no regular chapel as a temporary expedient hired two barns which being thrown into one served for public worship at this time there was quartered opposite to the spot an officer whose mind appears to have been deeply imbued with those prejudices which the protestant petitions now on the table prove to have been fortunately eradicated from the more rational portion of the people and when the catholics were assembled on the sabbath as usual in peace and goodwill towards men for the worship of their god and yours they found the chapel door closed and were told that if they did not immediately retire and they were told this by a yeoman officer and a magistrate the riot act should be read and the assembly dispersed at the point of the bayonet this was complained of to the middleman of government the secretary at the castle in 1806 and the answer was in lieu of redress that he would cause a letter to be written to the colonel to prevent if possible the recurrence of similar disturbances upon this fact no very great stress need be laid but it tends to prove that while the catholic church has not power to purchase land for its chapels to stand upon the laws for its protection are of no avail in the mean time the catholics are at the mercy of every pelting petty officer who may choose to play his fantastic tricks before high heaven to insult his god and injure his fellowcreatures  every schoolboy any footboy such have held commissions in our service any footboy who can exchange his shoulderknot for an epaulette may perform all this and more against the catholic by virtue of that very authority delegated to him by his sovereign for the express purpose of defending his fellowsubjects to the last drop of his blood without discrimination or distinction between catholic and protestant  have the irish catholics the full benefit of trial by jury they have not they never can have until they are permitted to share the privilege of serving as sheriffs and undersheriffs of this a striking example occurred at the last enniskillen assizes a yeoman was arraigned for the murder of a catholic named macvournagh three respectable uncontradicted witnesses deposed that they saw the prisoner load take aim fire at and kill the said macvournagh this was properly commented on by the judge but to the astonishment of the bar and indignation of the court the protestant jury acquitted the accused so glaring was the partiality that mr justice osborne felt it his duty to bind over the acquitted but not absolved assassin in large recognizances thus for a time taking away his licence to kill catholics  are the very laws passed in their favour observed they are rendered nugatory in trivial as in serious cases by a late act catholic chaplains are permitted in gaols but in fermanagh county the grand jury lately persisted in presenting a suspended clergyman for the office thereby evading the statute notwithstanding the most pressing remonstrances of a most respectable magistrate named fletcher to the contrary such is law such is justice for the happy free contented catholic  it has been asked in another place why do not the rich catholics endow foundations for the education of the priesthood why do you not permit them to do so why are all such bequests subject to the interference the vexatious arbitrary peculating interference of the orange commissioners for charitable donations  as to maynooth college in no instance except at the time of its foundation when a noble lord camden at the head of the irish administration did appear to interest himself in its advancement and during the government of a noble duke bedford who like his ancestors has ever been the friend of freedom and mankind and who has not so far adopted the selfish policy of the day as to exclude the catholics from the number of his fellowcreatures with these exceptions in no instance has that institution been properly encouraged there was indeed a time when the catholic clergy were conciliated while the union was pending that union which could not be carried without them while their assistance was requisite in procuring addresses from the catholic counties then they were cajoled and caressed feared and flattered and given to understand that the union would do every thing but the moment it was passed they were driven back with contempt into their former obscurity  in the conduct pursued towards maynooth college every thing is done to irritate and perplexevery thing is done to efface the slightest impression of gratitude from the catholic mind the very hay made upon the lawn the fat and tallow of the beef and mutton allowed must be paid for and accounted upon oath it is true this economy in miniature cannot sufficiently be commended particularly at a time when only the insect defaulters of the treasury your hunts and your chinnerys when only those gilded bugs can escape the microscopic eye of ministers but when you come forward session after session as your paltry pittance is wrung from you with wrangling and reluctance to boast of your liberality well might the catholic exclaim in the words of prior    to john i owe some obligation     but john unluckily thinks fit   to publish it to all the nation     so john and i are more than quit  some persons have compared the catholics to the beggar in gil blas who made them beggars who are enriched with the spoils of their ancestors and cannot you relieve the beggar when your fathers have made him such if you are disposed to relieve him at all cannot you do it without flinging your farthings in his face as a contrast however to this beggarly benevolence let us look at the protestant charter schools to them you have lately granted ¬£41000 thus are they supported and how are they recruited montesquieu observes on the english constitution that the model may be found in tacitus where the historian describes the policy of the germans and adds this beautiful system was taken from the woods so in speaking of the charter schools it may be observed that this beautiful system was taken from the gipsies these schools are recruited in the same manner as the janissaries at the time of their enrolment under amurath and the gipsies of the present day with stolen children with children decoyed and kidnapped from their catholic connections by their rich and powerful protestant neighbours this is notorious and one instance may suffice to show in what mannerthe sister of a mr carthy a catholic gentleman of very considerable property died leaving two girls who were immediately marked out as proselytes and conveyed to the charter school of coolgreny their uncle on being apprised of the fact which took place during his absence applied for the restitution of his nieces offering to settle an independence on these his relations his request was refused and not till after five years struggle and the interference of very high authority could this catholic gentleman obtain back his nearest of kindred from a charity charter school in this manner are proselytes obtained and mingled with the offspring of such protestants as may avail themselves of the institution and how are they taught a catechism is put into their hands consisting of i believe fortyfive pages in which are three questions relative to the protestant religion one of these queries is where was the protestant religion before luther answer in the gospel the remaining fortyfour pages and a half regard the damnable idolatry of papists  allow me to ask our spiritual pastors and masters is this training up a child in the way which he should go is this the religion of the gospel before the time of luther that religion which preaches peace on earth and glory to god is it bringing up infants to be men or devils better would it be to send them any where than teach them such doctrines better send them to those islands in the south seas where they might more humanely learn to become cannibals it would be less disgusting that they were brought up to devour the dead than persecute the living schools do you call them call them rather dunghills where the viper of intolerance deposits her young that when their teeth are cut and their poison is mature they may issue forth filthy and venomous to sting the catholic but are these the doctrines of the church of england or of churchmen no the most enlightened churchmen are of a different opinion what says paley    i perceive no reason why men of different religious persuasions   should not sit upon the same bench deliberate in the same council or   fight in the same ranks as well as men of various religious opinions   upon any controverted topic of natural history philosophy or ethics  it may be answered that paley was not strictly orthodox i know nothing of his orthodoxy but who will deny that he was an ornament to the church to human nature to christianity  i shall not dwell upon the grievance of tithes so severely felt by the peasantry but it may be proper to observe that there is an addition to the burden a percentage to the gatherer whose interest it thus becomes to rate them as highly as possible and we know that in many large livings in ireland the only resident protestants are the tithe proctor and his family  amongst many causes of irritation too numerous for recapitulation there is one in the militia not to be passed overi mean the existence of orange lodges amongst the privates can the officers deny this and if such lodges do exist do they can they tend to promote harmony amongst the men who are thus individually separated in society although mingled in the ranks and is this general system of persecution to be permitted or is it to be believed that with such a system the catholics can or ought to be contented if they are they belie human nature they are then indeed unworthy to be any thing but the slaves you have made them the facts stated are from most respectable authority or i should not have dared in this place or any place to hazard this avowal if exaggerated there are plenty as willing as i believe them to be unable to disprove them should it be objected that i never was in ireland i beg leave to observe that it is as easy to know something of ireland without having been there as it appears with some to have been born bred and cherished there and yet remain ignorant of its best interests  but there are who assert that the catholics have already been too much indulged see cry they what has been done we have given them one entire college we allow them food and raiment the full enjoyment of the elements and leave to fight for us as long as they have limbs and lives to offer and yet they are never to be satisfiedgenerous and just declaimers to this and to this only amount the whole of your arguments when stript of their sophistry those personages remind me of a story of a certain drummer who being called upon in the course of duty to administer punishment to a friend tied to the halberts was requested to flog high he didto flog low he didto flog in the middle he didhigh low down the middle and up again but all in vain the patient continued his complaints with the most provoking pertinacity until the drummer exhausted and angry flung down his scourge exclaiming the devil burn you theres no pleasing you flog where one will thus it is you have flogged the catholic high low here there and every where and then you wonder he is not pleased it is true that time experience and that weariness which attends even the exercise of barbarity have taught you to flog a little more gently but still you continue to lay on the lash and will so continue till perhaps the rod may be wrested from your hands and applied to the backs of yourselves and your posterity  it was said by somebody in a former debate i forget by whom and am not very anxious to remember if the catholics are emancipated why not the jews if this sentiment was dictated by compassion for the jews it might deserve attention but as a sneer against the catholic what is it but the language of shylock transferred from his daughters marriage to catholic emancipation    would any of the tribe of barabbas   should have it rather than a christian  i presume a catholic is a christian even in the opinion of him whose taste only can be called in question for his preference of the jews  it is a remark often quoted of dr johnson whom i take to be almost as good authority as the gentle apostle of intolerance dr duigenan that he who could entertain serious apprehensions of danger to the church in these times would have cried fire in the deluge this is more than a metaphor for a remnant of these antediluvians appear actually to have come down to us with fire in their mouths and water in their brains to disturb and perplex mankind with their whimsical outcries and as it is an infallible symptom of that distressing malady with which i conceive them to be afflicted so any doctor will inform your lordships for the unhappy invalids to perceive a flame perpetually flashing before their eyes particularly when their eyes are shut as those of the persons to whom i allude have long been it is impossible to convince these poor creatures that the fire against which they are perpetually warning us and themselves is nothing but an ignis fatuus of their own drivelling imaginations what rhubarb senna or what purgative drug can scour that fancy thenceit is impossible they are given overtheirs is the true    caput insanabile tribus anticyris  these are your true protestants like bayle who protested against all sects whatsoever so do they protest against catholic petitions protestant petitions all redress all that reason humanity policy justice and common sense can urge against the delusions of their absurd delirium these are the persons who reverse the fable of the mountain that brought forth a mouse they are the mice who conceive themselves in labour with mountains  to return to the catholics suppose the irish were actually contented under their disabilities suppose them capable of such a bull as not to desire deliveranceought we not to wish it for ourselves have we nothing to gain by their emancipation what resources have been wasted what talents have been lost by the selfish system of exclusion you already know the value of irish aid at this moment the defence of england is intrusted to the irish militia at this moment while the starving people are rising in the fierceness of despair the irish are faithful to their trust but till equal energy is imparted throughout by the extension of freedom you cannot enjoy the full benefit of the strength which you are glad to interpose between you and destruction ireland has done much but will do more at this moment the only triumph obtained through long years of continental disaster has been achieved by an irish general it is true he is not a catholic had he been so we should have been deprived of his exertions but i presume no one will assert that his religion would have impaired his talents or diminished his patriotism though in that case he must have conquered in the ranks for he never could have commanded an army  but he is fighting the battles of the catholics abroad his noble brother has this night advocated their cause with an eloquence which i shall not depreciate by the humble tribute of my panegyric whilst a third of his kindred as unlike as unequal has been combating against his catholic brethren in dublin with circular letters edicts proclamations arrests and dispersionsall the vexatious implements of petty warfare that could be wielded by the mercenary guerillas of government clad in the rusty armour of their obsolete statutes your lordships will doubtless divide new honours between the saviour of portugal and the disperser of delegates it is singular indeed to observe the difference between our foreign and domestic policy if catholic spain faithful portugal or the no less catholic and faithful king of the one sicily of which by the by you have lately deprived him stand in need of succour away goes a fleet and an army an ambassador and a subsidy sometimes to fight pretty hardly generally to negotiate very badly and always to pay very dearly for our popish allies but let four millions of fellowsubjects pray for relief who fight and pay and labour in your behalf they must be treated as aliens and although their fathers house has many mansions there is no restingplace for them allow me to ask are you not fighting for the emancipation of ferdinand vii who certainly is a fool and consequently in all probability a bigot and have you more regard for a foreign sovereign than your own fellowsubjects who are not fools for they know your interest better than you know your own who are not bigots for they return you good for evil but who are in worse durance than the prison of an usurper inasmuch as the fetters of the mind are more galling than those of the body  upon the consequences of your not acceding to the claims of the petitioners i shall not expatiate you know them you will feel them and your childrens children when you are passed away adieu to that union so called as lucus a non lucendo an union from never uniting which in its first operation gave a deathblow to the independence of ireland and in its last may be the cause of her eternal separation from this country if it must be called an union it is the union of the shark with his prey the spoiler swallows up his victim and thus they become one and indivisible thus has great britain swallowed up the parliament the constitution the independence of ireland and refuses to disgorge even a single privilege although for the relief of her swollen and distempered body politic  and now my lords before i sit down will his majestys ministers permit me to say a few words not on their merits for that would be superfluous but on the degree of estimation in which they are held by the people of these realms the esteem in which they are held has been boasted of in a triumphant tone on a late occasion within these walls and a comparison instituted between their conduct and that of noble lords on this side of the house  what portion of popularity may have fallen to the share of my noble friends if such i may presume to call them i shall not pretend to ascertain but that of his majestys ministers it were vain to deny it is to be sure a little like the wind no one knows whence it cometh or whither it goeth but they feel it they enjoy it they boast of it indeed modest and unostentatious as they are to what part of the kingdom even the most remote can they flee to avoid the triumph which pursues them if they plunge into the midland counties there will they be greeted by the manufacturers with spurned petitions in their hands and those halters round their necks recently voted in their behalf imploring blessings on the heads of those who so simply yet ingeniously contrived to remove them from their miseries in this to a better world if they journey on to scotland from glasgow to john o groats every where will they receive similar marks of approbation if they take a trip from portpatrick to donaghadee there will they rush at once into the embraces of four catholic millions to whom their vote of this night is about to endear them for ever when they return to the metropolis if they can pass under temple bar without unpleasant sensations at the sight of the greedy niches over that ominous gateway they cannot escape the acclamations of the livery and the more tremulous but not less sincere applause the blessings not loud but deep of bankrupt merchants and doubting stockholders if they look to the army what wreaths not of laurel but of nightshade are preparing for the heroes of walcheren it is true there are few living deponents left to testify to their merits on that occasion but a cloud of witnesses are gone above from that gallant army which they so generously and piously despatched to recruit the noble army of martyrs  what if in the course of this triumphal career in which they will gather as many pebbles as caligulas army did on a similar triumph the prototype of their own they do not perceive any of those memorials which a grateful people erect in honour of their benefactors what although not even a signpost will condescend to depose the saracens head in favour of the likeness of the conquerors of walcheren they will not want a picture who can always have a caricature or regret the omission of a statue who will so often see themselves exalted into effigy but their popularity is not limited to the narrow bounds of an island there are other countries where their measures and above all their conduct to the catholics must render them preeminently popular if they are beloved here in france they must be adored there is no measure more repugnant to the designs and feelings of bonaparte than catholic emancipation no line of conduct more propitious to his projects than that which has been pursued is pursuing and i fear will be pursued towards ireland what is england without ireland and what is ireland without the catholics it is on the basis of your tyranny napoleon hopes to build his own so grateful must oppression of the catholics be to his mind that doubtless as he has lately permitted some renewal of intercourse the next cartel will convey to this country cargoes of sevres china and blue ribands things in great request and of equal value at this moment blue ribands of the legion of honour for dr duigenan and his ministerial disciples such is that wellearned popularity the result of those extraordinary expeditions so expensive to ourselves and so useless to our allies of those singular inquiries so exculpatory to the accused and so dissatisfactory to the people of those paradoxical victories so honourable as we are told to the british name and so destructive to the best interests of the british nation above all such is the reward of the conduct pursued by ministers towards the catholics  i have to apologise to the house who will i trust pardon one not often in the habit of intruding upon their indulgence for so long attempting to engage their attention my most decided opinion is as my vote will be in favour of the motion                                               3 debate on major cartwrights petition june 11813   lord byron rose and said  my lordshe petition which i now hold for the purpose of presenting to the house is one which i humbly conceive requires the particular attention of your lordships inasmuch as though signed but by a single individual it contains statements which if not disproved demand most serious investigation the grievance of which the petitioner complains is neither selfish nor imaginary it is not his own only for it has been and is still felt by numbers no one without these walls nor indeed within but may tomorrow be made liable to the same insult and obstruction in the discharge of an imperious duty for the restoration of the true constitution of these realms by petitioning for reform in parliament the petitioner my lords is a man whose long life has been spent in one unceasing struggle for the liberty of the subject against that undue influence which has increased is increasing and ought to be diminished and whatever difference of opinion may exist as to his political tenets few will be found to question the integrity of his intentions even now oppressed with years and not exempt from the infirmities attendant on his age but still unimpaired in talent and unshaken in spiritfrangas non flecteshe has received many a wound in the combat against corruption and the new grievance the fresh insult of which he complains may inflict another scar but no dishonour the petition is signed by john cartwright and it was in behalf of the people and parliament in the lawful pursuit of that reform in the representation which is the best service to be rendered both to parliament and people that he encountered the wanton outrage which forms the subjectmatter of his petition to your lordships it is couched in firm yet respectful languagein the language of a man not regardless of what is due to himself but at the same time i trust equally mindful of the deference to be paid to this house the petitioner states amongst other matter of equal if not greater importance to all who are british in their feelings as well as blood and birth that on the 21st january 1813 at huddersfield himself and six other persons who on hearing of his arrival had waited on him merely as a testimony of respect were seized by a military and civil force and kept in close custody for several hours subjected to gross and abusive insinuation from the commanding officer relative to the character of the petitioner that he the petitioner was finally carried before a magistrate and not released till an examination of his papers proved that there was not only no just but not even statutable charge against him and that notwithstanding the promise and order from the presiding magistrates of a copy of the warrant against your petitioner it was afterwards withheld on divers pretexts and has never until this hour been granted the names and condition of the parties will be found in the petition to the other topics touched upon in the petition i shall not now advert from a wish not to encroach upon the time of the house but i do most sincerely call the attention of your lordships to its general contentsit is in the cause of the parliament and people that the rights of this venerable freeman have been violated and it is in my opinion the highest mark of respect that could be paid to the house that to your justice rather than by appeal to any inferior court he now commits himself whatever may be the fate of his remonstrance it is some satisfaction to me though mixed with regret for the occasion that i have this opportunity of publicly stating the obstruction to which the subject is liable in the prosecution of the most lawful and imperious of his duties the obtaining by petition reform in parliament i have shortly stated his complaint the petitioner has more fully expressed it your lordships will i hope adopt some measure fully to protect and redress him and not him alone but the whole body of the people insulted and aggrieved in his person by the interposition of an abused civil and unlawful military force between them and their right of petition to their own representatives  his lordship then presented the petition from major cartwright which was read complaining of the circumstances at huddersfield and of interruptions given to the right of petitioning in several places in the northern parts of the kingdom and which his lordship moved should be laid on the table  several lords having spoken on the question  lord byron replied that he had from motives of duty presented this petition to their lordships consideration the noble earl had contended that it was not a petition but a speech and that as it contained no prayer it should not be received what was the necessity of a prayer if that word were to be used in its proper sense their lordships could not expect that any man should pray to others he had only to say that the petition though in some parts expressed strongly perhaps did not contain any improper mode of address but was couched in respectful language towards their lordships he should therefore trust their lordships would allow the petition to be received                                               appendix iii   lady caroline lamb and byron   1 the following letter is one of the first which lady caroline wrote to byron in the spring of 1812   the rose lord byron gave lady caroline lamb died in despight of every effort made to save it probably from regret at its fallen fortunes hume at least who is no great believer in most things says that many more die of broken hearts than is supposed when lady caroline returns from brocket hall she will dispatch the cabinet maker to lord biron with the flower she wishes most of all others to resemble as however deficient its beauty and even use it has a noble and aspiring mind and having once beheld in its full lustre the bright and unclouded sun that for one moment condescended to shine upon it never while it exists could it think any lower object worthy of its worship and admiration yet the sunflower was punished for its temerity but its fate is more to be envied than that of many less proud flowers it is still permitted to gaze though at the humblest distance on him who is superior to every other and though in this cold foggy atmosphere it meets no doubt with many disappointments and though it never could never will have reason to boast of any peculiar mark of condescension or attention from the bright star to whom it pays constant homage yet to behold it sometimes to see it gazed at to hear it admired will repay all she hopes therefore when brought by the little page it will be graciously received without any more taunts and cuts about love of what is new  lady caroline does not plead guilty to this most unkind charge at least no further than is laudable for that which is rare and is distinguished and singular ought to be more prized and sought after than what is commonplace and disagreeable how can the other accusation of being easily pleased agree with this the very circumstance of seeking out that which is of high value shows at least a mind not readily satisfied but to attempt excuses for faults would be impossible with lady caroline they have so long been rooted in a soil suited to their growth that a far less penetrating eye than lord byrons might perceive themeven on the shortest acquaintance there is not one however though long indulged that shall not be instantly got rid of if ld byron thinks it worth while to name them the reproof and abuse of some however severe and just may be valued more than the easily gained encomiums of the rest of the world  miss mercer were she here would join with lady caroline in a last request during their absence that besides not forgetting his new acquaintances he would eat and drink like an english man till their return the lines upon the only dog ever loved by ld byron are beautiful what wrong then that having such proof of the faith and friendship of this animal ld byron should censure the whole race by the following unjust remarks    perchance my dog will whine in vain    till fed by stranger hands   but long eer i come back again    hed tear me where he stands  march 27th 1812 good friday                                               2 the following are the lines written by lady caroline when she burned byron in effigy at brocket hall endorsed in mrs leighs handwriting december 1812   address spoken by the page at brocket hall before the bonfire    is this guy faux you burn in effigy   why bring the traitor here what is guy faux to me   guy faux betrayed his country and his laws   england revenged the wrong his was a public cause   but i have private cause to raise this flame   burn also those and be their fate the same       puts the basket in the fire under the figure   see here are locks and braids of coloured hair   worn oft by me to make the people stare   rouge feathers flowers and all those tawdry things   besides those pictures letters chains and rings   all made to lure the mind and please the eye   and fill the heart with pride and vanity   burn fire burn these glittering toys destroy   while thus we hail the blaze with throats of joy   burn fire burn while wondering boys exclaim   and gold and trinkets glitter in the flame   ah look not thus on me so grave so sad   shake not your heads nor say the ladys mad   judge not of others for there is but one   to whom the heart and feelings can be known   upon my youthful faults few censures cast   look to the futureand forgive the past   london farewell vain world vain life adieu   take the last tears i eer shall shed for you   young tho i seem i leave the world for ever   never to enter it againno nevernever                                               3 the following letter was apparently written in the summer of 1812   you have been very generous and kind if you have not betrayd me and i do not think you have my remaining in town and seeing you thus is sacrificing the last chance i have left i expose myself to every eye to every unkind observation you think me weak and selfish you think i do not struggle to withstand my own feelings but indeed it is exacting more than human nature can bear and when i came out last night which was of itself an effort and when i heard your name announced the moment after i saw nothing more but seemed in a dream miss berrys very loud laugh and penetrating eyes did not restore me she however was good naturd and remaind near me and mr moor sic though he really does not approve one feeling i have had kindness of heart to stay near me otherwise i felt so ill i could not have struggled longer lady cahir said you are ill shall we go away which i was very glad to accept but we could not get through and so i fear it causd you pain to see me intrude again i sent a groom to holmes twice yesterday morning to prevent his going to you or giving you a letter full of flippant jokes written in one moment of gaiety which is quite gone since i am so afraid he has been to you if so i entreat you to forgive it and to do just what you think right about the picture  i have been drawing you mad de sta√´l as the last i sent was not like if you do not approve this give it murray and pray do not be angry with me  do not marry yet or if you do let me know it first i shall not suffer if she you chuse be worth you but she will never love you as i did i am going to the chapple royal at st james do you ever go there it begins at 12 past 5 and lasts till six it is the most beautiful singing i ever heard the choristers sing by the waters of babylon  the peers sit below the women quite apart but for the evening service very few go i wonder that more do notit is really most beautiful for those who like that style of music if you never heard it go there some day but not when it is so cold as this how very pale you are what a contrast with moore mai io lho veduto piu bello che jeri ma e la belta della morte or a statue of white marble so colourless and the dark brow and hair such a contrast i never see you without wishing to cry if any painter could paint me that face as it is i would give them any thing i possess on earthnot one has yet given the countenance and complexion as it is i only could if i knew how to draw and paint because one must feel it to give it the real expression                                               4 the following letter was evidently written at the time when the separation of lord and lady byron was first rumoured   melbourne house thursday  when so many wiser and better surround you it is not for me to presume to hope that anything i can say will find favour in your sight but yet i must venture to intrude upon you even though your displeasure against me be all i gain for so doing all others may have some object or interest in theirs i have none but the wish to save you will you generously consent to what is for the peace of both parties and will you act in a manner worthy of yourself i am sure in the end you will consent even were everything now left to your own choice you never could bring yourself to live with a person who felt desirous of being separated from you i know you too well to believe this possible and i am sure that a separation nobly and generously arranged by you will at once silence every report spread against either party believe me lord byron you will feel happier when you act thus and all the world will approve your conduct which i know is not a consideration with you but still should in some measure be thought of they tell me that you have accused me of having spread injurious reports against you had you the heart to say this i do not greatly believe it but it is affirmed and generally thought that you said so you have often been unkind to me but never as unkind as this  those who are dear to you cannot feel more anxious for your happiness than i do they may fear to offend you more than i ever will but they cannot be more ready to serve you i wish to god that i could see one so superior in mind and talents and every grace and power that can fascinate and delight happier you might still be so lord byron if you would believe what some day you will find true have you ever thought for one moment seriously do you wish to heap such misery upon yourself that you will no longer be able to endure it return to virtue and happiness for gods sake whilst it is yet time oh lord byron let one who has loved you with a devotion almost profane find favour so far as to incline you to hear her sometimes from the mouth of a sinner advice may be received that a proud heart disdains to take from those who are upon an equality with themselves if this is so may it now even now have some little weight with you do not drive things to desperate extremes do not even though you may have the power use it to ill god bless and sooth you and preserve you i cannot see all that i once admired and loved so well ruining himself and others without feeling it deeply if what i have said is unwise at least believe the motive was a kind one and would to god it might avail  i cannot believe that you will not act generously in this instance  yours unhappily as it has proved for me  caroline  those of my family who have seen lady byron have assured me that whatever her sorrow she is the last in the world to reproach or speak ill of you she is most miserable what regret will yours be evermore if false friends or resentment impel you to act harshly on this occasion whatever my feelings may be towards you or her i have with the most scrupulous care for both your sakes avoided either calling or sending or interfering to say that i have spread reports against either is therefore as unjust as it is utterly false i fear no enquiry                                                5 the following letter probably refers to the publication of the lines fare thee well in april 1816   at a moment of such deep agony and i may add shamewhen utterly disgraced judge byron what my feelings must be at murrays shewing me some beautiful verses of yours i do implore you for god sake not to publish them could i have seen you one moment i would explain why i have only time to add that however those who surround you may make you disbelieve it you will draw ruin on your own head and hers if at this moment you shew these i know not from what quarter the report originates you accused me and falsely but if you could hear all that is said at this moment you would believe one who though your enemy though for ever alienated from you though resolved never more whilst she lives to see or speak to or forgive you yet would perhaps die to save you  byron hear me my own misery i have scarce once thought of what is the loss of one like me to the world but when i see such as you are ruined for ever and utterly insensible of it i must speak out of course i cannot say to murray what i think of those verses but to you to you alone i will say i think they will prove your ruin                                               6 in 1824 after the death of byron and after the publication of captain medwins recollections of lord byron lady caroline lamb sent a letter to mr henry colburn the publisher enclosing one to be given to medwin and published both are given here and the latter should be read in substantiation or correction of what is stated in the notes the letter is printed verbatim et literati   1 lady caroline lamb to henry colburn  november  1824  my dear sirwalter who takes this will explain my wishes will you enable him to deliver my letter to captain medwin and will you publish it you are to give him ten pound for it i will settle it with you i am on my death bed do not fail to obey my wishes i send you my journals but do not publish them until i am dead  yours  caroline lamb      2 lady caroline lamb to captain thomas medwin  endorsed this copy to be carefully preserved hy cn henry colburn  november  1824  siri hope you will excuse my intruding upon your time with the most intense interest i have just finished your book which does you credit as to the manner in which it is executed and after the momentary pain in part which it excites in many a bosom will live in despight of censureand be gratefully accepted by the public as long as lord byrons name is rememberedyet as you have left to one who adored him a bitter legacy and as i feel secure the lines remember theethou false to him thou fiend to mewere hisand as i have been very ill  am not likely to trouble any one much longeryou will i am sure grant me one favourlet me to you at least confide the truth of the pastyou owe it to meyou will not i know refuse me  it was when the first child harold came out upon lord byrons return from greece that i first had the misfortune to be acquainted with himat that time i was the happiest and gayest of human beings i do believe without exceptioni had married for love and love the most romantic and ardentmy husband and i were so fond of each other that false as i too soon proved he never would part with me devonshire house was at that time closed from my uncles death for one yearat melbourne house where i lived the waltzes and quadrilles were being daily practised lady jersey lady cowper the duke of devonshire miss milbanke and a number of foreigners coming there to learnyou may imagine what forty or fifty people dancing from 12 in the morning until near dinner time all young gay and noisy werein the evenings we either had opposition suppers or went out to balls and routssuch was the life i then led when moore and rogers introduced lord byron to mewhat you say of his falling upstairs and of miss milbanke is all true lord byron 3 days after this brought me a rose and carnation and used the very words i mentioned in glenarvonwith a sort of half sarcastic smilesaying your ladyship i am told likes all that is new and rare for a momenti have them still and the woman who through many a trial has kept these relics with the romance of former agesdeserves not that you should speak of her as you do byron never never could say i had no heart he never could say either that i had not loved my husband in his letters to me he is perpetually telling me i love him the best of the two and my only charm believe me in his eyes was that i was innocent affectionate and enthusiastic  recall those words and let me not go down with your book as heartless tell the truth it is bad enough but not what is worse it makes me so nervous to write that i must stopwill it tire you too much if i continue i was not a woman of the world had i been one of that sort why would he have devoted nine entire months almost entirely to my society have written perhaps ten times in a day and lastly have pressd me to leave all and go with himand this at the very moment when he was made an idol of and when as he and you justly observe i had few personal attractions indeed indeed i tell the truth byron did not affectbut he loved me as never woman was loved i have had one of his letters copied in the stone press for you one just before we parted see if it looks like a mere lesson besides he was then very good to what he grew afterwards  his health being delicate he liked to read with me  stay with me out of the crowd not but what we went about everywhere together and were at last invited always as if we had been marriedit was a strange scenebut it was not vanity misled me i grew to love him better than virtue religionall prospects here he broke my heart  still i love himwitness the agony i experienced at his death  the tears your book has cost me yet sir allow me to say although you have unintentionally given me pain i had rather have experienced it than not have read your book parts of it are beautiful and i can vouch for the truth of much as i read his own memoirs before murray burnt them keep lord byrons letter to me i have the original  some day add a word or two to your work from his own words not to let every one think i am heartless the cause of my leaving lord byron was this my dearest mother now dead grew so terrified about usthat upon hearing a false report that we were gone off together she was taken dangerously ill  broke a blood vessel byron would not believe it but it was true when he was convinced we parted i went to ireland  remained there 3 months he wrote every day long kind entertaining letters it is these he asked murray to look out and extract from when he published the journal but i would not part with themi have them nowthey would only burn them  nothing of his should be burnt at dublin god knows why he wrote me the cruel letter part of which he acknowledges in glenarvon the 9th of november 1812he knew it would destroy my mind and all elseit did solady oxford was no doubt the instigator what will not a woman do to get rid of a rival she knew that he still loved mei need not tire you with every particular i was brought to england a mere wreck  in due time lady melbourne  my mother being seriously alarmed for me brought me to town and allowed me to see lord byron our meeting was not what he insinuateshe asked me to forgive him he looked sorry for me he cried i adored him still but i felt as passionless as the dead may feelwould i had died therei should have died pitied  still loved by him  with the sympathy of all i even should have pardoned myselfso deeply had i suffered but unhappily we continued occasionally to meet lord byron liked others i only himthe scene at lady heathcotes is nearly truehe had made me swear i was never to waltz lady heathcote said come lady caroline you must begin  i bitterly answeredoh yes i am in a merry humour i did sobut whispered to lord byron i conclude i may waltz now and he answered sarcastically with every body in turnyou always did it better than any one i shall have a pleasure in seeing youi did so you may judge with what feelings after this feeling ill i went into a small inner room where supper was prepared lord byron  lady rancliffe entered after seeing me he said i have been admiring your dexterity i clasped a knife not intending anything do my dear he said but if you mean to act a romans part mind which way you strike with your knifebe it at your own heart not mineyou have struck there already byron i said and ran away with the knife i never stabbed myself it is false lady rancliffe  tankerville screamed and said i would people pulled to get it from me i was terrified my hand got cut  the blood came over my gown i know not what happened afterbut this is the very truth after this long after ld byron abused by every one made the theme of every ones horror yet pitied me enough to come  see me and still in spight of every one william lamb had the generosity to retain me i never held my head up afternever could it was in all the papers and put not truly it is true i burnt lord byron in effigy  his book ring  chain it is true i went to see him as a carman after all that but it is also true that the last time we parted for ever as he pressed his lips on mine it was in the albany he said poor caro if every one hates me you i see will never changeno not with ill usage  i said yes i am changed  shall come near you no morefor then he showed me letters  told me things i cannot repeat  all my attachment went this was our last parting scenewell i remember it it had an effect upon me not to be conceived3 years i had worshipped him  shortly after he married once lady melbourne took me to see his wife in piccadilly it was a cruel request but lord byron himself made it it is to this wedding visit he alludes mrs leigh myself lady melbourne lady noel  lady byron were in the room i never looked up annabella was very cold to me lord byron came in  seemed agitatedhis hand was cold but he seemed kind this was the last time upon this earth i ever met him soon after the battle of waterloo took place my brother was wounded  i went to brussels i had one letter while at paris from ld byron a jesting one hoping i was as happy with the regiment as he was with his wife bell when i returned the parting between them occurred my page affair glenarvon i wrote it in a month under circumstances would surprise every body but which i am not at liberty to mention besides it has nothing to do with your book and would only tire you previous to this i once met  once only lady byron it was just after the separation occurred she was so altered i could hardly know hershe appeared heart broken what she then said to me i may not repeatshe was however sent away she did not go willingly  she accused me of knowing every thing  reproached me for not having stopped the marriage how could i she had been shewn my letters and every one else it is utterly false that she ever opened the deskthe nurse had nothing to do with the separation  from that hour lady byron  i met no more  it was after this that indignant  miserable i wrote glenarvon lady b was more angry at it than he wasfrom that time i put the whole as much as i could from my mind ld byron never once wrote to meand always spoke of me with contempt i was taken ill in march this yearmrs russell hunter  a nurse sat up with me in the middle of the night i fancied i saw ld byroni screamed jumped out of bed  desired them to save me from him he looked horrible  ground his teeth at me he did not speak his hair was straight he was fatter than when i knew him  not near so handsome i felt convinced i was to die this dream took possession of my mind i had not dreamed of him since we had parted it was besides like no other dream except one of my mother that i ever had i am glad to think it occurred before his death as i never did  hope i never shall see a ghost i have even avoided enquiring about the exact day for fear i should believe itit made enough impression as it was i told william and my brother  murray at the time judge what my horror was as well as grief when long after the news came of his death it was conveyed to me in two or 3 wordscaroline behave properly i know it will shock youlord byron is deadthis letter i received when laughing at brockett hall its effect or some other cause produced a fever from which i never yet have recoveredit was also singular that the first day i could go out in an open carriage as i was slowly driving up the hill herelord byrons hearse was at that moment passing under these very walls and rested at welwyn william lamb who was riding on before me met the procession at the turnpike  asked whose funeral it was he was very much affected and shockedi of course was not told but as i kept continually asking where  when he was to be buried  had read in the papers it was to be at westminster abbey i heard it too soon  it made me very ill again                                               appendix iv   letters of bernard barton  the two following letters were written to byron in 1814 by bernard barton the quaker poet see letter 238 footnote 1   i   woodbridge suffolk apl 14th 1814  my lordi received this morning the reply with which your lordship honourd my last and now avail myself of the permission you have so kindly granted to state as briefly as i can the circumstances which have induced me to make this application and the extent of my wishes respecting your lordships interference  eight years since i went into business in this place as a merchant i was then just of age and shortly after married the business in which i was engaged was of a very precarious nature and after vainly trying for 4 years to make the best of it i was compelld to relinquish it altogether just then to add to my distress i lost my best my firmest my tenderest friendthe only being for whose sake i ever desird wealth and the only one who could have cheerd the gloom of poverty my capital being a borrowd one i returned it as far as i could to the person who had lent it since that time my lord i have been struggling to make the best of a clerkship of ¬£80 per ann out of which i have to meet every expence and still to maintain a respectable appearance in a place where i have resided under different circumstances had i enterd my present situation free of all debts i should have made it an inviolable rule to have limited my expenditure to my income but beginning in debt compelld by peculiar circumstances to mix with those much superior to myself i have gone on till i find it quite impossible to go on any longer and i am compelled to seek for some asylum where by rigid frugality and indefatigable exertion i may free myself from my present humiliating embarrassments but while i am here the thing seems impracticable your lordship will naturally inquire why i do not avail myself of the influence of those friends by whom i am known as you have my lord done me the honour to encourage me to state my position frankly i will without hesitation inform you i am nominally at least a quaker the persons to whom i should in my present difficulties naturally look for assistance are among the most respectable of that body but my attachments to literary and metaphysical studies and a line of conduct not compatible with the strictness of quaker discipline have i am afraid brought me into disrepute with those to whom i should otherwise have confided my situation were i to disclose it it would only be considerd as a fit judgment on me for my scepticism and infidelity  this my lord is a brief but faithful statement of my present situation it is as i before told your lordship in every respect an untenable one i must relinquish it and throw myself an outcast on society can you will you my lord exert your influence to save me from irretrievable ruin can you my lord in any possible way afford employment to me can you take me into your servicea young man not totally destitute of talents eager to exert them and willing to do anything or be anything in his power if you can my lord i will promise to serve you not servilely but faithfully in any manner you shall point out do not i beg of you my lord refuse my application the moment you peruse it the mouse you know once was able to show its gratitude to the lion and it may be in my power if your lordship will but give me the opportunity to evince my deep gratitude for any kindness you may show me not by words but deeds be assurd you will not have cause to repent any interest you have taken or may take in my concerns for the civility you shewed me on a former occasion my lord i felt as i ought much indebted but infinitely more for the generosity of feeling and soundness of judgment which dictated the letter you then did me the honour to address to me ever since then i have entertaind the highest opinion both of your head and your heart is it then strange my lord that surrounded by difficulties perplexed at every step i take i should look up to your lordship for advice and if possible for assistance be the consequences what they may i have venturd on the presumption of doing so if i have taken too great a liberty i beg you my lord to forgive me and let the tale of my perplexities and my misfortunes my impertinence and its punishment be alike forgotten it can at any rate only give your lordship the trouble of reading a letter if on the other hand your lordship can in any way realize the hopes i have long enthusiastically cherished why the blessing of him who is ready to perish shall fall on you be the event what it may crede byron is your lordship sees my motto  i am my lord  your lordships very obt servt  b barton  p si shall wait with no common anxiety to see whether your lordship will so far forgive this intrusion as to answer it                                               2   woodbridge april 15th 1814  my lordi should be truly sorry if my importunity should defeat its own purpose and instead of interesting your lordship on my behalf should make you regret the indulgence you have already granted me but i really feel as if i had staked every remaining hope on the cast of the die and therefore before it is thrown i wish my lord to make one or two more observations  although in my last which as i before observed was hastily written i expressd my wish to be allowd in some capacity or other to serve your lordship yet i am not so foolish as to think of fastening myself on you my lord bon gr√© ou malgr√© one reason for my expressing that wish was an idea that your lordship might go abroad before long and added to my own wish to see something of the world on which fate has thrown me it occurred to me at the moment that on such an occasion the services of one who is warmly attachd to you perhaps romantically for i know nothing of your lordship but by your writings might be acceptable  but my lord although i have thus alluded to what would most gratify my own wishes it was not intended to dictate to you the manner in which you might promote my interest if your lordships superior judgment and greater knowledge of the world can suggest anything else for my consideration it shall receive every attention  one more remark my lord and i have done i am very sensible that in this application to your lordship i have been guilty of what would be termd by some a piece of great impertinence and by most an act of consummate folly will you allow me my lord frankly to state to you the arguments on which my resolutions were founded  i have not addressd you my lord on the impulse of the moment dictated by desperation and adopted without reflection no my lord i had or at least i thought i had better reasons i remembered that you had once condescended to address me candidly not critically that you had even kindly interested yourself on my behalf i thought that amid all the keenness and poignancy of your habitual feelings as powerfully pourtrayed in your writings i could discern the workings of a heart truly noble i imagind that what to a superficial observer appeard only the overflowings of misanthropy were in reality the effusions of deep sensibility i convincd myself by repeated perusals of your different productions that though disappointments the most painful and sensations the most acute might have stung your heart to its very core it had yet many feelings of the most exalted kind from these i hoped everything those hopes may be disappointed but the opinions which gave rise to them have not been hastily formd nor will any selfish feeling of mortification be able to alter them  i do not my lord intend the above as any idle complimentary apology for what i have done i am not god knows just now in a complimentary mood and if i were you my lord are one of the last persons on earth on whom i should be tempted to play off such trash as idle panegyrics i esteem you my lord not merely for your rank still less for your personal qualities the former i respect as i ought of the latter i know nothing but i feel something more than mere respect for your genius and your talents and from your past conduct towards myself i cannot be insensible to your kindness for these reasons my lord i acted as i have done i before told you that i considerd you no common character and i think your lordship will admit that i have not treated you as such  permit me once more my lord to take my leave by assuring you that i am  with the truest esteem your very obt and humble servt bernard barton  p si hope your lordship will find no difficulty in making out this scrawl but really not being able to mend my pen i am forced to write with it backwards when i have the good luck to find my penknife i will endeavour to furnish myself with a better tool                                               part of the draft of byrons answer to these two letters is in existence and runs as follows   albany april 16th 1814  sirall offence is out of the question my principal regret is that it is not in my power to be of service my own plans are very unsettled and at present from a variety of circumstances embarrassed and even were it otherwise i should be both to offer anything like dependence to one who from education and acquirements must doubly feel sensible of such a situation however i might be disposed to render it tolerable  as an adviser i am rather qualified to point out what should be avoided than what may be pursued for my own life has been but a series of imprudences and conflicts of all descriptions from these i have only acquired experience if repentance were added perhaps it might be all the better since i do not find the former of much avail without it                                               appendix v   correspondence with walter scott   the following is walter scotts reply to byrons letter of july 6 1812   abbotsford near melrose 16th july 1812  my lordi am much indebted to your lordship for your kind and friendly letter and much gratified by the prince regents good opinion of my literary attempts i know so little of courts or princes that any success i may have had in hitting off the stuarts is i am afraid owing to a little old jacobite leaven which i sucked in with the numerous traditionary tales that amused my infancy it is a fortunate thing for the prince himself that he has a literary turn since nothing can so effectually relieve the ennui of state and the anxieties of power  i hope your lordship intends to give us more of childe harold i was delighted that my friend jeffreyfor such in despite of many a feud literary and political i always esteem himhas made so handsomely the amende honorable for not having discovered in the bud the merits of the flower and i am happy to understand that the retractation so handsomely made was received with equal

giant and the dwarf   the reply of leigh hunts friends to moores squib the living dog and the dead lion see letter 291 p 205 note 1 footnote 2 ran as follows   the giant and the dwarf  humbly inscribed to t pidcock esq of exeter change    a giant that once of a dwarf made a friend     and their friendship the dwarf took care shouldnt be hid   would now and then out of his glooms condescend     to laugh at his anticsas every one did    this dwarfan extremely diminutive dwarf     in birth unlike gy though his pride was as big   had been taken when young from the bogs of clontarf     and though born quite a helot had grown up a whig    he wrote little versesand sung them withal     and the giants dark visions they sometimes could charm   like the voice of the lute which had powr over saul     and the song which could hell and its legions disarm    the giant was grateful and offered him gold     but the dwarf was indignant and spurnd at the offer   no never he cried shall my friendship be sold     for the sordid contents of another mans coffer    what would dwarfland and ireland and every land say     to what would so shocking a thing be ascribed   my lady would think that i was in your pay     and the quarterly say that i must have been bribed    you see how im puzzled i dont say it wouldnt     be pleasant just now to have just that amount   but to take it in gold or in banknotesi couldnt     i wouldnt accept iton any account    but couldnt you just write your autobiography     all fearless and personal bitter and stinging   sure that with a few famous heads in lithography     would bring me far more than my songs or my singing    you know what i did for poor sheridans life     yours is sure of my very best superintendence   ill expunge what might point at your sister or wife     and ill thus keep my priceless unbought independence    the giant smiled grimly he couldnt quite see     what diffrence there was on the face of the earth   between the dwarfs taking the money in fee     and his taking the same thing in that moneys worth    but to please him he wrote and the business was done     the dwarf went immediately off to the row   and ere the next

newspapers for february and march 1814   i the courier  1 lord byron the courier february 1 1814   a new poem has just been published by the above nobleman and the morning chronicle of today has favoured its readers with his lordships dedication of it to thomas moore esq in what that paper calls an elegant eulogium if the elegance of an eulogium consist in its extravagance the chronicles epithet is well chosen but our purpose is not with the dedication nor the main poem the corsair but with one of the pieces called poems published at the end of the corsair nearly two years ago in march 1812 when the regent was attacked with a bitterness and rancour that disgusted the whole country when attempts were made day after day to wound every feeling of the heart there appeared in the morning chronicle an anonymous address to a young lady weeping upon which we remarked at the time courier of march 7 1812 considering it as tending to make the princess charlotte of wales view the prince regent her father as an object of suspicion and disgrace few of our readers have forgotten the disgust which this address excited the author of it however unwilling that it should sleep in the oblivion to which it had been consigned with the other trash of that day has republished it and placed the first of what are called poems at the end of this newly published work the corsair we find this very address    weep daughter of a royal line   a sires disgrace a realms decay  lord byron thus avows himself to be the author  to be sure the prince has been extremely disgraced by the policy he has adopted and the events which that policy has produced and the realm has experienced great decay no doubt by the occurrences in the peninsula the resistance of russia the rising in germany the counterrevolution in holland and the defeat disgrace and shame of buonaparte but instead of continuing our observations suppose we parody his lordships address and apply it to february 1814   to a young lady  february 1814    view daughter of a royal line      a fathers fame a realms renown    ah happy that that realm is thine      and that its father is thine own    view and exulting view thy fate      which dooms thee oer these blissful isles    to reign but distant be the date      and like thy sire deserve thy peoples smiles                                               2 the courier february 2 1814   lord byron as we stated yesterday has discovered and promulgated to the world in eight lines of choice doggrel that the realm of england is in decay that her sovereign is disgraced and that the situation of the country is one which claims the tears of all good patriots to this very indubitable statement the morning chronicle of this day exhibits an admirable companion picture a genuine letter from paris of the 25th ult                                               3 the courier february 3 1814     the courier is indignant says the morning chronicle at the   discovery now made by lord byron that he was the author of the   verses to a young lady weeping which were inserted about a   twelvemonth ago in the morning chronicle the editor thinks it   audacious in a hereditary counsellor of the king to admonish the heir   apparent it may not be courtly but it is certainly british and   we wish the kingdom had more such honest advisers  the discovery of the author of the verses in question was not made by lord byron how could it be when he sent them to the chronicle without his name he was just as well informed about the author as he is now that he has published them in a pamphlet with his name the discovery was made to the public they did not know in march 1812 what they know in february 1814 they did not suspect then what they now find avowed that a peer of the realm was the author of the attack upon the prince of the attempt to induce the princess charlotte of wales to think that her father was an object not of reverence and regard but of disgrace  but we think it audacious in an hereditary counsellor of the king to admonish the heir apparent no we do not think it audacious it is constitutional and proper but are anonymous attacks the constitutional duty of a peer of the realm is that the mode in which he should admonish the heir apparent if lord byron had desired to admonish the prince his course was open plain and knownhe could have demanded an audience of the prince or he could have given his admonition in parliament but to level such an attackwhatkill men i the dark this however is called by the chronicle certainly british though it might not be courtly and a strong wish is expressed that the country had many more such honest advisers or admonishers admonishers indeed a pretty definition of admonition this which consists not in giving advice but in imputing blame not in openly proffering counsel but in secretly pointing censure                                               4 byroniana no i the courier february 5 1814   the lord byron has assumed such a poeticopolitical and such a politicopoetical air and authority that in our double capacity of men of letters and politicians he forces himself upon our recollection we say recollection for reasons which will bye and by be obvious to our readers and will lead them to wonder why this young lord whose greatest talent it is to forget and whose best praise it would be to be forgotten should be such an enthusiastic admirer of mr sam rogerss pleasures of memory  the most virulent satirists have ever been the most nauseous panegyrists and they are for the most part as offensive by the praise as by the abuse which they scatter  his lordship does not degenerate from the character of those worthy persons his poetical ancestors    the mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease  who of all authors dealt the most largely in the alternation of flattery and filth he is the severest satirical and the civilest dedicator of our day and what completes his reputation for candour good feeling and honesty is that the persons whom he most reviles and to whom he most fulsomely dedicates are identically the same  we shall indulge our readers with a few instancesthe most obvious case because the most recent is that of mr thomas moore to whom he has dedicated as we have already stated his last pamphlet but as we wish to proceed orderly we shall postpone this and revert to some instances prior in order of time we shall afterwards show that his lordship strictly adheres to horaces rule in maintaining to the end the ill character in which he appeared at the outset his lordships first dedication was to his guardian and relative the earl of carlisle so late as the year 1808 we find that lord byron was that noble lords most affectionate kinsman etc etc  hear how dutifully and affectionately this ingenuous young man celebrates in a few months after 1809 the praises of his friend    no muse will cheer with renovating smile   the paralytic puling of carlisle   what heterogeneous honours deck the peer   lord rhymester petitmaitre pamphleteer   so dull in youth so drivelling in age   his scenes alone had damnd our sinking stage   but managers for once cried hold enough   nor druggd their audience with the tragic stuff   yet at their judgment let his lordship laugh   and case his volumes in congenial calf   yes doff that covering where morocco shines   and hang a calfskin on those recreant lines  and in explanation of this affectionate effusion our lordly dedicator subjoins a note to inform us that lord carlisles works are splendidly bound but that the rest is all but leather and prunella and a little after in a very laborious note in which he endeavours to defend his consistency he outherods herod or to speak more forcibly outbyrons byron in the virulence of his invective against his guardian and relative to whom he dedicated his volume of puerile poems lord carlisle has it seems if we are to believe his word for a series of years beguiled the public with reams of most orthodox imperial nonsense and lord byron concludes by asking    what can ennoble knaves or fools or cowards    alas not all the blood of all the howards  so says pope adds lord byron but pope does not say so the words knaves and fools are not in pope but interpolated by lord byron in favour of his guardian and relative now all this might have slept in oblivion with lord carlisles dramas and lord byrons poems but if this young gentleman chooses to erect himself into a spokesman of the public opinion it becomes worth while to consider to what notice he is entitled when he affects a tone of criticism and an air of candour he obliges us to enquire whether he has any just pretensions to either and when he arrogates the high functions of public praise and public censure we may fairly inquire what the praise or censure of such a being is worth    thus bad begins but worse remains behind                                               5 byroniana no 2 the courier february 8 1814   crede byron is lord byrons armorial motto trust byron is the translation in the redbook we cannot but admire the ingenuity with which his lordship has converted the good faith of his ancestors into a sarcasm on his own duplicity    could nothing but your chief reproach   serve for a motto on your coach  poor lord carlisle he no doubt trusted in his affectionate ward and kinsman and we have seen how the affectionate ward and kinsman acknowledged like macbeth the double trust only to abuse it we shall now show how much another noble peer lord holland has to trust to from his ingenuous dedicator  some time last year lord byron published a poem called the bride of abydos which was inscribed to lord holland with every sentiment of regard and respect by his gratefully obliged and sincere friend byron grateful and sincere alas alas tis not even so good as what shakespeare in contempt calls the sincerity of a cold heart regard and respect hear with what regard and how much respect he treats this identical lord holland in a tirade against literary assassins a class of men which lord byron may well feel entitled to describe we have these lines addressed to the chief of the critical banditti    known be thy name unbounded be thy sway    thy hollands banquets shall each toil repay    while grateful britain yields the praise she owes    to hollands hirelings and to learnings foes  by which it appears that    these wolves that still in darkness prowl    this coward brood which mangle as their prey    by hellish instinct all that cross their way  are hired by lord holland and it follows very naturally that the hirelings of lord holland must be the foes of learning  this seems sufficiently caustic but hear how our dedicator proceeds    illustrious holland hard would be his lot    his hirelings mentiond and himself forgot    blest be the banquets spread at holland house    where scotchmen feed and critics may carouse    long long beneath that hospitable roof    shall grubstreet dine while duns are kept aloof    and grateful to the founder of the feast    declare the landlord can translate at least  lord byron has it seems very accurate notions of gratitude and the word grateful in these lines and in his dedication of the bride of abydos has a delightful similarity of meaning his lordship is pleased to add in an explanatory note to this passage that lord hollands life of lopez de vega and his translated specimens of that author are much bepraised by these disinterested guests lord byron well knows that bepraise and bespatter are almost synonimous there was but one point on which he could have any hope of touching lord holland more nearly and of course he avails himself in the most gentlemanly and generous manner of the golden opportunity  when his club of literary assassins is assembled at lord hollands table lord byron informs us    that lest when heated with the unusual grape    some glowing thoughts should to the press escape    and tinge with red the female readers cheek    my lady skims the cream of each critique    breathes oer each page her purity of soul    reforms each error and refines the whole  our readers will no doubt duly appreciate the manliness and generosity of these lines but to encrease their admiration we beg to remind them that the next time lord byron addresses lord holland it is to dedicate to him in all friendship sincerity and gratitude the story of a young a pure an amiable and an affectionate bride  the verses were bad enough but what shall be said after such verses of the insult of such a dedication  we forbear to extract any further specimens of this peculiar vein of lord byrons satire our gorge rises at it and we regret to have been obliged to say so much and yet lord byron is with all regard and respect lord hollands sincere and grateful friend it reminds us of the respect which lears daughters shewed their father and which the poor old king felt to be worse than murder  some of our readers may perhaps observe that personally lord holland was not so illtreated as lord carlisle but let it be recollected that lord holland is only an acquaintance while lord carlisle was guardian and relation and had therefore peculiar claims to the ingratitude of a mind like lord byrons  trust byron indeed him as hamlet says     him i would trust as i would adders fangd                                               6 byroniana no 3 the courier february 12 1814 crede byrontrust byron  we have seen lord byrons past and present opinions of two noble persons whom he has honoured with his satire and vilified by his dedications let us now compare the evidence which he has given at different and yet not distant times on the merits of his third dedicatee mr thomas moore to him lord byron has inscribed his last poem as a person of unshaken public principle and the most undoubted and various talents as the firmest of irish patriots and the first of irish bards  before we proceed to give lord byrons own judgment of this firmest of patriots and this best of poets we must be allowed to say that though we consider mr moore as a very good writer of songs we should very much complain of the poetical supremacy assigned to him if lord byron had not qualified it by calling him the first only of irish poets and as we suppose his lordship must mean of irish poets of the present day the title may be for aught we know to the contrary perfectly appropriate but we cannot conceive how mr moore comes by the highsounding name of patriot what pretence there is for such an appellation by what effort of intellect or of courage he has placed his name above those idols of irish worship messrs scully connell and dromgoole mr moore has written words to irish tunes so did burns for his national airs but who ever called burns the firmest of patriots on the score of his contributions to the scots magazine  mr moore we are aware has been accused of tuning his harpsichord to the keynote of a faction and of substituting wherever he could a party spirit for the spirit of poetry this in the opinion of most persons would derogate even from his poetical character but we hope that lord byron stands alone in considering that such a prostitution of the muse entitles him to the name of patriot mr moore it seems is an irishman and we believe a roman catholic he appears to be at least in his poetry no great friend to the connexion of ireland with england one or two of his ditties are quoted in ireland as laments upon certain worthy persons whose lives were terminated by the hand of the law in some of the unfortunate disturbances which have afflicted that country and one of his most admired songs begins with a stanza which we hope the attorneygeneral will pardon us for quoting    let erin remember the days of old     ere her faithless sons betrayed her   when malachy wore the collar of gold     which he won from her proud invader   when her kings with standard of green unfurld     led the red branch knights to danger   ere the emerald gem of the western world     was set in the crown of a stranger  this will pretty well satisfy an english reader that if it be any ingredient of patriotism to promote the affectionate connexion of the english isles under the constitutional settlement made at the revolution and at the union and if the foregoing verses speak mr moores sentiments he has the same claims to the name of patriot that lord byron has to the title of trustworthy but if these and similar verses do not speak mr moores political sentiments then undoubtedly he has never written or at least published any thing relating to public affairs and lord byron has no kind of pretence for talking of the political character and public principles of an humble individual who is only known as the translator of anacreon and the writer composer and singer of certain songs which songs do not exhypothesi speak the sentiments even of the writer himself  but holdwe had forgot one circumstance mr moore has been said to be one of the authors of certain verses on the highest characters of the state which appeared from time to time in the morning chronicle and which were afterwards collected into a little volume this may probably be in lord byrons opinion a clear title to the name of patriot in which case his lordship has also his claim to the same honour and indeed that sagacious and loyal person the editor of the morning chronicle seems to be of this notion for when some one ventured to express some we think not unnatural indignation at lord byrons having been the author of some impudent doggrels of the same vein which appeared anonymously in that paper reflecting on his royal highness the prince regent and her royal highness his daughter the editor beforementioned exclaimedwhat and is not a peer an hereditary councillor of the crown to be permitted to give his constitutional advice  if writing such vile and anonymous stuff as one sometimes reads in the morning chronicle be the duty of a good subject or the privilege of a peer of parliament then indeed we have nothing to object to mr moores title of patriot or lord byrons open honourable manly and constitutional method of advising the crown  to return however to our main object lord byrons consistency truth and trustworthiness  his lordship is pleased to call mr moore not only patriot and poet but he acquaints us also that he is the delight alike of his readers and his friends the poet of all circles and the idol of his own  let us now turn to lord byrons thricerecorded opinion of this poet of all circles we shall quote from a poem which was republished improved amended and reconsidered not more than three years ago since which time mr moore has published no poem whatsoever therefore lord byrons former and his present opinions are founded upon the same data and if they do not agree it really is no fault of mr moores who has published nothing to alter them    now look around and turn each trifling page   survey the precious works that please the age   while littles lyrics shine in hotpressed twelves  here by no great length of induction we find littles ie mr thomas moores lyrics are trifling precious works his lordship ironically adds that please times from which as his lordship says taste and reason are passed away  bye and by his lordship delivers a still more plain opinion on mr moores fitness to be the poet of all circles    who in soft guise surrounded by a quire   of virgins melting not to vestas fire   with sparkling eyes and cheek by passion flushd   strikes his wild lyre while listening dames are hushd   tis little young catullus of his day   as sweet but as immoral in his lay   grievd to condemn the muse must yet be just   nor spare melodious advocates of lust  o calum et terra as lingo says what this purest of patriots is immoral what the poet of all circles is the advocate of lust monstrous but who can doubt byron and his lordship in a subsequent passage does not hesitate to speak still more plainly and to declare in plain round terms we shudder while we copy that moore the poet the patriot moore is lewd  after this we humbly apprehend that if we were to trust byron mr moore however he may be the idol of his own circle would find some little difficulty in obtaining admittance into any other  lord byron having thus disposed as far as depended upon him of the moral character of the first of patriots and poets takes an early opportunity of doing justice to the personal honour of this dear friend one as his lordship expresses it of the magnificent and fiery spirited sons of erin  in 1806 says lord byron messrs jeffery and moore met at chalk farmthe duel was prevented by the interference of the magistracy and on examination the balls of the pistols like the courage of the combatants were found to have evaporated  magnificent and fiery spirit with a vengeance  we are far from thinking of mr moore as lord byron either did or does not so degradingly as his lordship did in 1810 not so extravagantly as he does in 1813 but we think that mr moore has grave reason of complaint and almost just cause to exert his fiery spirit against lord byron who has the effrontery to drag him twice before the public and overwhelm him one day with odium and another with ridicule  we regret that lord byron by obliging us to examine the value of his censures has forced us to contrast his past with his present judgments and to bring again before the public the objects of his lampoons and his flatteries we have however much less remorse in quoting his satire than his dedications for by this time we believe the whole world is inclined to admit that his lordship can pay no compliment so valuable as his censure nor offer any insult so intolerable as his praise                                            7 byroniana no 4 the courier february 17 1814     don pedro   what offence have these men done    dogberry    many sir they have committed false reports moreover                   they have spoken untruths secondarily they are                   slanders sixthly and lastly they have belied a lady                   thirdly they have verified unjust things and to                   conclude they are lying knaves  much  ado about nothing   we have already seen how scurvily lord byron has treated three of the four persons to whom he has successively dedicated his poems but for the fourth he reserved a species of contumely which we are confident our readers will think more degrading than all the rest he has uniformly praised him and him alonethe exalted rank the gentle manners the polished taste of his guardian and relation lord carlisle the considerations due to lord holland from his family his personal character and his love of letters the amiability of mr moores society the sweetness of his versification and the vivacity of his imaginationall these could not save their possessors from the brutality of lord byrons personal satire  it was then for a person only who should have none of these titles to his envy that his lordship could be expected to reserve the fullness and steadiness of his friendship and if we had any respect or regard for that small poet and very disagreeable person mr sam rogers we should heartily pity him for being damned to such fame as lord byrons uninterrupted praise can give  but mr sam rogers has another cause of complaint against lord byron and which he is of a taste to resent more his lordship has not deigned to call him the firmest of patriots though we have heard that his claims to that title are not much inferior to mr moores mr sam rogers is reported to have clubbd with the irish anacreon in that scurrilous collection of verses which we have before mentioned and which were published under the title of the twopenny postbag and the assumed name of thomas brown the rumour may be unfounded if it be messrs rogers and moore will easily forgive us for saying that much as we are astonished at the effrontery with which lord byron has acknowledged his lampoon we infinitely prefer it to the cowardly prudence of the author or authors of the twopenny postbag lurking behind a fictitious name and devising impossible slanders which he or they have not the spirit to avow  but to return to the more immediate subject of our lucubrations it seems almost like a fatality that lord byron has hardly ever praised any thing that he has not at some other period censured or censured any thing that he has not by and bye praised or practised  it does not often happen that booksellers are assailed for their too great liberality to authors yet in lord byrons satire while mr scott is abused his publisher mr murray is sneered at in the following lines    and thinkst them scott by vain conceit perchance   on public taste to foist thy stale romance   though murray with his miller may combine   to yield thy muse just halfacrown a line   no when the sons of song descend to trade   their bays are sear their former laurels fade   let such forego the poets sacred name   who rack their brains for lucre not for fame   low may they sink to merited contempt   and scorn remunerate the mean attempt  now is it not almost incredible that this very murray the only remaining one of the booksellers whom his lordship had attacked miller has left the tradeis it not we say almost incredible that this very murray should have been soon after selected by this very lord byron to be his own publisher but what will our readers say when we assure them that not only was murray so selected but that this magnanimous young lord has actually sold his works to this same murray and what is a yet more singular circumstance has received and pocketted for one of his own stale romances a sum amounting not to halfacrown but to a whole crown a line  this fact monstrous as it seems in the author of the foregoing lines is we have the fullest reason to believe accurately true and the faded laurel the brains racd for lucre the merited contempt the scorn and the meanness which this impudent young man dared to attribute to mr scott appear to have been a mere anticipation of his own future proceedings and thus            evenhanded justice   commends the ingredients of his poisond chalice   to his own lips  how he now likes the taste of it we do not know about as much we suspect as the incestuous murderous damned dane did when hamlet obliged him to drink off the potion which he had treacherously drugged for the destruction of others                                               8 byroniana no 5 the courier february 19 1814     he professes no keeping oaths in breaking them he is stronger than   hercules he will lie sir with such volubility that you would think   truth were a fool  alls well that ends well   we have we should hope sufficiently exposed the audacious levity and waywardness of lord byrons mind and yet there are a few touches which we think will give a finish to the portrait and add if it be at all wanting to the strength of the resemblance                                it must be amusing to those who know anything of lord byron in the circles of london to find him magnanimously defying in very stout heroics            all the din of melbourne house and lambes resentment  and adding that he is unscared even by hollands spouse                                to those who may be in the habit of hearing his lordships political descants the following extract will appear equally curious    mr brougham in no 25 of the edinburgh review throughout the   article concerning don pedro cevallos has displayed more politics   than policy many of the worthy burgesses of edinburgh being so   incensed at the infamous principles it evinces as to have   withdrawn their subscriptions and in the text of this poem to which   the foregoing is a note he advises the editor of the review to      beware lest blundering brougham destroy the sale     turn beef to bannacks cauliflower to kail  those who have attended to his lordships progress as an author and observed that he has published four poems in little more than two years will start at the following lines                    oh cease thy song     a bard may chaunt too often and too long     as thou art strong in verse in mercy spare     a fourth alas were more than we could bear  and as the scene of each of these four poems is laid in the levant it is curious to recollect that when his lordship informed the world that he was about to visit africs coast and calpes height and stambouls minarets and beautys native clime he enters into a voluntary and solemn engagement with the public      that should he back return no letterd rage     shall drag his commonplace book on the stage     of dardan tours let dilettanti tell     hell leave topography to classic cell     and quite content no more shall interpose     to stun mankind with poetry or prose  and yet we have already had growing out of this tour four volumes of poetry enriched with copious notes in prose selected from his commonplace book the whole interspersed every here and there with the most convincing proofs that instead of being quite content his lordship has returned as he went out the most discontented and peevish thing that breathes  but the passage of all others which gives us the most delight is that in which his lordship attacks his critics and declares that      our men in buckram shall have blows

are informed of the exact moment at which all retort is to cease at which misrepresentation towards the public and outrage towards the personages much more than insulted in those lines is to be no longer remembered what privileges does this writer claim for his friends they are to live in all the swilld insolence of attack upon those on whose character union and welfare the public prosperity mainly depends they are to instruct the daughter to hold the father disgraced because he does not surrender the prime offices of the state to their ambition and if after this public disgust make the author feel in the midst of the little circle of flatterers that remains to him what an insight he has given into the guilt of satire before maturity before experience before knowledge if the original unprovoked intruder upon the peace of others be thus taught a love of privacy and a facility of retraction if turnus have found the time        magno cum optaverit emptum   intactum pallanta et cum

and we are not the only persons who feel disgust as well as astonishment at the uncalled for avowal lord byron has made of being the author of some insolent lines by inserting them at the end of his new poem entitled the corsair the lines we allude to begin weep daughter of a royal line nothing can be more repugnant to every good heart as well as to the moral and religious feelings of a country which we are proud to say still cherishes every right sentiment than an attempt to lower a father in the eyes of his child lord byron is a young man and from the tenor of his writings has we fear adopted principles very contrary to those of christianity but as a man of honour and of feeling which latter character he affects outrageously he ought never to have been guilty of so unamiable and so unprovoked an attack should so gross an insult to her royal father ever meet the eyes of the illustrious young lady for whose perusal it was intended we trust her own good sense and good heart will teach her to consider it with the contempt and abhorrence it so well merits will she weep for the disgrace of a father who has saved europe from bondage and has accumulated in the short space of two years more glory than can be found in any other period of british history will she weep for a realms decay when that realm is hourly emerging under the government of her father from the complicated embarrassments in which he found it involved but all this is too evident to need being particularised what seems most surprising is that lord byron should chuse to avow irish trash at a moment when every thing conspires to give it the lie it is for the organ of the party alone or a few insane admirers of bonaparte and defamers of their own country and its rulers to applaud him we know it is now the fashion for our young gentlemen to become poets and a very innocent amusement it is while they confine themselves to putting their travels into verse like childe harolde and lord nugents portugal nor is there any harm in turkish tales nor wonderful ditties of ghosts and hobgoblins we cannot say so much for all mr moores productions admired as he is by lord byron in short the whole galaxy of minor poets lords nugent and byron with messrs rogers lewis and moore would do well to keep to rhyme and not presume to meddle with politics for which they seem mighty little qualified we must repeat that it is innocent to write tales and travels in verse but calumny can never be so whether written by poets in st jamessstreet albany or grubstreet                                               4

verax                                               10 lord byron morning post february 18 1814   if it was the object of lord byron to stamp his character and to bring his name forward by a single act of his life into general notoriety it must be confessed that he has completely succeeded we do not recollect any former instance in which a peer has stood forth as the libeller of his sovereign if he disapproves the measures of his ministers the house of parliament in which he has an hereditary right to sit is the place where his opinions may with propriety be uttered if he thinks he can avert any danger to his country by a personal conference with his sovereign he has a right to demand it the peers are the natural advisers of the crown but the constitution which has granted them such extraordinary privileges makes it doubly criminal in them to attack the authority from which it is derived and to insult the power which it is their peculiar province to uphold and protect what then must we think of the foolish vanity or the bad taste of a titled poet who is the first to proclaim himself the author of a libel because he is fearful it will not be sufficiently read without his avowal we perfectly remember having read the verses in question a year ago but we could not then suppose them the offspring of patrician bile nor should we now believe it without the authors special authority it seems by some late quotations from his lordships works which have been rescued from that oblivion to which they were hastening with a rapid step by one of our coequals that this peerless peer has already gone through a complete course of private ingratitude the inimitable hogarth has traced the gradual workings of an unfeeling heart in his progress of cruelty he has shewn that malevolence is progressive in its operation and that a man who begins life by impaling flies will find a delight in torturing his fellow creatures before he closes it we have heard that even at school these poetical propensities were strongly manifested in lord byron and that he began his satirical career against those persons to whom the formation of his mind was entrusted from his schoolmaster he turned the oestrum of his opening genius to his guardian and uncle the earl of carlisle we cannot believe that the noble persons conduct has in this instance been a perfect contrast to the general tenor of his life we have heard that during his guardianship he tripled the amount of his nephews fortune if the earl of carlisle was satisfied with his own conscia mens recti if he wanted no thanks he must at least have been much surprised to find such attentions and services rewarded with a libel in which not only his literary accomplishments but his bodily infirmities were made the subject of public ridicule the noble earl was certainly at liberty to treat such personal attacks with the contempt which they deserve but since his sovereign is become the object of a vile and unprovoked libel he will no doubt draw the attention of his peers to a new case of outrage to good order and government which has been unfortunately furnished by his own nephew                                               iii the sun   1 lord byron and the morning chronicle  the sun february 4 1814  that poetical peer lord byron knowing full well that anything insulting to his prince or injurious to his country would be most thankfully received and published by the morning chronicle did in march 1812 send the following loyal and patriotic lines to that loyal and patriotic paper in which of course they appeared     to a lady weeping    weep daughter of a royal line     a sires disgrace a realms decay   ah happy if each tear of thine     could wash a fathers fault away    weepfor thy tears are virtues tears     auspicious to these suffering isles   and be each drop in future years     repaid thee by thy peoples smiles   these lines the morning chronicle in the following paragraph of yesterday informs us were aimed at the prince regent and addressed to the princess charlotte    the courier is indignant at the discovery now made by lord byron   that he was the author of the verses to a young lady weeping which   were inserted about a twelvemonth ago in the morning chronicle the   editor thinks it audacious in a hereditary counsellor of the king to   admonish the heir apparent it may not be courtly but it is   certainly british and we wish the kingdom had more such honest   advisers  no wonder the courier and every loyal man should be indignant at the discovery made by the republication of these worthless lines in the noble lords new volume that this gross insult came from the pen of a hereditary counsellor of the king no wonder every good subject should execrate this novel and disagreeable mode of admonishing the heir apparent which is further from being british than it is from being courtly for from courtier baseness may be expected but from a briton no such infamous dereliction of his duty as is involved in a malignant anonymous attack by a peer of the realm upon the person exercising the sovereign authority of his country but the assertions of lord byron are as false as they are audacious what was the sires disgrace to be thus bewept he preferred the independence of the crown to the arrogant dictation of a haughty aristocracy who desired to hold him in leadingstrings it was then amid a realms fancied decay because this faction were not admitted to supreme power that his royal highnesss early friends drunk his health in contemptuous silence while their more vulgar partizans at the lower end of the hall hissed and hooted the royal name but mark the reverse since march 1812 a reverse which it might have been thought would have induced the noble lord from prudent motives to have withheld this illtimed publication how is his royal highnesss health toasted now with universal shouts and acclamations treason itself dare not interpose a single discordant sound save in its own private orgies where is now the realms decay oh shortsighted prognosticators of the prophecies look around and dread the fate of the speakers of falsehood among the jews of old who were stoned to death by the people the wide world furnishes the answer to your selfish croakings and tells lord byron that he is destitute of at least one of the qualities of an inspired bard  perhaps we might add another viz honesty in acknowledging his plagiarisms one of which as we have already said more than his silly verse above quoted deserves except from the rank of its author we shall take the liberty of stating to the public  the bride of abydos begins something in the stile of an old ballad thus    know ye the land where the cypress and myrtle   are emblems of deeds that are done in their clime   where the rage of the vulturethe love of the turtle   now melt into sorrownow madden to crime   know ye the land of the cedar and vine   where the flowers ever blossom the beams ever shine   where the light wings of zephyr oppressd with perfume   wax faint oer the gardens of g√∫l in her bloom   where the citron and olive are fairest of fruit   and the voice of the nightingale never is mute   where the tints of the earth and the hues of the sky   in colour though varied in beauty may vie   and the purple of ocean is deepest in dye  the whole of which passage we take to be a paraphrase and a bad paraphrase too of a song of the german of g√∂the of which the following translation was published at berlin in 1798    knowst thou the land where citrons scent the gale   where glows the orange in the golden vale   where softer breezes fan the azure skies   where myrtles spring and prouder laurels rise   knowst them the pile the colonnade sustains   its splendid chambers and its rich domains   where breathing statues stand in bright array   and seem what ails thee hapless maid to say    knowst thou the mount where clouds obscure the day   where scarce the mule can trace his misty way   where lurks the dragon and her scaly brood   and broken rocks oppose the headlong flood                                               2 epigram the sun february 8 1814   on the detection of lord byrons plagiarism in the sun of friday last     that byron borrows verses is well known   but his misanthropy is all his own                                               3 lord byron the sun february 11 1814     we are informed from very good authority that as soon as the house of   lords meets again a peer of very independent principles and character   intends to give notice of a motion occasioned by the late spontaneous   avowal of a copy of verses by lord byron addressed to the princess   charlotte of wales in which he has taken the most unwarrantable   liberties with her august fathers character and conduct this motion   being of a personal nature it will be necessary to give the noble   satirist some days notice that he may prepare himself for his defence   against a charge of so aggravated a nature which may perhaps not be a   fit subject for a criminal prosecution as the laws of the country   not forseeing the probability of such a case ever occurring under all   the present circumstances have not made a provision against it but   we know that each house of parliament has a controul over its own   members and that there are instances on the journals of parliament   where an individual peer has been suspended from all the privileges of   the high situation to which his birth entitled him when by any   flagrant offence against good order and government he has rendered   himself unworthy of exercising so important a trust  morning post                                               4 parody the sun february 16 1814
