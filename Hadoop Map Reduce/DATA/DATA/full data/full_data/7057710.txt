chivalry in westminster hall in memoriamw m thackeray adelaide anne procter chauncey hare townshend on mr fechters acting     the agricultural interest    the present government having shown itself to be particularly clever in its management of indictments for conspiracy cannot do better we think keeping in its administrative eye the pacification of some of its most influential and most unruly supporters than indict the whole manufacturing interest of the country for a conspiracy against the agricultural interest  as the jury ought to be beyond impeachment the panel might be chosen among the duke of buckinghams tenants with the duke of buckingham himself as foreman and to the end that the country might be quite satisfied with the judge and have ample security beforehand for his moderation and impartiality it would be desirable perhaps to make such a slight change in the working of the law a mere nothing to a conservative government bent upon its end as would enable the question to be tried before an ecclesiastical court with the bishop of exeter presiding  the attorneygeneral for ireland turning his sword into a ploughshare might conduct the prosecution and mr cobden and the other traversers might adopt any ground of defence they chose or prove or disprove anything they pleased without being embarrassed by the least anxiety or doubt in reference to the verdict  that the country in general is in a conspiracy against this sacred but unhappy agricultural interest there can be no doubt  it is not alone within the walls of covent garden theatre or the free trade hall at manchester or the town hall at birmingham that the cry repeal the cornlaws is raised  it may be heard moaning at night through the strawlittered wards of refuges for the destitute it may be read in the gaunt and famished faces which make our streets terrible it is muttered in the thankful grace pronounced by haggard wretches over their felon fare in gaols it is inscribed in dreadful characters upon the walls of fever hospitals and may be plainly traced in every record of mortality  all of which proves that there is a vast conspiracy afoot against the unfortunate agricultural interest  they who run even upon railroads may read of this conspiracy  the old stagecoachman was a farmers friend  he wore topboots understood cattle fed his horses upon corn and had a lively personal interest in malt  the enginedrivers garb and sympathies and tastes belong to the factory  his fustian dress besmeared with coaldust and begrimed with soot his oily hands his dirty face his knowledge of machinery all point him out as one devoted to the manufacturing interest  fire and smoke and redhot cinders follow in his wake  he has no attachment to the soil but travels on a road of iron furnace wrought  his warning is not conveyed in the fine old saxon dialect of our glorious forefathers but in a fiendish yell  he never cries yahip with agricultural lungs but jerks forth a manufactured shriek from a brazen throat  where is the agricultural interest represented  from what phase of our social life has it not been driven to the undue setting up of its false rival  are the police agricultural  the watchmen were  they wore woollen nightcaps to a man they encouraged the growth of timber by patriotically adhering to staves and rattles of immense size they slept every night in boxes which were but another form of the celebrated wooden walls of old england they never woke up till it was too latein which respect you might have thought them very farmers  how is it with the police  their buttons are made at birmingham a dozen of their truncheons would poorly furnish forth a watchmans staff they have no wooden walls to repose between and the crowns of their hats are plated with castiron  are the doctors agricultural  let messrs morison and moat of the hygeian establishment at kings cross london reply  is it not upon the constant showing of those gentlemen an ascertained fact that the whole medical profession have united to depreciate the worth of the universal vegetable medicines  and is this opposition to vegetables and exaltation of steel and iron instead on the part of the regular practitioners capable of any interpretation but one is it not a distinct renouncement of the agricultural interest and a setting up of the manufacturing interest instead  do the professors of the law at all fail in their truth to the beautiful maid whom they ought to adore  inquire of the attorney general for ireland  inquire of that honourable and learned gentleman whose last public act was to cast aside the grey goose quill an article of agricultural produce and take up the pistol which under the system of percussion locks has not even a flint to connect it with farming  or put the question to a still higher legal functionary who on the same occasion when he should have been a reed inclining here and there as adverse gales of evidence disposed him was seen to be a manufactured image on the seat of justice cast by power in most impenetrable brass  the world is too much with us in this manufacturing interest early and late that is the great complaint and the great truth  it is not so with the agricultural interest or what passes by that name it never thinks of the suffering world or sees it or cares to extend its knowledge of it or so long as it remains a world cares anything about it  all those whom dante placed in the first pit or circle of the doleful regions might have represented the agricultural interest in the present parliament or at quarter sessions or at meetings of the farmers friends or anywhere else  but that is not the question now  it is conspired against and we have given a few proofs of the conspiracy as they shine out of various classes engaged in it  an indictment against the whole manufacturing interest need not be longer surely than the indictment in the case of the crown against oconnell and others mr cobden may be taken as its representativeas indeed he is by one consent already  there may be no evidence but that is not required  a judge and jury are all that is needed  and the government know where to find them or they gain experience to little purpose    threatening letter to thomas hood from an ancient gentleman    mr hood  sirthe constitution is going at last  you neednt laugh mr hood  i am aware that it has been going two or three times before perhaps four times but it is on the move now sir and no mistake  i beg to say that i use those last expressions advisedly sir and not in the sense in which they are now used by jackanapeses  there were no jackanapeses when i was a boy mr hood  england was old england when i was young  i little thought it would ever come to be young england when i was old  but everything is going backward  ah governments were governments and judges were judges in my day mr hood  there was no nonsense then  any of your seditious complainings and we were ready with the military on the shortest notice  we should have charged covent garden theatre sir on a wednesday night  at the point of the bayonet  then the judges were full of dignity and firmness and knew how to administer the law  there is only one judge who knows how to do his duty now  he tried that revolutionary female the other day who though she was in full work making shirts at threehalfpence a piece had no pride in her country but treasonably took it in her head in the distraction of having been robbed of her easy earnings to attempt to drown herself and her young child and the glorious man went out of his way sirout of his wayto call her up for instant sentence of death and to tell her she had no hope of mercy in this worldas you may see yourself if you look in the papers of wednesday the 17th of april  he wont be supported sir i know he wont but it is worth remembering that his words were carried into every manufacturing town of this kingdom and read aloud to crowds in every political parlour beershop newsroom and secret or open place of assembly frequented by the discontented workingmen and that no milkandwater weakness on the part of the executive can ever blot them out  great things like that are caught up and stored up in these times and are not forgotten mr hood  the public at large especially those who wish for peace and conciliation are universally obliged to him  if it is reserved for any man to set the thames on fire it is reserved for him and indeed i am told he very nearly did it once  but even he wont save the constitution sir  it is mauled beyond the power of preservation  do you know in what foul weather it will be sacrificed and shipwrecked mr hood  do you know on what rock it will strike sir  you dont i am certain for nobody does know as yet but myself  i will tell you  the constitution will go down sir nautically speaking in the degeneration of the human species in england and its reduction into a mingled race of savages and pigmies  that is my proposition  that is my prediction  that is the event of which i give you warning  i am now going to prove it sir  you are a literary man mr hood and have written i am told some things worth reading  i say i am told because i never read what is written in these days  youll excuse me but my principle is that no man ought to know anything about his own time except that it is the worst time that ever was or is ever likely to be  that is the only way sir to be truly wise and happy  in your station as a literary man mr hood you are frequently at the court of her gracious majesty the queen  god bless her  you have reason to know that the three great keys to the royal palace after rank and politics are science literature art  i dont approve of this myself  i think it ungenteel and barbarous and quite unenglish the custom having been a foreign one ever since the reigns of the uncivilised sultans in the arabian nights who always called the wise men of their time about them  but so it is and when you dont dine at the royal table there is always a knife and fork for you at the equerries table  where i understand all gifted men are made particularly welcome  but all men cant be gifted mr hood  neither scientific literary nor artistical powers are any more to be inherited than the property arising from scientific literary or artistic productions which the law with a beautiful imitation of nature declines to protect in the second generation  very good sir then people are naturally very prone to cast about in their minds for other means of getting at court favour and watching the signs of the times to hew out for themselves or their descendants the likeliest roads to that distinguished goal  mr hood it is pretty clear from recent records in the court circular that if a father wish to train up his son in the way he should go to go to court  and cannot indenture him to be a scientific man an author or an artist three courses are open to him  he must endeavour by artificial means to make him a dwarf a wild man or a boy jones  now sir this is the shoal and quicksand on which the constitution will go to pieces  i have made inquiry mr hood and find that in my neighbourhood two families and a fraction out of every four in the lower and middle classes of society are studying and practising all conceivable arts to keep their infant children down  understand me  i do not mean down in their numbers or down in their precocity but down in their growth sir  a destructive and subduing drink compounded of gin and milk in equal quantities such as is given to puppies to retard their growth  not something short but something shortening  is administered to these young creatures many times a day  an unnatural and artificial thirst is first awakened in these infants by meals of salt beef bacon anchovies sardines red herrings shrimps olives peasoup and that description of diet and when they screech for drink in accents that might melt a heart of stone which they do constantly i allude to screeching not to melting this liquid is introduced into their too confiding stomachs  at such an early age and to so great an extent is this custom of provoking thirst then quenching it with a stunting drink observed that brine pap has already superseded the use of topsandbottoms and wetnurses previously free from any kind of reproach have been seen to stagger in the streets  owing sir to the quantity of gin introduced into their systems with a view to its gradual and natural conversion into the fluid i have already mentioned  upon the best calculation i can make this is going on as i have said in the proportion of about two families and a fraction in four  in one more family and a fraction out of the same number efforts are being made to reduce the children to a state of nature and to inculcate at a tender age the love of raw flesh train oil new rum and the acquisition of scalps  wild and outlandish dances are also in vogue you will have observed the prevailing rage for the polka and savage cries and whoops are much indulged in as you may discover if you doubt it in the house of commons any night nay some persons mr hood and persons of some figure and distinction too have already succeeded in breeding wild sons who have been publicly shown in the courts of bankruptcy and in police offices and in other commodious exhibitionrooms with great effect but who have not yet found favour at court in consequence as i infer of the impression made by mr rankins wild men being too fresh and recent to say nothing of mr rankins wild men being foreigners  i need not refer you sir to the late instance of the ojibbeway bride  but i am credibly informed that she is on the eve of retiring into a savage fastness where she may bring forth and educate a wild family who shall in course of time by the dexterous use of the popularity they are certain to acquire at windsor and st jamess divide with dwarfs the principal offices of state of patronage and power in the united kingdom  consider the deplorable consequences mr hood which must result from these proceedings and the encouragement they receive in the highest quarters  the dwarf being the favourite sir it is certain that the public mind will run in a great and eminent degree upon the production of dwarfs  perhaps the failures only will be brought up wild  the imagination goes a long way in these cases and all that the imagination can do will be done and is doing  you may convince yourself of this by observing the condition of those ladies who take particular notice of general tom thumb at the egyptian hall during his hours of performance  the rapid increase of dwarfs will be first felt in her majestys recruiting department  the standard will of necessity be lowered the dwarfs will grow smaller and smaller the vulgar expression a man of his inches will become a figure of fact instead of a figure of speech crack regiments householdtroops especially will pick the smallest men from all parts of the country and in the two little porticoes at the horse guards two tom thumbs will be daily seen doing duty mounted on a pair of shetland ponies  each of them will be relieved as tom thumb is at this moment in the intervals of his performance by a wild man and a british grenadier will either go into a quart pot or be an old boy or blue gull or flying bull or some other savage chief of that nature  i will not expatiate upon the number of dwarfs who will be found representing grecian statues in all parts of the metropolis because i am inclined to think that this will be a change for the better and that the engagement of two or three in trafalgar square will tend to the improvement of the public taste  the various genteel employments at court being held by dwarfs sir it will be necessary to alter in some respects the present regulations  it is quite clear that not even general tom thumb himself could preserve a becoming dignity on state occasions if required to walk about with a scaffoldingpole under his arm therefore the gold and silver sticks at present used must be cut down into skewers of those precious metals a twig of the black rod will be quite as much as can be conveniently preserved the coral and bells of his royal highness the prince of wales will be used in lieu of the mace at present in existence and that bauble as oliver cromwell called it mr hood its value being first calculated by mr finlayson the government actuary will be placed to the credit of the national debt  all this sir will be the death of the constitution  but this is not all  the constitution dies hard perhaps but there is enough disease impending mr hood to kill it three times over  wild men will get into the house of commons  imagine that sir imagine strong wind in the house of commons  it is not an easy matter to get through a debate now but i say imagine strong wind speaking for the benefit of his constituents upon the floor of the house of commons or imagine which is pregnant with more awful consequences still the ministry having an interpreter in the house of commons to tell the country in english what it really means  why sir that in itself would be blowing the constitution out of the mortar in st jamess park and leaving nothing of it to be seen but smoke  but this i repeat it is the state of things to which we are fast tending mr hood and i enclose my card for your private eye that you may be quite certain of it  what the condition of this country will be when its standing army is composed of dwarfs with here and there a wild man to throw its ranks into confusion like the elephants employed in war in former times i leave you to imagine sir  it may be objected by some hopeful jackanapeses that the number of impressments in the navy consequent upon the seizure of the boyjoneses or remaining portion of the population ambitious of court favour will be in itself sufficient to defend our island from foreign invasion  but i tell those jackanapeses sir that while i admit the wisdom of the boy jones precedent of kidnapping such youths after the expiration of their several terms of imprisonment as vagabonds hurrying them on board ship and packing them off to sea again whenever they venture to take the air on shore i deny the justice of the inference inasmuch as it appears to me that the inquiring minds of those young outlaws must naturally lead to their being hanged by the enemy as spies early in their career and before they shall have been rated on the books of our fleet as able seamen  such mr hood sir is the prospect before us  and unless you and some of your friends who have influence at court can get up a giant as a forlorn hope it is all over with this illfated land  in reference to your own affairs sir you will take whatever course may seem to you most prudent and advisable after this warning  it is not a warning to be slighted  that i happen to know  i am informed by the gentleman who favours this that you have recently been making some changes and improvements in your magazine and are in point of fact starting afresh  if i be well informed and this be really so rely upon it that you cannot start too small sir come down to the duodecimo size instantly mr hood  take time by the forelock and reducing the stature of your magazine every month bring it at last to the dimensions of the little almanack no longer issued i regret to say by the ingenious mr schloss  which was invisible to the naked eye until examined through a little eye glass  you project i am told the publication of a new novel by yourself in the pages of your magazine  a word in your ear  i am not a young man sir and have had some experience  dont put your own name on the titlepage it would be suicide and madness  treat with general tom thumb mr hood for the use of his name on any terms if the gallant general should decline to treat with you get mr barnums name which is the next best in the market  and when through this politic course you shall have received in presents a richly jewelled set of tablets from buckingham palace and a gold watch and appendages from marlborough house and when those valuable trinkets shall be left under a glass case at your publishers for inspection by your friends and the public in generalthen sir you will do me the justice of remembering this communication  it is unnecessary for me to add after what i have observed in the course of this letter that i am notsir ever your  constant reader  tuesday 23rd april 1844  psimpress it upon your contributors that they cannot be too short and that if not dwarfish they must be wildor at all events not tame    crime and education    i offer no apology for entreating the attention of the readers of the daily news to an effort which has been making for some three years and a half and which is making now to introduce among the most miserable and neglected outcasts in london some knowledge of the commonest principles of morality and religion to commence their recognition as immortal human creatures before the gaol chaplain becomes their only schoolmaster to suggest to society that its duty to this wretched throng foredoomed to crime and punishment rightfully begins at some distance from the police office and that the careless maintenance from year to year in this the capital city of the world of a vast hopeless nursery of ignorance misery and vice a breeding place for the hulks and jails  is horrible to contemplate  this attempt is being made in certain of the most obscure and squalid parts of the metropolis where rooms are opened at night for the gratuitous instruction of all comers children or adults under the title of ragged schools  the name implies the purpose they who are too ragged wretched filthy and forlorn to enter any other place  who could gain admission into no charity school and who would be driven from any church door are invited to come in here and find some people not depraved willing to teach them something and show them some sympathy and stretch a hand out which is not the iron hand of law for their correction  before i describe a visit of my own to a ragged school and urge the readers of this letter for gods sake to visit one themselves and think of it which is my main object let me say that i know the prisons of london well that i have visited the largest of them more times than i could count and that the children in them are enough to break the heart and hope of any man  i have never taken a foreigner or a stranger of any kind to one of these establishments but i have seen him so moved at sight of the child offenders and so affected by the contemplation of their utter renouncement and desolation outside the prison walls that he has been as little able to disguise his emotion as if some great grief had suddenly burst upon him  mr chesterton and lieutenant tracey than whom more intelligent and humane governors of prisons it would be hard if not impossible to find know perfectly well that these children pass and repass through the prisons all their lives that they are never taught that the first distinctions between right and wrong are from their cradles perfectly confounded and perverted in their minds that they come of untaught parents and will give birth to another untaught generation that in exact proportion to their natural abilities is the extent and scope of their depravity and that there is no escape or chance for them in any ordinary revolution of human affairs  happily there are schools in these prisons now  if any readers doubt how ignorant the children are let them visit those schools and see them at their tasks and hear how much they knew when they were sent there  if they would know the produce of this seed let them see a class of men and boys together at their books as i have seen them in the house of correction for this county of middlesex and mark how painfully the full grown felons toil at the very shape and form of letters their ignorance being so confirmed and solid  the contrast of this labour in the men with the less blunted quickness of the boys the latent shame and sense of degradation struggling through their dull attempts at infant lessons and the universal eagerness to learn impress me in this passing retrospect more painfully than i can tell  for the instruction and as a first step in the reformation of such unhappy beings the ragged schools were founded  i was first attracted to the subject and indeed was first made conscious of their existence about two years ago or more by seeing an advertisement in the papers dated from west street saffron hill stating that a room had been opened and supported in that wretched neighbourhood for upwards of twelve months where religious instruction had been imparted to the poor and explaining in a few words what was meant by ragged schools as a generic term including then four or five similar places of instruction  i wrote to the masters of this particular school to make some further inquiries and went myself soon afterwards  it was a hot summer night and the air of field lane and saffron hill was not improved by such weather nor were the people in those streets very sober or honest company  being unacquainted with the exact locality of the school i was fain to make some inquiries about it  these were very jocosely received in general but everybody knew where it was and gave the right direction to it the prevailing idea among the loungers the greater part of them the very sweepings of the streets and station houses seemed to be that the teachers were quixotic and the school upon the whole a lark but there was certainly a kind of rough respect for the intention and as i have said nobody denied the school or its whereabouts or refused assistance in directing to it  it consisted at that time of either two or threei forget which miserable rooms upstairs in a miserable house  in the best of these the pupils in the female school were being taught to read and write and though there were among the number many wretched creatures steeped in degradation to the lips they were tolerably quiet and listened with apparent earnestness and patience to their instructors  the appearance of this room was sad and melancholy of coursehow could it be otherwisebut on the whole encouraging  the close low chamber at the back in which the boys were crowded was so foul and stifling as to be at first almost insupportable but its moral aspect was so far worse than its physical that this was soon forgotten  huddled together on a bench about the room and shown out by some flaring candles stuck against the walls were a crowd of boys varying from mere infants to young men sellers of fruit herbs lucifermatches flints sleepers under the dry arches of bridges young thieves and beggarswith nothing natural to youth about them  with nothing frank ingenuous or pleasant in their faces lowbrowed vicious cunning wicked abandoned of all help but this speeding downward to destruction and unutterably ignorant  this reader was one room as full as it could hold but these were only grains in sample of a multitude that are perpetually sifting through these schools in sample of a multitude who had within them once and perhaps have now the elements of men as good as you or i and maybe infinitely better in sample of a multitude among whose doomed and sinful ranks oh think of this and think of them the child of any man upon this earth however lofty his degree must as by destiny and fate be found if at its birth it were consigned to such an infancy and nurture as these fallen creatures had  this was the class i saw at the ragged school  they could not be trusted with books they could only be instructed orally they were difficult of reduction to anything like attention obedience or decent behaviour their benighted ignorance in reference to the deity or to any social duty how could they guess at any social duty being so discarded by all social teachers but the gaoler and the hangman was terrible to see  yet even here and among these something had been done already  the ragged school was of recent date and very poor but he had inculcated some association with the name of the almighty which was not an oath and had taught them to look forward in a hymn they sang it to another life which would correct the miseries and woes of this  the new exposition i found in this ragged school of the frightful neglect by the state of those whom it punishes so constantly and whom it might as easily and less expensively instruct and save together with the sight i had seen there in the heart of london haunted me and finally impelled me to an endeavour to bring these institutions under the notice of the government with some faint hope that the vastness of the question would supersede the theology of the schools and that the bench of bishops might adjust the latter question after some small grant had been conceded  i made the attempt and have heard no more of the subject from that hour  the perusal of an advertisement in yesterdays paper announcing a lecture on the ragged schools last night has led me into these remarks  i might easily have given them another form but i address this letter to you in the hope that some few readers in whom i have awakened an interest as a writer of fiction may be by that means attracted to the subject who might otherwise unintentionally pass it over  i have no desire to praise the system pursued in the ragged schools which is necessarily very imperfect if indeed there be one  so far as i have any means of judging of what is taught there i should individually object to it as not being sufficiently secular and as presenting too many religious mysteries and difficulties to minds not sufficiently prepared for their reception  but i should very imperfectly discharge in myself the duty i wish to urge and impress on others if i allowed any such doubt of mine to interfere with my appreciation of the efforts of these teachers or my true wish to promote them by any slight means in my power  irritating topics of all kinds are equally far removed from my purpose and intention but i adjure those excellent persons who aid munificently in the building of new churches to think of these ragged schools to reflect whether some portion of their rich endowments might not be spared for such a purpose to contemplate calmly the necessity of beginning at the beginning to consider for themselves where the christian religion most needs and most suggests immediate help and illustration and not to decide on any theory or hearsay but to go themselves into the prisons and the ragged schools and form their own conclusions  they will be shocked pained and repelled by much that they learn there but nothing they can learn will be one thousandth part so shocking painful and repulsive as the continuance for one year more of these things as they have been for too many years already  anticipating that some of the more prominent facts connected with the history of the ragged schools may become known to the readers of the daily news through your account of the lecture in question i abstain though in possession of some such information from pursuing the question further at this time  but if i should see occasion i will take leave to return to it    capital punishment    i will take for the subject of this letter the effect of capital punishment on the commission of crime or rather of murder the only crime with one exception and that a rare one to which it is now applied  its effect in preventing crime i will reserve for another letter  and a few of the more striking illustrations of each aspect of the subject for a concluding one  the effect of capital punishment on the commission of murder  some murders are committed in hot blood and furious rage some in deliberate revenge some in terrible despair some but not many for mere gain some for the removal of an object dangerous to the murderers peace or good name some to win a monstrous notoriety  on murders committed in rage in the despair of strong affection as when a starving child is murdered by its parent or for gain i believe the punishment of death to have no effect in the least  in the two first cases the impulse is a blind and wild one infinitely beyond the reach of any reference to the punishment  in the last there is little calculation beyond the absorbing greed of the money to be got  courvoisier for example might have robbed his master with greater safety and with fewer chances of detection if he had not murdered him  but his calculations going to the gain and not to the loss he had no balance for the consequences of what he did so it would have been more safe and prudent in the woman who was hanged a few weeks since for the murder in westminster to have simply robbed her old companion in an unguarded moment as in her sleep  but her calculation going to the gain of what she took to be a bank note and the poor old woman living between her and the gain she murdered her  on murders committed in deliberate revenge or to remove a stumbling block in the murderers path or in an insatiate craving for notoriety is there reason to suppose that the punishment of death has the direct effect of an incentive and an impulse  a murder is committed in deliberate revenge  the murderer is at no trouble to prepare his train of circumstances takes little or no pains to escape is quite cool and collected perfectly content to deliver himself up to the police makes no secret of his guilt but boldly says i killed him  im glad of it  i meant to do it  i am ready to die  there was such a case the other day  there was such another case not long ago  there are such cases frequently it is the commonest first exclamation on being seized  now what is this but a false arguing of the question announcing a foregone conclusion expressly leading to the crime and inseparably arising out of the punishment of death  i took his life  i give up mine to pay for it  life for life blood for blood  i have done the crime  i am ready with the atonement  i know all about it its a fair bargain between me and the law  here am i to execute my part of it and what more is to be said or done  it is the very essence of the maintenance of this punishment for murder that it does set life against life  it is in the essence of a stupid weak or otherwise illregulated mind of such a murderers mind in short to recognise in this set off a something that diminishes the base and coward character of murder  in a pitched battle i a common man may kill my adversary but he may kill me  in a duel a gentleman may shoot his opponent through the head but the opponent may shoot him too and this makes it fair  very well  i take this mans life for a reason i have or choose to think i have and the law takes mine  the law says and the clergyman says there must be blood for blood and life for life  here it is  i pay the penalty  a mind incapable or confounded in its perceptionsand you must argue with reference to such a mind or you could not have such a murdermay not only establish on these grounds an idea of strict justice and fair reparation but a stubborn and dogged fortitude and foresight that satisfy it hugely  whether the fact be really so or not is a question i would be content to rest alone on the number of cases of revengeful murder in which this is well known without dispute to have been the prevailing demeanour of the criminal  and in which such speeches and such absurd reasoning have been constantly uppermost with him  blood for blood and life for life and such like balanced jingles have passed current in peoples mouths from legislators downwards until they have been corrupted into tit for tat and acted on  next come the murders done to sweep out of the way a dreaded or detested object  at the bottom of this class of crimes there is a slow corroding growing hate  violent quarrels are commonly found to have taken place between the murdered person and the murderer usually of opposite sexes  there are witnesses to old scenes of reproach and recrimination in which they were the actors and the murderer has been heard to say in this or that coarse phrase that he wouldnt mind killing her though he should be hanged for itin these cases the commonest avowal  it seems to me that in this wellknown scrap of evidence there is a deeper meaning than is usually attached to it  i do not know but it may bei have a strong suspicion that it isa clue to the slow growth of the crime and its gradual development in the mind  more than this a clue to the mental connection of the deed with the punishment to which the doer of that deed is liable until the two conjoined give birth to monstrous and misshapen murder  the idea of murder in such a case like that of selfdestruction in the great majority of instances is not a new one  it may have presented itself to the disturbed mind in a dim shape and afar off but it has been there  after a quarrel or with some strong sense upon him of irritation or discomfort arising out of the continuance of this life in his path the man has brooded over the unformed desire to take it  though he should be hanged for it  with the entrance of the punishment into his thoughts the shadow of the fatal beam begins to attendnot on himself but on the object of his hate  at every new temptation it is there stronger and blacker yet trying to terrify him  when she defies or threatens him the scaffold seems to be her strength and vantage ground let her not be too sure of that though he should be hanged for it  thus he begins to raise up in the contemplation of this death by hanging a new and violent enemy to brave  the prospect of a slow and solitary expiation would have no congeniality with his wicked thoughts but this throttling and strangling has  there is always before him an ugly bloody scarecrow phantom that champions her as it were and yet shows him in a ghastly way the example of murder  is she very weak or very trustful in him or infirm or old  it gives a hideous courage to what would be mere slaughter otherwise for there it is a presence always about her darkly menacing him with that penalty whose murky secret has a fascination for all secret and unwholesome thoughts  and when he struggles with his victim at the last though he should be hanged for it it is a merciless wrestle not with one weak life only but with that ever haunting everbeckoning shadow of the gallows too and with a fierce defiance to it after their long survey of each other to come on and do its worst  present this black idea of violence to a bad mind contemplating violence hold up before a man remotely compassing the death of another person the spectacle of his own ghastly and untimely death by mans hands and out of the depths of his own nature you shall assuredly raise up that which lures and tempts him on  the laws which regulate those mysteries have not been studied or cared for by the maintainers of this law but they are paramount and will always assert their power  out of one hundred and sixtyseven persons under sentence of death in england questioned at different times in the course of years by an english clergyman in the performance of his duty there were only three who had not been spectators of executions  we come now to the consideration of those murders which are committed or attempted with no other object than the attainment of an infamous notoriety  that this class of crimes has its origin in the punishment of death we cannot question because as we have already seen and shall presently establish by another proof great notoriety and interest attach and are generally understood to attach only to those criminals who are in danger of being executed  one of the most remarkable instances of murder originating in mad selfconceit and of the murderers part in the repulsive drama in which the law appears at such great disadvantage to itself and to society being acted almost to the last with a selfcomplacency that would be horribly ludicrous if it were not utterly revolting is presented in the case of hocker  here is an insolent flippant dissolute youth  aping the man of intrigue and levity  overdressed overconfident inordinately vain of his personal appearance  distinguished as to his hair cane snuffbox and singingvoice  and unhappily the son of a working shoemaker  bent on loftier flights than such a poor house swallow as a teacher in a sundayschool can take and having no truth industry perseverance or other dull workaday quality to plume his wings withal he casts about him in his jaunty way for some mode of distinguishing himselfsome means of getting that head of hair into the printshops of having something like justice done to his singingvoice and fine intellect of making the life and adventures of thomas hocker remarkable and of getting up some excitement in connection with that slighted piece of biography  the stage  no  not feasible  there has always been a conspiracy against the thomas hockers in that kind of effort  it has been the same with authorship in prose and poetry  is there nothing else  a murder now would make a noise in the papers  there is the gallows to be sure but without that it would be nothing  short of that it wouldnt be fame  well  we must all die at one time or other and to die game and have it in print is just the thing for a man of spirit  they always die game at the minor theatres and the saloons and the people like it very much  thurtell too died very game and made a capital speech when he was tried  theres all about it in a book at the cigarshop now  come tom get your name up  let it be a dashing murder that shall keep the woodengravers at it for the next two months  you are the boy to go through with it and interest the town  the miserable wretch inflated by this lunatic conceit arranges his whole plan for publication and effect  it is quite an epitome of his experience of the domestic melodrama or penny novel  there is the victim friend the mysterious letter of the injured female to the victim friend the romantic spot for the deathstruggle by night the unexpected appearance of thomas hocker to the policeman the parlour of the public house with thomas hocker reading the paper to a strange gentleman the family apartment with a song by thomas hocker the inquest room with thomas hocker boldly looking on the interior of the marylebone theatre with thomas hocker taken into custody the police office with thomas hocker affable to the spectators the interior of newgate with thomas hocker preparing his defence the court where thomas hocker with his dancingmaster airs is put upon his trial and complimented by the judge the prosecution the defence the verdict the black cap the sentence each of them a line in any playbill and how bold a line in thomas hockers life  it is worthy of remark that the nearer he approaches to the gallowsthe great last scene to which the whole of these effects have been working upthe more the overweening conceit of the poor wretch shows itself the more he feels that he is the hero of the hour the more audaciously and recklessly he lies in supporting the character  in publicat the condemned sermonhe deports himself as becomes the man whose autographs are precious whose portraits are innumerable in memory of whom whole fences and gates have been borne away in splinters from the scene of murder  he knows that the eyes of europe are upon him but he is not proudonly graceful he bows like the first gentleman in europe to the turnkey who brings him a glass of water and composes his clothes and hassock as carefully as good madame blaize could do  in privatewithin the walls of the condemned cellevery word and action of his waning life is a lie  his whole time is divided between telling lies and writing them  if he ever have another thought it is for his genteel appearance on the scaffold as when he begs the barber not to cut his hair too short or they wont know him when he comes out  his last proceeding but one is to write two romantic love letters to women who have no existence  his last proceeding of all but less characteristic though the only true one is to swoon away miserably in the arms of the attendants and be hanged up like a craven dog  is not such a history from first to last a most revolting and disgraceful one and can the student of it bring himself to believe that it ever could have place in any record of facts or that the miserable chiefactor in it could have ever had a motive for his arrogant wickedness but for the comment and the explanation which the punishment of death supplies  it is not a solitary case nor is it a prodigy but a mere specimen of a class  the case of oxford who fired at her majesty in the park will be found on examination to resemble it very nearly in the essential feature  there is no proved pretence whatever for regarding him as mad other than that he was like this malefactor brimful of conceit and a desire to become even at the cost of the gallows the only cost within his reach the talk of the town  he had less invention than hocker and perhaps was not so deliberately bad but his attempt was a branch of the same tree and it has its root in the ground where the scaffold is erected  oxford had his imitators  let it never be forgotten in the consideration of this part of the subject how they were stopped so long as attempts invested them with the distinction of being in danger of death at the hangmans hands so long did they spring up when the penalty of death was removed and a mean and humiliating punishment substituted in its place the race was at an end and ceased to be   ii   we come now to consider the effect of capital punishment in the prevention of crime  does it prevent crime in those who attend executions  there never is and there never was an execution at the old bailey in london but the spectators include two large classes of thieves one class who go there as they would go to a dogfight or any other brutal sport for the attraction and excitement of the spectacle the other who make it a dry matter of business and mix with the crowd solely to pick pockets  add to these the dissolute the drunken the most idle profligate and abandoned of both sexes some moody illconditioned minds drawn thither by a fearful interestand some impelled by curiosity of whom the greater part are of an age and temperament rendering the gratification of that curiosity highly dangerous to themselves and to societyand the great elements of the concourse are stated  nor is this assemblage peculiar to london  it is the same in country towns allowing for the different statistics of the population  it is the same in america  i was present at an execution in rome for a most treacherous and wicked murder and not only saw the same kind of assemblage there but wearing what is called a shootingcoat with a great many pockets in it felt innumerable hands busy in every one of them close to the scaffold  i have already mentioned that out of one hundred and sixtyseven convicts under sentence of death questioned at different times in the performance of his duty by an english clergyman there were only three who had not been spectators of executions  mr wakefield in his facts relating to the punishment of death goes into the working as it were of this sum  his testimony is extremely valuable because it is the evidence of an educated and observing man who before having personal knowledge of the subject and of newgate was quite satisfied that the punishment of death should continue but who when he gained that experience exerted himself to the utmost for its abolition even at the pain of constant public reference in his own person to his own imprisonment  it cannot be egotism he reasonably observes that prompts a man to speak of himself in connection with newgate  whoever will undergo the pain says mr wakefield of witnessing the public destruction of a fellowcreatures life in london must be perfectly satisfied that in the great mass of spectators the effect of the punishment is to excite sympathy for the criminal and hatred of the law   i am inclined to believe that the criminals of london spoken of as a class and allowing for exceptions take the same sort of delight in witnessing executions as the sportsman and soldier find in the dangers of hunting and war   i am confident that few old bailey sessions pass without the trial of a boy whose first thought of crime occurred whilst he was witnessing an execution   and one grown man of great mental powers and superior education who was acquitted of a charge of forgery assured me that the first idea of committing a forgery occurred to him at the moment when he was accidentally witnessing the execution of fauntleroy  to which it may be added that fauntleroy is said to have made precisely the same declaration in reference to the origin of his own criminality  but one convict who was within an ace of being hanged among the many with whom mr wakefield conversed seems to me to have unconsciously put a question which the advocates of capital punishment would find it very difficult indeed to answer  have you often seen an execution asked mr wakefield  yes often  did it not frighten you  no  why should it  it is very easy and very natural to turn from this ruffian shocked by the hardened retort but answer his question why should it should he be frightened by the sight of a dead man  we are born to die he says with a careless triumph  we are not born to the treadmill or to servitude and slavery or to banishment but the executioner has done no more for that criminal than nature may do tomorrow for the judge and will certainly do in her own good time for judge and jury counsel and witnesses turnkeys hangman and all  should he be frightened by the manner of the death  it is horrible truly so horrible that the law afraid or ashamed of its own deed hides the face of the struggling wretch it slays but does this fact naturally awaken in such a man terroror defiance  let the same man speak  what did you think then asked mr wakefield think  why i thought it was ashame  disgust and indignation or recklessness and indifference or a morbid tendency to brood over the sight until temptation is engendered by it are the inevitable consequences of the spectacle according to the difference of habit and disposition in those who behold it  why should it frighten or deter  we know it does not we know it from the police reports and from the testimony of those who have experience of prisons and prisoners and we may know it on the occasion of an execution by the evidence of our own senses if we will be at the misery of using them for such a purpose  but why should it  who would send his child or his apprentice or what tutor would send his scholars or what master would send his servants to be deterred from vice by the spectacle of an execution if it be an example to criminals and to criminals only why are not the prisoners in newgate brought out to see the show before the debtors door  why while they are made parties to the condemned sermon are they rigidly excluded from the improving postscript of the gallows  because an execution is well known to be an utterly useless barbarous and brutalising sight and because the sympathy of all beholders who have any sympathy at all is certain to be always with the criminal and never with the law  i learn from the newspaper accounts of every execution how mr so andso and mr somebody else and mr soforth shook hands with the culprit but i never find them shaking hands with the hangman  all kinds of attention and consideration are lavished on the one but the other is universally avoided like a pestilence  i want to know why so much sympathy is expended on the man who kills another in the vehemence of his own bad passions and why the man who kills him in the name of the law is shunned and fled from  is it because the murderer is going to die  then by no means put him to death  is it because the hangman executes a law which when they once come near it face to face all men instinctively revolt from  then by all means change it  there is there can be no prevention in such a law  it may be urged that public executions are not intended for the benefit of those dregs of society who habitually attend them  this is an absurdity to which the obvious answer is so much the worse if they be not considered with reference to that class of persons comprehending a great host of criminals in various stages of development they ought to be and must be  to lose sight of that consideration is to be irrational unjust and cruel  all other punishments are especially devised with a reference to the rooted habits propensities and antipathies of criminals  and shall it be said out of bedlam that this last punishment of all is alone to be made an exception from the rule even where it is shown to be a means of propagating vice and crime  but there may be people who do not attend executions to whom the general fame and rumour of such scenes is an example and a means of deterring from crime  who are they  we have seen that around capital punishment there lingers a fascination urging weak and bad people towards it and imparting an interest to details connected with it and with malefactors awaiting it or suffering it which even good and well disposed people cannot withstand  we know that lastdying speeches and newgate calendars are the favourite literature of very low intellects  the gallows is not appealed to as an example in the instruction of youth unless they are training for it nor are there condensed accounts of celebrated executions for the use of national schools  there is a story in an old spellingbook of a certain dont care who was hanged at last but it is not understood to have had any remarkable effect on crimes or executions in the generation to which it belonged and with which it has passed away hogarths idle apprentice is hanged but the whole scenewith the unmistakable stout lady drunk and pious in the cast the quarrelling blasphemy lewdness and uproar tiddy doll vending his gingerbread and the boys picking his pocketis a bitter satire on the great example as efficient then as now  is it efficient to prevent crime  the parliamentary returns demonstrate that it is not  i was engaged in making some extracts from these documents when i found them so well abstracted in one of the papers published by the committee on this subject established at aylesbury last year by the humane exertions of lord nugent that i am glad to quote the general results from its pages   in 1843 a return was laid on the table of the house of the commitments and executions for murder in england and wales during the thirty years ending with december 1842 divided into five periods of six years each  it shows that in the last six years from 1836 to 1842 during which there were only 50 executions the commitments for murder were fewer by 61 than in the six years preceding with 74 executions fewer by 63 than in the six years ending 1830 with 75 executions fewer by 56 than in the six years ending 1824 with 94 executions and fewer by 93 than in the six years ending 1818 when there was no less a number of executions than 122  but it may be said perhaps that in the inference we draw from this return we are substituting cause for effect and that in each successive cycle the number of murders decreased in consequence of the example of public executions in the cycle immediately preceding and that it was for that reason there were fewer commitments  this might be said with some colour of truth if the example had been taken from two successive cycles only  but when the comparative examples adduced are of no less than five successive cycles and the result gradually and constantly progressive in the same direction the relation of facts to each other is determined beyond all ground for dispute namely that the number of these crimes has diminished in consequence of the diminution of the number of executions  more especially when it is also remembered that it was immediately after the first of these cycles of five years when there had been the greatest number of executions and the greatest number of murders that the greatest number of persons were suddenly cast loose upon the country without employ by the reduction of the army and navy that then came periods of great distress and great disturbance in the agricultural and manufacturing districts and above all that it was during the subsequent cycles that the most important mitigations were effected in the law and that the punishment of death was taken away not only for crimes of stealth such as cattle and horse stealing and forgery of which crimes corresponding statistics show likewise a corresponding decrease but for the crimes of violence too tending to murder such as are many of the incendiary offences and such as are highway robbery and burglary  but another return laid before the house at the same time bears upon our argument if possible still more conclusively  in table 11 we have only the years which have occurred since 1810 in which all persons convicted of murder suffered death and compared with these an equal number of years in which the smallest proportion of persons convicted were executed in the first case there were 66 persons convicted all of whom underwent the penalty of death in the second 83 were convicted of whom 31 only were executed  now see how these two very different methods of dealing with the crime of murder affected the commission of it in the years immediately following  the number of commitments for murder in the four years immediately following those in which all persons convicted were executed was 270  in the four years immediately following those in which little more than onethird of the persons convicted were executed there were but 222 being 48 less  if we compare the commitments in the following years with those in the first years we shall find that immediately after the examples of unsparing execution the crime increased nearly 13 per cent and that after commutation was the practice and capital punishment the exception it decreased 17 per cent  in the same parliamentary return is an account of the commitments and executions in london and middlesex spread over a space of 32 years ending in 1842 divided into two cycles of 16 years each  in the first of these 34 persons were convicted of murder all of whom were executed  in the second 27 were convicted and only 17 executed  the commitments for murder during the latter long period with 17 executions were more than one half fewer than they had been in the former long period with exactly double the number of executions  this appears to us to be as conclusive upon our argument as any statistical illustration can be upon any argument professing to place successive events in the relation of cause and effect to each other  how justly then is it said in that able and useful periodical work now in the course of publication at glasgow under the name of the magazine of popular information on capital and secondary punishment the greater the number of executions the greater the number of murders the smaller the number of executions the smaller the number of murders  the lives of her majestys subjects are less safe with a hundred executions a year than with fifty less safe with fifty than with twentyfive   similar results have followed from rendering public executions more and more infrequent in tuscany in prussia in france in belgium wherever capital punishments are diminished in their number there crimes diminish in their number too  but the very same advocates of the punishment of death who contend in the teeth of all facts and figures that it does prevent crime contend in the same breath against its abolition because it does not  there are so many bad murders say they and they follow in such quick succession that the punishment must not be repealed why is not this a reason among others for repealing it  does it not go to show that it is ineffective as an example that it fails to prevent crime and that it is wholly inefficient to stay that imitation or contagion call it what you please which brings one murder on the heels of another  one forgery came crowding on anothers heels in the same way when the same punishment attached to that crime  since it has been removed forgeries have diminished in a most remarkable degree  yet within five and thirty years lord eldon with tearful solemnity imagined in the house of lords as a possibility for their lordships to shudder at that the time might come when some visionary and morbid person might even propose the abolition of the punishment of death for forgery  and when it was proposed lords lyndhurst wynford tenterden and eldonall law lordsopposed it  the same lord tenterden manfully said on another occasion and another question that he was glad the subject of the amendment of the laws had been taken up by mr peel who had not been bred to the law for those who were were rendered dull by habit to many of its defects  i would respectfully submit in extension of this text that a criminal judge is an excellent witness against the punishment of death but a bad witness in its favour and i will reserve this point for a few remarks in the next concluding letter   iii   the last english judge i believe who gave expression to a public and judicial opinion in favour of the punishment of death is mr justice coleridge who in charging the grand jury at hertford last year took occasion to lament the presence of serious crimes in the calendar and to say that he feared that they were referable to the comparative infrequency of capital punishment  it is not incompatible with the utmost deference and respect for an authority so eminent to say that in this mr justice coleridge was not supported by facts but quite the reverse  he went out of his way to found a general assumption on certain very limited and partial grounds and even on those grounds was wrong  for among the few crimes which he instanced murder stood prominently forth  now persons found guilty of murder are more certainly and unsparingly hanged at this time as the parliamentary returns demonstrate than such criminals ever were  so how can the decline of public executions affect that class of crimes  as to persons committing murder and yet not found guilty of it by juries they escape solely because there are many public executionsnot because there are none or few  but when i submit that a criminal judge is an excellent witness against capital punishment but a bad witness in its favour i do so on more broad and general grounds than apply to this error in fact and deduction so i presume to consider it on the part of the distinguished judge in question  and they are grounds which do not apply offensively to judges as a class than whom there are no authorities in england so deserving of general respect and confidence or so possessed of it but which apply alike to all men in their several degrees and pursuits  it is certain that men contract a general liking for those things which they have studied at great cost of time and intellect and their proficiency in which has led to their becoming distinguished and successful  it is certain that out of this feeling arises not only that passive blindness to their defects of which the example given by my lord tenterden was quoted in the last letter but an active disposition to advocate and defend them  if it were otherwise if it were not for this spirit of interest and partisanship no single pursuit could have that attraction for its votaries which most pursuits in course of time establish  thus legal authorities are usually jealous of innovations on legal principles  thus it is described of the lawyer in the introductory discourse to the description of utopia that he said of a proposal against capital punishment this could never be so established in england but that it must needs bring the wealpublic into great jeopardy and hazard and as he was thus saying he shaked his head and made a wry mouth and so he held his peace  thus the recorder of london in 1811 objected to the capital part being taken off from the offence of picking pockets  thus the lord chancellor in 1813 objected to the removal of the penalty of death from the offence of stealing to the amount of five shillings from a shop thus lord ellenborough in 1820 anticipated the worst effects from there being no punishment of death for stealing five shillings worth of wet linen from a bleaching ground  thus the solicitor general in 1830 advocated the punishment of death for forgery and the satisfaction of thinking in the teeth of mountains of evidence from bankers and other injured parties one thousand bankers alone that he was deterring persons from the commission of crime by the severity of the law  thus mr justice coleridge delivered his charge at hertford in 1845  thus there were in the criminal code of england in 1790 one hundred and sixty crimes punishable with death  thus the lawyer has said again and again in his generation that any change in such a state of things must needs bring the wealpublic into jeopardy and hazard  and thus he has all through the dismal history shaked his head and made a wry mouth and held his peace  excepta glorious exceptionwhen such lawyers as bacon more blackstone romilly andlet us ever gratefully rememberin later times mr basil montagu have striven each in his day within the utmost limits of the endurance of the mistaken feeling of the people or the legislature of the time to champion and maintain the truth  there is another and a stronger reason still why a criminal judge is a bad witness in favour of the punishment of death  he is a chief actor in the terrible drama of a trial where the life or death of a fellow creature is at issue  no one who has seen such a trial can fail to know or can ever forget its intense interest  i care not how painful this interest is to the good wise judge upon the bench  i admit its painful nature and the judges goodness and wisdom to the fullest extentbut i submit that his prominent share in the excitement of such a trial and the dread mystery involved has a tendency to bewilder and confuse the judge upon the general subject of that penalty  i know the solemn pause before the verdict the bush and stifling of the fever in the court the solitary figure brought back to the bar and standing there observed of all the outstretched heads and gleaming eyes to be next minute stricken dead as one may say among them  i know the thrill that goes round when the black cap is put on and how there will be shrieks among the women and a taking out of some one in a swoon and when the judges faltering voice delivers sentence how awfully the prisoner and he confront each other two mere men destined one day however far removed from one another at this time to stand alike as suppliants at the bar of god  i know all this i can imagine what the office of the judge costs in this execution of it but i say that in these strong sensations he is lost and is unable to abstract the penalty as a preventive or example from an experience of it and from associations surrounding it which are and can be only his and his alone  not to contend that there is no amount of wig or ermine that can change the nature of the man inside not to say that the nature of a judge may be like the dyers hand subdued to what it works in and may become too used to this punishment of death to consider it quite dispassionately not to say that it may possibly be inconsistent to have deciding as calm authorities in favour of death judges who have been constantly sentencing to deathi contend that for the reasons i have stated alone a judge and especially a criminal judge is a bad witness for the punishment but an excellent witness against it inasmuch as in the latter case his conviction of its inutility has been so strong and paramount as utterly to beat down and conquer these adverse incidents  i have no scruple in stating this position because for anything i know the majority of excellent judges now on the bench may have overcome them and may be opposed to the punishment of death under any circumstances  i mentioned that i would devote a portion of this letter to a few prominent illustrations of each head of objection to the punishment of death  those on record are so very numerous that selection is extremely difficult but in reference to the possibility of mistake and the impossibility of reparation one case is as good i should rather say as bad as a hundred and if there were none but eliza fennings that would be sufficient  nay if there were none at all it would be enough to sustain this objection that men of finite and limited judgment do inflict on testimony which admits of doubt an infinite and irreparable punishment  but there are on record numerous instances of mistake many of them very generally known and immediately recognisable in the following summary which i copy from the new york report already referred to   there have been cases in which groans have been heard in the apartment of the crime which have attracted the steps of those on whose testimony the case has turnedwhen on proceeding to the spot they have found a man bending over the murdered body a lantern in the left hand and the knife yet dripping with the warm current in the bloodstained right with horrorstricken countenance and lips which in the presence of the dead seem to refuse to deny the crime in the very act of which he is thus surprisedand yet the man has been many years after when his memory alone could be benefited by the discovery ascertained not to have been the real murderer  there have been cases in which in a house in which were two persons alone a murder has been committed on one of themwhen many additional circumstances have fastened the imputation upon the otherand when all apparent modes of access from without being closed inward the demonstration has seemed complete of the guilt for which that other has suffered the doom of the lawyet suffered innocently  there have been cases in which a father has been found murdered in an outhouse the only person at home being a son sworn by a sister to have been dissolute and undutiful and anxious for the death of the father and succession to the family propertywhen the track of his shoes in the snow is found from the house to the spot of the murder and the hammer with which it was committed known as his own found on a search in the corner of one of his private drawers with the bloody evidence of the deed only imperfectly effaced from itand yet the son has been innocentthe sister years after on her deathbed confessing herself the fratricide as well as the parricide  there have been cases in which men have been hung on the most positive testimony to identity aided by many suspicious circumstances by persons familiar with their appearance which have afterwards proved grievous mistakes growing out of remarkable personal resemblance there have been cases in which two men have been seen fighting in a fieldan old enmity existing between themthe one found dead killed by a stab from a pitchfork known as belonging to the other and which that other had been carrying the pitchfork lying by the side of the murdered manand yet its owner has been afterwards found not to have been the author of the murder of which it had been the instrument the true murderer sitting on the jury that tried him  there have been cases in which an innkeeper has been charged by one of his servants with the murder of a traveller the servant deposing to having seen his master on the strangers bed strangling him and afterwards rifling his pocketsanother servant deposing that she saw him come down at that time at a very early hour in the morning steal into the garden take gold from his pocket and carefully wrapping it up bury it in a designated spoton the search of which the ground is found loose and freshly dug and a sum of thirty pounds in gold found buried according to the descriptionthe master who confessed the burying of the money with many evidences of guilt in his hesitation and confusion has been hung of course and proved innocent only too late  there have been cases in which a traveller has been robbed on the highway of twenty guineas which he had taken the precaution to markone of these is found to have been paid away or changed by one of the servants of the inn which the traveller reaches the same eveningthe servant is about the height of the robber who had been cloaked and disguisedhis master deposes to his having been recently unaccountably extravagant and flush of goldand on his trunk being searched the other nineteen marked guineas and the travellers purse are found there the servant being asleep at the time halfdrunkhe is of course convicted and hung for the crime of which his master was the author  there have been cases in which a father and daughter have been overheard in violent disputethe words barbarity cruelly and death being heard frequently to proceed from the latterthe former goes out locking the door behind himgroans are overheard and the words cruel father thou art the cause of my deathon the room being opened she is found on the point of death from a wound in her side and near her the knife with which it had been inflictedand on being questioned as to her owing her death to her father her last motion before expiring is an expression of assent the father on returning to the room exhibits the usual evidences of guilthe too is of course hungand it is not till nearly a year afterwards that on the discovery of conclusive evidence that it was a suicide the vain reparation is made to his memory by the public authorities ofwaving a pair of colours over his grave in token of the recognition of his innocence   more than a hundred such cases are known it is said in this report in english criminal jurisprudence  the same report contains three striking cases of supposed criminals being unjustly hanged in america and also five more in which people whose innocence was not afterwards established were put to death on evidence as purely circumstantial and as doubtful to say the least of it as any that was held to be sufficient in this general summary of legal murders mr oconnell defended in ireland within five and twenty years three brothers who were hanged for a murder of which they were afterwards shown to have been innocent  i cannot find the reference at this moment but i have seen it stated on good authority that but for the exertions i think of the present lord chief baron six or seven innocent men would certainly have been hanged  such are the instances of wrong judgment which are known to us  how many more there may be in which the real murderers never disclosed their guilt or were never discovered and where the odium of great crimes still rests on guiltless people long since resolved to dust in their untimely graves no human power can tell  the effect of public executions on those who witness them requires no better illustration and can have none than the scene which any execution in itself presents and the general policeoffice knowledge of the offences arising out of them  i have stated my belief that the study of rude scenes leads to the disregard of human life and to murder  referring since that expression of opinion to the very last trial for murder in london i have made inquiry and am assured that the youth now under sentence of death in newgate for the murder of his master in drury lane was a vigilant spectator of the three last public executions in this city  what effects a daily increasing familiarity with the scaffold and with death upon it wrought in france in the great revolution everybody knows  in reference to this very question of capital punishment robespierre himself before he was   in blood stept in so far   warned the national assembly that in taking human life and in displaying before the eyes of the people scenes of cruelty and the bodies of murdered men the law awakened ferocious prejudices which gave birth to a long and growing train of their own kind  with how much reason this was said let his own detestable name bear witness if we would know how callous and hardened society even in a peaceful and settled state becomes to public executions when they are frequent let us recollect how few they were who made the last attempt to stay the dreadful mondaymorning spectacles of men and women strung up in a row for crimes as different in their degree as our whole social scheme is different in its component parts which within some fifteen years or so made human shambles of the old bailey  there is no better way of testing the effect of public executions on those who do not actually behold them but who read of them and know of them than by inquiring into their efficiency in preventing crime  in this respect they have always and in all countries failed  according to all facts and figures failed  in russia in spain in france in italy in belgium in sweden in england there has been one result  in bombay during the recordership of sir james macintosh there were fewer crimes in seven years without one execution than in the preceding seven years with fortyseven executions notwithstanding that in the seven years without capital punishment the population had greatly increased and there had been a large accession to the numbers of the ignorant and licentious soldiery with whom the more violent offences originated  during the four wickedest years of the bank of england from 1814 to 1817 inclusive when the onepound note capital prosecutions were most numerous and shocking the number of forged onepound notes discovered by the bank steadily increased from the gross amount in the first year of 10342 pounds to the gross amount in the last of 28412 pounds  but in every branch of this part of the subjectthe inefficiency of capital punishment to prevent crime and its efficiency to produce itthe body of evidence if there were space to quote or analyse it here is overpowering and resistless  i have purposely deferred until now any reference to one objection which is urged against the abolition of capital punishment  i mean that objection which claims to rest on scriptural authority  it was excellently well said by lord melbourne that no class of persons can be shown to be very miserable and oppressed but some supporters of things as they are will immediately rise up and assertnot that those persons are moderately well to do or that their lot in life has a reasonably bright sidebut that they are of all sorts and conditions of men the happiest  in like manner when a certain proceeding or institution is shown to be very wrong indeed there is a class of people who rush to the fountainhead at once and will have no less an authority for it than the bible on any terms  so we have the bible appealed to in behalf of capital punishment so we have the bible produced as a distinct authority for slavery so american representatives find the title of their country to the oregon territory distinctly laid down in the book of genesis  so in course of time we shall find repudiation perhaps expressly commanded in the sacred writings  it is enough for me to be satisfied on calm inquiry and with reason that an institution or custom is wrong and bad and thence to feel assured that it cannot be a part of the law laid down by the divinity who walked the earth  though every other man who wields a pen should turn himself into a commentator on the scripturesnot all their united efforts pursued through our united lives could ever persuade me that slavery is a christian law nor with one of these objections to an execution in my certain knowledge that executions are a christian law my will is not concerned  i could not in my veneration for the life and lessons of our lord believe it  if any text appeared to justify the claim i would reject that limited appeal and rest upon the character of the redeemer and the great scheme of his religion where in its broad spirit made so plainand not this or that disputed letterwe all put our trust but happily such doubts do not exist  the case is far too plain the rev henry christmas in a recent pamphlet on this subject shows clearly that in five important versions of the old testament to say nothing of versions of less note the words by man in the oftenquoted text whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed do not appear at all  we know that the law of moses was delivered to certain wandering tribes in a peculiar and perfectly different social condition from that which prevails among us at this time  we know that the christian dispensation did distinctly repeal and annul certain portions of that law  we know that the doctrine of retributive justice or vengeance was plainly disavowed by the saviour  we know that on the only occasion of an offender liable by the law to death being brought before him for his judgment it was not death  we know that he said thou shalt not kill  and if we are still to inflict capital punishment because of the mosaic law under which it was not the consequence of a legal proceeding but an act of vengeance from the next of kin which would surely be discouraged by our later laws if it were revived among the jews just now it would be equally reasonable to establish the lawfulness of a plurality of wives on the same authority  here i will leave this aspect of the question  i should not have treated of it at all in the columns of a newspaper but for the possibility of being unjustly supposed to have given it no consideration in my own mind  in bringing to a close these letters on a subject in connection with which there is happily very little that is new to be said or written i beg to be understood as advocating the total abolition of the punishment of death as a general principle for the advantage of society for the prevention of crime and without the least reference to or tenderness for any individual malefactor whomsoever  indeed in most cases of murder my feeling towards the culprit is very strongly and violently the reverse  i am the more desirous to be so understood after reading a speech made by mr macaulay in the house of commons last tuesday night in which that accomplished gentleman hardly seemed to recognise the possibility of anybody entertaining an honest conviction of the inutility and bad effects of capital punishment in the abstract founded on inquiry and reflection without being the victim of a kind of effeminate feeling  without staying to inquire what there may be that is especially manly and heroic in the advocacy of the gallows or to express my admiration of mr calcraft the hangman as doubtless one of the most manly specimens now in existence i would simply hint a doubt in all good humour whether this be the true macaulay way of meeting a great question  one of the instances of effeminacy of feeling quoted by mr macaulay i have reason to think was not quite fairly stated  i allude to the petition in tawells case  i had neither hand nor part in it myself but unless i am greatly mistaken it did pretty clearly set forth that tawell was a most abhorred villain and that the house might conclude how strongly the petitioners were opposed to the punishment of death when they prayed for its noninfliction even in such a case    the spirit of chivalry in westminster hall    of all the cants that are canted in this canting world wrote sterne kind heaven defend me from the cant of art  we have no intention of tapping our little cask of cant soured by the thunder of great mens fame for the refreshment of our readers  its freest draught would be unreasonably dear at a shilling when the same small liquor may be had for nothing at innumerable ready pipes and conduits  but it is a main part of the design of this magazine to sympathise with what is truly great and good to scout the miserable discouragements that beset especially in england the upward path of men of high desert and gladly to give honour where it is due in right of something achieved tending to elevate the tastes and thoughts of all who contemplate it and prove a lasting credit to the country of its birth  upon the walls of westminster hall there hangs at this time such a something  a composition of such marvellous beauty of such infinite variety of such masterly design of such vigorous and skilful drawing of such thought and fancy of such surprising and delicate accuracy of detail subserving one grand harmony and one plain purpose that it may be questioned whether the fine arts in any period of their history have known a more remarkable performance  it is the cartoon of daniel maclise executed by order of the commissioners and called the spirit of chivalry  it may be left an open question whether or no this allegorical order on the part of the commissioners displays any uncommon felicity of idea  we rather think not and are free to confess that we should like to have seen the commissioners notion of the spirit of chivalry stated by themselves in the first instance on a sheet of foolscap as the groundplan of a model cartoon with all the commissioned proportions of height and breadth  that the treatment of such an abstraction for the purposes of art involves great and peculiar difficulties no one who considers the subject for a moment can doubt  that nothing is easier to render it absurd and monstrous is a position as little capable of dispute by anybody who has beheld another cartoon on the same subject in the same hall representing a ghoule in a state of raving madness dancing on a body in a very high wind to the great astonishment of john the baptists head which is looking on from a corner  mr maclises handling of the subject has by this time sunk into the hearts of thousands upon thousands of people  it is familiar knowledge among all classes and conditions of men  it is the great feature within the hall and the constant topic of discourse elsewhere  it has awakened in the great body of society a new interest in and a new perception and a new love of art  students of art have sat before it hour by hour perusing in its many forms of beauty lessons to delight the world and raise themselves its future teachers in its better estimation  eyes well accustomed to the glories of the vatican the galleries of florence all the mightiest works of art in europe have grown dim before it with the strong emotions it inspires ignorant unlettered drudging men mere hewers and drawers have gathered in a knot about it as at our back a week ago and read it in their homely language as it were a book  in minds the roughest and the most refined it has alike found quick response and will and must so long as it shall hold together  for how can it be otherwise  look up upon the pressing throng who strive to win distinction from the guardian genius of all noble deeds and honourable renowna gentle spirit holding her fair state for their reward and recognition do not be alarmed my lord chamberlain this is only in a picture and say what young and ardent heart may not find one to beat in unison with itbeat high with generous aspiration like its ownin following their onward course as it is traced by this great pencil  is it the love of woman in its truth and deep devotion that inspires you  see it here  is it glory as the world has learned to call the pomp and circumstance of arms  behold it at the summit of its exaltation with its mailed hand resting on the altar where the spirit ministers  the poets laurelcrown which they who sit on thrones can neither twine or witheris that the aim of thy ambition  it is there upon his brow it wreathes his stately forehead as he walks apart and holds communion with himself  the palmer and the bard are there no solitary wayfarers now but two of a great company of pilgrims climbing up to honour by the different paths that lead to the great end  and sure amidst the gravity and beauty of them all unseen in his own form but shining in his spirit out of every gallant shape and earnest thoughtthe painter goes triumphant  or say that you who look upon this work be old and bring to it grey hairs a head bowed down a mind on which the day of life has spent itself and the calm evening closes gently in  is its appeal to you confined to its presentment of the past  have you no share in this but while the grace of youth and the strong resolve of maturity are yours to aid you  look up again  look up where the spirit is enthroned and see about her reverend men whose task is done whose struggle is no more who cluster round her as her train and council who have lost no share or interest in that great rising up and progress which bears upward with it every means of human happiness but true in autumn to the purposes of spring are there to stimulate the race who follow in their steps to contemplate with hearts grown serious not cold or sad the striving in which they once had part to die in that great presence which is truth and bravery and mercy to the weak beyond all power of separation  it would be idle to observe of this last group that both in execution and idea they are of the very highest order of art and wonderfully serve the purpose of the picture  there is not one among its threeandtwenty heads of which the same remark might not be made  neither will we treat of great effects produced by means quite powerless in other hands for such an end or of the prodigious force and colour which so separate this work from all the rest exhibited that it would scarcely appear to be produced upon the same kind of surface by the same description of instrument  the bricks and stones and timbers of the hall itself are not facts more indisputable than these  it has been objected to this extraordinary work that it is too elaborately finished too complete in its several parts  and heaven knows if it be judged in this respect by any standard in the hall about it it will find no parallel nor anything approaching to it but it is a design intended to be afterwards copied and painted in fresco and certain finish must be had at last if not at first  it is very well to take it for granted in a cartoon that a series of crosslines almost as rough and apart as the latticework of a garden summerhouse represents the texture of a human face but the face cannot be painted so  a smear upon the paper may be understood by virtue of the context gained from what surrounds it to stand for a limb or a body or a cuirass or a hat and feathers or a flag or a boot or an angel  but when the time arrives for rendering these things in colours on a wall they must be grappled with and cannot be slurred over in this wise  great misapprehension on this head seems to have been engendered in the minds of some observers by the famous cartoons of raphael but they forget that these were never intended as designs for fresco painting  they were designs for tapestrywork which is susceptible of only certain broad and general effects as no one better knew than the great master  utterly detestable and vile as the tapestry is compared with the immortal cartoons from which it was worked it is impossible for any man who casts his eyes upon it where it hangs at rome not to see immediately the special adaptation of the drawings to that end and for that purpose  the aim of these cartoons being wholly different mr maclises object if we understand it was to show precisely what he meant to do and knew he could perform in fresco on a wall  and here his meaning is worked out without a compromise of any difficulty without the avoidance of any disconcerting truth expressed in all its beauty strength and power  to what end  to be perpetuated hereafter in the high place of the chief senatehouse of england  to be wrought as it were into the very elements of which that temple is composed to coendure with it and still present perhaps some lingering traces of its ancient beauty when london shall have sunk into a grave of grassgrown ruinand the whole circle of the arts another revolution of the mighty wheel completed shall be wrecked and broken  let us hope so  we will contemplate no other possibilityat present    in memoriamw m thackeray    it has been desired by some of the personal friends of the great english writer who established this magazine 1 that its brief record of his having been stricken from among men should be written by the old comrade and brother in arms who pens these lines and of whom he often wrote himself and always with the warmest generosity  i saw him first nearly twentyeight years ago when he proposed to become the illustrator of my earliest book  i saw him last shortly before christmas at the athenaeum club when he told me that he had been in bed three daysthat after these attacks he was troubled with cold shiverings which quite took the power of work out of himand that he had it in his mind to try a new remedy which he laughingly described  he was very cheerful and looked very bright in the night of that day week he died  the long interval between those two periods is marked in my remembrance of him by many occasions when he was supremely humorous when he was irresistibly extravagant when he was softened and serious when he was charming with children  but by none do i recall him more tenderly than by two or three that start out of the crowd when he unexpectedly presented himself in my room announcing how that some passage in a certain book had made him cry yesterday and how that he had come to dinner because he couldnt help it and must talk such passage over  no one can ever have seen him more genial natural cordial fresh and honestly impulsive than i have seen him at those times  no one can be surer than i of the greatness and the goodness of the heart that then disclosed itself  we had our differences of opinion  i thought that he too much feigned a want of earnestness and that he made a pretence of under valuing his art which was not good for the art that he held in trust  but when we fell upon these topics it was never very gravely and i have a lively image of him in my mind twisting both his hands in his hair and stamping about laughing to make an end of the discussion  when we were associated in remembrance of the late mr douglas jerrold he delivered a public lecture in london in the course of which he read his very best contribution to punch describing the grownup cares of a poor family of young children  no one hearing him could have doubted his natural gentleness or his thoroughly unaffected manly sympathy with the weak and lowly  he read the paper most pathetically and with a simplicity of tenderness that certainly moved one of his audience to tears  this was presently after his standing for oxford from which place he had dispatched his agent to me with a droll note to which he afterwards added a verbal postscript urging me to come down and make a speech and tell them who he was for he doubted whether more than two of the electors had ever heard of him and he thought there might be as many as six or eight who had heard of me  he introduced the lecture just mentioned with a reference to his late electioneering failure which was full of good sense good spirits and good humour  he had a particular delight in boys and an excellent way with them i remember his once asking me with fantastic gravity when he had been to eton where my eldest son then was whether i felt as he did in regard of never seeing a boy without wanting instantly to give him a sovereign  i thought of this when i looked down into his grave after he was laid there for i looked down into it over the shoulder of a boy to whom he had been kind  these are slight remembrances but it is to little familiar things suggestive of the voice look manner never never more to be encountered on this earth that the mind first turns in a bereavement  and greater things that are known of him in the way of his warm affections his quiet endurance his unselfish thoughtfulness for others and his munificent hand may not be told  if in the reckless vivacity of his youth his satirical pen had ever gone astray or done amiss he had caused it to prefer its own petition for forgiveness long before   ive writ the foolish fancy of his brain the aimless jest that striking hath caused pain the idle word that hed wish back again   in no pages should i take it upon myself at this time to discourse of his books of his refined knowledge of character of his subtle acquaintance with the weaknesses of human nature of his delightful playfulness as an essayist of his quaint and touching ballads of his mastery over the english language  least of all in these pages enriched by his brilliant qualities from the first of the series and beforehand accepted by the public through the strength of his great name  but on the table before me there lies all that he had written of his latest and last story  that it would be very sad to any one that it is inexpressibly so to a writerin its evidences of matured designs never to be accomplished of intentions begun to be executed and destined never to be completed of careful preparation for long roads of thought that he was never to traverse and for shining goals that he was never to reach will be readily believed  the pain however that i have felt in perusing it has not been deeper than the conviction that he was in the healthiest vigour of his powers when he wrought on this last labour  in respect of earnest feeling farseeing purpose character incident and a certain loving picturesqueness blending the whole i believe it to be much the best of all his works  that he fully meant it to be so that he had become strongly attached to it and that he bestowed great pains upon it i trace in almost every page  it contains one picture which must have cost him extreme distress and which is a masterpiece  there are two children in it touched with a hand as loving and tender as ever a father caressed his little child with there is some young love as pure and innocent and pretty as the truth  and it is very remarkable that by reason of the singular construction of the story more than one main incident usually belonging to the end of such a fiction is anticipated in the beginning and thus there is an approach to completeness in the fragment as to the satisfaction of the readers mind concerning the most interesting persons which could hardly have been better attained if the writers breakingoff had been foreseen  the last line he wrote and the last proof he corrected are among these papers through which i have so sorrowfully made my way  the condition of the little pages of manuscript where death stopped his hand shows that he had carried them about and often taken them out of his pocket here and there for patient revision and interlineation  the last words he corrected in print were and my heart throbbed with an exquisite bliss  god grant that on that christmas eve when he laid his head back on his pillow and threw up his arms as he had been wont to do when very weary some consciousness of duty done and christian hope throughout life humbly cherished may have caused his own heart so to throb when he passed away to his redeemers rest  he was found peacefully lying as above described composed undisturbed and to all appearance asleep on the twentyfourth of december 1863  he was only in his fiftythird year so young a man that the mother who blessed him in his first sleep blessed him in his last  twenty years before he had written after being in a white squall   and when its force expended the harmless storm was ended and as the sunrise splendid came blushing oer the sea i thought as day was breaking my little girls were waking and smiling and making a prayer at home for me   those little girls had grown to be women when the mournful day broke that saw their father lying dead  in those twenty years of companionship with him they had learned much from him and one of them has a literary course before her worthy of her famous name  on the bright wintry day the last but one of the old year he was laid in his grave at kensal green there to mingle the dust to which the mortal part of him had returned with that of a third child lost in her infancy years ago  the heads of a great concourse of his fellowworkers in the arts were bowed around his tomb    adelaide anne procter introduction to her legends and lyrics    in the spring of the year 1853 i observed as conductor of the weekly journal household words a short poem among the proffered contributions very different as i thought from the shoal of verses perpetually setting through the office of such a periodical and possessing much more merit  its authoress was quite unknown to me  she was one miss mary berwick whom i had never heard of and she was to be addressed by letter if addressed at all at a circulating library in the western district of london  through this channel miss berwick was informed that her poem was accepted and was invited to send another  she complied and became a regular and frequent contributor  many letters passed between the journal and miss berwick but miss berwick herself was never seen  how we came gradually to establish at the office of household words that we knew all about miss berwick i have never discovered but we settled somehow to our complete satisfaction that she was governess in a family that she went to italy in that capacity and returned and that she had long been in the same family  we really knew nothing whatever of her except that she was remarkably businesslike punctual selfreliant and reliable  so i suppose we insensibly invented the rest  for myself my mother was not a more real personage to me than miss berwick the governess became  this went on until december 1854 when the christmas number entitled the seven poor travellers was sent to press  happening to be going to dine that day with an old and dear friend distinguished in literature as barry cornwall i took with me an early proof of that number and remarked as i laid it on the drawingroom table that it contained a very pretty poem written by a certain miss berwick  next day brought me the disclosure that i had so spoken of the poem to the mother of its writer in its writers presence that i had no such correspondent in existence as miss berwick and that the name had been assumed by barry cornwalls eldest daughter miss adelaide anne procter  the anecdote i have here noted down besides serving to explain why the parents of the late miss procter have looked to me for these poor words of remembrance of their lamented child strikingly illustrates the honesty independence and quiet dignity of the ladys character  i had known her when she was very young i had been honoured with her fathers friendship when i was myself a young aspirant and she had said at home if i send him in my own name verses that he does not honestly like either it will be very painful to him to return them or he will print them for papas sake and not for their own  so i have made up my mind to take my chance fairly with the unknown volunteers  perhaps it requires an editors experience of the profoundly unreasonable grounds on which he is often urged to accept unsuitable articlessuch as having been to school with the writers husbands brotherinlaw or having lent an alpenstock in switzerland to the writers wifes nephew when that interesting stranger had broken his ownfully to appreciate the delicacy and the selfrespect of this resolution  some verses by miss procter had been published in the book of beauty ten years before she became miss berwick  with the exception of two poems in the cornhill magazine two in good words and others in a little book called a chaplet of verses issued in 1862 for the benefit of a night refuge her published writings first appeared in household words or all the year round  the present edition contains the whole of her legends and lyrics and originates in the great favour with which they have been received by the public  miss procter was born in bedford square london on the 30th of october 1825  her love of poetry was conspicuous at so early an age that i have before me a tiny album made of small notepaper into which her favourite passages were copied for her by her mothers hand before she herself could write  it looks as if she had carried it about as another little girl might have carried a doll  she soon displayed a remarkable memory and great quickness of apprehension  when she was quite a young child she learned with facility several of the problems of euclid  as she grew older she acquired the french italian and german languages became a clever pianoforte player and showed a true taste and sentiment in drawing but as soon as she had completely vanquished the difficulties of any one branch of study it was her way to lose interest in it and pass to another  while her mental resources were being trained it was not at all suspected in her family that she had any gift of authorship or any ambition to become a writer  her father had no idea of her having ever attempted to turn a rhyme until her first little poem saw the light in print  when she attained to womanhood she had read an extraordinary number of books and throughout her life she was always largely adding to the number  in 1853 she went to turin and its neighbourhood on a visit to her aunt a roman catholic lady  as miss procter had herself professed the roman catholic faith two years before she entered with the greater ardour on the study of the piedmontese dialect and the observation of the habits and manners of the peasantry  in the former she soon became a proficient  on the latter head i extract from her familiar letters written home to england at the time two pleasant pieces of description   a betrothal   we have been to a ball of which i must give you a description last tuesday we had just done dinner at about seven and stepped out into the balcony to look at the remains of the sunset behind the mountains when we heard very distinctly a band of music which rather excited my astonishment as a solitary organ is the utmost that toils up here  i went out of the room for a few minutes and on my returning emily said oh  that band is playing at the farmers near here  the daughter is fiancee today and they have a ball  i said i wish i was going  well replied she the farmers wife did call to invite us  then i shall certainly go i exclaimed  i applied to madame b who said she would like it very much and we had better go children and all  some of the servants were already gone  we rushed away to put on some shawls and put off any shred of black we might have about us as the people would have been quite annoyed if we had appeared on such an occasion with any black and we started  when we reached the farmers which is a stones throw above our house we were received with great enthusiasm the only drawback being that no one spoke french and we did not yet speak piedmontese  we were placed on a bench against the wall and the people went on dancing  the room was a large whitewashed kitchen i suppose with several large pictures in black frames and very smoky  i distinguished the martyrdom of saint sebastian and the others appeared equally lively and appropriate subjects  whether they were old masters or not and if so by whom i could not ascertain  the band were seated opposite us  five men with wind instruments part of the band of the national guard to which the farmers sons belong  they played really admirably and i began to be afraid that some idea of our dignity would prevent me getting a partner so by madame bs advice i went up to the bride and offered to dance with her  such a handsome young woman  like one of uwinss pictures  very dark with a quantity of black hair and on an immense scale  the children were already dancing as well as the maids  after we came to an end of our dance which was what they called a polkamazourka i saw the bride trying to screw up the courage of her fiance to ask me to dance which after a little hesitation he did  and admirably he danced as indeed they all didin excellent time and with a little more spirit than one sees in a ballroom  in fact they were very like ones ordinary partners except that they wore earrings and were in their shirtsleeves and truth compels me to state that they decidedly smelt of garlic  some of them had been smoking but threw away their cigars when we came in  the only thing that did not look cheerful was that the room was only lighted by two or three oillamps and that there seemed to be no preparation for refreshments  madame b seeing this whispered to her maid who disengaged herself from her partner and ran off to the house she and the kitchenmaid presently returning with a large tray covered with all kinds of cakes of which we are great consumers and always have a stock and a large hamper full of bottles of wine with coffee and sugar  this seemed all very acceptable  the fiancee was requested to distribute the eatables and a bucket of water being produced to wash the glasses in the wine disappeared very quickly as fast as they could open the bottles  but elated i suppose by this the floor was sprinkled with water and the musicians played a monferrino which is a piedmontese dance  madame b danced with the farmers son and emily with another distinguished member of the company  it was very fatiguingsomething like a scotch reel  my partner was a little man like perrot and very proud of his dancing  he cut in the air and twisted about until i was out of breath though my attempts to imitate him were feeble in the extreme  at last after seven or eight dances i was obliged to sit down  we stayed till nine and i was so dead beat with the heat that i could hardly crawl about the house and in an agony with the cramp it is so long since i have danced   a marriage   the wedding of the farmers daughter has taken place  we had hoped it would have been in the little chapel of our house but it seems some special permission was necessary and they applied for it too late  they all said this is the constitution  there would have been no difficulty before the lower classes making the poor constitution the scapegoat for everything they dont like  so as it was impossible for us to climb up to the church where the wedding was to be we contented ourselves with seeing the procession pass it was not a very large one for it requiring some activity to go up all the old people remained at home  it is not etiquette for the brides mother to go and no unmarried woman can go to a weddingi suppose for fear of its making her discontented with her own position  the procession stopped at our door for the bride to receive our congratulations  she was dressed in a shot silk with a yellow handkerchief and rows of a large gold chain  in the afternoon they sent to request us to go there  on our arrival we found them dancing out of doors and a most melancholy affair it was  all the brides sisters were not to be recognised they had cried so  the mother sat in the house and could not appear  and the bride was sobbing so she could hardly stand  the most melancholy spectacle of all to my mind was that the bridegroom was decidedly tipsy  he seemed rather affronted at all the distress we danced a monferrino i with the bridegroom and the bride crying the whole time  the company did their utmost to enliven her by firing pistols but without success and at last they began a series of yells which reminded me of a set of savages  but even this delicate method of consolation failed and the wishing goodbye began  it was altogether so melancholy an affair that madame b dropped a few tears and i was very near it particularly when the poor mother came out to see the last of her daughter who was finally dragged off between her brother and uncle with a last explosion of pistols  as she lives quite near makes an excellent match and is one of nine children it really was a most desirable marriage in spite of all the show of distress  albert was so discomfited by it that he forgot to kiss the bride as he had intended to do and therefore went to call upon her yesterday and found her very smiling in her new house and supplied the omission the cook came home from the wedding declaring she was cured of any wish to marrybut i would not recommend any man to act upon that threat and make her an offer  in a couple of days we had some rolls of the brides first baking which they call madonnas  the musicians it seems were in the same state as the bridegroom for in escorting her home they all fell down in the mud  my wrath against the bridegroom is somewhat calmed by finding that it is considered bad luck if he does not get tipsy at his wedding   those readers of miss procters poems who should suppose from their tone that her mind was of a gloomy or despondent cast would be curiously mistaken  she was exceedingly humorous and had a great delight in humour  cheerfulness was habitual with her she was very ready at a sally or a reply and in her laugh as i remember well there was an unusual vivacity enjoyment and sense of drollery she was perfectly unconstrained and unaffected  as modestly silent about her productions as she was generous with their pecuniary results  she was a friend who inspired the strongest attachments she was a finely sympathetic woman with a great accordant heart and a sterling noble nature  no claim can be set up for her thank god to the possession of any of the conventional poetical qualities she never by any means held the opinion that she was among the greatest of human beings she never suspected the existence of a conspiracy on the part of mankind against her she never recognised in her best friends her worst enemies she never cultivated the luxury of being misunderstood and unappreciated she would far rather have died without seeing a line of her composition in print than that i should have maundered about her here as the poet or the poetess  with the recollection of miss procter as a mere child and as a woman fresh upon me it is natural that i should linger on my way to the close of this brief record avoiding its end  but even as the close came upon her so must it come here  always impelled by an intense conviction that her life must not be dreamed away and that her indulgence in her favourite pursuits must be balanced by action in the real world around her she was indefatigable in her endeavours to do some good  naturally enthusiastic and conscientiously impressed with a deep sense of her christian duty to her neighbour she devoted herself to a variety of benevolent objects  now it was the visitation of the sick that had possession of her now it was the sheltering of the houseless now it was the elementary teaching of the densely ignorant now it was the raising up of those who had wandered and got trodden under foot now it was the wider employment of her own sex in the general business of life now it was all these things at once  perfectly unselfish swift to sympathise and eager to relieve she wrought at such designs with a flushed earnestness that disregarded season weather time of day or night food rest  under such a hurry of the spirits and such incessant occupation the strongest constitution will commonly go down  hers neither of the strongest nor the weakest yielded to the burden and began to sink  to have saved her life then by taking action on the warning that shone in her eyes and sounded in her voice would have been impossible without changing her nature  as long as the power of moving about in the old way was left to her she must exercise it or be killed by the restraint  and so the time came when she could move about no longer and took to her bed  all the restlessness gone then and all the sweet patience of her natural disposition purified by the resignation of her soul she lay upon her bed through the whole round of changes of the seasons  she lay upon her bed through fifteen months  in all that time her old cheerfulness never quitted her  in all that time not an impatient or a querulous minute can be remembered  at length at midnight on the second of february 1864 she turned down a leaf of a little book she was reading and shut it up  the ministering hand that had copied the verses into the tiny album was soon around her neck and she quietly asked as the clock was on the stroke of one  do you think i am dying mamma  i think you are very very ill tonight my dear  send for my sister  my feet are so cold  lift me up  her sister entering as they raised her she said  it has come at last  and with a bright and happy smile looked upward and departed  well had she written   why shouldst thou fear the beautiful angel death who waits thee at the portals of the skies ready to kiss away thy struggling breath ready with gentle hand to close thine eyes  oh what were life if life were all  thine eyes are blinded by their tears or thou wouldst see thy treasures wait thee in the faroff skies and death thy friend will give them all to thee    chauncey hare townshend explanatory introduction to religious opinions by the late reverend chauncey hare townshend    mr chauncey hare townshend died in london on the 25th of february 1868  his will contained the following passage   i appoint my friend charles dickens of gads hill place in the county of kent esquire my literary executor and beg of him to publish without alteration as much of my notes and reflections as may make known my opinions on religious matters they being such as i verily believe would be conducive to the happiness of mankind   in pursuance of the foregoing injunction the literary executor so appointed not previously aware that the publication of any religious opinions would be enjoined upon him applied himself to the examination of the numerous papers left by his deceased friend some of these were in lausanne and some were in london considerable delay occurred before they could be got together arising out of certain claims preferred and formalities insisted on by the authorities of the canton de vaud  when at length the whole of his late friends papers passed into the literary executors hands it was found that religious opinions were scattered up and down through a variety of memoranda and notebooks the gradual accumulation of years and years  many of the following pages were carefully transcribed numbered connected and prepared for the press but many more were dispersed fragments originally written in pencil afterwards inked over the intended sequence of which in the writers mind it was extremely difficult to follow  these again were intermixed with journals of travel fragments of poems critical essays voluminous correspondence and old schoolexercises and college themes having no kind of connection with them  to publish such materials without alteration was simply impossible  but finding everywhere internal evidence that mr townshends religious opinions had been constantly meditated and reconsidered with great pains and sincerity throughout his life the literary executor carefully compiled them always in the writers exact words and endeavoured in piecing them together to avoid needless repetition  he does not doubt that mr townshend held the clue to a precise plan which could have greatly simplified the presentation of these views and he has devoted the first section of this volume to mr townshends own notes of his comprehensive intentions  proofs of the devout spirit in which they were conceived and of the sense of responsibility with which he worked at them abound through the whole mass of papers  mr townshends varied attainments delicate tastes and amiable and gentle nature caused him to be beloved through life by the variously distinguished men who were his compeers at cambridge long ago  to his literary executor he was always a warmlyattached and sympathetic friend  to the public he has been a most generous benefactor both in his munificent bequest of his collection of precious stones in the south kensington museum and in the devotion of the bulk of his property to the education of poor children    on mr fechters acting    the distinguished artist whose name is prefixed to these remarks purposes to leave england for a professional tour in the united states  a few words from me in reference to his merits as an actor i hope may not be uninteresting to some readers in advance of his publicly proving them before an american audience and i know will not be unacceptable to my intimate friend  i state at once that mr fechter holds that relation towards me not only because it is the fact but also because our friendship originated in my public appreciation of him  i had studied his acting closely and had admired it highly both in paris and in london years before we exchanged a word  consequently my appreciation is not the result of personal regard but personal regard has sprung out of my appreciation  the first quality observable in mr fechters acting is that it is in the highest degree romantic  however elaborated in minute details there is always a peculiar dash and vigour in it like the fresh atmosphere of the story whereof it is a part  when he is on the stage it seems to me as though the story were transpiring before me for the first and last time  thus there is a fervour in his lovemakinga suffusion of his whole being with the rapture of his passionthat sheds a glory on its object and raises her before the eyes of the audience into the light in which he sees her  it was this remarkable power that took paris by storm when he became famous in the lovers part in the dame aux camelias  it is a short part really comprised in two scenes but as he acted it he was its original representative it left its poetic and exalting influence on the heroine throughout the play  a woman who could be so lovedwho could be so devotedly and romantically adoredhad a hold upon the general sympathy with which nothing less absorbing and complete could have invested her  when i first saw this play and this actor i could not in forming my lenient judgment of the heroine forget that she had been the inspiration of a passion of which i had beheld such profound and affecting marks  i said to myself as a child might have said  a bad woman could not have been the object of that wonderful tenderness could not have so subdued that worshipping heart could not have drawn such tears from such a lover  i am persuaded that the same effect was wrought upon the parisian audiences both consciously and unconsciously to a very great extent and that what was morally disagreeable in the dame aux camelias first got lost in this brilliant halo of romance i have seen the same play with the same part otherwise acted and in exact degree as the love became dull and earthy the heroine descended from her pedestal  in ruy blas in the master of ravenswood and in the lady of lyons three dramas in which mr fechter especially shines as a lover but notably in the firstthis remarkable power of surrounding the beloved creature in the eyes of the audience with the fascination that she has for him is strikingly displayed  that observer must be cold indeed who does not feel when ruy blas stands in the presence of the young unwedded queen of spain that the air is enchanted or when she bends over him laying her tender touch upon his bloody breast that it is better so to die than to live apart from her and that she is worthy to be so died for  when the master of ravenswood declares his love to lucy ashton and she hers to him and when in a burst of rapture he kisses the skirt of her dress we feel as though we touched it with our lips to stay our goddess from soaring away into the very heavens  and when they plight their troth and break the piece of gold it is wenot edgarwho quickly exchange our half for the half she was about to hang about her neck solely because the latter has for an instant touched the bosom we so dearly love  again in the lady of lyons  the picture on the easel in the poor cottage studio is not the unfinished portrait of a vain and arrogant girl but becomes the sketch of a souls high ambition and aspiration here and hereafter  picturesqueness is a quality above all others pervading mr fechters assumptions  himself a skilled painter and sculptor learned in the history of costume and informing those accomplishments and that knowledge with a similar infusion of romance for romance is inseparable from the man he is always a picturealways a picture in its right place in the group always in true composition with the background of the scene  for picturesqueness of manner note so trivial a thing as the turn of his hand in beckoning from a window in ruy blas to a personage down in an outer courtyard to come up or his assumption of the dukes livery in the same scene or his writing a letter from dictation  in the last scene of victor hugos noble drama his bearing becomes positively inspired and his sudden assumption of the attitude of the headsman in his denunciation of the duke and threat to be his executioner is so far as i know one of the most ferociously picturesque things conceivable on the stage  the foregoing use of the word ferociously reminds me to remark that this artist is a master of passionate vehemence in which aspect he appears to me to represent perhaps more than in any other an interesting union of characteristics of two great nationsthe french and the anglosaxon  born in london of a french mother by a german father but reared entirely in england and in france there is in his fury a combination of french suddenness and impressibility with our more slowly demonstrative anglosaxon way when we get as we say our blood up that produces an intensely fiery result  the fusion of two races is in it and one cannot decidedly say that it belongs to either but one can most decidedly say that it belongs to a powerful concentration of human passion and emotion and to human nature  mr fechter has been in the main more accustomed to speak french than to speak english and therefore he speaks our language with a french accent  but whosoever should suppose that he does not speak english fluently plainly distinctly and with a perfect understanding of the meaning weight and value of every word would be greatly mistaken  not only is his knowledge of english extending to the most subtle idiom or the most recondite cant phrasemore extensive than that of many of us who have english for our mothertongue but his delivery of shakespeares blank verse is remarkably facile musical and intelligent  to be in a sort of pain for him as one sometimes is for a foreigner speaking english or to be in any doubt of his having twenty synonymes at his tongues end if he should want one is out of the question after having been of his audience  a few words on two of his shakespearian impersonations and i shall have indicated enough in advance of mr fechters presentation of himself  that quality of picturesqueness on which i have already laid stress is strikingly developed in his iago and yet it is so judiciously governed that his iago is not in the least picturesque according to the conventional ways of frowning sneering diabolically grinning and elaborately doing everything else that would induce othello to run him through the body very early in the play  mr fechters is the iago who could and did make friends who could dissect his masters soul without flourishing his scalpel as if it were a walkingstick who could overpower emilia by other arts than a signofthesaracenshead grimness who could be a boon companion without ipso facto warning all beholders off by the portentous phenomenon who could sing a song and clink a can naturally enough and stab men really in the darknot in a transparent notification of himself as going about seeking whom to stab  mr fechters iago is no more in the conventional psychological mode than in the conventional hussar pantaloons and boots and you shall see the picturesqueness of his wearing borne out in his bearing all through the tragedy down to the moment when he becomes invincibly and consistently dumb  perhaps no innovation in art was ever accepted with so much favour by so many intellectual persons precommitted to and preoccupied by another system as mr fechters hamlet  i take this to have been the case as it unquestionably was in london not because of its picturesqueness not because of its novelty not because of its many scattered beauties but because of its perfect consistency with itself  as the animalpainter said of his favourite picture of rabbits that there was more nature about those rabbits than you usually found in rabbits so it may be said of mr fechters hamlet that there was more consistency about that hamlet than you usually found in hamlets  its great and satisfying originality was in its possessing the merit of a distinctly conceived and executed idea from the first appearance of the broken glass of fashion and mould of form pale and worn with weeping for his fathers death and remotely suspicious of its cause to his final struggle with horatio for the fatal cup there were cohesion and coherence in mr fechters view of the character  devrient the german actor had some years before in london fluttered the theatrical doves considerably by such changes as being seated when instructing the players and like mild departures from established usage but he had worn in the main the old nondescript dress and had held forth in the main in the old way hovering between sanity and madness  i do not remember whether he wore his hair crisply curled short as if he were going to an everlasting dancingmasters party at the danish court but i do remember that most other hamlets since the great kemble had been bound to do so  mr fechters hamlet a pale woebegone norseman with long flaxen hair wearing a strange garb never associated with the part upon the english stage if ever seen there at all and making a piratical swoop upon the whole fleet of little theatrical prescriptions without meaning or like dr johnsons celebrated friend with only one idea in them and that a wrong one never could have achieved its extraordinary success but for its animation by one pervading purpose to which all changes were made intelligently subservient  the bearing of this purpose on the treatment of ophelia on the death of polonius and on the old student fellowship between hamlet and horatio was exceedingly striking and the difference between picturesqueness of stage arrangement for mere stage effect and for the elucidation of a meaning was well displayed in there having been a gallery of musicians at the play and in one of them passing on his way out with his instrument in his hand when hamlet seeing it took it from him to point his talk with rosencrantz and guildenstern  this leads me to the observation with which i have all along desired to conclude  that mr fechters romance and picturesqueness are always united to a true artists intelligence and a true artists training in a true artists spirit  he became one of the company of the theatre francais when he was a very young man and he has cultivated his natural gifts in the best schools  i cannot wish my friend a better audience than he will have in the american people and i cannot wish them a better actor than they will have in my friend    footnotes  1  cornhill magazine
