88391592	some rambling notes of an idle excursion  by mark twain     i  all the journeyings i had ever done had been purely in the way of business the pleasant may weather suggested a novelty namely a trip for pure recreation the breadandbutter element left out the reverend said he would go too a good man one of the best of men although a clergyman by eleven at night we were in new haven and on board the new york boat we bought our tickets and then went wandering around here and there in the solid comfort of being free and idle and of putting distance between ourselves and the mails and telegraphs  after a while i went to my stateroom and undressed but the night was too enticing for bed we were moving down the bay now and it was pleasant to stand at the window and take the cool night breeze and watch the gliding lights on shore presently two elderly men sat down under that window and began a conversation their talk was properly no business of mine yet i was feeling friendly toward the world and willing to be entertained i soon gathered that they were brothers that they were from a small connecticut village and that the matter in hand concerned the cemetery said one  now john we talked it all over amongst ourselves and this is what weve done you see everybody was amovin from the old buryinground and our folks was most about left to theirselves as you may say they was crowded too as you know lot want big enough in the first place and last year when seths wife died we couldnt hardly tuck her in she sort o overlaid deacon shorbs lot and he soured on her so to speak and on the rest of us too so we talked it over and i was for a lay out in the new simitery on the hill they want unwilling if it was cheap well the two best and biggest plots was no 8 and no 9both of a size nice comfortable room for twentysixtwentysix fullgrowns that is but you reckon in children and other shorts and strike an average and i should say you might lay in thirty or maybe thirtytwo or three pretty genteelno crowdin to signify  thats a plenty william which one did you buy  well im acomin to that john you see no 8 was thirteen dollars no 9 fourteen  i see sost you took no 8  you wait i took no 9 and ill tell you for why in the first place deacon shorb wanted it well after the way hed gone on about seths wife overlappin his premses id a beat him out of that no 9 if id a had to stand two dollars extra let alone one thats the way i felt about it says i whats a dollar anyway lifes ony a pilgrimage says i we aint here for good and we cant take it with us says i so i just dumped it down knowin the lord dont suffer a good deed to go for nothin and callatin to take it out o somebody in the course o trade then there was another reason john no 9s a long way the handiest lot in the simitery and the likeliest for situation it lays right on top of a knoll in the dead center of the buryin ground and you can see millport from there and tracys and hopper mount and a raft o farms and so on there aint no better outlook from a buryinplot in the state si higgins says so and i reckon he ought to know well and that aint all course shorb had to take no 8 want no help for t now no 8 jines onto no 9 but its on the slope of the hill and every time it rains it ll soak right down onto the shorbs si higgins says t when the deacons time comes he better take out fire and marine insurance both on his remains  here there was the sound of a low placid duplicate chuckle of appreciation and satisfaction  now john heres a little rough draft of the ground that ive made on a piece of paper up here in the lefthand corner weve bunched the departed took them from the old graveyard and stowed them one alongside o tother on a firstcomefirstserved plan no partialities with granther jones for a starter ony because it happened so and windin up indiscriminate with seths twins a little crowded towards the end of the layout maybe but we reckoned twant best to scatter the twins well next comes the livin here where its marked a were goin to put mariar and her family when theyre called b thats for brother hosea and hisn c calvin and tribe whats left is these two lots herejust the gem of the whole patch for general style and outlook theyre for me and my folks and you and yourn which of them would you rather be buried in  i swan youve took me mighty unexpected william it sort of started the shivers fact is i was thinkin so busy about makin things comfortable for the others i hadnt thought about being buried myself  lifes ony a fleetin show john as the sayin is weve all got to go sooner or later to go with a clean records the main thing fact is its the ony thing worth strivin for john  yes thats so william thats so there aint no getting around it which of these lots would you recommend  well it depends john are you particular about outlook  i dont say i am william i dont say i aint reely i dont know but mainly i reckon id set store by a south exposure  thats easy fixed john theyre both south exposure they take the sun and the shorbs get the shade  how about site william  ds a sandy sile es mostly loom  you may gimme e then william a sandy sile caves in more or less and costs for repairs  all right set your name down here john under e now if you dont mind payin me your share of the fourteen dollars john while were on the business everythings fixed  after some niggling and sharp bargaining the money was paid and john bade his brother good night and took his leave there was silence for some moments then a soft chuckle welled up from the lonely william and he muttered i declare for t if i havent made a mistake its d thats mostly loom not e and johns booked for a sandy site after all  there was another soft chuckle and william departed to his rest also  the next day in new york was a hot one still we managed to get more or less entertainment out of it toward the middle of the afternoon we arrived on board the stanch steamship bermuda with bag and baggage and hunted for a shady place it was blazing summer weather until we were halfway down the harbor then i buttoned my coat closely half an hour later i put on a spring overcoat and buttoned that as we passed the lightship i added an ulster and tied a handkerchief around the collar to hold it snug to my neck so rapidly had the summer gone and winter come again  by nightfall we were far out at sea with no land in sight no telegrams could come here no letters no news this was an uplifting thought it was still more uplifting to reflect that the millions of harassed people on shore behind us were suffering just as usual  the next day brought us into the midst of the atlantic solitudesout of smokecolored sounding into fathomless deep blue no ships visible anywhere over the wide ocean no company but mother careys chickens wheeling darting skimming the waves in the sun there were some seafaring men among the passengers and conversation drifted into matter concerning ships and sailors one said that true as the needle to the pole was a bad figure since the needle seldom pointed to the pole he said a ships compass was not faithful to any particular point but was the most fickle and treacherous of the servants of man it was forever changing it changed every day in the year consequently the amount of the daily variation had to be ciphered out and allowance made for it else the mariner would go utterly astray another said there was a vast fortune waiting for the genius who should invent a compass that would not be affected by the local influences of an iron ship he said there was only one creature more fickle than a wooden ships compass and that was the compass of an iron ship then came reference to the well known fact that an experienced mariner can look at the compass of a new iron vessel thousands of mile from her birthplace and tell which way her head was pointing when she was in process of building  now an ancient whaleship master fell to talking about the sort of crews they used to have in his early days said he  sometimes wed have a batch of college students queer lot ignorant why they didnt know the catheads from the main brace but if you took them for fools youd get bit sure theyd learn more in a month than another man would in a year we had one once in the mary ann that came aboard with gold spectacles on and besides he was rigged out from main truck to keelson in the nobbiest clothes that ever saw a focastle he had a chestful too cloaks and broadcloth coats and velvet vests everything swell you know and didnt the saltwater fix them out for him i guess not well going to sea the mate told him to go aloft and help shake out the foretogallantsl up he shins to the foretop with his spectacles on and in a minute down he comes again looking insulted says the mate what did you come down for says the chap praps you didnt notice that there aint any ladders above there you see we hadnt any shrouds above the foretop the men bursted out in a laugh such as i guess you never heard the like of next night which was dark and rainy the mate ordered this chap to go aloft about something and im dummed if he didnt start up with an umbrella and a lantern but no matter he made a mighty good sailor before the voyage was done and we had to hunt up something else to laugh at years afterwards when i had forgot all about him i comes into boston mate of a ship and was loafing around town with the second mate and it so happened that we stepped into the revere house thinking maybe we would chance the salthorse in that big diningroom for a flyer as the boys say some fellows were talking just at our elbow and one says yonders the new governor of massachusettsat that table over there with the ladies we took a good look my mate and i for we hadnt either of us ever see a governor before i looked and looked at that face and then all of a sudden it popped on me but didnt give any sign says i mate ive a notion to go over and shake hands with him says he i think i see you doing it tom says i mate im agoing to do it says he oh yes i guess so maybe you dont want to bet you will tom say i i dont mind going a v on it mate says he put it up up she goes says i planking the cash this surprised him but he covered it and says pretty sarcastic hadnt you better take your grub with the governor and the ladies tom says i upon second thoughts i will says he well tom you aye a dum fool says i maybe i am maybe i aint but the main question is do you wan to risk two and a half that i wont do it make it a v says he done says i i started him a giggling and slapping his hand on his thigh he felt so good i went over there and leaned my knuckle on the table a minute and looked the governor in the face and says i mr gardner dont you know me he stared and i stared and he stared then all of a sudden he sings out tom bowling by the holy poker ladies its old tom bowling that youve heard me talk aboutshipmate of mine in the mary ann he rose up and shook hands with me ever so heartyi sort of glanced around and took a realizing sense of my mates saucer eyesand then says the governor plant yourself tom plant yourself you cant cat your anchor again till youve had a feed with me and the ladies i planted myself alongside the governor and canted my eye around toward my mate well sir his deadlights were bugged out like tompions and his mouth stood that wide open that you could have laid a ham in it without him noticing it  there was great applause at the conclusion of the old captains story then after a moments silence a grave pale young man said  had you ever met the governor before  the old captain looked steadily at this inquirer awhile and then got up and walked aft without making any reply one passenger after another stole a furtive glance at the inquirer but failed to make him out and so gave him up it took some little work to get the talkmachinery to running smoothly again after this derangement but at length a conversation sprang up about that important and jealously guarded instrument a ships timekeeper its exceeding delicate accuracy and the wreck and destruction that have sometimes resulted from its varying a few seemingly trifling moments from the true time then in due course my comrade the reverend got off on a yarn with a fair wind and everything drawing it was a true story tooabout captain rouncevilles shipwrecktrue in every detail it was to this effect  captain rouncevilles vessel was lost in midatlantic and likewise his wife and his two little children captain rounceville and seven seamen escaped with life but with little else a small rudely constructed raft was to be their home for eight days they had neither provisions nor water they had scarcely any clothing no one had a coat but the captain this coat was changing hands all the time for the weather was very cold whenever a man became exhausted with the cold they put the coat on him and laid him down between two shipmates until the garment and their bodies had warmed life into him again among the sailors was a portuguese who knew no english he seemed to have no thought of his own calamity but was concerned only about the captains bitter loss of wife and children by day he would look his dumb compassion in the captains face and by night in the darkness and the driving spray and rain he would seek out the captain and try to comfort him with caressing pats on the shoulder one day when hunger and thirst were making their sure inroad upon the mens strength and spirits a floating barrel was seen at a distance it seemed a great find for doubtless it contained food of some sort a brave fellow swam to it and after long and exhausting effort got it to the raft it was eagerly opened it was a barrel of magnesia on the fifth day an onion was spied a sailor swam off and got it although perishing with hunger he brought it in its integrity and put it into the captains hand the history of the sea teaches that among starving shipwrecked men selfishness is rare and a wondercompelling magnanimity the rule the onion was equally divided into eight parts and eaten with deep thanksgivings on the eighth day a distant ship was sighted attempts were made to hoist an oar with captain rouncevilles coat on it for a signal there were many failures for the men were but skeletons now and strengthless at last success was achieved but the signal brought no help the ship faded out of sight and left despair behind her by and by another ship appeared and passed so near that the castaways every eye eloquent with gratitude made ready to welcome the boat that would be sent to save them but this ship also drove on and left these men staring their unutterable surprise and dismay into each others ashen faces late in the day still another ship came up out of the distance but the men noted with a pang that her course was one which would not bring her nearer their remnant of life was nearly spent their lips and tongues were swollen parched cracked with eight days thirst their bodies starved and here was their last chance gliding relentlessly from them they would not be alive when the next sun rose for a day or two past the men had lost their voices but now captain rounceville whispered let us pray the portuguese patted him on the shoulder in sign of deep approval all knelt at the base of the oar that was waving the signalcoat aloft and bowed their heads the sea was tossing the sun rested a red rayless disk on the sealine in the west when the men presently raised their heads they would have roared a hallelujah if they had had a voicethe ships sails lay wrinkled and flapping against her mastsshe was going about here was rescue at last and in the very last instant of time that was left for it no not rescue yetonly the imminent prospect of it the red disk sank under the sea and darkness blotted out the ship by and by came a pleasant soundoars moving in a boats rowlocks nearer it came and nearerwithin thirty steps but nothing visible then a deep voice hollo the castaways could not answer their swollen tongues refused voice the boat skirted round and round the raft started awaythe agony of itreturned rested the oars close at hand listening no doubt the deep voice again hollo where are ye shipmates captain rounceville whispered to his men saying whisper your best boys nowall at once so they sent out an eightfold whisper in hoarse concert here there was life in it if it succeeded death if it failed after that supreme moment captain rounceville was conscious of nothing until he came to himself on board the saving ship said the reverend concluding  there was one little moment of time in which that raft could be visible from that ship and only one if that one little fleeting moment had passed unfruitful those mens doom was sealed as close as that does god shave events foreordained from the beginning of the world when the sun reached the waters edge that day the captain of that ship was sitting on deck reading his prayerbook the book fell he stooped to pick it up and happened to glance at the sun in that instant that faroff raft appeared for a second against the red disk its needlelike oar and diminutive signal cut sharp and black against the bright surface and in the next instant was thrust away into the dusk again but that ship that captain and that pregnant instant had had their work appointed for them in the dawn of time and could not fail of the performance the chronometer of god never errs  there was deep thoughtful silence for some moments then the grave pale young man said  what is the chronometer of god     ii  at dinner six oclock the same people assembled whom we had talked with on deck and seen at luncheon and breakfast this second day out and at dinner the evening before that is to say three journeying shipmasters a boston merchant and a returning bermudian who had been absent from his bermuda thirteen years these sat on the starboard side on the port side sat the reverend in the seat of honor the pale young man next to him i next next to me an aged bermudian returning to his sunny islands after an absence of twentyseven years of course our captain was at the head of the table the purser at the foot of it a small company but small companies are pleasantest  no racks upon the table the sky cloudless the sun brilliant the blue sea scarcely ruffled then what had become of the four married couples the three bachelors and the active and obliging doctor from the rural districts of pennsylvaniafor all these were on deck when we sailed down new york harbor this is the explanation i quote from my notebook       thursday 330 pm  under way passing the battery  the large      party of four married couples three bachelors and a cheery      exhilarating doctor from the wilds of pennsylvania are evidently      traveling together  all but the doctor grouped in campchairs on      deck       passing principal fort  the doctor is one of those people who has      an infallible preventive of seasickness is flitting from friend to      friend administering it and saying dont you be afraid i know      this medicine absolutely infallible prepared under my own      supervision  takes a dose himself intrepidly       415 pm  two of those ladies have struck their colors      notwithstanding the infallible  they have gone below  the other      two begin to show distress       5 pm  exit one husband and one bachelor  these still had their      infallible in cargo when they started but arrived at the      companionway without it       510  lady no 3 two bachelors and one married man have gone      below with their own opinion of the infallible       520  passing quarantine hulk  the infallible has done the      business for all the party except the scotchmans wife and the      author of that formidable remedy       nearing the lightship  exit the scotchmans wife head drooped on      stewardesss shoulder       entering the open sea  exit doctor   the rout seems permanent hence the smallness of the company at table since the voyage began our captain is a grave handsome hercules of thirtyfive with a brown hand of such majestic size that one cannot eat for admiring it and wondering if a single kid or calf could furnish material for gloving it  conversation not general drones along between couples one catches a sentence here and there like this from bermudian of thirteen years absence it is the nature of women to ask trivial irrelevant and pursuing questionsquestions that pursue you from a beginning in nothing to a runtocover in nowhere reply of bermudian of twentyseven years absence yes and to think they have logical analytical minds and argumentative ability you see em begin to whet up whenever they smell argument in the air plainly these be philosophers  twice since we left port our engines have stopped for a couple of minutes at a time now they stop again says the pale young man meditatively therethat engineer is sitting down to rest again  grave stare from the captain whose mighty jaws cease to work and whose harpooned potato stops in midair on its way to his open paralyzed mouth presently he says in measured tones is it your idea that the engineer of this ship propels her by a crank turned by his own hands  the pale young man studies over this a moment then lifts up his guileless eyes and says dont he  thus gently falls the deathblow to further conversation and the dinner drags to its close in a reflective silence disturbed by no sounds but the murmurous wash of the sea and the subdued clash of teeth  after a smoke and a promenade on deck where is no motion to discompose our steps we think of a game of whist we ask the brisk and capable stewardess from ireland if there are any cards in the ship  bless your soul dear indeed there is not a whole pack true for ye but not enough missing to signify  however i happened by accident to bethink me of a new pack in a morocco case in my trunk which i had placed there by mistake thinking it to be a flask of something so a party of us conquered the tedium of the evening with a few games and were ready for bed at six bells mariners time the signal for putting out the lights  there was much chat in the smokingcabin on the upper deck after luncheon today mostly whaler yarns from those old seacaptains captain tom bowling was garrulous he had that garrulous attention to minor detail which is born of secluded farm life or life at sea on long voyages where there is little to do and time no object he would sail along till he was right in the most exciting part of a yarn and then say well as i was saying the rudder was fouled ship driving before the gale headon straight for the iceberg all hands holding their breath turned to stone tophamper giving way sails blown to ribbons first one stick going then another boom smash crash duck your head and stand from under when up comes johnny rogers capstanbar in hand eyes ablazing hair aflying no twant johnny rogers lemme see  seems to me johnny rogers want along that voyage he was along one voyage i know that mighty well but somehow it seems to me that he signed the articles for this voyage butbutwhether he come along or not or got left or something happened  and so on and so on till the excitement all cooled down and nobody cared whether the ship struck the iceberg or not  in the course of his talk he rambled into a criticism upon new england degrees of merit in ship building said he you get a vessel built away down maineway bath for instance whats the result first thing you do you want to heave her down for repairsthats the result well sir she haint been hove down a week till you can heave a dog through her seams you send that vessel to sea and whats the result she wets her oakum the first trip leave it to any man if taint so well you let our folks build you a vesseldown new bedfordway whats the result well sir you might take that ship and heave her down and keep her hove down six months and shell never shed a tear  everybody landsmen and all recognized the descriptive neatness of that figure and applauded which greatly pleased the old man a moment later the meek eyes of the pale young fellow heretofore mentioned came up slowly rested upon the old mans face a moment and the meek mouth began to open  shet your head shouted the old mariner  it was a rather startling surprise to everybody but it was effective in the matter of its purpose so the conversation flowed on instead of perishing  there was some talk about the perils of the sea and a landsman delivered himself of the customary nonsense about the poor mariner wandering in far oceans tempesttossed pursued by dangers every stormblast and thunderbolt in the home skies moving the friends by snug firesides to compassion for that poor mariner and prayers for his succor captain bowling put up with this for a while and then burst out with a new view of the matter  come belay there i have read this kind of rot all my life in poetry and tales and suchlike rubbage pity for the poor mariner sympathy for the poor mariner all right enough but not in the way the poetry puts it pity for the mariners wife all right again but not in the way the poetry puts it looka here whose lifes the safest in the whole world the poor mariners you look at the statistics youll see so dont you fool away any sympathy on the poor mariners dangers and privations and sufferings leave that to the poetry muffs now you look at the other side a minute here is captain brace forty years old been at sea thirty on his way now to take command of his ship and sail south from bermuda next week hell be under way easy times comfortable quarters passengers sociable company just enough to do to keep his mind healthy and not tire him king over his ship boss of everything and everybody thirty years safety to learn him that his profession aint a dangerous one now you look back at his home his wifes a feeble woman shes a stranger in new york shut up in blazing hot or freezing cold lodgings according to the season dont know anybody hardly no company but her lonesomeness and her thoughts husband gone six months at a time she has borne eight children five of them she has buried without her husband ever setting eyes on them she watches them all the long nights till they diedhe comfortable on the sea she followed them to the grave she heard the clods fall that broke her heart he comfortable on the sea she mourned at home weeks and weeks missing them every day and every hourhe cheerful at sea knowing nothing about it now look at it a minuteturn it over in your mind and size it five children born she among strangers and him not by to hearten her buried and him not by to comfort her think of that sympathy for the poor mariners perils is rot give it to his wifes hard lines where it belongs poetry makes out that all the wife worries about is the dangers her husbands running shes got substantialer things to worry over i tell you poetrys always pitying the poor mariner on account of his perils at sea better a blamed sight pity him for the nights he cant sleep for thinking of how he had to leave his wife in her very birth pains lonesome and friendless in the thick of disease and trouble and death if theres one thing that can make me madder than another its this sappy damned maritime poetry  captain brace was a patient gentle seldom speaking man with a pathetic something in his bronzed face that had been a mystery up to this time but stood interpreted now since we had heard his story he had voyaged eighteen times to the mediterranean seven times to india once to the arctic pole in a discoveryship and between times had visited all the remote seas and ocean corners of the globe but he said that twelve years ago on account of his family he settled down and ever since then had ceased to roam and what do you suppose was this simplehearted lifelong wanderers idea of settling down and ceasing to roam why the making of two fivemonth voyages a year between surinam and boston for sugar and molasses  among other talk today it came out that whaleships carry no doctor the captain adds the doctorship to his own duties he not only gives medicines but sets broken limbs after notions of his own or saws them off and sears the stump when amputation seems best the captain is provided with a medicinechest with the medicines numbered instead of named a book of directions goes with this it describes diseases and symptoms and says give a teaspoonful of no 9 once an hour or give ten grains of no 12 every halfhour etc one of our seacaptains came across a skipper in the north pacific who was in a state of great surprise and perplexity said he  theres something rotten about this medicinechest business one of my men was sicknothing much the matter i looked in the book it said give him a teaspoonful of no 15 i went to the medicinechest and i see i was out of no 15 i judged id got to get up a combination somehow that would fill the bill so i hove into the fellow half a teaspoonful of no 8 and half a teaspoonful of no 7 and ill be hanged if it didnt kill him in fifteen minutes theres something about this medicinechest system thats too many for me  there was a good deal of pleasant gossip about old captain hurricane jones of the pacific oceanpeace to his ashes two or three of us present had known him i particularly well for i had made four seavoyages with him he was a very remarkable man he was born in a ship he picked up what little education he had among his shipmates he began life in the forecastle and climbed grade by grade to the captaincy more than fifty years of his sixtyfive were spent at sea he had sailed all oceans seen all lands and borrowed a tint from all climates when a man has been fifty years at sea he necessarily knows nothing of men nothing of the world but its surface nothing of the worlds thought nothing of the worlds learning but its a b c and that blurred and distorted by the unfocused lenses of an untrained mind such a man is only a gray and bearded child that is what old hurricane jones wassimply an innocent lovable old infant when his spirit was in repose he was as sweet and gentle as a girl when his wrath was up he was a hurricane that made his nickname seem tamely descriptive he was formidable in a fight for he was of powerful build and dauntless courage he was frescoed from head to heel with pictures and mottoes tattooed in red and blue india ink i was with him one voyage when he got his last vacant space tattooed this vacant space was around his left ankle during three days he stumped about the ship with his ankle bare and swollen and this legend gleaming red and angry out from a clouding of india ink virtue is its own rd there was a lack of room he was deeply and sincerely pious and swore like a fishwoman he considered swearing blameless because sailors would not understand an order unillumined by it he was a profound biblical scholarthat is he thought he was he believed everything in the bible but he had his own methods of arriving at his beliefs he was of the advanced school of thinkers and applied natural laws to the interpretation of all miracles somewhat on the plan of the people who make the six days of creation six geological epochs and so forth without being aware of it he was a rather severe satire on modern scientific religionists such a man as i have been describing is rabidly fond of disquisition and argument one knows that without being told it  one trip the captain had a clergyman on board but did not know he was a clergyman since the passengerlist did not betray the fact he took a great liking to this reverend mr peters and talked with him a great deal told him yarns gave him toothsome scraps of personal history and wove a glittering streak of profanity through his garrulous fabric that was refreshing to a spirit weary of the dull neutralities of undecorated speech one day the captain said peters do you ever read the bible  wellyes  i judge it aint often by the way you say it now you tackle it in dead earnest once and youll find it ll pay dont you get discouraged but hang right on first you wont understand it but by and by things will begin to clear up and then you wouldnt lay it down to eat  yes i have heard that said  and its so too there aint a book that begins with it it lays over m all peters theres some pretty tough things in itthere aint any getting around thatbut you stick to them and think them out and when once you get on the inside everythings plain as day  the miracles too captain  yes sir the miracles too every one of them now theres that business with the prophets of baal like enough that stumped you  well i dont know but  own up now it stumped you well i dont wonder you hadnt had any experience in raveling such things out and naturally it was too many for you would you like to have me explain that thing to you and show you how to get at the meat of these matters  indeed i would captain if you dont mind  then the captain proceeded as follows ill do it with pleasure first you see i read and read and thought and thought till i got to understand what sort of people they were in the old bible times and then after that it was all clear and easy now this was the way i put it up concerning isaacthis is the captains own mistakeand the prophets of baal there was some mighty sharp men among the public characters of that old ancient day and isaac was one of them isaac had his failingsplenty of them too it aint for me to apologize for isaac he played it on the prophets of baal and like enough he was justifiable considering the odds that was against him no all i say is twant any miracle and that ill show you sost you can see it yourself  well times had been getting rougher and rougher for prophetsthat is prophets of isaacs denomination there was four hundred and fifty prophets of baal in the community and only one presbyterian that is if isaac was a presbyterian which i reckon he was but it dont say naturally the prophets of baal took all the trade isaac was pretty lowspirited i reckon but he was a good deal of a man and no doubt he went aprophesying around letting on to be doing a landoffice business but twant any use he couldnt run any opposition to amount to anything by and by things got desperate with him he sets his head to work and thinks it all out and then what does he do why he begins to throw out hints that the other parties are this and that and tothernothing very definite maybe but just kind of undermining their reputation in a quiet way this made talk of course and finally got to the king the king asked isaac what he meant by his talk says isaac oh nothing particular only can they praydown fire from heaven on an altar it aint much maybe your majesty only can they do it thats the idea so the king was a good deal disturbed and he went to the prophets of baal and they said pretty airy that if he had an altar ready they were ready and they intimated he better get it insured too  so next morning all the children of israel and their parents and the other people gathered themselves together well here was that great crowd of prophets of baal packed together on one side and isaac walking up and down all alone on the other putting up his job when time was called isaac let on to be comfortable and indifferent told the other team to take the first innings so they went at it the whole four hundred and fifty praying around the altar very hopeful and doing their level best they prayed an hourtwo hoursthree hoursand so on plumb till noon it want any use they hadnt took a trick of course they felt kind of ashamed before all those people and well they might now what would a magnanimous man do keep still wouldnt he of course what did isaac do he graveled the prophets of baal every way he could think of says he you dont speak up loud enough your gods asleep like enough or maybe hes taking a walk you want to holler you knowor words to that effect i dont recollect the exact language mind i dont apologize for isaac he had his faults  well the prophets of baal prayed along the best they knew how all the afternoon and never raised a spark at last about sundown they were all tuckered out and they owned up and quit  what does isaac do now he steps up and says to some friends of his there pour four barrels of water on the altar everybody was astonished for the other side had prayed at it dry you know and got whitewashed they poured it on says he heave on four more barrels then he says heave on four more twelve barrels you see altogether the water ran all over the altar and all down the sides and filled up a trench around it that would hold a couple of hogsheadsmeasures it says i reckon it means about a hogshead some of the people were going to put on their things and go for they allowed he was crazy they didnt know isaac isaac knelt down and began to pray he strung along and strung along about the heathen in distant lands and about the sister churches and about the state and the country at large and about those thats in authority in the government and all the usual program you know till everybody had got tired and gone to thinking about something else and then all of a sudden when nobody was noticing he outs with a match and rakes it on the under side of his leg and pff up the whole thing blazes like a house afire twelve barrels of water petroleum sir petroleum thats what it was  petroleum captain  yes sir the country was full of it isaac knew all about that you read the bible dont you worry about the tough places they aint tough when you come to think them out and throw light on them there aint a thing in the bible but what is true all you want is to go prayerfully to work and cipher out how twas done  at eight oclock on the third morning out from new york land was sighted away across the sunny waves one saw a faint dark stripe stretched along under the horizonor pretended to see it for the credit of his eyesight even the reverend said he saw it a thing which was manifestly not so but i never have seen any one who was morally strong enough to confess that he could not see land when others claimed that they could  by and by the bermuda islands were easily visible the principal one lay upon the water in the distance a long dullcolored body scalloped with slight hills and valleys we could not go straight at it but had to travel all the way around it sixteen miles from shore because it is fenced with an invisible coral reef at last we sighted buoys bobbing here and there and then we glided into a narrow channel among them raised the reef and came upon shoaling blue water that soon further shoaled into pale green with a surface scarcely rippled now came the resurrection hour the berths gave up their dead who are these pale specters in plughats and silken flounces that file up the companionway in melancholy procession and step upon the deck these are they which took the infallible preventive of seasickness in new york harbor and then disappeared and were forgotten also there came two or three faces not seen before until this moment ones impulse is to ask where did you come aboard  we followed the narrow channel a long time with land on both sideslow hills that might have been green and grassy but had a faded look instead however the landlocked water was lovely at any rate with its glittering belts of blue and green where moderate soundings were and its broad splotches of rich brown where the rocks lay near the surface everybody was feeling so well that even the grave pale young man who by a sort of kindly common consent had come latterly to be referred to as the ass received frequent and friendly noticewhich was right enough for there was no harm in him  at last we steamed between two island points whose rocky jaws allowed only just enough room for the vessels body and now before us loomed hamilton on her clustered hillsides and summits the whitest mass of terraced architecture that exists in the world perhaps  it was sunday afternoon and on the pier were gathered one or two hundred bermudians half of them black half of them white and all of them nobbily dressed as the poet says  several boats came off to the ship bringing citizens one of these citizens was a faded diminutive old gentleman who approached our most ancient passenger with a childlike joy in his twinkling eyes halted before him folded his arms and said smiling with all his might and with all the simple delight that was in him you dont know me john come out with it now you know you dont  the ancient passenger scanned him perplexedly scanned the napless threadbare costume of venerable fashion that had done sunday service no man knows how many years contemplated the marvelous stovepipe hat of still more ancient and venerable pattern with its poor pathetic old stiff brim canted up gallusly in the wrong places and said with a hesitation that indicated strong internal effort to place the gentle old apparition why let me see plague on it theres something about you that er er but ive been gone from bermuda for twentyseven years and hum hum  i dont seem to get at it somehow but theres something about you that is just as familiar to me as  likely it might be his hat murmured the ass with innocent sympathetic interest  so the reverend and i had at last arrived at hamilton the principal town in the bermuda islands a wonderfully white town white as snow itself white as marble white as flour yet looking like none of these exactly never mind we said we shall hit upon a figure by and by that will describe this peculiar white  it was a town that was compacted together upon the sides and tops of a cluster of small hills its outlying borders fringed off and thinned away among the cedar forests and there was no woody distance of curving coast or leafy islet sleeping upon the dimpled painted sea but was flecked with shining white pointshalfconcealed houses peeping out of the foliage the architecture of the town was mainly spanish inherited from the colonists of two hundred and fifty years ago some raggedtopped cocoapalms glimpsed here and there gave the land a tropical aspect  there was an ample pier of heavy masonry upon this under shelter were some thousands of barrels containing that product which has carried the fame of bermuda to many lands the potato with here and there an onion that last sentence is facetious for they grow at least two onions in bermuda to one potato the onion is the pride and joy of bermuda it is her jewel her gem of gems in her conversation her pulpit her literature it is her most frequent and eloquent figure in bermuda metaphor it stands for perfectionperfection absolute  the bermudian weeping over the departed exhausts praise when he says he was an onion the bermudian extolling the living hero bankrupts applause when he says he is an onion the bermudian setting his son upon the stage of life to dare and do for himself climaxes all counsel supplication admonition comprehends all ambition when he says be an onion  when parallel with the pier and ten or fifteen steps outside it we anchored it was sunday bright and sunny the groups upon the piermen youths and boyswere whites and blacks in about equal proportion all were well and neatly dressed many of them nattily a few of them very stylishly one would have to travel far before he would find another town of twelve thousand inhabitants that could represent itself so respectably in the matter of clothes on a freightpier without premeditation or effort the women and young girls black and white who occasionally passed by were nicely clad and many were elegantly and fashionably so the men did not affect summer clothing much but the girls and women did and their white garments were good to look at after so many months of familiarity with somber colors  around one isolated potatobarrel stood four young gentlemen two black two white becomingly dressed each with the head of a slender cane pressed against his teeth and each with a foot propped up on the barrel another young gentleman came up looked longingly at the barrel but saw no rest for his foot there and turned pensively away to seek another barrel he wandered here and there but without result nobody sat upon a barrel as is the custom of the idle in other lands yet all the isolated barrels were humanly occupied whosoever had a foot to spare put it on a barrel if all the places on it were not already taken the habits of all peoples are determined by their circumstances the bermudians lean upon barrels because of the scarcity of lampposts  many citizens came on board and spoke eagerly to the officersinquiring about the turcorussian war news i supposed however by listening judiciously i found that this was not so they said what is the price of onions or hows onions naturally enough this was their first interest but they dropped into the war the moment it was satisfied  we went ashore and found a novelty of a pleasant nature there were no hackmen hacks or omnibuses on the pier or about it anywhere and nobody offered his services to us or molested us in any way i said it was like being in heaven the reverend rebukingly and rather pointedly advised me to make the most of it then we knew of a boardinghouse and what we needed now was somebody to pilot us to it presently a little barefooted colored boy came along whose raggedness was conspicuously not bermudian his rear was so marvelously bepatched with colored squares and triangles that one was half persuaded he had got it out of an atlas when the sun struck him right he was as good to follow as a lightningbug we hired him and dropped into his wake he piloted us through one picturesque street after another and in due course deposited us where we belonged he charged nothing for his map and but a trifle for his services so the reverend doubled it the little chap received the money with a beaming applause in his eye which plainly said this mans an onion  we had brought no letters of introduction our names had been misspelled in the passengerlist nobody knew whether we were honest folk or otherwise so we were expecting to have a good private time in case there was nothing in our general aspect to close boardinghouse doors against us we had no trouble bermuda has had but little experience of rascals and is not suspicious we got large cool welllighted rooms on a second floor overlooking a bloomy display of flowers and flowering shrubscalia and annunciation lilies lantanas heliotrope jasmine roses pinks double geraniums oleanders pomegranates blue morningglories of a great size and many plants that were unknown to me     iii   we took a long afternoon walk and soon found out that that exceedingly white town was built of blocks of white coral bermuda is a coral island with a sixinch crust of soil on top of it and every man has a quarry on his own premises everywhere you go you see square recesses cut into the hillsides with perpendicular walls unmarred by crack or crevice and perhaps you fancy that a house grew out of the ground there and has been removed in a single piece from the mold if you do you err but the material for a house has been quarried there they cut right down through the coral to any depth that is convenientten to twenty feetand take it out in great square blocks this cutting is done with a chisel that has a handle twelve or fifteen feet long and is used as one uses a crowbar when he is drilling a hole or a dasher when he is churning thus soft is this stone then with a common handsaw they saw the great blocks into handsome huge bricks that are two feet long a foot wide and about six inches thick these stand loosely piled during a month to harden then the work of building begins  the house is built of these blocks it is roofed with broad coral slabs an inch thick whose edges lap upon each other so that the roof looks like a succession of shallow steps or terraces the chimneys are built of the coral blocks and sawed into graceful and picturesque patterns the groundfloor veranda is paved with coral blocks also the walk to the gate the fence is built of coral blocksbuilt in massive panels with broad capstones and heavy gateposts and the whole trimmed into easy lines and comely shape with the saw then they put a hard coat of whitewash as thick as your thumbnail on the fence and all over the house roof chimneys and all the sun comes out and shines on this spectacle and it is time for you to shut your unaccustomed eyes lest they be put out it is the whitest white you can conceive of and the blindingest a bermuda house does not look like marble it is a much intenser white than that and besides there is a dainty indefinable something else about its look that is not marblelike we put in a great deal of solid talk and reflection over this matter of trying to find a figure that would describe the unique white of a bermuda house and we contrived to hit upon it at last it is exactly the white of the icing of a cake and has the same unemphasized and scarcely perceptible polish the white of marble is modest and retiring compared with it  after the house is cased in its hard scale of whitewash not a crack or sign of a seam or joining of the blocks is detectable from basestone to chimneytop the building looks as if it had been carved from a single block of stone and the doors and windows sawed out afterward a white marble house has a cold tomblike unsociable look and takes the conversation out of a body and depresses him not so with a bermuda house there is something exhilarating even hilarious about its vivid whiteness when the sun plays upon it if it be of picturesque shape and graceful contourand many of the bermudian dwellings areit will so fascinate you that you will keep your eyes on it until they ache one of those cleancut fanciful chimneystoo pure and white for this worldwith one side glowing in the sun and the other touched with a soft shadow is an object that will charm ones gaze by the hour i know of no other country that has chimneys worthy to be gazed at and gloated over one of those snowy houses half concealed and half glimpsed through green foliage is a pretty thing to see and if it takes one by surprise and suddenly as he turns a sharp corner of a country road it will wring an exclamation from him sure  wherever you go in town or country you find those snowy houses and always with masses of brightcolored flowers about them but with no vines climbing their walls vines cannot take hold of the smooth hard whitewash wherever you go in the town or along the country roads among little potato farms and patches or expensive countryseats these stainless white dwellings gleaming out from flowers and foliage meet you at every turn the least little bit of a cottage is as white and blemishless as the stateliest mansion nowhere is there dirt or stench puddle or hogwallow neglect disorder or lack of trimness and neatness the roads the streets the dwellings the people the clothesthis neatness extends to everything that falls under the eye it is the tidiest country in the world and very much the tidiest too  considering these things the question came up where do the poor live no answer was arrived at therefore we agreed to leave this conundrum for future statesmen to wrangle over  what a bright and startling spectacle one of those blazing white country palaces with its browntinted windowcaps and ledges and green shutters and its wealth of caressing flowers and foliage would be in black london and what a gleaming surprise it would be in nearly any american city one could mention too  bermuda roads are made by cutting down a few inches into the solid white coralor a good many feet where a hill intrudes itselfand smoothing off the surface of the roadbed it is a simple and easy process the grain of the coral is coarse and porous the roadbed has the look of being made of coarse white sugar its excessive cleanness and whiteness are a trouble in one way the sun is reflected into your eyes with such energy as you walk along that you want to sneeze all the time old captain tom bowling found another difficulty he joined us in our walk but kept wandering unrestfully to the roadside finally he explained said he well i chew you know and the roads so plagued clean  we walked several miles that afternoon in the bewildering glare of the sun the white roads and the white buildings our eyes got to paining us a good deal by and by a soothing blessed twilight spread its cool balm around we looked up in pleased surprise and saw that it proceeded from an intensely black negro who was going by we answered his military salute in the grateful gloom of his near presence and then passed on into the pitiless white glare again  the colored women whom we met usually bowed and spoke so did the children the colored men commonly gave the military salute they borrow this fashion from the soldiers no doubt england has kept a garrison here for generations the younger mens custom of carrying small canes is also borrowed from the soldiers i suppose who always carry a cane in bermuda as everywhere else in britains broad dominions  the country roads curve and wind hither and thither in the delightfulest way unfolding pretty surprises at every turn billowy masses of oleander that seem to float out from behind distant projections like the pink cloudbanks of sunset sudden plunges among cottages and gardens life and activity followed by as sudden plunges into the somber twilight and stillness of the woods flitting visions of white fortresses and beacon towers pictured against the sky on remote hilltops glimpses of shining green sea caught for a moment through opening headlands then lost again more woods and solitude and by and by another turn lays bare without warning the full sweep of the inland ocean enriched with its bars of soft color and graced with its wandering sails  take any road you please you may depend upon it you will not stay in it half a mile your road is everything that a road ought to be it is bordered with trees and with strange plants and flowers it is shady and pleasant or sunny and still pleasant it carries you by the prettiest and peacefulest and most homelike of homes and through stretches of forest that lie in a deep hush sometimes and sometimes are alive with the music of birds it curves always which is a continual promise whereas straight roads reveal everything at a glance and kill interest your road is all this and yet you will not stay in it half a mile for the reason that little seductive mysterious roads are always branching out from it on either hand and as these curve sharply also and hide what is beyond you cannot resist the temptation to desert your own chosen road and explore them you are usually paid for your trouble consequently your walk inland always turns out to be one of the most crooked involved purposeless and interesting experiences a body can imagine there is enough of variety sometimes you are in the level open with marshes thick grown with flaglances that are ten feet high on the one hand and potato and onion orchards on the other next you are on a hilltop with the ocean and the islands spread around you presently the road winds through a deep cut shut in by perpendicular walls thirty or forty feet high marked with the oddest and abruptest stratum lines suggestive of sudden and eccentric old upheavals and garnished with here and there a clinging adventurous flower and here and there a dangling vine and by and by your way is along the sea edge and you may look down a fathom or two through the transparent water and watch the diamondlike flash and play of the light upon the rocks and sands on the bottom until you are tired of itif you are so constituted as to be able to get tired of it  you may march the country roads in maiden meditation fancy free by field and farm for no dog will plunge out at you from unsuspected gate with breathtaking surprise of ferocious bark notwithstanding it is a christian land and a civilized we saw upward of a million cats in bermuda but the people are very abstemious in the matter of dogs two or three nights we prowled the country far and wide and never once were accosted by a dog it is a great privilege to visit such a land the cats were no offense when properly distributed but when piled they obstructed travel  as we entered the edge of the town that sunday afternoon we stopped at a cottage to get a drink of water the proprietor a middleaged man with a good face asked us to sit down and rest his dame brought chairs and we grouped ourselves in the shade of the trees by the door mr smiththat was not his name but it will answerquestioned us about ourselves and our country and we answered him truthfully as a general thing and questioned him in return it was all very simple and pleasant and sociable rural too for there was a pig and a small donkey and a hen anchored out close at hand by cords to their legs on a spot that purported to be grassy presently a woman passed along and although she coldly said nothing she changed the drift of our talk said smith  she didnt look this way you noticed well she is our next neighbor on one side and theres another family thats our next neighbors on the other side but theres a general coolness all around now and we dont speak yet these three families one generation and another have lived here side by side and been as friendly as weavers for a hundred and fifty years till about a year ago  why what calamity could have been powerful enough to break up so old a friendship  well it was too bad but it couldnt be helped it happened like this about a year or more ago the rats got to pestering my place a good deal and i set up a steel trap in my back yard both of these neighbors run considerable to cats and so i warned them about the trap because their cats were pretty sociable around here nights and they might get into trouble without my intending it well they shut up their cats for a while but you know how it is with people they got careless and sure enough one night the trap took mrs joness principal tomcat into camp and finished him up in the morning mrs jones comes here with the corpse in her arms and cries and takes on the same as if it was a child it was a cat by the name of yelvertonhector g yelvertona troublesome old rip with no more principle than an injun though you couldnt make her believe it i said all a man could to comfort her but no nothing would do but i must pay for him finally i said i warnt investing in cats now as much as i was and with that she walked off in a huff carrying the remains with her that closed our intercourse with the joneses mrs jones joined another church and took her tribe with her she said she would not hold fellowship with assassins well by and by comes mrs browns turnshe that went by here a minute ago she had a disgraceful old yellow cat that she thought as much of as if he was twins and one night he tried that trap on his neck and it fitted him so and was so sort of satisfactory that he laid down and curled up and stayed with it such was the end of sir john baldwin  was that the name of the cat  the same theres cats around here with names that would surprise you maria to his wife what was that cats name that eat a keg of ratsbane by mistake over at hoopers and started home and got struck by lightning and took the blind staggers and fell in the well and was most drowned before they could fish him out  that was that colored deacon jacksons cat i only remember the last end of its name which was holdthefortforiamcoming jackson  sho that aint the one thats the one that eat up an entire box of seidlitz powders and then hadnt any more judgment than to go and take a drink he was considered to be a great loss but i never could see it well no matter about the names mrs brown wanted to be reasonable but mrs jones wouldnt let her she put her up to going to law for damages so to law she went and had the face to claim seven shillings and sixpence it made a great stir all the neighbors went to court everybody took sides it got hotter and hotter and broke up all the friendships for three hundred yards around friendships that had lasted for generations and generations  well i proved by eleven witnesses that the cat was of a low character and very ornery and warnt worth a canceled postagestamp anyway taking the average of cats here but i lost the case what could i expect the system is all wrong here and is bound to make revolution and bloodshed some day you see they give the magistrate a poor little starvation salary and then turn him loose on the public to gouge for fees and costs to live on what is the natural result why he never looks into the justice of a casenever once all he looks at is which client has got the money so this one piled the fees and costs and everything on to me i could pay specie dont you see and he knew mighty well that if he put the verdict on to mrs brown where it belonged hed have to take his swag in currency  currency why has bermuda a currency  yesonions and they were forty per cent discount too then because the season had been over as much as three months so i lost my case i had to pay for that cat but the general trouble the case made was the worst thing about it broke up so much good feeling the neighbors dont speak to each other now mrs brown had named a child after me but she changed its name right away she is a baptist well in the course of baptizing it over again it got drowned i was hoping we might get to be friendly again some time or other but of course this drowning the child knocked that all out of the question it would have saved a world of heartbreak and ill blood if she had named it dry  i knew by the sigh that this was honest all this trouble and all this destruction of confidence in the purity of the bench on account of a sevenshilling lawsuit about a cat somehow it seemed to size the country  at this point we observed that an english flag had just been placed at halfmast on a building a hundred yards away i and my friends were busy in an instant trying to imagine whose death among the island dignitaries could command such a mark of respect as this then a shudder shook them and me at the same moment and i knew that we had jumped to one and the same conclusion the governor has gone to england it is for the british admiral  at this moment mr smith noticed the flag he said with emotion  thats on a boardinghouse i judge theres a boarder dead  a dozen other flags within view went to halfmast  its a boarder sure said smith  but would they halfmast the flags here for a boarder mr smith  why certainly they would if he was dead  that seemed to size the country again     iv  the early twilight of a sunday evening in hamilton bermuda is an alluring time there is just enough of whispering breeze fragrance of flowers and sense of repose to raise ones thoughts heavenward and just enough amateur piano music to keep him reminded of the other place there are many venerable pianos in hamilton and they all play at twilight age enlarges and enriches the powers of some musical instrumentsnotably those of the violinbut it seems to set a pianos teeth on edge most of the music in vogue there is the same that those pianos prattled in their innocent infancy and there is something very pathetic about it when they go over it now in their asthmatic second childhood dropping a note here and there where a tooth is gone  we attended evening service at the stately episcopal church on the hill where five or six hundred people half of them white and the other half black according to the usual bermudian proportions and all well dresseda thing which is also usual in bermuda and to be confidently expected there was good music which we heard and doubtlessa good sermon but there was a wonderful deal of coughing and so only the high parts of the argument carried over it as we came out after service i overheard one young girl say to another  why you dont mean to say you pay duty on gloves and laces i only pay postage have them done up and sent in the boston advertiser  there are those that believe that the most difficult thing to create is a woman who can comprehend that it is wrong to smuggle and that an impossible thing to create is a woman who will not smuggle whether or no when she gets a chance but these may be errors  we went wandering off toward the country and were soon far down in the lonely black depths of a road that was roofed over with the dense foliage of a double rank of great cedars there was no sound of any kind there it was perfectly still and it was so dark that one could detect nothing but somber outlines we strode farther and farther down this tunnel cheering the way with chat  presently the chat took this shape how insensibly the character of the people and of a government makes its impress upon a stranger and gives him a sense of security or of insecurity without his taking deliberate thought upon the matter or asking anybody a question we have been in this land half a day we have seen none but honest faces we have noted the british flag flying which means efficient government and good order so without inquiry we plunge unarmed and with perfect confidence into this dismal place which in almost any other country would swarm with thugs and garroters  sh what was that stealthy footsteps low voices we gasp we close up together and wait a vague shape glides out of the dusk and confronts us a voice speaksdemands money  a shilling gentlemen if you please to help build the new methodist church  blessed sound holy sound we contribute with thankful avidity to the new methodist church and are happy to think how lucky it was that those little colored sundayschool scholars did not seize upon everything we had with violence before we recovered from our momentary helpless condition by the light of cigars we write down the names of weightier philanthropists than ourselves on the contribution cards and then pass on into the farther darkness saying what sort of a government do they call this where they allow little black pious children with contribution cards to plunge out upon peaceable strangers in the dark and scare them to death  we prowled on several hours sometimes by the seaside sometimes inland and finally managed to get lost which is a feat that requires talent in bermuda i had on new shoes they were no 7s when i started but were not more than 5s now and still diminishing i walked two hours in those shoes after that before we reached home doubtless i could have the readers sympathy for the asking many people have never had the headache or the toothache and i am one of those myself but every body has worn tight shoes for two or three hours and known the luxury of taking them off in a retired place and seeing his feet swell up and obscure the firmament once when i was a callow bashful cub i took a plain unsentimental country girl to a comedy one night i had known her a day she seemed divine i wore my new boots at the end of the first halfhour she said why do you fidget so with your feet i said did i then i put my attention there and kept still at the end of another halfhour she said why do you say yes oh yes and ha ha oh certainly very true to everything i say when half the time those are entirely irrelevant answers i blushed and explained that i had been a little absentminded at the end of another halfhour she said please why do you grin so steadfastly at vacancy and yet look so sad i explained that i always did that when i was reflecting an hour passed and then she turned and contemplated me with her earnest eyes and said why do you cry all the time i explained that very funny comedies always made me cry at last human nature surrendered and i secretly slipped my boots off this was a mistake i was not able to get them on any more it was a rainy night there were no omnibuses going our way and as i walked home burning up with shame with the girl on one arm and my boots under the other i was an object worthy of some compassionespecially in those moments of martyrdom when i had to pass through the glare that fell upon the pavement from streetlamps finally this child of the forest said where are your boots and being taken unprepared i put a fitting finish to the follies of the evening with the stupid remark the higher classes do not wear them to the theater  the reverend had been an army chaplain during the war and while we were hunting for a road that would lead to hamilton he told a story about two dying soldiers which interested me in spite of my feet he said that in the potomac hospitals rough pine coffins were furnished by government but that it was not always possible to keep up with the demand so when a man died if there was no coffin at hand he was buried without one one night late two soldiers lay dying in a ward a man came in with a coffin on his shoulder and stood trying to make up his mind which of these two poor fellows would be likely to need it first both of them begged for it with their fading eyesthey were past talking then one of them protruded a wasted hand from his blankets and made a feeble beckoning sign with the fingers to signify be a good fellow put it under my bed please the man did it and left the lucky soldier painfully turned himself in his bed until he faced the other warrior raised himself partly on his elbow and began to work up a mysterious expression of some kind in his face gradually irksomely but surely and steadily it developed and at last it took definite form as a pretty successful wink the sufferer fell back exhausted with his labor but bathed in glory now entered a personal friend of no 2 the despoiled soldier no 2 pleaded with him with eloquent eyes till presently he understood and removed the coffin from under no 1s bed and put it under no 2s no 2 indicated his joy and made some more signs the friend understood again and put his arm under no 2s shoulders and lifted him partly up then the dying hero turned the dim exultation of his eye upon no 1 and began a slow and labored work with his hands gradually he lifted one hand up toward his face it grew weak and dropped back again once more he made the effort but failed again he took a rest he gathered all the remnant of his strength and this time he slowly but surely carried his thumb to the side of his nose spread the gaunt fingers wide in triumph and dropped back dead that picture sticks by me yet the situation is unique  the next morning at what seemed a very early hour the little white tablewaiter appeared suddenly in my room and shot a single word out of himself breakfast  this was a remarkable boy in many ways he was about eleven years old he had alert intent black eyes he was quick of movement there was no hesitation no uncertainty about him anywhere there was a military decision in his lip his manner his speech that was an astonishing thing to see in a little chap like him he wasted no words his answers always came so quick and brief that they seemed to be part of the question that had been asked instead of a reply to it when he stood at table with his flybrush rigid erect his face set in a castiron gravity he was a statue till he detected a dawning want in somebodys eye then he pounced down supplied it and was instantly a statue again when he was sent to the kitchen for anything he marched upright till he got to the door he turned handsprings the rest of the way  breakfast  i thought i would make one more effort to get some conversation out of this being  have you called the reverend or are  yes sr  is it early or is  eightfive  do you have to do all the chores or is there somebody to give you a  colored girl  is there only one parish in this island or are there  eight  is the big church on the hill a parish church or is it  chapelofease  is taxation here classified into poll parish town and  dont know  before i could cudgel another question out of my head he was below handspringing across the back yard he had slid down the balusters headfirst i gave up trying to provoke a discussion with him the essential element of discussion had been left out of him his answers were so final and exact that they did not leave a doubt to hang conversation on i suspect that there is the making of a mighty man or a mighty rascal in this boyaccording to circumstancesbut they are going to apprentice him to a carpenter it is the way the world uses its opportunities  during this day and the next we took carriage drives about the island and over to the town of st georges fifteen or twenty miles away such hard excellent roads to drive over are not to be found elsewhere out of europe an intelligent young colored man drove us and acted as guidebook in the edge of the town we saw five or six mountaincabbage palms atrocious name standing in a straight row and equidistant from each other these were not the largest or the tallest trees i have ever seen but they were the stateliest the most majestic that row of them must be the nearest that nature has ever come to counterfeiting a colonnade these trees are all the same height say sixty feet the trunks as gray as granite with a very gradual and perfect taper without sign of branch or knot or flaw the surface not looking like bark but like granite that has been dressed and not polished thus all the way up the diminishing shaft for fifty feet then it begins to take the appearance of being closely wrapped spoolfashion with gray cord or of having been turned in a lathe above this point there is an outward swell and thence upward for six feet or more the cylinder is a bright fresh green and is formed of wrappings like those of an ear of green indian corn then comes the great spraying palm plume also green other palm trees always lean out of the perpendicular or have a curve in them but the plumbline could not detect a deflection in any individual of this stately row they stand as straight as the colonnade of baalbec they have its great height they have its gracefulness they have its dignity in moonlight or twilight and shorn of their plumes they would duplicate it  the birds we came across in the country were singularly tame even that wild creature the quail would pick around in the grass at ease while we inspected it and talked about it at leisure a small bird of the canary species had to be stirred up with the buttend of the whip before it would move and then it moved only a couple of feet it is said that even the suspicious flea is tame and sociable in bermuda and will allow himself to be caught and caressed without misgivings this should be taken with allowance for doubtless there is more or less brag about it in san francisco they used to claim that their native flea could kick a child over as if it were a merit in a flea to be able to do that as if the knowledge of it trumpeted abroad ought to entice immigration such a thing in nine cases out of ten would be almost sure to deter a thinking man from coming  we saw no bugs or reptiles to speak of and so i was thinking of saying in print in a general way that there were none at all but one night after i had gone to bed the reverend came into my room carrying something and asked is this your boot i said it was and he said he had met a spider going off with it next morning he stated that just at dawn the same spider raised his window and was coming in to get a shirt but saw him and fled  i inquired did he get the shirt  no  how did you know it was a shirt he was after  i could see it in his eye  we inquired around but could hear of no bermudian spider capable of doing these things citizens said that their largest spiders could not more than spread their legs over an ordinary saucer and that they had always been considered honest here was testimony of a clergyman against the testimony of mere worldlingsinterested ones too on the whole i judged it best to lock up my things  here and there on the country roads we found lemon papaw orange lime and fig trees also several sorts of palms among them the cocoa the date and the palmetto we saw some bamboos forty feet high with stems as thick as a mans arm jungles of the mangrove tree stood up out of swamps propped on their interlacing roots as upon a tangle of stilts in drier places the noble tamarind sent down its grateful cloud of shade here and there the blossomy tamarisk adorned the roadside there was a curious gnarled and twisted black tree without a single leaf on it it might have passed itself off for a dead apple tree but for the fact that it had a a starlike redhot flower sprinkled sparsely over its person it had the scattery red glow that a constellation might have when glimpsed through smoked glass it is possible that our constellations have been so constructed as to be invisible through smoked glass if this is so it is a great mistake  we saw a tree that bears grapes and just as calmly and unostentatiously as a vine would do it we saw an indiarubber tree but out of season possibly so there were no shoes on it nor suspenders nor anything that a person would properly expect to find there this gave it an impressively fraudulent look there was exactly one mahogany tree on the island i know this to be reliable because i saw a man who said he had counted it many a time and could not be mistaken he was a man with a harelip and a pure heart and everybody said he was as true as steel such men are all too few  ones eye caught near and far the pink cloud of the oleander and the red blaze of the pomegranate blossom in one piece of wild wood the morningglory vines had wrapped the trees to their very tops and decorated them all over with couples and clusters of great bluebellsa fine and striking spectacle at a little distance but the dull cedar is everywhere and is the prevailing foliage one does not appreciate how dull it is until the varnished bright green attire of the infrequent lemon tree pleasantly intrudes its contrast in one thing bermuda is eminently tropicalwas in may at leastthe unbrilliant slightly faded unrejoicing look of the landscape for forests arrayed in a blemishless magnificence of glowing green foliage that seems to exult in its own existence and can move the beholder to an enthusiasm that will make him either shout or cry one must go to countries that have malignant winters  we saw scores of colored farmers digging their crops of potatoes and onions their wives and children helpingentirely contented and comfortable if looks go for anything we never met a man or woman or child anywhere in this sunny island who seemed to be unprosperous or discontented or sorry about anything this sort of monotony became very tiresome presently and even something worse the spectacle of an entire nation groveling in contentment is an infuriating thing we felt the lack of something in this communitya vague an indefinable an elusive something and yet a lack but after considerable thought we made out what it wastramps let them go there right now in a body it is utterly virgin soil passage is cheap every true patriot in america will help buy tickets whole armies of these excellent beings can be spared from our midst and our polls they will find a delicious climate and a green kindhearted people there are potatoes and onions for all and a generous welcome for the first batch that arrives and elegant graves for the second  it was the early rose potato the people were digging later in the year they have another crop which they call the garnet we buy their potatoes retail at fifteen dollars a barrel and those colored farmers buy ours for a song and live on them havana might exchange cigars with connecticut in the same advantageous way if she thought of it  we passed a roadside grocery with a sign up potatoes wanted an ignorant stranger doubtless he could not have gone thirty steps from his place without finding plenty of them  in several fields the arrowroot crop was already sprouting bermuda used to make a vast annual profit out of this staple before firearms came into such general use  the island is not large somewhere in the interior a man ahead of us had a very slow horse i suggested that we had better go by him but the driver said the man had but a little way to go i waited to see wondering how he could know presently the man did turn down another road i asked how did you know he would  because i knew the man and where he lived  i asked him satirically if he knew everybody in the island he answered very simply that he did this gives a bodys mind a good substantial grip on the dimensions of the place  at the principal hotel at st georges a young girl with a sweet serious face said we could not be furnished with dinner because we had not been expected and no preparation had been made yet it was still an hour before dinnertime we argued she yielded not we supplicated she was serene the hotel had not been expecting an inundation of two people and so it seemed that we should have to go home dinnerless i said we were not very hungry a fish would do my little maid answered it was not the marketday for fish things began to look serious but presently the boarder who sustained the hotel came in and when the case was laid before him he was cheerfully willing to divide so we had much pleasant chat at table about st georges chief industry the repairing of damaged ships and in between we had a soup that had something in it that seemed to taste like the hereafter but it proved to be only pepper of a particularly vivacious kind and we had an ironclad chicken that was deliciously cooked but not in the right way baking was not the thing to convince this sort he ought to have been put through a quartzmill until the tuck was taken out of him and then boiled till we came again we got a good deal of sport out of him but not enough sustenance to leave the victory on our side no matter we had potatoes and a pie and a sociable good time then a ramble through the town which is a quaint one with interesting crooked streets and narrow crooked lanes with here and there a grain of dust here as in hamilton the dwellings had venetian blinds of a very sensible pattern they were not double shutters hinged at the sides but a single broad shutter hinged at the top you push it outward from the bottom and fasten it at any angle required by the sun or desired by yourself  all about the island one sees great white scars on the hillslopes these are dished spaces where the soil has been scraped off and the coral exposed and glazed with hard whitewash some of these are a quarteracre in size they catch and carry the rainfall to reservoirs for the wells are few and poor and there are no natural springs and no brooks  they say that the bermuda climate is mild and equable with never any snow or ice and that one may be very comfortable in spring clothing the year round there we had delightful and decided summer weather in may with a flaming sun that permitted the thinnest of raiment and yet there was a constant breeze consequently we were never discomforted by heat at four or five in the afternoon the mercury began to go down and then it became necessary to change to thick garments i went to st georges in the morning clothed in the thinnest of linen and reached home at five in the afternoon with two overcoats on the nights are said to be always cool and bracing we had mosquitonets and the reverend said the mosquitoes persecuted him a good deal i often heard him slapping and banging at these imaginary creatures with as much zeal as if they had been real there are no mosquitoes in the bermudas in may  the poet thomas moore spent several months in bermuda more than seventy years ago he was sent out to be registrar of the admiralty i am not quite clear as to the function of a registrar of the admiralty of bermuda but i think it is his duty to keep a record of all the admirals born there i will inquire into this there was not much doing in admirals and moore got tired and went away a reverently preserved souvenir of him is still one of the treasures of the islands i gathered the idea vaguely that it was a jug but was persistently thwarted in the twentytwo efforts i made to visit it however it was no matter for i found out afterward that it was only a chair  there are several sights in the bermudas of course but they are easily avoided this is a great advantageone cannot have it in europe bermuda is the right country for a jaded man to loaf in there are no harassments the deep peace and quiet of the country sink into ones body and bones and give his conscience a rest and chloroform the legion of invisible small devils that are always trying to whitewash his hair a good many americans go there about the first of march and remain until the early spring weeks have finished their villainies at home  the bermudians are hoping soon to have telegraphic communication with the world but even after they shall have acquired this curse it will still be a good country to go to for a vacation for there are charming little islets scattered about the inclosed sea where one could live secure from interruption the telegraphboy would have to come in a boat and one could easily kill him while he was making his landing  we had spent four days in bermudathree bright ones out of doors and one rainy one in the house we being disappointed about getting a yacht for a sail and now our furlough was ended and we entered into the ship again and sailed homeward  we made the run home to new york quarantine in three days and five hours and could have gone right along up to the city if we had had a health permit but health permits are not granted after seven in the evening partly because a ship cannot be inspected and overhauled with exhaustive thoroughness except in daylight and partly because healthofficers are liable to catch cold if they expose themselves to the night air still you can buy a permit after hours for five dollars extra and the officer will do the inspecting next week our ship and passengers lay under expense and in humiliating captivity all night under the very nose of the little official reptile who is supposed to protect new york from pestilence by his vigilant inspections this imposing rigor gave everybody a solemn and awful idea of the beneficent watchfulness of our government and there were some who wondered if anything finer could be found in other countries  in the morning we were all atiptoe to witness the intricate ceremony of inspecting the ship but it was a disappointing thing the healthofficers tug ranged alongside for a moment our purser handed the lawful threedollar permit fee to the healthofficers bootblack who passed us a folded paper in a forked stick and away we went the entire inspection did not occupy thirteen seconds  the healthofficers place is worth a hundred thousand dollars a year to him his system of inspection is perfect and therefore cannot be improved on but it seems to me that his system of collecting his fees might be amended for a great ship to lie idle all night is a most costly loss of time for her passengers to have to do the same thing works to them the same damage with the addition of an amount of exasperation and bitterness of soul that the spectacle of that healthofficers ashes on a shovel could hardly sweeten now why would it not be better and simpler to let the ships pass in unmolested and the fees and permits be exchanged once a year by post
